The suspect, Ravi Singh, was caught by Delhi Police’s crime branch on Wednesday, three days after he hacked Vijay Sahil to death. According to Monika Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police (crime), Singh operated a vegetable cart in Subhash Place with which he supported his family. “But he was being forced to come to cough up a substantial portion of that earning to the local criminal, Vijay Sahil,” said the DCP. Sahil had nearly two dozen criminal cases against him, ranging from theft to murder across Delhi. He lived in the same neighbourhood as Singh. On Sunday evening, Sahil again visited Singh’s vegetable stall, allegedly to collect his daily extortion money.But Singh this time refused to pay, said the DCP. That led to a heated exchange between them, during which Sahil allegedly threatened Singh, who responded by using a knife to hack the alleged extortionist to death. While Singh fled the crime spot and went into hiding, Sahil’s body lay at the spot until next morning when it was discovered by his family. Initially, given the background of the dead man, the local police suspected it to be a case of enmity with another criminal. But the evidence at the spot soon indicated the alleged involvement of Singh. “On Wednesday, we received a tip-off about Singh’s location and we arrested him. We have handed him over to the local police,” said DCP Bhardwaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fed-up-of-paying-extortion-vegetable-vendor-kills-man-in-subhash-place-101610647892834.html

They should then identify subject specialists and high performing teachers and welcome them into the system,” he said.Crehan, who has studied the education model of five countries, said, “In Japan, China, Singapore, the practice of ‘lesson study’ is common. The teachers come together and produce lesson plans on how to teach a certain concept.” Fletcher, a history teacher in England, said teachers must spend time together “to work on their ideas outside of classrooms to refine their teaching plans.”Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, said, “Ideas like focusing on quality teacher training, developing good infrastructure and offering a conducive work environment for teachers are important for our government. If we work together, we can implement all these ideas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/on-day-3-of-education-conference-experts-suggest-ways-to-improve-teaching-101610647891978.html

In a statement issued on Thursday, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia’s office said the SCERT will focus on improving teacher training in Delhi government schools. “We have to prepare teachers who can inculcate an inquisitive habit in our children and empower them to ask questions in classrooms. Children should have the courage to demand truth and fill in the gaps of what they’ve learned so far. Only teachers can transform our society. It is then important to instil the right spirit in our teachers, and we can only achieve that through teacher training,” the statement said.Addressing the programme organised on the occasion of the announcement on Thursday, Sisodia said the Delhi government has also done a lot of work on teacher training over the past few years. “We have increased the posts and salaries in SCERT to instil a sense of respect for the talent that comes into the system. They’ve been given the UGC-scale salaries. Delhi is the only state which has increased the pay scale in SCERT and DIET to bring it on par with NCERT,” he said.The Government of Delhi has increased the number of academic faculty posts in SCERT and DIET from 240 to over 700. “This will make it possible for these institutions to fulfil their objectives and also perform better,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-restructures-scert-diet-for-better-teacher-training-opportunities-101610647831927.html

It also said the vaccination programme was due to be rolled out from next week and “large-scale arrangements were being made to ensure a full roll-out of the vaccination process”.The court noted that all parties in the matter have participated in a non-adversarial manner and orders passed have been “received and acted upon by the authorities in the spirit in which they were intended”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-implement-steps-to-ensure-proper-post-covid-care-govt-tells-hc-101610647772473.html

After that, the wind direction will change from north-westerly to easterly. Simply put, at present Delhi is receiving icy cold winds from the snow-clad states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh but after January 18, winds will start coming in from the landlocked states and there will be some respite,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s regional weather forecasting centre. The minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for Delhi’s weather, was 2°C. The maximum was 19.2°C, a degree below what is considered to be normal for this time of the year. At the Palam and Lodhi Road weather stations, the minimum temperatures were 4.9°C and 2.4°C respectively. This is the second time this season that Delhi residents are experiencing a sharp drop in temperatures. The last cold spell occurred around the end of 2020 when the minimum temperature on New Year’s Day dropped to 1.1°C – the lowest recorded in 14 years.IMD scientists said the minimum temperature is likely to rise, but only marginally, on Friday. It will fall again from Saturday.The fall in temperatures has also coincided with a slowing of wind speeds, trapping pollutants in the air. The AQI shot up to 429 from 354 on Wednesday. This is the third time in the last fortnight that the AQI in Delhi had crossed the severe threshold. Similar to the last very cold spell, the last time pollution was this high was on January 1, when the AQI was 441. It stayed almost at the same level (rising by a notch) on January 2 – both these days had similar weather conditions: low temperatures and calm winds. “The average wind speed on Thursday was less than 6kmph. This, along with the moisture content in the air, is not letting pollutants to disperse properly. Similar conditions will prevail till January 18,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), warned that the coming week could be the “first extended extreme air pollution event for 2021”. “The AQI is forecasted to deteriorate rapidly in the next three days. The combination of dense fog formation leading to secondary particulate formation under congenial conditions of high humidity, extremely low ventilation and shallow boundary layer height is a major reason for the predicted smog episode in the coming days,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cold-wave-to-continue-delhi-air-quality-to-get-worse-warn-monitoring-agencies-101610647231911.html

Each centre will get 2,000 doses, said officials.According to state health officials, these doses of Covaxin will be given on the first day (January 16) in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Amravati and Satara. There will however be dedicated vaccination centres like one in Aundh in Pune where Covaxin shots will be given to healthcare staff.“As per the information shared by the government of India, doses have been sent to District Hospital Pune, Government Medical College Solapur, Government Medical College Aurangabad, Government Medical College Nagpur, Grant Medical College and JJ Hospital Mumbai and District Hospital Amaravati,” said Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer.He further added that more details will be shared by the Centre tomorrow (Friday).Serum Institute of India’s (SII’s) Covishield, along with Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, were approved for restricted emergency use by the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) on January 3.The vaccine dose to each health care worker has to be given in two rounds within 28 days.According to Patil, the state has received 9.83 lakh doses in total out of which 9.63 lakh doses are of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin.“Compared to 9.83 lakh doses, there are around 7.86 lakh healthcare staff from government, private and Armed Forces medical facilities registered for the inoculation though so far no one has come forward saying that he or she does not want to take the jab amid apprehensions by few about efficacy, “said Patil.Due to short supply of vials to Maharashtra, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday complained about the fewer vials, saying that with the given stock, only 500,000 health workers will be inoculated, down from the earlier target of 800,000.“The first people who will be given priority will be health care workers. And the consent for the same is compulsory from the healthcare professionals,” added Patil.The Centre has already made it clear that registered healthcare workers will not have any choice between two vaccines.“To take the vaccine is optional but beneficiaries will have no option to choose between two vaccines. Whichever vaccine is available at the centre, will be administered,” said Patil.He added that the vaccination is planned at 285 places in the state on the first day and by Friday, the far off locations will also get their consignments of Covishield vaccine.The state health department has also established a mechanism to deal with the situation if there is any adverse reaction during vaccination.

Initially, a few medicines like Hydroxychloroquine were administered to patients which later proved to be more harmful. It is similar to the vaccine also. There is no safety proven for these vaccines,” he said.“In the United States and Europe, patients are strictly observed after the vaccine is administered, but in India, there is no such provision,” said Sathaye.He further added that there is no pathogen challenge. “There should be a follow-up after the vaccination to make sure that those who are administered with it are safe,” he said.Sharing similar views, Dr Nitin Bhagali, a city-based orthopaedic doctor said that he is confused whether he should take the vaccine or not.“I am confused if I should take the vaccine myself as this is the record time ever that any vaccine is introduced for a new viral disease. There is definite apprehension if adequate trials have been properly conducted and safety issues are ensured. Disasters following a number of vaccinations for different diseases are on record in various parts of the world in the recent past,” he said.He added that reports of narcolepsy that is excessive sleep after swine flu vaccination, severe reactions after HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination in Japan and antibody-dependent disease enhancement after dengue vaccine in the Philippines are some examples of grievous nature.“I am in a dilemma if I should trust my own immunity or vaccine as there is a high chance of being already exposed to the virus as I have been practising even during the lockdown and my branch has the highest risk because of aerosol generation,” he said.However, other experts differ in opinion. Speaking during an online discussion about the vaccine, Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former head scientist of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said that vaccines are a good way to secure a vulnerable population.“In a country like Israel, where the population is less. The government has managed to give vaccination to around 22 per cent of the total population. India has to make similar efforts. We can do that with the government and people’s acceptance. We have to vaccinate vulnerable population. This will help in the reduction in mortality and transmission. There is the issue of side effects, but they can be effectively managed by regular follow-ups of the patient,” he said.Dr Amit Shah, Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) immunisation officer, said that the vaccination will start from January 16 for healthcare staff and later frontline workers like the police force among others.“Vaccines will be administered at eight sites across the city and around 800 people will receive the vaccination on day 1. In the first week, we will reach 24,000 people,” said Dr Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/few-city-doctors-unwilling-to-take-covid-vaccine-experts-say-it-s-the-only-way-forward-101610645671796.html

A second round of tests is being done so that we can be completely sure. Until then, we are monitoring all wetland areas for any excess or unusual bird deaths. So far, we have found none.”Dr Punita Gahlot, deputy director with the district animal husbandry department, declined to comment without reviewing the final lab reports. Dr Mohinder Pal Singh, joint director at the RDDL in Jalandhar, could not be reached on Thursday despite multiple attempts.The district animal husbandry department on Thursday also convened a meeting of various line departments, whose involvement will be required in case a containment operation needs to be launched at poultry farms.A senior veterinarian with the department, who was present at the meeting, said, “We have gone over the standard action plan to be followed in case there is an unusual mortality among poultry. No specific tasks have yet been assigned. But everyone from the police to the health department has been apprised of their role and told to be prepared.”However, a containment operation will only be required if poultry is affected, the official pointed out, adding that there is no evidence yet to suggest this. They pointed to the reopening of poultry markets in Delhi’s Ghazipur area, where the sale and transport of poultry had been restricted after wild bird samples from Delhi tested positive for avian influenza. However, after 100 poultry samples from Ghazipur tested negative on Thursday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal removed these restrictions, allowing the sale and transport of poultry to resume.In case the wild bird samples test positive, the animal husbandry department will send 39 chicken samples from an area where poultry density is the highest. “The state will decide the next steps based on those results,” said the senior veterinarian cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bird-samples-suspected-positive-for-avian-flu-sent-for-further-testing-101610644771684.html

Another consignment of 11,400 doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine also arrived late night, confirmed district health department officials.Of the total supply, 44,950 Covishield doses and at least 4,200 doses from the Covaxin stock have been allocated for Gurugram. The district has received the maximum doses of the 22 districts in the state due to the highest number of Covid-19 cases being reported from the district.The remaining stock of Covishield at the Pataudi storage unit has been allocated for nearby districts of Nuh (7,120 doses), Faridabad (21,770 doses), Palwal (5,090 doses) and Rewari (5,700 doses). In case of Covaxin, at least 3,000 doses will be given to Palwal and 4,200 to Faridabad.Around 1pm on Thursday, the consignment of the Covishield vaccine arrived from the state vaccine store of Kurukshetra in a vaccine van. On entering Pataudi, two police vans escorted the vaccine van to ensure the secure delivery of the vaccine to the regional vaccine storage at the Pataudi Civil Hospital.According to Pawan Kumar, the driver of the vaccine van, the consignment was collected from the state storage facility in Kurukshetra around 3.30am on Thursday. Cold boxes, in which vaccines were kept, were loaded onto the van and they left for Gurugram at 8:30am. On arrival, at least nine cold boxes were shifted straight to the walk-in room of the cold storage unit at the Pataudi hospital, he said.A technician at the site said that each cold box contains 12,000 doses of the vaccine. From the cold box, they were shifted to the ice-lined refrigerator, to store them at the optimal temperature of 5 degrees Celsius. The technician, requesting anonymity, said the stock allocated for neighbouring districts was collected by the respective health teams in the evening and the stock for Gurugram left at the storage facility.On the day of vaccination, the vaccines will be distributed to cold chain points and further to six session sites in the city through vaccine carriers, which will have ice packs conditioned at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.“Gurugram is the first district in the state to collect the vaccine from the state store. Vigilance has been increased to protect against any sort of pilferage or theft,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. He said that the storage facility has a 24-hour power backup.Officials said that continuous temperature monitoring will be done at the cold storage unit as there cannot be temperature excursion beyond 30 minutes. Any temperature fluctuation would affect the efficacy of the vaccine. The storage temperature has to be recorded twice a day through the Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN).For security purposes, four police personnel have been deployed at the site.Karan Singh, the superintendent of police, Pataudi, said, “Our teams will be deployed 24x7 until we receive further orders from the police department. The teams will work in two shifts to prevent any unregulated movement.”Yadav said that the distribution of Covaxin and Covishield to the vaccine sites will have to be decided. “Persons who will get the first vaccine jab at each of the six sites are yet to be confirmed.” He said that the district can finalise the list once the access of the Co-WIN platform is given to the district by the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccine-doses-arrive-at-pataudi-store-101610644714714.html

The kingpin of the gang has been arrested and two SUVs worth ₹70 lakh recovered from his possession.The police said the suspect, identified as Kikheto Achuri of Dimapur in Nagaland, used to replace the chassis and engine numbers of stolen cars and sell them in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Mizoram and Haryana. His two close aides were arrested last December from Sector 29 while they were allegedly trying to steal an SUV. The police said Achuri confessed to having stolen more than 200 SUVs from Gurugram, Faridabad, Rohtak, Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida in the last two years. The police said that the gang used to take less than three minutes to steal a car and they used to steal at least two vehicles a day. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they have recovered four high-security number plates of the Arunachal Pradesh authority. “We have recovered a hi-tech gadget that can hack into security systems of cars with advanced lock mechanisms. They unlocked cars by using the device to hack the vehicles’ engine control module. The thieves use the device to break into cars by unlocking it without breaking windows,” he said. The gang bought the gadget for ₹2 lakh, said Sangwan, adding that they targeted posh areas of the city and sold each SUV for ₹5 lakh.Sangwan said the gang used to meet second-hand car dealers in different cities and offer them good margins to sell these cars. “The stolen vehicles were sold with new identities along with original looking documents in Gurugram, Faridabad, Rohtak, Hisar, Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Rajasthan,” he said. The police said that all gang members are repeat offenders. The police said the suspects were wanted by Meghalaya, Kolkata, Haryana and Manipur police for the last one year. “We are questioning the suspect to know all details of people involved in sale and purchase of these stolen vehicles,” said KK Rao, the commissioner of police. Rao said the suspects used to steal cars from Delhi-NCR and travel to other places. They had all documents handy due to which they went under the radar and were allowed to cross interstate borders.The police said the suspects used to do the rounds of the city to identify their targets in the day and steal vehicles using a master key in the night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/interstate-car-thief-arrested-stole-over-200-suvs-police-101610644713660.html

Officials and experts attributed the surge in pollution to low wind speeds, lack of sunlight and colder temperatures that began setting in earlier this week.The minimum temperature in Gurugram rose marginally to settle at 4.9 degrees Celsius on Thursday morning, up from 4.6 degrees Celsius a day prior. The maximum temperature increased significantly, touching 18.2 degrees Celsius, up from 15.2 degrees Celsius a day prior.The weather readings are according to the data from the India Meteorological Department’s automatic weather station in Delhi’s Palam area, which borders the city. Gurugram’s weather system has not been recording the temperature readings for several days now.Experts pointed out that the increase in temperature hasn’t been able to stave off a deterioration in air quality, due to the lack of clear skies and wind speeds. “Conditions, right now, are extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants. This is not surprising since we have witnessed a western disturbance earlier this month. After the passage of a weather system, there is a stagnation period where winds slow down and the temperature falls, allowing dust to accumulate and remain suspended very close to the earth. There was some change in daytime temperature today, but not enough to get the winds moving again,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist.While two of the city’s four air quality monitors — at Teri Gram and in Sector 51 — did not record sufficient data to compute the AQI on Thursday, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11 recorded an AQI of 410 (indicating severe air), while another monitor on the Gurugram-Faridabad Road recorded an AQI of 354 (indicating very poor air). The average daily concentration of finer particulate matter (PM2.5) at Vikas Sadan stood at 410ug/m3, up from 331ug/m3 on Wednesday and almost seven times the permissible limit of 60ug/m3.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “The air quality is likely to deteriorate and crossover from the upper end of very poor to the severe category on 15.01.2021. The air quality is likely to remain in the severe category on 16.01.2021. A slight improvement is expected on 17.01.2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-deteriorates-experts-point-to-low-temperatures-slow-winds-101610644712608.html
14-01-2021||Gurugram||Mewat farmers start sit-in near Punhana||Farmers from Mewat on Thursday started a sit-in protest at Sunhera-Jurehra, near Punhana at the Rajasthan-Haryana border. The farmers decided to start the protest after they were prevented from proceeding towards Delhi. Around 300 people are currently participating in the sit-in that has received support from farmer leaders at other protest sites in the region, protesters said.This is the third such sit-in protest taking place in the region. Farmers from different states have been camping at Jaisinghpur Khera, at the Rajasthan-Haryana border, for over a month now, while another set of farmers are camping at Dharuhera in Rewari. “Today is the third day of our protest. Farmers from Haryana and Rajasthan came together on Tuesday and we decided to walk towards Delhi to join the farmers’ movement. The Haryana police didn’t allow us to proceed ahead so we started a sit-in protest,” said Maulana Arshad Meel, a native of Bharatpur in Rajasthan, who is spearheading the protest. Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new agriculture laws that were passed in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Meel said that the laws are against the interest of farmers and would adversely affect the region, since a major chunk of the region’s population is dependent on farming for sustenance. He said that the Haryana-Rajasthan Mewati Kisan Andalon (movement) will continue till the three laws are repealed. “The majority of the people in Mewat are into farming. While some have land holdings, others work as labourers in the fields. These laws could disfranchise farmers of their land and make them vulnerable to exploitation,” said Meel. He said that farmers from Nuh, Palwal, Alwar and Faridabad had extended support to their agitation. “We will continue to support the farmers’ agitation till the three laws are repealed. Regardless of harsh weather conditions or pressure from the police, we will persist with our protest,” said Meel. Siddique Ahmed Meo, a social activist from Nuh, said that the protest had been initiated by farmers in Rajasthan and Haryana. He said that outreach efforts are being carried out in villages to increase awareness about the new farm laws and their consequences. “We are making efforts to make farmers aware of the dangers posed by these laws. A sense of awakening and understanding of the laws is developing gradually,” said Meo. He said that around 85% of the population in Nuh was associated with farming. “Some people have smaller landholdings, while some have bigger landholdings. However, bigger landowners such as the ones in Punjab or other parts of Haryana are not found here,” said Meo. Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Jawahar Yadav said that farmers should go home and understand that the implementation of the three laws had been stayed by the Supreme Court. “Currently, the laws have been stayed. Farmers should go home and reflect on the various aspects of the laws till the committee formed does its job,” said Yadav, maintaining that the laws were in the interest of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mewat-farmers-start-sit-in-near-punhana-101610644713253.html

Each facility will have at least two vaccinators to administer the vaccine jab, according to the medical officers of the hospitals.Out of the six sites — Medanta Hospital in Sector 39 and SGT Medical College in Chandu Budhera — are the only private facilities, while the remaining sessions sites are at government primary schools in Wazirabad and Daulatabad, Chauma urban primary health centre and Bhangrola primary health centre.Medanta Hospital, which has almost 6,800 healthcare workers, will set up two vaccination counters, with each handling 50 persons. “A mock drill was conducted in the hospital on Wednesday. About 25 vaccinators from our facility have already been trained. They can be either on stand-by in case there is a vaccinator from the health department or else they would administer the vaccine,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, who looks after clinical and operational management for Medanta. She said at least 25 data entry operators from the hospital were trained by the district administration last week. “They will be doing the verification and data entry on the Co-WIN platform. Overall, at least 10 people from our facility will be stationed on the first floor of the hospital, where the vaccination will be conducted.”Likewise, the staff of SGT hospital will have their own data entry operators. Dr Umesh Lamba, deputy medical superintendent, SGT Hospital, said, “At least 14 people were trained last week to handle Co-WIN platform. As per the plan, there will be two vaccinators at the site, one from the government set-up and an other from our facility. It will be decided later who would do the inoculation.”Both the hospitals have included nurses, housekeeping staff, lab technicians and doctors as vaccine beneficiaries. Kataria said, “Of the 100 people, health workers who had duty at Covid-19 wards are first on the list. Others, like housekeeping staff and doctors, are also included.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/private-hospitals-serving-as-session-sites-ready-for-covid-19-inoculations-101610644711774.html

PMC building permission department expects to collect an additional Rs100 crore till March end,” said an official from the building permission department requesting anonymity.PMC city engineer Prashant Waghmare said, “We received very few proposals for building permission this year because of the Covid situation. The lockdown imposed in March last year put a stop on construction activity and many labourers left for their hometown. Developers were planning to submit proposals after seeing a rise in demand for flats, but the former have decided to present fresh new proposals after the state government published notification for unified development control rules (DCR).” The new DCR notification permits plot holders below 1,500 square feet to erect the construction without submitting the plan to local bodies.“As developers are revising building plans as per the new unified DCR rules, we expect many proposals in the next few months and PMC may collect record revenue from building permission,” Waghmare said.During September to December 2020, over 12 lakh propoerties got registered in the state. Omprakash Deshmukh IGR said, “After the announcing the discount in stamp duty by three percentage, property registration increased substantially. It shows that buying and selling sentiments has increased in the realty sector.”Credai India’s national president Satish Magar said, “People brought flats taking advantage of stamp duty discount and the real estate sector got a boost after lockdown.”A builder on condition of anonymity said, “Many builders who had ready-to-move flats sold it post stamp duty discount. As developers are focussing on selling their existing projects than launching new ones, they are not seeking building permission from authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-earns-less-revenue-from-building-permission-101610637691090.html

An estimated 78 farmers have so far lost their lives.Stressing the need for an early resolution to the agitation to prevent further loss of life, the cabinet said the matter has already been debated and discussed in eight rounds of negotiations held between the protesting farmers and the Union government.Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar was also present in the meeting.The cabinet noted that the Centre should not stand on “prestige and ego” in the matter, which, if unresolved, could lead to “devastating repercussions” for the country for decades to come.“If the Centre can make sweeping amendments to the laws, then this adamancy about not revoking the legislations is inexplicable,” it said.The council of ministers also mentioned the Supreme Court's acknowledgement of the concerns of the protesting farmers.The apex court had on Monday rapped the Centre over the prolonged impasse with the protesting farmers demanding the repeal of the three new farm laws, saying it was “extremely disappointed” with the negotiation process.In a formal resolution, the Punjab cabinet reiterated its commitment to the resolutions passed by the Punjab Vidhan Sabha on August 28 and October 20 last year, stressing that all the genuine demands of the farmers must be accepted.It urged the Centre to “repeal the farm laws as agriculture is a state subject under the Constitution of India, and to make MSP a statutory right”.The state cabinet also welcomed the Supreme Court order staying the central legislations as “acknowledgement” of the concerns of the farmers of Punjab who are protesting against the farm laws, and “recognition” of their pain and anguish. “There is need for broad-based dialogue and proper consultation with all stakeholders as these legislations impact the future of millions of farmers across the country, and all genuine demands of the farmers must be accepted,” said the resolution.The cabinet also appreciated the peaceful protest by the farmers, which has also been taken note of by the Supreme Court, in keeping with the best of the democratic practices. The cabinet meeting was convened by CM Singh with the sole agenda of discussing the issue in the light of the apex court orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nothing-short-of-repeal-of-farm-laws-will-resolve-crisis-punjab-cabinet-101610636832207.html

Sisodia alleged that the BJP has left the MCD bankrupt.“North and East municipal corporations are bankrupt, they have ₹12 crores & ₹99 lakh in their bank accounts respectively. They have a loan amount of ₹6,276 crores to be paid to the Delhi govt. BJP has left the MCDs bankrupt,” Sisodia was quoted as saying by ANI.Sisodia also said that even BJP leaders have accepted that MCD is facing issues due to corruption. “In 14 years of corrupt rule, BJP has sucked the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) dry. The municipal corporations are not in a state to pay the salaries of their employees. Even BJP leaders have agreed that corruption is at its peak in MCD,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said.MCD workers also announced that they will not resume their duties if they do not receive their salaries.

Good Luck Café at Fergusson College road, known for its popular butter chicken delicacy, has noticed a dip in orders. “The demand for chicken and egg-based dishes has gone down since last week. The sale of food items made of mutton has increased and many are ordering it in place of chicken,” said Abbas Ali, manager, Good Luck Café. “The major impact of bird flu has been noticed in sale of backyard poultry birds.

Rajendra Raut, superintendent engineer, Building permission and construction department, said, “We have demolished more than 100 structures in the 11 merged villages so far and more than 1 lakh squre feet of area of construction. In the 23 villages, after PMRDA hands over the record of building permission, we will be able to decide the course of action on unauthorised constructions.”“At present, we have floated a tender to demolish unauthorised construction within PMC limits, ‘’ he said.Suhas Divase, chief executive officer of the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), said, “During the corona pandemic the authority didn’t take any action or service notices to unauthorised constructions. Now, we will initiate action.”Last month, the State government issued a notification and appealed to citizens to register suggestions and objections on the merger of villages. The last date of submission of suggestions and objections is January 24, 2021. After that, state government will issue a final order to merge the 23 villages in the PMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-survey-unauthorised-constructions-in-23-villages-merged-101610630250113.html

Now ranked world no. 2, Kapur says he has shred them to be a contrast version of himself from two years ago. In the Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings released on Tuesday, Kapur secured the world no. 2 ranking in the under-19 boys’ single category.For Kapur, it is his best achievement so far. “One of the main things on which I was improving on was my speed on the court. I guess three things – speed, patience, and strength. I am not very strong, I am agile so I have to focus lot on my strength training so I have been training with the fitness coach Kaifi Afzal and mental fitness coach Gayatri Vartak,” Kapur said. In the year 2020, Kapur stayed inside the top five rankings during most of months, only in December, he was dropped to six as he was not able to play many tournaments due to the pandemic. A trainee from Nikhil Kanetkar Badminton Academy (NKBA) at the Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex in Balewadi, Kapur has improved by leaps and bounds in the last six years since he started training in Pune. A prodigy of Nikhil Kanetkar and Mayank Gole, Kapur kept improving year by year and now he aims to transfer the same performance in the senior level tournament. “The main thing while switching from junior to senior will be motivation. Keeping yourself motivated is tough since you might not get results straight away. It’s all about having belief and self-confidence which is required the most,” added Kapur who will be turning 18 in March this year. Even though 2020 was marred by the Covid-19 pandemic globally, Kapur managed to play three tournaments. He played the first two in February – Hungarian International Junior Championship where he finished a runner up then in the same month, Kapur played the Dutch Junior International where he could not make it to final and then the Portuguese International Junior where he emerged champion. “I went to Denmark at the start of October and that was the reason I was allowed to travel to Portugal for the tournament because I was already in Europe. After a long time I was playing the tournament (after February 2020) so in the first round I was very nervous but after a few points you get used to it,” Kapur said. Exposure to playing tournaments overseas is helping Kapur develop his game and build a unique style of his own. “It makes you deal with different situations because the game style is different abroad. You have to adopt the game style and it helps you improve your game,” added Kapur who is sponsored by Kanetkar Sports Foundation (KSF), Li-Ning and the Virat Kohli Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-badminton-star-varun-kapur-ranked-world-no-2-in-u-19-singles-101610621427409.html

The project was announced in 2017 to ease the traffic problem of Paud road, Senapati Bapat road and Shivajinagar.Almost a year ago, the PMC had given a tender to CV Kand consultant Pvt limited to conduct and submit a feasibility report, topographical survey and an aerial survey. However, it was not completed by the consultant.Now, the PMC project department has blacklisted the consultant and have begun retendering. Last week, the corporation floated a tender to appoint project management consultants for pre- and post-tender activities for the construction of the tunnel connecting Pashan-Panchavati to Kothrud.The Pashan-Panchavati area with the Kothrud tunnel project is a long pending one. The project was introduced in 2017 in the PMC annual budget and the PMC administration had appointed a consultant in 2019 for the project. The total estimated cost was ₹224 crore.The project consists of two tunnels, Kothrud-Panchvati and Panchvati-Gokhalenagar which will connect each other. It will help reduce the distance of Pashan to Kothrud by half.Indrabhan Randive, executive engineer of the project department said, “Last week, the corporation floated a tender to appoint consultant for the Pashan-Panchavati to Kothrud tunnel work. The previous consultant could not submit a feasibility report to the civic body for more than a year. The previous consultant only conducted a topographical survey. Therefore, we floated a new tender for feasibility report work.”In September 2020, deputy chief Minister Ajit Pawar had instructed all government institutes from where the tunnel is going to pass to cooperate with the PMC. After that, state forest department, Automotive Research Association of India Research Institute (ARAI), the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) and the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) gave a no-objection certificate to the PMC to conduct geological surveys on their premises.The PMC proposed two tunnels under the development plan for the old city limits. The common endpoint of both these tunnels opens at Panchavati society where there is a hilly area behind the residential complexes. According to the plan, the vehicles coming from both Gokhalenagar and Kothrud will come out of the tunnel at Panchavati and through the society; these vehicles will head towards Pashan, Balewadi and Aundh area.On the other side, residents of Panchavati had registered opposition to the proposal saying that the proposed plan will not only fail in addressing traffic problems, but it will also destroy the rich biodiversity in the area.The residents of Panchavati, Pashan area claimed that the proposed tunnels are 100 feet wide, but the roads in Panchavati are only 40 feet wide, so they will not be able to take the volume of the traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tunnel-project-pmc-appointed-consultant-blacklisted-for-delaying-feasibility-report-101610620648257.html

He was one of the four members and the only farmer leader to be appointed by the apex court to resolve the nearly two-month-long farmers’ agitation on Delhi’s borders. Earlier the BKU tweeted, “Bhupinder Singh Mann, ex-MP and national president of BKU and chairman of the All India Kisan Coordination Committee has recused himself from the four-member committee constituted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.” It was followed by a statement attributed to Mann that read: “I am thankful to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India for nominating me in the four-member committee to start dialogue with kisan unions on the three laws brought in by the central government. As a farmer myself and a union leader, in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions among the farm unions and the public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as to not compromise the interests of Punjab and farmers of the country.” Mann’s son Gurpartap Singh Mann, who is a Punjab Public Service Commission member, confirmed that his father had written the letter but declined further comment.The other members of the court-appointed committee are economists Ashok Gulati, Dr Pramod Kumar Joshi and farmer leader Anil Ghanwat.

Only the bicycle remains pure in heart,” says a fictional character in a novel by Iris Murdoch, set in 1916.This sentiment has come full circle in a century.The cycle elegantly combines individual mobility, health, economy and cool lifestyle with care for the city and the planet.Cycling has been an important commute/travel mode in Pune. Old timers recall the sound of bells as factory workers cycled down the old Bombay-Poona road. Hundreds of cycles were available for rent from cycle shops in the core city, near Swargate, and Khadki and Pune railway stations. As recently as about 10 years ago, about 9 per cent of work trips were by cycle.Given the importance of cycles for transport, the 1987 development plan had included cycle routes. Unfortunately, these were not implemented. Over time, conditions for cycling have deteriorated greatly, while motorised traffic increased manifold.Sujit Patwardhan, Founder Trustee of the NGO Parisar, recalls cycling as a child with his cousins and friends from Prabhat Road to Vitthalwadi, Chatushringi and Pune Railway Station.. “Parents did not worry about road safety if children were out cycling,” says Sujit.Pune is no longer a city where children can enjoy carefree cycling.The last few months of lockdown saw some resurgence in cycling. Now, it’s almost business as usual with air pollution, fast moving traffic and unsafe road conditions – a danger to existing cyclists and a big barrier for many who wish to start (or restart) cycling.What can be done?The Comprehensive Bicycle Master Plan, prepared through a highly participatory process involving both cyclists and non-cyclists, approved by the city in 2017 must be implemented on priority. The plan has provisions and design guidelines for building safe, convenient and comfortable bicycle tracks as a city-wide network.It recognises that a few tracks here and there do not help people shift to cycling. Municipal authorities are expected to prepare a regulation plan with the Traffic Police to prevent motor-vehicles driving and parking on cycle tracks.An excellent, safe cycling network would be welcomed by students, women and elderly, who are more dependent on cycling as a flexible and affordable transport mode. As would non-cyclists – studies show that over fifty percent non-cyclists would like to cycle if safe facilities are created.App-based bicycle rental systems launched by various companies had placed nearly 8000 cycles for rent in Pune in 2018. Sadly, they pulled out in the absence of safe infrastructure. A new workable model to provide affordable rental cycles across the city needs to be developed.It is commendable that the municipal road department now has responsibilities allocated to implement the bicycle plan, and a non-motorised transport committee.This is in line with the cycle plan’s provisions to increase PMC’s institutional capacity to implement the plan. We hope this arrangement will work effectively in the coming months to develop the required high quality cycling infrastructure. Philanthropists and corporates can help.“We give good quality cycles as performance awards,” says Ulhas Joshi, who runs an engineering services company, and is an avid cyclist himself.Companies can set up cycling clubs, set up changing rooms for employees, gift cycles to employees, students, women workers, and adopt an area in discussion with the municipal corporation to develop cycling infrastructure.Individuals can help by asking corporators for cycle plan implementation. Those who drive can be respectful towards cyclists (and others too!).Of course, try leaving behind the motorbike or car and enjoy cycling, whenever possible.Let’s re-create Pune’s cycling culture!After all, fast cars, flyovers and wide roads for motor vehicles do not make cities great.Instead, excellent walking, cycling and public transport facilities help cities be safe, humane, inclusive, and truly modern.Sanskriti Menon is senior programme director, Centre for Environment Education.She writes on urban sustainability and participatory governance.

Amritsar recorded a minimum temperature of 6 degrees Celsius but that did not deter devotees from taking the Maghi isnaan (holy bath) early in the morning. “Today is the first day of the traditional Punjabi month of Maghi and I feel blessed to have started it by taking a dip in the sarovar,” said a devotee, requesting anonymity. Some enthusiastic devotees even stayed on the Golden Temple premises overnight to take the dip in the wee hours. Langars (community kitchens) were organised to mark the day. Though Maghi is celebrated with fervour in Muktsar district, many consider taking the holy dip in the Golden Temple sarovar as significant. In Muktsar, people gather on the occasion to commemorate the martyrdom of the 40 Sikhs (chalis mukte) who had once deserted the 10th Sikh master, Guru Gobind Singh, at Anandpur Sahib, but later rejoined and died while fighting the Mughal army in 1705.

14-01-2021||Lucknow||Gujarat IAS officer's voluntary retirement creates buzz over role in UP politics||Voluntary retirement of senior Gujarat cadre Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Arvind Kumar Sharma, considered a close aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has led to speculations if he will play a role in Uttar Pradesh politics as the state heads towards the 2022 Assembly elections.A 1988-batch IAS officer, Sharma hails from the Mau district in eastern UP. The central government accepted his voluntary retirement plea on Monday, when the BJP state unit was busy finalising names of candidates for the biennial election to 12 seats in the UP Legislative Council. The quick acceptance of his application for voluntary retirement has started a buzz in the BJP circles that Sharma may be sent to the Legislative Council.BJP state unit president Swatantra Dev Singh said Sharma will join the BJP on Thursday.Even while senior BJP leaders are maintaining a silence over Sharma’s candidature for the council, those privy to the developments on the issue said, he may be made the deputy chief minister in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet. Another view on his role suggests he may be given a key assignment at the Centre.A senior leader, who did not wish to be named, said Sharma was from the upper caste Bhumihar community, whereas, the party was working on a strategy to win the support of Dalits and other backward castes (OBCs) to retain power in the 2022 Assembly election.The BJP strategists wanted the elevation of a Dalit leader in the state cabinet to send a message before the elections, he said.Another leader said that Sharma held top positions in the Gujarat government when Narendra Modi was the state’s chief minister. Later, he moved to the Prime Minister’s Office after Modi became the Prime Minister in 2014. Before taking voluntary retirement, he was handling affairs in MSME (micro small and medium enterprises), a crucial department that was working on PM Modi’s plan for revival of the economy post Covid lockdown.Rather than state politics, Sharma may be given an important position in the central government, he said.A postgraduate in political science from Allahabad University, Sharma is a native of Kajha Khurd village in Muhammadabad Gohna tehsil in Mau district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/gujarat-ias-officer-s-voluntary-retirement-creates-buzz-over-role-in-up-politics-101610614480943.html

Of them, four cases were of seizures of more than 2 kg each, while 10 recoveries were of more than 1kg each.

Lallu had ordered the appointment of Tauquir Ali as the Bulandshahr city party unit chief on January 8 this year.“Kunwar Tauquir Ali was appointed as city Congress committee president in Bulandshahr on January 8, 2021. A video from reliable sources has come to the notice. After seeing the video, this does not seem to be a pardonable act. This appointment is hereby stayed with immediate effect,” said Lallu, in a letter dated January 12, sent to All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, AICC secretaries and other senior leaders.In the video, Ali is shown using abusive words against top Congress leadership. Questions are now being raised over the manner in which appointments are being made on various posts in the Congress in Uttar Pradesh.“This video is four to five years old and how can anybody verify the use of such obscene language? We have taken action after this video was brought to our notice,” Lallu said in an effort to contain the damage.Calls are now being made to review such appointments made in the state. “Those making appointments in the state have no experience of working in the Congress organization. This is why the party is appointing such leaders in top positions in various party units,” said a party office-bearer.The UPCC’s style of functioning has been questioned in the past too. Action has been taken against the party men who have raised questions over the manner in which the party has been functioning in the state.“I have worked exclusively for the Congress organization for six years. Those working with the organization have no experience. Those making appointments are only importing people from select left wing organisations. Those loyal to the Congress are being insulted during the tenure of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as UP incharge,” said former minister Satyadev Tripathi.Tripathi was expelled from the party organization recently for allegedly indulging in anti-party activities when he and a few others voiced disagreement with the state party unit leaders on various organizational issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/congress-revival-bid-gets-reality-check-with-video-of-leader-abusing-party-brass-101610599814366.html

14-01-2021||Bhopal||Congress leader’s remark on girls’ reproductive age backfires, BJP seeks apology||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders demanded an unconditional apology from senior Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh minister Sajjan Singh Verma, over his remark on women’s reproductive age, made while responding to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s recent suggestion that the minimum marriageable age of women should be raised to 21 years.During a press conference in Bhopal, the former minister said, “15 saal ke baad hi bachchi prajanan yogya ho jati hai. Ye kya bade doctor ho gaye hain? (A girl develops the capability of reproduction after she turns 15. Has he (Shivraj Singh Chouhan) become a bigger doctor?”The Congress leader’s remark drew a sharp reaction from the ruling party, the BJP.“This showed the mindset of Congress leaders about women in the society. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s statement was in reference to empowerment of women by giving them equal legal status that men have in the society, the Congress leader’s remark was about women’s reproductive age,” said state BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.Continuing his attack, Agrawal said it was unfortunate that Congress leaders continue to insult women but the Congress high command remains silent despite the fact that the party is headed by a woman in Sonia Gandhi.“It was during the by-polls in the state in November last year when the state Congress president called a woman candidate of the BJP an item.

A villager rushed to rescue her and attacked the boar with an axe. Though the boar was killed, the woman could not be saved.Saraswati Devi, 62, resident of Naini Dewal village in Bhaisiyachhana block of Almora district, was returning home from a nearby forest with her cattle on Wednesday evening. On the way to her home, a boar suddenly attacked her. Women, who were accompanying her, raised an alarm, but in vain.On seeing the woman being mauled by a boar, Ramnath Goswami, a labourer, rushed to the spot with an axe, in a bid to save the elderly woman and attacked the boar. While the boar succumbed to severe injuries, the woman could not be saved.Range officer of Almora Sanchita Verma rushed to the village. She took the bodies of the woman and the wild boar into possession. She said, the kin of the deceased woman would be provided with an ex-gratia relief of ₹ 3 lakh.She added that such incidents were not common. Post-mortem of the victim and the wild animal will be conducted on Thursday.Raghunath Singh Chauhan, vice-chairman of the Uttarakhand assembly, also arrived in the village after the incident.

14-01-2021||Delhi||Metro will get 50 e-buses for feeder service by April||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will get its first batch of 50 electric buses (e-buses) for the feeder service by April this year.The feeder service, which is crucial for last-mile connectivity, has been shut since last March, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, and DMRC is planning to restart the service soon.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “DMRC is in the process of procuring 100 e-buses to further strengthen its feeder bus services. About 50 are expected to arrive by March or April and the remaining will arrive within the year.”The air-conditioned e-buses will have a carrying capacity of 22 passengers and will be fitted with CCTV cameras, GPS tracking system and display boards , Dayal said.The e-buses will run on new routes in north and east Delhi. “The e-buses will operate on 10 designated routes--five in each cluster. Two agencies have already been finalised for the running of e-buses,” he said.DMRC currently has 174 feeder buses, which are operated by private concessionaires, on around 20 routes to provide last-mile connectivity in areas such as Dwarka, Azadpur, Badarpur.With the induction of 100 new buses, DMRC will have 274 feeder buses plying on around 30 routes. The DMRC is also in the process of resuming the feeder bus service by addressing the concerns of feeder service operators.The operators say their income has dropped after the Delhi government announced free rides to women on Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses last year -- women are now giving the feeder service a miss, they claimed. Therefore, while the Metro resumed operations on September 7, 2020, after the gradual easing of the nationwide lockdown, feeder service is yet to be restarted.The operators have now asked the DMRC to provide financial assistance to offset their losses. Prasanna Patwardhan, owner of Prasanna Purple mobility solutions, a feeder operator, said, “It is not financially viable for us to provide services. Due to free travel for women on DTC buses, our income has reduced by almost 50%, as women passengers prefer DTC buses over feeder buses. In the present scenario, it is not viable to run our services. We have asked DMRC to provide financial aid to help minimise losses.”Metro users want the DMRC to resume feeder services, especially in areas such as Dwarka and Vasant Kunj where there is a lack of adequate public transport options.Amit Aggarwal, a resident of Vasant Kunj and member of URJA (an association of RWAs in Delhi), said, “Feeder buses are an important mode of transport for Metro users. In our area, a lot of people use it to reach Metro stations and we need an affordable mode of public transport.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/metro-will-get-50-e-buses-for-feeder-service-by-april-101610581800057.html
14-01-2021||Delhi||A contactless Republic Day parade in store for students||From contactless formations to compulsory masks during performances, Covid-19 pandemic has changed how school students will take part in the Republic Day Parade this year. The number of schools sending their entries for participation are down too, from around 30 in previous years to nine this year. Of these, two have dropped out after registering for the event in September.As in previous years, three groups of students will perform at Rajpath this year — Delhi Tamil Education Association (DTEA) Senior Secondary schools, Mount Abu Public School and Vidya Bharti School from Rohini, and Government Girls Senior Secondary School B-2 Yamuna Vihar.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said they had to hold sessions with parents to convince them that all safety norms would be followed. The buses provided by schools to commute to rehearsals were sanitized and the schools ensured that only one child sat on a bench.“The rehearsals began in mid-November when Covid-19 was at its peak in the capital. We had to ensure no-contact formations in the choreography and all Covid norms were followed,” she said.Arora added that the song composed by the school, which included references to the new National Education Policy and technological development was particularly significant for the 72nd Republic Day. “It was a difficult year and now the vaccine is also on its way. The performance celebrates India’s advancement in all these sectors,” she said.Class 11 student Deepti Singh, who has performed in the 2017 and 2018 parades for the school, said the experience this year was “very different.”“Earlier, we could sit in groups and chat, but we had to maintain distance this time. Performing in masks is also a little difficult. But we enjoyed this as we were all sitting at home since March,” she said.Her mother Poonam Singh, 37, a homemaker, said, “She was bored at home and going to the rehearsals has made her happy. We allowed her because such opportunities do not come often and we saw that schools were following safety protocols. Students were not even sharing lunch, as a precaution.”Additional director education (physical education) Pushpa Ratnam said, “Earlier, we used to receive entries from around 30 schools who used to be shortlisted for the first round at the Chhatrasal Stadium. This time, we received entries from nine, of which two dropped out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-contactless-republic-day-parade-in-store-for-students-101610579968026.html
14-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi shivers as 2nd cold wave sets in, lows to stay around 3-4°C: IMD||Delhi residents shivered as a biting cold set over the city for the second time this season with the minimum temperature on Wednesday dropping to 3.2 degrees Celsius, even as dense fog and low wind speed pushed the air quality into the “very poor” zone.Cold wave conditions are expected to continue in Delhi-NCR for at least the next five days, according to scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while pollution levels are likely to further worsen and may even reach the “severe” zone in the coming days.This is the second time this season that the Delhi residents are experiencing a sharp drop in temperatures, with the previous cold spell occurring around the end of 2020 in which the minimum temperature on New Year’s Day dropped to 1.1°C – the lowest temperature recorded in the city in 14 years.On Wednesday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city, was 3.2°C, a deviation of four degrees from what is considered normal this time of the year. The maximum temperature during the day was 18.5°C, a notch below normal.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that on Thursday the minimum temperature is likely to stay around 3-4°C. On Friday, it will rise marginally, before falling again on Saturday.“There is intense snowfall being reported from states like Jammu Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and currently Delhi is receiving north-westerly winds from these snow-clad states. On Wednesday, there is also a forecast of dense fog, which will also impact the visibility in the early hours,” said Srivastava.On early Wednesday, dense fog conditions led to the visibility at Palam and Safdarjung observatories dropping to zero metres for a brief period. Even with the dense fog, officials at Delhi airport said there was no impact on flight operations.“Low visibility procedures were activated but no diversions or cancellations were reported due to fog,” the official said.The dense fog also led to the city’s air quality worsening. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 354, in the “very poor” zone, a deterioration from Tuesday’s 293, categorised as “poor”.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said the AQI in Delhi is likely to deteriorate further in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-shivers-as-2nd-cold-wave-sets-in-lows-to-stay-around-3-4-c-imd-101610579644416.html
14-01-2021||Delhi||Caution, relief as kids weigh return to school||The Delhi government’s decision to allow physical classes for schools students of classes 10 and 12 from January 18 received mixed reactions from principals, teachers, parents, and students, with safety still a matter of major concern for several stakeholders.The students’ return to campuses will be “completely optional for parents”, and attendance will not be mandatory, the government said in its announcement on Wednesday. Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia tweeted that students can be called only with the consent of their parents, and nobody will be forced to come.A senior official in the Delhi education department said the decision was taken in the backdrop of the CBSE announcing the schedule for its practical and board exams.“It’s too early to comment on when the government will reopen schools for other classes. Besides, it’s optional, and students will be called only if their parents allow,” the official said.Manju Sethi, principal of Bluebells School International in Kailash Colony, said the school will start calling students back in the first week of February after taking the parents’ consent.“We will call only a few students a day to conduct practicals. Our students have already done practicals online, but we would like to give them the real experience. Some parents also want the school to conduct pre-board exams in person to give students written practice,” she said.Several principals said the decision will be vital for students who need personal attention from teachers.“The decision was essential to give students hands-on practice for the forthcoming CBSE practical exams. Some students also need more help from teachers, so it’s going to be very useful for them. Students will be able to get detailed guidelines and supervision from teachers for projects and practical files,” said Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini.To ease the students’ return to campus, some schools have already started initiatives to provide mental health support for those who need it.Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said, “We have set up a counselling cell to provide emotional support to the students when they rejoin after a long gap. The school has also prepared a specific time table that will be sent to zonal district education officers for approval.”Several parents and students, though, said they are still apprehensive, and preferred to “avoid the risk.”Suman Sharma, a resident of Mayur Vihar and parent of a class 10 student, said, “Though the number of cases has gone down in Delhi over the last few days, it’s too early to send our children back to school. We still do not know how the schools will ensure the safety of our children. I won’t allow my son to go to school any time soon.”Darshan Ram, a class 12 student at Bluebells School International, said, “Considering that physical attendance is optional, I won’t take the risk right now. I would rather wait and see how the school has planned everything and then decide.”However, the response was decidedly different at government schools, where officials said their students would benefit significantly from the decision.Awadesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodaya Co-ed School in Rohini, said, “Students and parents have been keen on this for quite some time. Many could not keep up with online classes due to the lack of resources.”Parents of children in government schools said they will send their wards despite worries.Atul Kumar Yadav, a resident of Gandhi Nagar and father of a class 12 student at a government girls’ school, said, “My daughter has been anxious ever since dates for board exam were announced. Although she has a smartphone and internet connection, we could not afford to arrange home tuitions. Now, she can go back to her school and clear her doubts with teachers.”Experts said the risk of Covid-19 is low among children.Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicine department at Safdarjung hospital, said, “Studies show that the risk of Covid-19 is very low among children. Not reopening schools for a long period can adversely impact students’ mental and physical health. Parents need not worry. It’s just that schools should take all the precautions prescribed by the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/caution-relief-as-kids-weigh-return-to-school-101610579394160.html
14-01-2021||Delhi||City vaccine centres down to 75 from 89||The Covid-19 vaccination drive in Delhi will begin across 75 locations on Saturday, each with one vaccination site, a senior government official said on Wednesday.Initially, the central government had approved 5,000 vaccination locations across India, of which 89 were in Delhi. On Wednesday, the Centre reduced the number of locations for the inaugural day (Saturday) from 5,000 to 2,934, with which the number of centres in Delhi also reduced to 75, said a senior government official.“After the second dry run (January 8), the government felt the necessity to reduce the overall workload on the first day. Hence, it was decided that 75 centres, instead of 89, would be fit for Delhi. It was communicated to the state government on Wednesday. With time, the government plans to increase the number of locations as well as the number of sites in each location. The learning experience on each day will be recorded and that shall guide the administration in further planning,” said a senior Delhi government official, on condition of anonymity.The 75 include prominent hospitals such as Lok Nayak, BL Kapoor, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, AIIMS, Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, Fortis Escorts Institute, and Safdarjung Hospital.The 14 locations that have been removed included 12 private hospitals such as Jeewan Mala Hospital in central Delhi, Vinayak Hospital in north Delhi, Medeor Hospital in south Delhi and Satyabhama Hospital in west Delhi. The only two government hospitals removed from the inaugural day list are Delhi State Cancer Institute and Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital.Each vaccination centre will have a limit of 100 shots a day. The drive will start with health care workers – their numbers are estimated at 300,000 in Delhi, of which 225,000 have registered for the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/city-vaccine-centres-down-to-75-from-89-101610578819421.html
14-01-2021||Delhi||20k Covaxin doses land in city; final prep underway for V-Day||The first lot of Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine ‘Covaxin’, was shipped to Delhi’s primary storage facility at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital on Wednesday, days before the inoculation drive is scheduled to begin countrywide, and were then taken to vaccination centres across the city by police and administration staff.This comes a day after 264,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India, reached the Capital. The first doses will be administered on Saturday.Two flights, Air India flight AI 559 and Vistara’s UK 860, brought the Covaxin consignment into the Capital from Hyderabad on Wednesday. While the AI flight landed at the Indira Gandhi International airport with three boxes of the vaccine around 9.15am, the other, loaded with four boxes of Covaxin, arrived around 10.40am.Officials aware of the development said the boxes were shifted to a temperature-controlled facility in cargo terminals and were then shipped out. “While the vaccines brought in by Air India were dispatched for Kurukshetra, the Vistara consignment was sent to Delhi,” said an official who asked not to be named.Hospital authorities at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality (RGSS) hospital said the four boxes brought there held 20,000 doses of the vaccine. Later in the day, these were shipped to different hospitals across 11 districts. The government will start the vaccination drive at hospitals on Saturday, by administering the shots to healthcare workers identified in the priority category. Later, the vaccination sites will be expanded to over 600 places across the city.According to a list that the government’s health department shared with the police, most vaccination points for Saturday are in south-east Delhi, which has 10 earmarked hospitals, followed by east and central Delhi that have nine hospitals each. The hospitals have been marked as private, district and government hospitals.The data has been shared with police districts across the city to ensure law-and-order on Saturday.Special commissioner of police (operations) Muktesh Chander confirmed that the vaccine was transported to hospitals on Wednesday. “The police provided security during the transport of the vaccine to the hospitals. Local police have been alerted and keeping secure every point where the vaccine is stored,” he said.Meanwhile, Vistara and Spice Jet continued to transport the vaccines to other parts of the country. A Vistara spokesperson said the airline carried multiple shipments of the vaccines to various routes including Mumbai to Varanasi and Hyderabad to Delhi.A SpiceJet flight also landed at Delhi airport from Pune, carrying 34 boxes of Covishield vaccines. “Of these, nine were sent to Agra, 12 to Bareilly and 13 boxes to Meerut,” the officer said.The airline in a statement said, “From Pune, SpiceJet carried 34 boxes of Covishield to Delhi. On Wednesday a total of 111 boxes of Covid-19 vaccine, weighing 3.5 tonnes were shipped by SpiceJet from Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad to 11 cities.”Delhi police vehicles escorted the vehicles carrying the vaccines to nearby states. Police said they alerted the control room of the UP police after which the vaccine was handed to the state police.Meanwhile, senior police officers said 70% of the city law enforcement’s agency data was uploaded on CoWIN portal, with the remainder due to be done by the end of Wednesday.“The Delhi Police has over 80,000 personnel. Seventy per cent of their data has been uploaded on the CoWIN portal, and the rest will be uploaded today [Wednesday]. People over 50 years of age will be given priority. They had received the date, time, and centre for their Covid-19 vaccination via SMS,” Chander told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/20k-covaxin-doses-land-in-city-final-prep-underway-for-vday-101610578332685.html
14-01-2021||Delhi||Relieve us of bird flu duty, say teachers||The Delhi government has deployed school teachers besides civil defence volunteers at various borders to check and report any illegal transportation of poultry or live birds into Delhi. Teachers, however, urged deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday to withdraw the order.In a state revenue department order on Tuesday, the government constituted five surveillance teams — each led by a government school teacher and accompanied by two civil defence volunteers — to check the spread of bird flu in Delhi.The viral infection was confirmed in the city on Monday after more than 150 while birds were found dead in various parts of the capital, prompting the Delhi government to shut the Ghazipur poultry market for 10 days and ban the import of live birds without a valid health certificate and the sale of packaged or processed chicken.The teams have been asked to stay put at the borders from 8 pm to 6 am, something that has not gone down well with teachers. These teams have been deployed at Auchandi Border, Saboli border, Safiabad border, Lampur border and Muneerpur border — entry points from where most of the poultry or live birds arrive in Delhi.The government order states that the teams have to ensure that no vehicle carrying live poultry birds in Delhi is allowed to enter without a valid veterinary health certificate from an authorised veterinarian of the concerned state government, declaring the farm of origin of birds as free from any infection and contagious disease of birds. They were also asked to prevent the entry or sale of dressed, processed or canned chicken and its products in the Capital.The government school teachers’ association, (GSTA), Delhi, on Wednesday wrote to Sisodia, who is both education and development minister, to repeal the order and put their teachers back on school duty.“The revenue department has deputed government school teachers on Delhi borders to check for and to prevent the spread of bird flu under day/night duty. Moreover, teachers have been mostly assigned midnight hours of this duty,” read the letter signed by Ajay Veer Yadav, general secretary, GSTA.“Sir, the teaching community selflessly served when the government and the citizens needed them for Covid-19 prevention. But the revenue department is now taking advantage of the situation and just harassing teachers into unjustified duties... I request you to intervene and stop such deputation of teaching community...,” it stated.The Delhi government did not respond to queries regarding the teachers’ demand.A teacher deputed at the borders said there was no detailed brief on what is allowed.“As of now the order has not been taken back, so I have to report at the border and perform my duty. But I am not sure what exactly we are supposed to do. Will the vehicles even stop on our insistence? We as school teachers know nothing about a health certificate issued by a veterinarian,” the teacher said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/relieve-us-of-bird-flu-duty-say-teachers-101610577792328.html
14-01-2021||Delhi||MCDs ban sale, stocking of poultry; eateries can’t serve chicken or eggs||The three municipal corporations (MCDs) of Delhi on Wednesday imposed a blanket ban on the storage, packaging and sale of all poultry across the national capital, triggering anguish among retailers and restaurant owners who said that if the order was not reviewed immediately, the supply of chicken and eggs will come to a complete halt in Delhi.The MCDs also prohibited restaurants and hotels from serving any item containing chicken or eggs to their customers. The orders, issued separately by the three civic bodies, stated that the rules were applicable with immediate effect, and that any violation would attract penal action or cancellation of the meat trade licences.The Delhi government had on Monday confirmed the spread of avian influenza in the Capital, shut the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market for 10 days, and banned the entry of live birds into the city without proper health certification from authorised veterinarians. Later, the government also prohibited the sale of packaged or processed chicken brought from outside Delhi. But it did not completely ban the sale of chicken and eggs in the city.On Wednesday, the north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations went a step further by imposing a complete ban on any form of activity related to poultry and live birds in the areas under their jurisdiction, including prohibiting restaurants and hotels from serving any item containing chicken or eggs to their customers.The civic bodies said their decision was based on the Delhi government’s recent orders, which banned all forms of trade related to poultry.However, a Delhi government spokesperson said the orders issued by the MCDs were more stringent compared to what the city administration had done.Jai Prakash, mayor of the north Delhi municipal corporation (North MCD), said the civic body has asked those involved in the poultry business to strictly follow the prohibitory orders. “If violated, action will be taken by the deputy director (veterinary services) of all zones and their meat trade licence will also be cancelled. Owners of restaurants are being ordered not to serve food containing poultry meat and eggs otherwise penal action will be initiated against them as per the law,” he said.The east MCD also issued a similar order and said people are also being requested call on the helpline number 011-23890318, if they find any unnatural death of birds in their locality.Anurag Katriar, president of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said they will write to the MCDs requesting them to rescind the rules.“What is more surprising is that the Delhi government had actually given out newspaper advertisements today morning assuring that well-cooked meat or egg is safe to eat. Businesses are being affected due to the multiplicity of authority in the city,” he said. Health experts have also pointed out that chicken thoroughly cooked above 70 degrees Celsius is safe to consume.Restaurateur Priyank Sukhija, owner of restaurants brands such as Tamasha, Lord of the Drinks, Warehouse Café and Teddy Boy, said because of the MCD order they will have to trash cold-processed chicken worth lakhs of rupees.“Cold processed chicken has a maximum shelf-life of a month. Our current stock was to be totally used up within the next 10-15 days, but now it will have to be trashed. Also, Delhi lives on chicken, especially butter chicken. Our restaurants see a huge demand for chicken items, with that being taken off the shelves, now we are likely to see a drastic drop in customer footfall as well,” said Sukhija.Irshad Qureshi, general secretary, Delhi meat traders’ association, said of the 6,000 licensed meat shops registered under the group, nearly 2,500 shops sell only chicken. “Their businesses had dropped by nearly 60-70% in the past one week because of bird flu. Now, it has come to a complete halt,” Qureshi said.Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said people could still eat chicken, but precautions must be taken. “The virus gets killed once the chicken is thoroughly cooked above 70 degrees Celsius. People need to take precautions with the raw chicken -- they should use gloves to handle it, they should clean the surface where the uncooked chicken is kept thoroughly, and wash their hands properly,” said Dr Broor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mcds-ban-sale-stocking-of-poultry-eateries-can-t-serve-chicken-or-eggs-101610568762501.html
14-01-2021||Delhi||Free vaccine for all residents of Delhi: Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday said that the Covid-19 vaccine will be free for all residents of Delhi even if the central government does not make it free for all across the country, even as he alerted people against “misinformation” related to the vaccines.The comments by Kejriwal came three days before the vaccination drive is set to kick start across the country – with healthcare workers chosen as the first priority group, to be followed by frontline workers.Kejriwal said, “There are a lot of people who would not be able to afford the vaccine. I had appealed to the Centre to provide free vaccine to all the people of the country… If the Centre doesn’t do it, the Delhi government will provide free vaccine to all the residents of Delhi.”“I want to appeal to everyone to not spread any misinformation on the vaccine. I believe that the Central government along with the scientists have followed all protocols and safeguards before bringing this vaccine. There should be no doubt regarding it,” said Kejriwal on the sidelines of his visit to the residence of a doctor who died of Covid-19 while on duty.The Delhi government provided ₹1 crore in financial assistance to the family of Dr Hitesh Gupta, who was employed at the Karkardooma dispensary of Delhi government.After the first dry run of the vaccine on January 2, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said the vaccine would be free for all Delhi residents, even though Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had announced the same day that the vaccines would be free for health care workers and frontline workers.On January 9, Kejriwal had urged the Centre to consider making the vaccine free for people across India.As many as 264,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine, manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India — and 20,000 doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin have so far reached the national capital.On Wednesday, the government started the process of allocating doses to each of the 11 revenue districts, said a senior government official.The doses are stored in bulk at a cold storage facility set up at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in Tahirpur, from where they are to be sent to cold chain points, and eventually to vaccination sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/free-vaccine-for-all-residents-of-delhi-kejriwal-101610568166752.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||Illegal building construction in Mumbai: HC relief for actor Sonu Sood||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday reserved order on an appeal filed by actor Sonu Sood, challenging the refusal of interim relief by the city civil court at Dindoshi, for restraining the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) from taking any action pursuant to the October 24, 2020 notice issued to him over purportedly illegal additions and alterations made to his Shakti Sagar building at Juhu, and illegal conversion of the building into a residential hotel.BMC had issued the notice, calling upon the actor, who owns the ground-plus-six storey structure, to either remove all unauthorised additions and alterations and restore the building to its original condition, or apply under section 44 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 for retention of the additions and alterations.Besides, the civic body had also called upon the actor to stop using tenements in the building for commercial purpose – a residential hotel and of the shops as restaurants, alleging that the change of user was without appropriate permissions.Sood’s counsel, advocate Amogh Singh, however, maintained that the actor has not made any additional constructions in the building. He said the actor took ownership of the building only in 2018-19, and the building was as it was since January 1992, when it was constructed.Singh submitted that the allegations of unauthorised additions and alterations made in the notice were vague. “Forget about the dimensions of the unauthorised work, even the floor numbers are not mentioned in the notice,” said Singh.As regards conversion of the building into a residential hotel and ground-floor shops into restaurants, Singh said no permission of the civic body was required for the change of user, but by way of abundant caution, the actor has applied for change of user, and in-principle approval had already been granted by the civic body for the same.Singh also pointed out that during the recent lockdown, Sood had made the entire building available as temporary accommodation for police personnel, and urged the court to grant an interim order in favour of the actor.Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, who represented BMC, opposed Sood’s appeal, contending that he had not come to court with clean hands, and had suppressed several vital aspects of the matter that a speaking order was passed for demolition of the unauthorised additions and alterations on February 14, 2020, and the additions and alterations were earlier demolished twice – once in November 2018 and then in February 2020, and the same has reconstructed for the third time.Sood has filed a suit before the civil court challenging the October 24 notice issued by BMC and had also applied for interim relief. He moved HC on January 5, 2021, after the civil court rejected his plea for interim relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/illegal-building-construction-in-mumbai-hc-relief-for-actor-sonu-sood-101610567844363.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Maharashtra government revives Nariman Point-Colaba sea link plan||The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has revived another decade-old project of a sea bridge connecting Nariman Point to Colaba in south Mumbai. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has invited bids for appointing a consultant who would look at the technical and financial feasibility of the project.According to officials, the route will serve as an alternative to the Captain Prakash Pethe Marg which witnessed heavy traffic congestion. “Since it is the only major route along Colaba, commuters face traffic congestion. This project will be planned as a sea bridge that will also connect Cuffe Parade,” said MMRDA commissioner RA Rajeev.On Wednesday, tourism and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who took stock of the ongoing projects of MMRDA, tweeted, “Nariman Point-Cuffe Parade connector: on my humble request, the @MMRDAOfficial has put out an EoI for consultants. This connector will ease out traffic in a key business-residential area, while not obstructing the boats of fishermen. By June, we shall have a design for it.”In 2008, MMRDA had planned a 1.2-km coastal road connecting National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA) to Cuffe Parade. The project was also cleared by the then chief minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh. However, it was put in the back-burner as MMRDA was also planning a ₹3,500-crore redevelopment plan for Nariman Point.The state has already undertaken construction of five sea links which include the 22-km Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link, Versova-Bandra sea link, its 43-km extension till Virar and coastal road which will connect Nariman Point to the western suburbs. The Thackeray-led government has also revived the Konkan coast project connecting the three coastal districts of Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg. This mega project was also put in the back-burner for two-decades owing to various issues including land acquisition, high cost and priority given to widening of the Mumbai-Goa highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaimaharashtra-government-revives-nariman-point-colaba-sea-link-plan-101610567724175.html

The officials will also check on the chicken and egg sellers, to note their source and licenses will be checked and the poultry will also be medically examined across the district.Suresh Deshmukh, joint commissioner, Food and Drug Administration, said, “Bird flu cases can be easily detected in live birds, which is under the supervision of the local bodies. Ideally, only those poultry can be slaughtered which are fit; hence all inspectors have been cautioned to find the source of the chicken and eggs in hotels.”It has come to light that apart from the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), none of the governing bodies within the district has an animal husbandry department. However, a district-level control room has been set up under the Thane district’s animal husbandry which will look after bird flu-related complaints. The helpline numbers are 022-25603311 and 18002330418.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-poultry-farms-across-thane-to-be-checked-101610567605612.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police extends deadline for private establishments to install CCTVs within two months||The Mumbai Police extended the deadline for all private and commercial establishments in the city to install CCTV cameras by two months. Shopkeepers or commercial establishment owners who refuse to abide by it despite having their shops in crime-prone areas may face legal action. Earlier the deadline for installing CCTVs was January 7.According to police, incidents of crime occur in public places as well as in the vicinity of private establishments, thus posing a threat to the safety of citizens, and thereby, disturbing peace and tranquillity. CCTVs help police to effectively check crimes and also help in building confidence and a sense of security among citizens. It also deters perpetrators from committing crime as their acts will be recorded.Therefore, the city police in November 2020 under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) directed all private establishments in the city to install CCTVs. The establishments include jewellery shops, hotels, guest houses, restaurants, bars and pubs, wine and beer shops, residential towers, banks, ATMs, financial institutions, office buildings, new and upcoming residential towers/office buildings, petrol pumps, shopping complexes, shopping malls, super markets, gyms, sports grounds, stadiums, educational institutions, multiplexes, places of worships, hospitals, trusts and other organizations.Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police (operation) Chaitanya Siriprolu, who issued the order, said the deadline for private establishments to install CCTVs has been extended by two months. “The response from private establishments is good. Since we don’t want to forcefully impose it and are expecting active participation from the public, we have extended the deadline by two months. The project is going to ultimately benefit the public and enhance their safety. Citizens understand this and are gradually installing CCTV. Policemen at the police station level are conveying to establishment owners the importance of the step and encouraging them to install CCTV,” he said.“With citizens’ active participation in installing CCTV cameras, we aim to have a dense network of nearly 300,000 virtual eyes which would cover every nook and corner of the city. The crime rate will go down drastically,” a senior IPS officer said.It is also observed that in cases where private establishments have CCTV systems installed, the direction and field of view of the cameras are such that the area outside such establishments is not covered, the camera quality is inadequate, the recording capacity is inadequate or non-existent, resulting in incidents of crime not being captured and recorded. Hence the establishment owners are directed by the police that CCTV camera must cover an area of around 50 metres from the establishment. CCTV should be of good quality and should be working at all times. It should have the recording capacity of at least 15 days with features to playback the recording and also to take a copy of the same.In Mumbai, there is already a network of around 5,000 government- operated CCTV cameras covering arterial roads, main roads, junctions. These 5,000 cameras are installed at over 1,510 sensitive locations across the city. The existing CCTV network is also used by the traffic police to maintain vehicular traffic in the city. The government would soon be adding additional 7,000 cameras to its network.The CCTV network surveillance project was imposed in Mumbai after the 26/11 terror attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-extends-deadline-for-private-establishments-to-install-cctvs-within-two-months-101610567604530.html

The court has, however, asked the prison authorities to check the contents, if they are objectionable, before allowing the same.Bharadwaj along with Hany Babu and Gautam Navlakha had approached the special court for access to books and newspapers in prison. Their lawyer, on Tuesday, filed an affidavit stating that the prison authorities at Taloja did not allow to deliver books brought by lawyers as well.Bharadwaj in her petition said the books sent to her in the past few months, by post as well as those brought personally by her lawyers, have been returned repeatedly. “Applicant is a lawyer and a law professor who has spent her life reading and studying books and texts, and she cannot be denied access to books arbitrarily,” read the petition.The court has now permitted her to have five books from outside the prison. “The superintendent shall carefully examine the books and if they contain objectionable material, which preaches violence, vulgar, obscene, pornographic or the material propagating the banned organisation namely Revolutionary Democratic Front or CPI (Maoist), in that case, he shall not allow the applicant to accept such books,” the court said.Meanwhile, since the reply on the plea of Babu and Navlakha was not received from Taloja jail, it is kept pending for hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-sudha-bharadwaj-allowed-access-to-5-books-per-month-from-outside-jail-101610567365361.html

The cost of one litre of petrol is now ₹91.07 while the cost of a litre of diesel in the city soared to ₹81.34. The fuel prices in the city have increased after seven days.On January 7, the price of one litre of petrol in the city was ₹90.83, while a litre of diesel was priced at ₹81.07. The fuel prices across metro cities soared after oil prices witnessed an increase throughout last week. In October 2018, the cost of one litre of petrol was ₹91.34 and cost of one litre of diesel was ₹80.10.Motorists in the city are irked with the increase in petrol prices. “The lockdown imposed due to the spread of coronavirus in the city has already impacted the livelihood of people. Citizens in the city are using their private vehicles to commute and undertake important work. With the increased petrol prices, the financial burden increases. The government should bring the petrol prices under control and reduce the cost of both petrol and diesel in the city,” said Aarti Singh, a Vikhroli resident. The Petrol Dealers Association have stated that they are going through unprecedented conditions. “The petrol dealers are earning a minimal commission over the sale. The issues of the dealers are also not addressed,” said M Venkatrao, president, Petrol Dealers Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/petrol-price-soars-to-91-07-a-litre-in-mumbai-diesel-now-at-8134-101610567244108.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Covid vaccination drive: Doctors on standby at 9 centres||Doctors and medical staff have been kept on standby at the nine Covid-19 vaccination centres in the city, as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) prepares to administer vaccines to healthcare workers from January 16. The BMC aims to vaccinate at least 10,000 people daily, aiming to cover a total of 130,000 medical workers within two weeks. The second phase of the dry run is expected on January 15. The nine vaccination centres in Mumbai include four major hospitals namely KEM, BYL Nair, Cooper and Sion, followed by four peripheral hospitals namely Bhabha Hospital in Bandra, VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivli; and the Covid-19 facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex. At every centre, 10 to 20 doctors will be on stand-by to attend to any emergency. Overall, around 200 doctors, over 100 nurses and around 500 volunteers will participate in the drive. The vaccine centres have a total of 50 booths for vaccination, and each booth will be handled by a team of two to five vaccinators. According to BMC officials, the vaccination will be done by nurses in some centres and by doctors in some. The BMC has trained 5,000 volunteers. Dr Sheela Jagptap from the immunisation department of the BMC, said, “Each health worker who undergoes vaccination will have to wait at the centre for around 30 minutes. In this period, if the person reports any side effects, we have kept doctors, nurses and specialists on standby. They will shift the person to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further treatment. In case there is no side effect, the person will be allowed to go home with a pamphlet on what he should do in case of a side effect. The second dose has to be taken 28 days after taking the first dose.” “We won’t have a uniform number of staff at each vaccine centre. It is being worked out, as per the need. We are working on minute details,” she added. According to BMC officials, they are not expecting serious side effects, except for a fever or swelling in rare cases. All those who undergo vaccination will be given contact of their local wards where they need to report any such problem. The first shift at the centres will be from 8am to 2pm, and the second shift will be from 2pm to 8pm. Each centre will have a team of vaccinators, supervising doctors and nodal officers who will report to BMC headquarters. On Wednesday, senior BMC officials, including Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar and additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, visited the F-South ward in Parel where the vaccines are stored. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the BMC’s standing committee meeting was adjourned as members across parties, including Shiv Sena, BJP, Congress and NCP, demanded information on how the Covid-19 vaccination drive on health care will be conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-covid-vaccination-drive-doctors-on-standby-at-9-centres-101610567125974.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai second most congested city in the world after Moscow: Report||Mumbai was the second most congested city in the world after Moscow in 2020 in terms of traffic states the latest of traffic index released by TomTom Traffic Index, which conducted a study across 416 cities across 57 countries. After ranking fourth in 2019 and 2018, Mumbai has now risen to the second spot. Two other Indian cities — Bengaluru and New Delhi — have ranked sixth and eighth most congested cities respectively in 2020. TomTom Traffic Index’s report analysed traffic data from more than 400 cities in 57 countries. Its findings show traffic congestion lessened in a number of places. Werner van Huyssteen, general manager (India), TomTom, said, “Last year, we announced that both global and India congestion levels in 2019 had increased for the ninth consecutive traffic index. In 2020, we saw a vastly different picture. From lockdowns to closed borders, people’s movement changed – and it changed very fast.” In Mumbai, traffic congestion decreased by 12%, while Bengaluru, ranked sixth, saw 51% congestion in 2020, compared to 71% congestion in 2019 and was ranked at number one. Parag Bedarkar, manager (enterprise sales) at TomTom, said congestion had decreased across the world and could be due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Bedarkar said that in Mumbai, congestion levels dipped by 18% in the morning peak hour and 17% during the evening rush hour. “Solutions offered by companies like work-from-home helped to reduce congestion after lockdown,” said Bedarkar. According to TomTom, drivers in Mumbai spend an average of 53% more travel time due to traffic congestion. Other global cities in the top 10 list for their congestion include Manila, Bogota, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Kyiv, Lima, Istanbul and Jakarta. TomTom provides real-time traffic management data along with historical traffic congestion data which could help local governments plan their infrastructure projects and initiate more public transport schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-second-most-congested-city-in-the-world-after-moscow-report-101610567124457.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||‘Patole may not be top contender for Maharashtra Congress chief’s post’||While there is a tussle among the aspirants for the post of Maharashtra Congress chief, the top contender for the same, Nana Patole, faces a major hurdle now.The Congress’ allies in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition are not keen to face an election for the post of speaker of the state Assembly, if the incumbent Patole resigns for the organisational post, in the party. The MVA allies are wary of facing instability if a few of their members of Legislative Assembly (MLA) resort to cross-voting for the BJP.Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and even some Congress leaders have reportedly conveyed this to the Congress leadership. NCP leadership also has reservations over Patole because of the strained relations between him and senior NCP leader Praful Patel. In this background, senior leaders Rajiv Satav and Vijay Wadettiwar are now emerging as two strong contenders for the post.After state in-charge of the party, HK Patil, met Congress legislators and key leaders from Maharashtra in Mumbai recently, to gauge the mood among them for the change of guard in the state unit, the lobbying for the post has intensified. Party leaders from the state have been meeting central leadership in Delhi over the last few days. Former chief minister Ashok Chavan met leaders in Delhi and reportedly batted for state relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who is one of the top contenders for the post.“Patole could be an ideal face and fits in the criterion finalised by the party for the post. Party high command is expected to hand-pick a non-Maratha from Vidarbha as it wants to send out a message to the electorate. However, none of the ruling parties would want to re-election to the post of speaker. Speaker cannot hold any political post. The MVA has a thumping majority in the lower house, but cross-voting by even a few members could lead to an atmosphere of instability in the coalition. The Opposition BJP would like to grab the opportunity to let ruling alliance down,” said a senior Congress leader requesting anonymity.Another Congress minister pointed out that there is resistance from the NCP to make Patole state unit chief. “NCP’s key leader Praful Patel is bete noire of Patole, owing to the local politics in Bhandara and Gondia. He would not want Patole to hold the reign of Congress, thus NCP leadership has reportedly started to ensure that the Congress does not handpick Patole,” he said.Ashok Chavan camp has been reportedly convincing the party high command that the state unit needs an aggressive face like Wadettiwar to face other two ruling parties and Opposition BJP is pitching for Satav to be his successor.Patole, however, said, “The MVA enjoys a solid majority of about 186 members in the lower house and it has no threat. The deputy speaker was elected unopposed and it could be repeated even in choosing the new speaker if I was given another responsibility. The fear of election for the new speaker cannot prove to be a hurdle for my becoming party chief in the state. I met state-in-charge of the Congress HK Patil during his recent review meetings in Mumbai, and have told him that I was ready to obey party decisions, which are in the interest of the party at large.”Talking about the resistance from NCP, Patole said that it is good for him if other parties are afraid of him and his party should think about it.Another question being asked in the party is if any minister was made state unit chief, would he be asked to give up his ministerial berth? “Not necessary. One leader one post is an old formula and in states like Punjab party leadership has appointed ministers to head the state unit,” a senior leader said.Wadettiwar said, “It is up to the party leadership to decide on this, but I think state chief of the party gets strength if is also in the cabinet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/patole-may-not-be-top-contender-for-maharashtra-congress-chief-s-post-101610567004185.html
14-01-2021||Lucknow||Public notice for interfaith marriage not a must: HC||Public display of notices to invite objections to an interfaith marriage is not mandatory under the 1954 Special Marriage Act (SMA), the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court said on Wednesday, arguing that the contentious provision violates the rights to liberty and privacy.The order, passed by justice Vivek Chaudhury on Tuesday but made public on Wednesday, came on a petition by an interfaith couple who said the provision, under which notices are displayed at marriage offices and sometimes even sent to the houses of the applicants 30 days prior to the scheduled date, prompted social pressure in their “free choice” of marriage.“This court mandates that while giving notice under Section 5 of the (Special Marriage) Act of 1954 it shall be optional for the parties to the intended marriage to make a request in writing to the marriage officer to publish or not to publish a notice under Section 6,” the judge said in his 47-page order.“In case they do not make such a request for publication of notice in writing, while giving notice under Section 5 of the Act, the marriage officer shall not publish any such notice or entertain objections to the intended marriage and proceed with the solemnisation of the marriage,” he added.SMA, which allows solemnisation of marriages by way of registration without religious customs, regulates interfaith marriages in India.The order is not directly linked to the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, which outlaws conversion by allurement, fraud, coercion or marriage.But it comes amid a swirling debate over the new law that has provisions — such as 60-day advance notice before a planned conversion and police inquiries — similar to the SMA, and a controversy over “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing groups to desribe relationships between Hindu women and Muslim men. The couple’s lawyers also told the high court that the situation was “more critical” for interfaith couples after the new ordinance was notified.Two other petitions challenging the controversial public-notice provision, which activists say puts hurdles in the way of interfaith couples and encourages vigilantes to scuttle such unions, are pending before the Delhi high court and the Supreme Court.As the case was related to protection of fundamental rights of many people, the court ordered a copy of the verdict be sent to the chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh and asked him to communicate the same to all marriage officers and other authorities.“It would be cruel and unethical to force the present generation living with its current needs and expectations to follow the customs and traditions adopted by a generation living nearly 150 years back for its social needs and circumstances, which violates fundamental rights recognised by the courts of the day,” the order read.The court was hearing a habeas corpus (have the body) petition by a Hindu man who claimed that his wife, who converted from Islam to Hinduism to marry him, was being stopped from living with him by her father. During the course of the hearing, the couple told the court that they could have solemnised their union under SMA but for the public notice provision.“They expressed that any such notice would be an invasion in their privacy and would have definitely caused unnecessary social pressure/interference in their free choice with regard to their marriage.They further stated that such a challenge was being faced by a large number of similarly situated persons who desire to build a life with a partner of their own choice,” the order read.The court relied on previous apex court judgments, including the 2018 decriminalisation of homosexuality and the 2017 right to privacy verdicts, and also noted that no provision of public notices existed under personal religious laws. “There is no apparent reasonable purpose achieved by making the procedure to be more protective or obstructive under the Act of 1954, under which much less numbers of marriages are taking place, than procedure under the other personal laws, more particularly when this discrimination violates fundamental rights,” the order read.SMA mandates an elaborate process to register a marriage. First, one of the parties has to give a notice to the marriage officer of the district where at least one of the parties has resided for at least 30 days.This notice, which includes details such as names, date of birth, age, occupation, parents’ name, address, and phone number, is then entered in the marriage notice book and the officer puts it up in the office.Anybody can then raise objections on various grounds. If no objection is raised within 30 days, then the marriage can be solemnised. If objections are raised, then the officer has to inquire into the objections, and can then decide whether to solemnise the union.The high court sharply criticised this public notice provision. “In case the same...are held mandatory...they would invade in the fundamental rights of liberty and privacy, including ...freedom to choose for marriage without interference from state and non-state actors,” the judge held.The order mentioned that if an interfaith couple “by their free choice” wanted to get more information about their potential partner, they could opt for publication of the notice. The court also said the marriage officer was free to verify the identification, age and valid consent of the parties. “In case he has any doubt, it shall be open for him to ask for appropriate details/proof as per the facts of the case,” the judgment read.Activists welcomed the judgment. “The 30-day public notice provision is feared by most interfaith couples because it triggers vigilantes. Making it optional will remove a major hurdle in registering interfaith unions. But it has to be implemented quickly,” said Asif Iqbal, founder of the non-governmental organisation Dhanak that works with interfaith couples.State president of All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA), Madhu Garg, said the public notices had led to hate crimes in the past, and making it optional would make people feel safe.Legal experts said the contentious provision was an intrusion on an individual’s right to privacy. “Any adult has a right to marry without interference in his privacy. This judgment has upheld this fundamental value. It is a well researched judgment,” said Desh Ratna Sinha, advocate, Lucknow high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/public-notice-for-interfaith-marriage-not-a-must-hc-101610566591456.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||NCPCR asks NIOS to address Mumbai parents’ concerns over Class 10, 12 exams||A few days after city parents whose children are registered under the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) requested the board to cancel the upcoming offline Class 10 and Class 12 exams, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has taken cognisance of the issue and has written to the board.In its letter addressed to the board on Tuesday, NCPCR asked officials to look into the request of parents who had said they did not want a physical examination and also complained about no reduction in the syllabus for the exams. With the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) allowing boards to conduct their scheduled exams in the city, parents are anxious, especially as practical exams have been scheduled from today (January 14). “We stay in Andheri (West), but the exam centre is in Mumbai Central. It will be difficult for our children to travel all the way there as they have low immunity as many are with special needs,” said the parent of a student. Officials from the board did not respond to calls and messages. An official from the Pune region of the board which overlooks centres in Maharashtra, said, “We cannot comment on this because it is a policy decision that will be decided upon by the central leadership.”Parents said that the board should mark students based on their internal assessments. Many complained about not getting study material on time. Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association, who wrote to the NCPCR, said, “Exams should be conducted in the online mode, and the board should also consider promoting students on their internal assessments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncpcr-asks-nios-to-address-mumbai-parents-concerns-over-class-10-12-exams-101610566824167.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Why Covid vaccines are stored at Parel, Not Kanjurmarg||Why has the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) stored the 139,500 vaccine vials that the city got from the Serum Institute of India in Pune at the public health department’s headquarters at the F-South ward office in Parel, instead of the regional vaccine storage facility at Kanjurmarg, which is being prepared since mid-November? The Kanjurmarg facility is undergoing civil works at its premises and will be ready only after two weeks. The Kanjurmarg facility can store up to 9,000,000 vaccine vials, while the F-South ward office can store up to 600,000 vaccine doses at a time. Suresh Kakani, additional Municipal commissioner in charge of the BMC’s public health department, said on Tuesday, “The Kanjurmarg facility is ready to be activated for storage of vials, but some civil work is pending. Moreover, the capacity is more to be activated at once for a comparatively smaller unit of vaccine doses. So we got the facility at Parel ready. Once the Parel facility is used to its full capacity, we will begin to use the one at Kanjurmarg.” Moreover, logistically, it would be tedious to transport vaccine doses from the Kanjurmarg facility in the eastern suburbs to all nine vaccination centres, and hence the facility at Parel, which is centrally located, was chosen, Kakani added. The nine vaccination centres in the city are the four major hospitals, King Edward Memorial Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, Cooper Hospital and Sion Hospital; four peripheral hospitals — Bhabha at Bandra, VN Desai at Santacruz, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar hospital, Kandivli; and the Covid facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex. A room on the ground floor of the F-South ward office building was cleared and handed over to the BMC’s public health department by the ward authorities. It is equipped with 10 ice-lined refrigerators, and the vaccine doses will be transferred from here on Saturday morning. With an area of 5,000sqft, the Kanjurmarg facility in the five-storey Parivar building will have two walk-in coolers (WIC) and one walk-in freezer (WIF). The WIC will have capacity of 40 cubic metres and will maintain temperature up to -80 degrees Celsius. The WIF will have a capacity of 20 cubic metres and will maintain temperature between -15 and -250 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-why-covid-vaccines-are-stored-at-parel-not-kanjurmarg-101610566704322.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||Fishermen can claim compensation only thrice a year for rescue of endangered marine life: Maharashtra fisheries department||Fishermen claiming compensation for rescuing and releasing marine life into the sea can now do so only three times a year. The state government has introduced an upper limit to the number of claims one can file and the amount that can be claimed to the compensation scheme for the fishing community.In a notification issued last week, the state fisheries department has announced a new structure for the compensation scheme for conservation practices by the fishing community. Endangered marine animals, protected under various schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, get caught in large trawler fishing nets and are rescued by cutting these nets. However, while the animals survive once the nets are cut the fishing community endures a loss due to damaged nets. Changes to the compensation scheme, which was introduced in 2018 to encourage conservation practices by fishermen, were proposed by the state mangrove cell to ensure more fishermen take advantage of it instead of the rewards going to those making multiple claims through the year. The compensation is provided once the fisherman can submit proof of the release and damage to nets.The compensation amount, which was earlier ₹25,000 for rescuing all kinds of marine life and releasing them into the sea, has been lowered for smaller species to ₹12,500.For instance, for rescuing and releasing sea turtles, such as the Olive Ridley, green sea, loggerhead and hawksbill, fishermen will receive ₹12,500 for their first claim. One fisherman can make claims only three times a year. The compensation for the second claim will be ₹10,000 and for the third will be ₹8,000.The compensation will remain ₹25,000 for the first claim for rescuing and releasing larger species such as the whale shark, Gangetic shark, Pondicherry shark, sawfish, giant guitarfish, leatherback turtle, dolphins and whales. Compensation for subsequent claims has been reduced to ₹20,000 and ₹15,000.“Since the start of the scheme, we have disbursed ₹25 lakh to fishermen for their conservation efforts. However, we have noticed that some fishermen make multiple claims throughout the year. It can’t be that all these rare species are getting trapped in the nets of only a handful of fishermen. Therefore, we had proposed an upper limit on the number of claims one can file,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell). The compensation scheme for conservation practices was launched by the mangrove cell and fisheries department on December 21, 2018, and was subsequently passed by the state cabinet. The mangrove cell had also found that the damage caused to nets by releasing smaller species was not very high, and therefore proposed to reduce the compensation, Tiwari added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fishermen-can-claim-compensation-only-thrice-a-year-for-rescue-of-endangered-marine-life-maharashtra-fisheries-department-101610566584209.html

Of them, 455 are poultry birds. This has also increased the risk of a spread of bird flu in other districts of the state. The state has also culled close to 15,000 poultry birds till date to contain the spread of avian influenza or bird flu.In a late evening development, around eight-10 peacocks and peahens were found dead at Hinganghat in Wardha district.Further, the state government on Wednesday empowered all the district collectors for immediate implementation of a containment plan, even if they suspect deaths are due to bird flu, said state animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh.The state government is also still awaiting test results of the samples from other districts sent to the ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, a nodal body for testing bird flu cases, to confirm the cause of bird deaths, he said.Of 481 deaths, 294 died in Yavatmal, 79 in Bhandara, 18 in Latur, 13 each in Akola and Pune, nine each in Nanded and Solapur, three each in Beed and Ahmednagar. In addition, 21 crows have been found dead in seven districts — Beed, Ahmednagar, Ratnagiri, Satara, Pune, Akola and Yavatmal, the officials said.On Tuesday, a total of 218 birds were found dead in different districts of the state, of them 214 were poultry birds.Till Monday, the bird flu cases were confirmed at six places that include Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, Beed and Latur districts.In Parbhani and Latur where confirmed cases of avian influenza or bird flu were detected, the district administrations have culled nearly 15,000 poultry birds.Deepak Muglikar, Parbhani district collector said that they have completed culling process of 3,443 poultry birds within 1 km vicinity of the concerned poultry farm. The test reports of the people have also come negative. “Culling process of poultry birds within 1 km radius of the concerned poultry farm has been completed. We have also completed examinations of all the people in the village. We have also conducted RT-PCR tests of those 28 people working with the poultry farm and their reports have come negative,” Muglikar said.Over 800 birds were found dead in Parbhani owing to bird flu last week.Prithiviraj BP, Latur district collector said that they have culled a total 11,164 poultry birds at eleven locations in the district within one km vicinity of two villages Kendrewadi and Sukni. “We have initiated all the preventive measures following the containment plan in the district. The culling of birds has been completed and people are being examined for symptoms. A detailed report will now be sent to the state government soon,” he said.The state animal husbandry commissioner said, “Following the provisions under section 36 of the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009, all the district collectors have been empowered to initiate measures of the containment plan to stop the spread of bird flu even if they suspect bird flu if the cause of death in birds in the respective districts.”This is being done to ensure the containment plan will be enforced without any delay and spread of avian influenza can be stopped. So far, the containment plan was allowed to be enforced in a district only after confirmation of a test report, he added.According to the guidelines issued by the central government, the local administration will have to cull poultry birds within 1-km radius of that particular poultry farm where bird deaths were found due to avian influenza or bird flu. A surveillance zone within a periphery of 10-km will have to be created, which means no birds will be allowed to sell or purchase in that area. The particular village, where that poultry farm is situated, will have to be declared as a prohibited area, which means no one can enter inside and no one can come out of it that include local villagers as a precaution. A medical team has to be set up for the examination of the local people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/481-more-birds-dead-in-maharashtra-count-soars-to-2395-101610566464384.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Election to two gram panchayats cancelled following allegations of post auctioning||The state election commission (SEC) has cancelled the process of election for two gram panchayats in north Maharashtra after the state machinery found substance in the reports of auctions for the post of village sarpanch and panchayat members. The election process for Umrane gram panchayat in Nashik and Khondamali gram panchayat in Nandurbar has been scrapped. Elections will be held for 14,234 gram panchayats on January 15.State election commissioner UPS Madan said that the elections to these gram panchayats have been cancelled after reports by the district collector, election observers, sub-divisional officers and the scrutiny of documents and audio clips have established that auctions had taken place for the posts of sarpanchs and members. “The commission, therefore, has decided to cancel the election process in these two village bodies. We have also directed district police authorities to initiate action against the people involved in it under section 171 (C) of the Indian Penal Code and submit a report. Police have already registered a complaint regarding the auctions,” said Madan.The commission had received several complaints after video and audio clips of the auctions in several villages went viral ahead of the filing of nominations for the posts of sarpanch and members. The commission said that such incidents are a violation of the code of conduct and fundamental principles of democracy, and hamper equal opportunity to all to contest the elections. Social activist Anna Hazare had criticised such incidents, calling them an “auction of democracy” and demanded the strictest action.Additionally, the SEC has allowed Covid-19 affected people, those in isolation centres and people with symptoms to vote in the gram panchayat elections in the concluding 30 minutes on January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-election-to-two-gram-panchayats-cancelled-following-allegations-of-post-auctioning-101610566344185.html

14-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai crosses 300,000-case mark with 675 new Covid-19 cases||Eleven months after the first Covid-19 case was reported in Mumbai, the total number of Covid-19 cases in the city crossed the 300,000 mark on Wednesday. The caseload in the city stood at 300,474 on Wednesday which included 675 new cases. The death toll rose to 11,212 with 12 deaths reported on Wednesday. Of the total cases, 280,853 have recovered and been discharged from hospitals and health centres so far, bringing the city’s recovery rate to 93%. Mumbai had reached the grim mark of 100,000 cases in July 2020, four months after the first case was reported on March 11. The cases sped up to 200,000 in September. Later, the trends changed to lower Covid-19 cases and deaths. The trend of the declining Covid curve has continued since mid-November and December despite the fear of a surge in cases due to the festival season around that time. Statistics released by the state health department show that December 2020 recorded a drop of 60% and 84% as compared to the number of total Covid-19 cases in November and September, respectively. Compared to May last year, December’s caseload dropped by around 70%.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “Even though we are in a better situation than what we were in May and September, strict masking and social distancing needs to be continued. Whatever we could achieve so far is because of relentless efforts of our civic staff. We have to follow Covid protocols for a bit longer. We now want to focus on vaccination and ensure that we scale up our vaccine centres for a smooth implementation.”A strict lockdown was imposed in March and the number of cases had peaked in June. Areas such as Worli and Dharavi were prime hot spots where hundreds of cases were being reported on a daily basis. The cases saw a decline in July and August, but later in September, there was a sudden surge which has been attributed to the festive season in August and lifting restrictions on public movement. By mid-November, there was a sharp decline in daily cases and active Covid cases in the city.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), active cases in Mumbai have been below 10,000 since December 15. Officials have cited this as a good sign for the city. The case fatality rate (CFR) for Covid-19 has also dropped over the month from 9.5% in March 2020 to between 2.1% and 2.5% in September and December 2020.The civic body also scaled up Covid testing exponentially even when the positivity rate declined. From 4,000-5,000 daily tests in May, BMC took the number up to 15,000 tests a day. While positivity rate had once peaked at 35-40% in May, it has now come down to 11.88% as of Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crosses-300-000-case-mark-with-675-new-covid-19-cases-101610566104188.html
14-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP demands removal of Dhananjay Munde; NCP says let probe be completed||Following allegations of rape, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded sacking of the social justice minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Dhananjay Munde. State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said they are expecting Munde’s resignation, if not, then the NCP chief Sharad Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should remove him from the ministerial council. He also said that the party will hit the streets if Munde was not removed.Munde has found himself in the centre of a controversy after a woman accused him of rape on the pretext of marriage and other favours. The woman alleged that the police are not accepting her written complaint against the minister and her life is under threat. Munde, however, claimed that the woman is trying to defame and blackmail him.“I am sure he (Munde) will resign from the ministerial council on his own. If not, then the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) or the NCP chief (Sharad Pawar) should take his resignation,” Patil told reporters on Wednesday.“The allegations of rape by another woman are serious in nature and the (Munde) doesn’t deserve to be on this (ministerial) position,” he said in his statement.Patil further said Munde admitted to having a “second wife” and two children. Going by his confession, action should be initiated against him. It is also against the ethics of politics. This information was also not mentioned in his election affidavit.“We will wait for him to be sacked and if not, we will hit the streets demanding his removal from the ministerial position,” the state BJP chief said.Following allegations, Munde went to meet party supremo Sharad Pawar at his Mumbai residence ‘Silver Oak’ and briefed him in detail about the issue on Wednesday. He also met the deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal during the day.State NCP chief Jayant Patil said that concluding before the investigation would be unfair for Munde. “It is a family matter and the case is pending before the high court. Munde has also issued a detailed clarification. Let the investigation be completed and facts come before the people. It would be unfair to reach on to a conclusion without investigation,” Patil said.In a copy of a complaint uploaded on her Twitter handle, the woman mentioned that Munde made sexual advances towards her without her consent since 2006. “He (Munde) had promised to get me launched as a singer in Bollywood,” the complaint states.Following the post, Munde issued a public clarification on his social media account and said that the victim and her sister with whom he was in a relationship with, were blackmailing him since 2019. Her brother is also involved in the alleged conspiracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrabjp-demands-removal-of-dhananjay-munde-ncp-says-let-probe-be-completed-101610566044373.html

Currently, those working in essential and emergency sectors, cancer patients and differently-abled persons are allowed to travel on local trains through the day. From the third week of October, women commuters have been allowed to travel in specified hours. Earlier, there were talks of opening local trains for all during non-peak hours. The issue was discussed in the state cabinet meeting following which chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said they will deliberate with all the people concerned before taking any decision. State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said they were in favour of reopening local trains for general people and a decision will be taken in the next eight days. “The ministers are wary of the consequences of allowing lakhs of commuters to travel in suburban trains. They are of the view that permission would be like opening floodgates, which will result in a spike in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai. This is the reason the government is extra cautious,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity. “The hearing on the matter in the Bombay high court is yet to be completed. The state government is also in favour of allowing all commuters to travel on suburban trains. The cabinet has discussed the issue and a decision will be taken in the next eight days,” Wadettiwar said. After its initial shutdown in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the suburban train services have been partially resumed, allowing only essential workers and some sections of people to travel in them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trains-for-all-maharashtra-government-yet-to-take-a-call-wary-of-spike-in-covid-cases-101610565864846.html

The civic body received 6,000 vaccine doses on Wednesday evening, while it has prepared a list of 5,143 beneficiaries. “When the vehicle carrying the vaccine arrived at the hospital, all the staffers were happy and clapped their hands welcoming the vaccine,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.The centres, which are now prepared for the drive, include Rukmini Bai hospital in Kalyan (West), Shastrinagar Hospital in Dombivli (West), hall of a Shaktidham building in Kalyan (East) and DNC private school in Dombivli (East). In the last week’s dry run, WHO representatives suggested to look for larger space. “The four places that have been finalised have a capacity of vaccinating 100 beneficiaries per day. We are ready with around 600 vaccinators who can be deployed at these centres,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commissioner. KDMC has a list of 5,200 beneficiaries in phase one which includes health workers from both civic and private hospitals and health centres. The civic body claimed to have a capacity of storing vaccines for up to a population of 200,000. “We are setting up all the four centres and I will conduct an inspection for the same. These centres are big and we have planned well for the vaccination process to go smoothly,” said Panpatil. The vaccine will initially be stored at Rukminibai Civic Hospital and later distributed to the other two centres. The civic body has also prepared an in-patient department (IPD) at its Savlaram Sports Complex in Dombivli for those who suffer from side-effects or reactions after the vaccination. Such beneficiaries can get themselves admitted in this facility, said Suryavanshi. All the centres will have medicines in case of any side effects are reported on the spot. If a beneficiary is severe he will be sent to the IPD. The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Kalyan has also pitched in its help to the civic body by sending expert doctors at the centres. “Our doctors will be at the centres in case of any ill-effects are reported.

14-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Anti-polio drive deferred, but no need to worry, say doctors||Health workers were relieved on Wednesday as the Union health ministry deferred the National Pulse Polio vaccination drive indefinitely in view of the upcoming large-scale Covid-19 vaccination drive. Polio or poliomyelitis is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus which spreads from person to person and can infect a person’s spinal cord, causing paralysis. Though doctors assured that the decision will not lead to resurgence of polio, a section of medical experts warned that further gaps in polio immunisation may diminish the herd immunity in society.The upcoming mass Covid-19 immunisation programme was clashing with the anti-polio drive which would have put additional pressure on already overworked health workers. Taking note of this, a decision to defer the polio vaccination was taken, providing some breathing space to health workers. “From Saturday, around 130,000 healthcare workers will start Covid-19 vaccination. Along with this, managing polio vaccination would have been troublesome and would have led to improper and incomplete door-to-door immunisation,” said an officer from BMC’s immunisation programme. “So, it’s better to wait rather than doing shoddy work,” he added.Even last year, the programme got affected due to the outbreak of the pandemic. “When the pandemic started, a large number of migrants returned home and there were restrictions on movement of people. As a result, many children missed their polio doses,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of Mumbai civic body.While skipping polio dose is likely to raise concern among parents about the safety of their infants, doctors said the vaccine given in the polio programme is just an additional shot to maintain herd immunity in the society. “Presently, we are in the mop up phase of the polio disease after announcing the eradication in 2014...The door-to-door polio vaccination programme is deferred due to the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive. But the resurgence of polio is extremely unlikely as a reasonable amount of children may have already gained herd immunity,” said Dr Hemalata Arora, senior consultant, internal medicine and infectious diseases, Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, Vile Parle.Dr Bela Verma, head of the department of paediatric medicine at Sir JJ Hospital, said that every child till the age of five years is given five doses of polio vaccine. The dose given during the immunisation programme is an additional one to maintain herd immunity in the society. “This is one dose is given as an extra other than the routine immunisation. So it will not have any impact if children miss this,” she added.Doctors also said that the primary concern should be Covid-19 vaccination. “This is the time to prioritise the immediate impacts. Covid-19 has put the world at a standstill. We need to focus on it first as we already have polio under control. With the completion of the Covid-19 vaccination, the government will start with polio immunisation,” said Dr Paras Kothari, head of the paediatric surgery department at Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion hospital.However, doctors also warn that any further delays might wear off the herd immunity which has been attained after years of hard work. “Reinstating the programme (polio vaccination) is of utmost importance as the herd immunity levels may diminish if the polio vaccine remains unavailable for a long duration,” said Arora.Dr Verma also said that during the ongoing pandemic, all forms of immunisation have been badly affected due to the lockdown. “Finally, with the relaxation of lockdown, we have started getting children for immunisation and after months, things are getting back on track,” she added.Every year, during National Immunisation Day (NID) commonly known as Pulse Polio Immunisation programme which was scheduled for January 17, vaccinators immunise children between the age group of 0 and 5 years in their door-to-door survey. Mumbai civic body vaccinates around 800,000 children during the five days of the national immunisation programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiantipolio-drive-deferred-but-no-need-to-worry-say-doctors-101610564546119.html

They also quizzed the school in-charge and girl’s parents. They remained in the school for over six hours to record the statements. Sources said that all the teachers, in a written statement, have stated that the girl was a bright student and had scored above 80% in the Class-12 December exams.The two classmates, whose statements were recorded, told the inquiry officers that the girl had attended the school for the first time after lockdown on Monday. Both said that after the classes ended at 3pm, the girl had told them that her parents were to pick her up and that she would wait for them in the school. In closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of the school, the girl was seen coming out of the classroom at 3pm and entering the biology laboratory at 3.10pm. The footage also shows that the school’s watchman closed the door of the laboratory and locked a few classrooms at 3.45pm. The girl’s parents had also visited the school around 5.40pm and checked two rooms, but had not found her. They had later lodged a complaint with the police. As per the suicide note recovered by the police, the girl wanted to study further but her parents were planning to marry her off, which is why had resorted to the extreme step. She had, however, also written in the note that she did not blame anyone for her suicide.The parents have confirmed that the handwriting in the note was their daughter’s. The parents, in their statement, also stated that their daughter had never complained about any teacher. District education officer, elementary-cum-secondary, Rajinder Kaur, said, “The inquiry team members have recorded the statements and I will be able to comment only after receiving their report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/suicide-in-ludhiana-school-probe-team-records-statements-of-victim-s-teachers-friends-101610560825121.html

Kumar, in his complaint, stated that the spat took place over a minor issue. Lucky had allegedly walked up to Kumar and started abusing him for ‘staring’ at him. “I told Lucky that there must have been some misunderstanding as I was not staring at him. But Lucky started abusing me, prompting the other inmates to intervene. After some time, Lucky came back with a kitchen knife and stabbed me in the stomach,” said Kumar in his statement. A case under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the accused at Division Number 7 police station. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Paramjit Singh, who is investigating the case, said the victim has not suffered serious injuries and that the accused will be brought for questioning on production warrant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-drug-convict-stabs-fellow-inmate-for-staring-at-him-101610560823946.html
14-01-2021||World||US commission says China possibly committed 'genocide' against Xinjiang Muslims||China has possibly committed "genocide" in its treatment of Uighurs and other minority Muslims in its western region of Xinjiang, a bipartisan commission of the US Congress said in a report released on Thursday.The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) said new evidence had emerged in the past year that "crimes against humanity - and possibly genocide - are occurring." The CECC also accused China of harassing Uighurs in the United States.China has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in Xinjiang that it describes as "vocational training centers" to stamp out extremism and give people new skills and which others have called concentration camps.The United Nations says at least 1 million Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang. Faith leaders, activist groups and others have said crimes against humanity, including genocide, are taking place there. Beijing denies abuse accusations.The CECC report called for a formal US "determination on whether atrocities are being committed" in Xinjiang, and such a determination is required within 90 days of US legislation passed on Dec. 27.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his final days in office before President-elect Joe Biden succeeds President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, has already been weighing a determination, although given current turmoil in Washington, officials have played down the possibility of an announcement before that.CECC co-chair, Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, called China's actions to crush human rights in the past year "shocking and unprecedented" and urged Congress and the incoming Biden administration to hold Beijing accountable."The United States must continue to stand with the people of China in their struggle and lead the world in a united and coordinated response to the human rights abuses of the Chinese government," he said.Relations between the world's two biggest economic powerhouses have plunged to the lowest level in recent years over disagreements on issues including human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, espionage and a sweeping national security law imposed on Hong Kong.Experts say a genocide determination would be an enormous embarrassment for China, the world's second-largest economy and a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.It could also pose problems for Biden by complicating his dealings with Beijing, although his campaign had already declared, before the November election, that genocide was occurring in Xinjiang.In October, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said Beijing was perpetrating "something close to" genocide in Xinjiang and other officials have referred to concentration camps there.Under international law, crimes against humanity are defined as widespread and systematic, whereas the burden of proof for genocide - the intent to destroy part of a population - can be more difficult to prove.Expectations that Pompeo might declare genocide were raised in June when he labeled as "shocking" and "disturbing" reports that China was using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against Muslims.He was referring to a report last year about the situation in Xinjiang by German researcher Adrian Zenz, which the CECC report also cited.Zenz said his findings represented the strongest evidence yet that Beijing's Xinjiang policies met one of the criteria cited in the U.N. genocide convention, namely "imposing measures intended to prevent births within the (targeted) group."A US genocide declaration would mean that countries would have to think hard about allowing companies to do business with Xinjiang, a leading global supplier of cotton. It would also raise pressure for further US sanctions against China.On Wednesday, US Customs and Border Protection said the United States was imposing a region-wide ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations that they are made with forced labor by detained Uighurs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-commission-says-china-possibly-committed-genocide-against-xinjiang-muslims-101610645950914.html
14-01-2021||World||NATO chief calls for justice over US Capitol mob siege||The head of NATO said Thursday that all those responsible for last week’s deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol should be held accountable, and he expressed confidence that American institutions are up to the job.“Democracy must always prevail over violence, and I’m confident that the democratic institutions of the United States will handle this challenge,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.The storming of the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying President-elect Joe Biden's election victory resulted in the deaths of 5 people. In impeaching President Donald Trump Wednesday for inciting the mob that broke into the building, several U.S. lawmakers insisted that Trump posed a “clear and present danger.”Stoltenberg, a former prime minister of Norway, said that what happened in Washington last week is “absolutely unacceptable.” He said it “was shocking, and the outcome of the election has to be respected and we have to make sure that our democratic values are fully respected.”The United States is by far the biggest and most influential member of NATO, but Trump has surprised and routinely confounded many allies by berating them over defense spending or taking unilateral actions such as pulling U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and northern Syria.Stoltenberg did not mention Trump by name, focusing instead on the incoming administration.“I look forward to a peaceful transition, and I look forward to working with Joe Biden,” Stoltenberg said, adding that the president-elect “is strongly committed to our trans-Atlantic cooperation, to NATO, and I know that he also of course strongly supports the idea of further strengthening the cooperation between North America and Europe.”Hundreds of National Guard members are camped out at the Capitol to protect lawmakers, some still reeling from the violence and preparing for Biden's inauguration next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-chief-calls-for-justice-over-us-capitol-mob-siege-101610645347656.html

Harrison previously ran for national party chairman in 2017, but ultimately dropped out and endorsed current head Tom Perez.With a narrow margin in the House and a tied Senate, Democrats are planning for a tough fight in the 2022 midterm elections.

They also measure floors climbed, heart rate, and how long and how well people sleep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-closes-deal-to-buy-fitbit-as-justice-dept-probe-continues-101610642733688.html
14-01-2021||World||Ex-presidential candidate Andrew Yang joins NYC mayoral race||Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang officially entered the race for mayor of New York City on Thursday, joining a crowded Democratic primary field that includes longtime elected officials and veterans of the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is barred by the city charter from seeking a third term.“It is here in New York City that my passion for uplifting people, for wanting to move our country forward, got started,” Yang said at a campaign launch that was streamed on YouTube because of the coronavirus pandemic. “And now that we are facing this historic crisis I am aiming to unleash and channel that energy for a human-centered economy right here in New York, my home!"Yang’s proposal for a universal basic income won him a national following during the 2020 Democratic primary campaign before he dropped out of the race in February. He brings high name recognition to the mayoral race but has no record of involvement in local politics.More than two dozen people have filed with the city's Campaign Finance Board to run in the June 22 Democratic mayoral primary, which for the first time in city history will be determined by ranked choice voting, a system that lets voters rank candidates in order of preference.The contenders include City Comptroller Scott Stringer, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, banker Ray McGuire, former city sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia and former U.S. housing secretary Shaun Donovan.Yang has lived in New York City since attending law school at Columbia University in the 1990s but has spent much of the coronavirus pandemic at his family’s weekend home about 85 miles (136 kilometers) north of the city in New Paltz, New York.Critics pounced when Yang explained his absence from the city by asking a New York Times reporter, “Can you imagine trying to have two kids on virtual school in a two-bedroom apartment, and then trying to do work yourself?” Fellow mayoral candidate Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, tweeted: “I spent all of 2020 in NYC, living with THREE generations under one roof, AND running a campaign from home.”Wherever the candidates are physically located, the mayoral campaign has so far been conducted largely via Zoom and other online platforms because of the pandemic.The winner of the Democratic primary will be the strong favorite in the November general election because Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city by a wide margin. Republicans who have said they are considering running include Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expresidential-candidate-andrew-yang-joins-nyc-mayoral-race-101610644332806.html
14-01-2021||World||American capital turns into a fortress ahead of Biden’s inauguration||Four times more US troops than the combined deployment in Afghanistan and Iraq would be stationed in Washington, DC around the time of the inauguration of Joe Biden as US president on January 20. The build-up to the big day has already started. National Guard troops have secured the US capital, where Biden will be sworn in the 46th American president. The US Capitol building was teeming with National Guard troops on Wednesday as the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time.“I think you can expect to see somewhere, upwards beyond 20,000 members of the National Guard that will be here in the footprint of the District of Columbia,” DC Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said.The defence department has said there will actually be 21,000 of them, which is more than four times the number of troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Military Times has reported that 2,500 troops are scheduled to be left in Afghanistan and Iraq each by January 15 because of a drawdown, as announced by acting defence secretary Chris Miller last November.Washington DC is on heightened security alert with warnings from the FBI and other security agencies of armed protests being planned at the Capitol and capitols in all 50 states in the days leading up to Biden’s inauguration.Senior officials of the FBI and the US Secret Service briefed Biden and key members of his national security team on the security arrangement on Wednesday, said the transition team. They will be getting daily briefings on the “security and operational preparations”.A mob incited by President Trump had stormed the US Capitol on January 6 to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory. They had overrun the building complex, temporarily breaking up the session, forced Vice-President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification process, and lawmakers to be removed to secure locations. Five people, including a Capitol police officer, were killed in the riots that lasted hours. President Trump, who was impeached on Wednesday for inciting that attack, issued an appeal for peace and calm in a video message and a statement. “In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind. That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers,” he said in the written statement. In the video message, the outgoing president went further, and delivered a more forceful denunciation of the January 6 attack — calling it a “calamity at the Capitol”.Trump also went on to complain about the “unprecedented assault on free speech”, framing in general terms his accounts being shut down by social media platforms. “These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong, and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another. Not to silence one another.”Twitter, Facebook, Google, Instagram and a whole range of social media companies have shut down Trump’s accounts and those of some of his enablers and right-wing figures and entities in the days since the January 6 attack.Jack Dorsey, the Twitter founder and CEO, explained himself in a string of tweets on Wednesday. “I do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here. After a clear warning we’d take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter. Was this correct?”He added that he believes it was the right decision for Twitter because it “faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-capital-turns-into-a-fortress-ahead-of-biden-s-inauguration-101610644532606.html
14-01-2021||World||Brazil sends aircraft to collect vaccines, 'too early' for exports, says India||Brazil appears to have jumped the gun by officially announcing the despatch of an aircraft to transport two million doses of Covid-19 vaccine from India, with New Delhi making it clear on Thursday that decisions on supplies to foreign countries will take more time.A statement issued by Brazil’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said an Airbus A330neo aircraft of Azul Airlines equipped with special containers was set to fly back from Mumbai with two million doses of vaccine from Serum Institute of India and reach the country on January 16.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that any supplies contracted for by foreign countries, including Brazil, would be provided by India in due course though a timeframe for this is yet to be finalised.“India stands by its commitment to help the world and all countries will get the vaccines,” one of the people cited above said.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s office announced on January 8 that he had written a letter to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to expedite a shipment of two million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. Bolsonaro is facing pressure to rollout the vaccine from political rivals, including some who have shown a preference for the Chinese vaccine.Also Watch | Stage set for Covid vaccination drive in India: All you need to know“To [ensure] the immediate implementation of the Brazilian National Programme of Immunisation, I would highly appreciate your good offices in expediting the shipment of two million doses of the vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India to Brazil urgently, but as long as it does not impact the Indian vaccination programme,” Bolsonaro wrote in the letter in Portuguese.The Brazilian foreign ministry’s statement, also in Portuguese, said the health ministry had “purchased” the doses from the Serum Institute of India and that the Brazilian embassy had “made arrangements with the Indian authorities and the Serum Institute of India, following the letter from President Jair Bolsonaro to Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.The statement also spoke of plans to distribute the vaccines to Brazil’s states within five days after endorsement by the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) to start immunisation across the country, simultaneously and free of charge. It also described the “successful acquisition of doses” from India as a demonstration of the “excellent” Brazil-India relations.Asked about the matter during a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said it was too early to discuss vaccine exports as India’s immunisation programme is set to be rolled out on Saturday.“You would recall that the prime minister had already stated that India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used for the benefit of all humanity in fighting this crisis,” Srivastava said.“As you would know, the vaccination process is just starting in India. It is too early to give a specific response on the supplies to other countries as we are still assessing production schedules and delivery. We will take decisions in this regard in due course, this may take some time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-sends-aircraft-to-collect-vaccines-too-early-for-exports-says-india-101610643849088.html
14-01-2021||World||Drug dealer faces execution for 7 gang killings in Virginia||It was one of the worst bursts of gang violence Richmond had ever seen. At least 11 people were killed in a 45-day period in 1992, all at the hands of gang members who eliminated anyone they thought would get in the way of their growing crack cocaine business.Corey Johnson, who was sentenced to death in connection with seven of the slayings, was right in the thick of it as one of the leaders of the Newtowne gang. He and two other members were sentenced to death under a federal law that targets large-scale drug traffickers.Johnson, now 52, is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. ET Thursday at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., had halted the execution and Friday's scheduled execution of Dustin Higgs because both men tested positive last month for Covid-19, but a federal appeals court late Wednesday lifted the injunction. Additional appeals in the case are likely, though government lawyers have been successful in getting a green light from the U.S. Supreme Court to proceed even after lower courts put federal executions on hold.If the executions are delayed past this week they might not happen at all because President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office next Wednesday, opposes the federal death penalty and has said he'll work to end its use.Lawyers for both inmates argue that lung damage from the coronavirus makes it more likely they'll suffer excruciating pain from a lethal injection of pentobarbital. Johnson's lawyers also argue he is intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible to be put to death, under both federal law and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.In their clemency petition, Johnson's lawyers asked Trump to commute his death sentence to life in prison. They described a traumatic childhood when he was physically abused by his drug-addicted mother and her boyfriends, abandoned at age 13, then shuffled between residential and institutional facilities until he aged out of the foster care system. They cite numerous childhood IQ tests discovered after he was sentenced that place him in the mentally disabled category and say testing during his time in prison shows he can read and write at only an elementary school level.“Allowing Corey to be executed would be a grave miscarriage of justice,” said Don Salzman, one of Johnson's attorneys.Government filings have spelled Johnson's name ‘Cory,' but his lawyers say he spells it ‘Corey.'Richard Benedict, who was Johnson's special education teacher at a New York school for emotionally troubled kids, said Johnson was hyperactive, anxious and reading and writing at a second- or third-grade level when he was 16 and 17.“I had to have someone walk him to the bathroom because he just couldn't get back to the classroom," Benedict said.Prosecutors, however, say Johnson has not shown that he is mentally disabled.“While rejecting that he has intellectual disabilities that preclude his death sentences, courts have repeatedly and correctly concluded that Johnson’s seven murders were planned to advance his drug trafficking and were not impulsive acts by someone incapable of capable making calculated judgments, and are therefore eligible for the death penalty," prosecutors argue in court documents.A defense psychologist testified during the trial that Johnson’s IQ was measured at 77, above the threshold score of 75 then needed to label someone as intellectually disabled. Johnson's appellate lawyers say that psychologist was not an expert in intellectual disability and relied on standards that are now outdated.C.T. Woody Jr., the lead homicide detective on the case, said that during his interrogations of Johnson, he denied any involvement in the killings and said police were trying to frame him because of lies people were telling about him.“It did not seem to me that he had any kind of mental problems at all except his viciousness and no respect for human life — none whatsoever,” Woody said.Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Vick Jr., one of the prosecutors in the case, said the violence committed by Johnson and his fellow gang members was unmatched at the time. One of the gang's victims was stabbed 85 times and another was shot 16 times. Johnson was convicted of being the shooter in a triple slaying, and participating in four other capital murders, including shooting a rival drug dealer 15 times.“The heinousness of the crimes, the utter senselessness of the crimes, the crimes themselves warranted the seeking of the death penalty this case,” Vick said.In his clemency petition, Johnson's lawyers said he has repeatedly expressed “sincere remorse” for his crimes.“I’m sorry for the great number of people who are dead, you know, and there is a lot on us, and I feel we are no angels,” he said during his sentencing hearing. He also spoke to a group of students present in the courtroom that day and urged them not to commit crimes or make the mistakes he had made in his life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-dealer-faces-execution-for-7-gang-killings-in-virginia-101610643938099.html
14-01-2021||World||IAEA highlights another Iranian breach of nuclear deal||The United Nations' atomic watchdog agency confirmed Thursday that Iran has informed it the country has begun installing equipment for the production of uranium metal, which would be another violation of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers.Iran maintains its plans to conduct research and development on uranium metal production are part of its “declared aim to design an improved type of fuel,” the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said.Uranium metal can also be used for a nuclear bomb, however, and research on its production is specifically prohibited under the nuclear deal — the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — that Tehran signed with Germany, France, Britain, China, Russia and the United States in 2015.Since the unilateral American withdrawal from the deal in 2018, the other members have been working to try and preserve the accord, and Germany slammed the new Iranian move as a “completely wrong signal and not likely to build trust.”The Foreign Ministry told The Associated Press that as the other members are committed to the deal and the “future American government has also expressed its willingness to return" to it, Iran “must not continue to undermine the core provisions" of the accord.“It is long overdue for Iran to return to full compliance with its commitments,” the ministry said.The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something Iran insists it does not want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.On Sunday, IAEA inspectors visited the Isfahan plant where Iran has said it plans to conduct the research, and officials were informed by Tehran on Wednesday that “modification and installation of the relevant equipment for the mentioned R&D activities have been already started," the agency said.Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, repeated that in a tweet on Wednesday, adding that “natural uranium will be used to produce uranium metal in the first stage.”He told Iran's official news agency IRNA that the move will elevate Iran to the level of “progressive nations in production of new fuels.”Although uranium metal in theory can be geared toward generating electricity, experiments with metal alloys are prohibited under the nuclear deal because uranium metal is a key material in the making of nuclear weapons. The process involves converting high-enriched uranium gas into metal that provides the cladding, or outer covering, for the fuel rods that power a nuclear reaction.“Iran had not previously experimented with this step in the process, but in order to make a bomb, you would have to,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, based in Washington.It was the latest in a string of violations of the nuclear deal that Iran has undertaken since President Donald Trump pulled the United States out in 2018, saying it needed to be re-negotiated.Tehran has been using the violations to put pressure on the other signatories to provide more incentives to Iran to offset crippling American sanctions re-imposed after the American pullout. President-elect Joe Biden, who was vice president when the deal was signed during the Obama administration, has said he hopes to return the US to the deal.The timing of the uranium metal announcement, Kimball said, left little doubt about Iran’s intentions.“They know there’s someone named Biden who’s going to be in the White House next week and they want him to act as soon as possible to waive nuclear-related sanctions,” he added. “They are looking for ways to underscore that their patience has run out.”Britain, France and Germany said last week that Iran “risks compromising” chances of diplomacy with Washington after Tehran announced another violation — that it was starting to enrich uranium to 20% purity, a technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.The foreign ministers of the three European nations said in a joint statement then that the Iranian activity “has no credible civil justification.” They said the enrichment was a clear violation of the deal and “further hollows out the agreement.”Those working to save the deal also note that despite the violations, Iran continues to allow inspectors to access all sites in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iaea-highlights-another-iranian-breach-of-nuclear-deal-101610644048620.html
14-01-2021||World||Palm Oil producers say anti-palm oil campaigns hinder sustainability shift||Top palm oil producers said on Thursday that the industry is making strides towards transparency and sustainability across its supply chain despite campaigns against use of the oil.Campaigners say that the industry is responsible for deforestation of tropical rainforests and human rights abuses and have initiated consumer boycotts of palm oil, which is found in everything from pizza to lipsticks.However, such campaigns are hindering the industry's efforts to achieve sustainability certification and develop a market for certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO), top palm oil producers said during the Reuters Next conference.The panelists said sales of more expensive sustainable palm oil, certified by bodies including the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), are still lacking."The supply of CSPO outstrips demand by a factor of two ... Even if you are certified, it does not necessarily mean you're able to get that to the market," Mohd Haris Mohd Arshad, Managing Director at Sime Darby Oils said.Sime Darby Plantation is the world's largest palm oil company by land size and the largest producer of CSPO.Indonesia and Malaysia, which together account for 85% of global output, in particular have come under fire for clearing biodiversity-rich rainforests and allegations of forced labour.The United States last year banned imports of palm oil from Malaysian producers Sime and FGV Holdings over allegations of forced labour during production.Mohd Haris said on Tuesday in a radio interview that there was not a systemic problem and Sime has asked the NGO involved and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for more information on the allegations."The palm industry is a very large industry so ... yes, you can have a few bad apples but does it mean that it is a systemic issue and the systems are not in place?" Olivier Tichit, Director of Sustainable Supply Chain at Musim Mas, said."The issue is how do we regain the trust we seemed to have lost?" said Tichit, adding that the industry has a high level of transparency compared to other commodities.To boost their green credentials, both Malaysia and Indonesia have implemented national sustainability standards, but NGOs say these are not stringent enough."We can't afford for people to continue undermining efforts to get certification, because for everything that we do it seems like it is one-step forward and two-steps back. It will disincentivize others (to) get on board," Mohd Haris said.The palm oil industry has been linked to forest fires in Indonesia where in 2019 at least 1.6 million hectares of forest and other land were burned and losses were estimated at $5.2 billion as a choking haze blanketed the region.Greenpeace said in October that nearly a third of Indonesia forest fires are in pulp and palm areas.Ravi Muthayah, Secretary-General of Malaysia's Plantation & Commodities Ministry called for greater recognition of industry efforts instead of being singled out for driving deforestation."It's better than not having any sustainability standards and causing further damage, no matter what crop you're in."For more coverage from the Reuters Next conference please click here or http://www.reuters.com/business/reuters-nextTo watch Reuters Next live, visit https://www.reutersevents.com/events/next/register.php(Reporting by Mei Mei Chu; Editing by Alexander Smith)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palm-oil-producers-say-anti-palm-oil-campaigns-hinder-sustainability-shift-101610643466693.html
14-01-2021||World||Jacob Blake says he was ready to surrender before being shot||A Black man who was shot in the back by a white police officer in Wisconsin, triggering several nights of violent protests over the summer and leaving him partially paralyzed, said in an interview broadcast Thursday that he was prepared to surrender just before the officer opened fire.Jacob Blake, 29, said an interview with ABC's “Good Morning America” that during a struggle with Kenosha police who were trying to arrest him Aug. 23 on an outstanding warrant his pocketknife fell from his pants. He said he picked it up before heading to a vehicle to drive away with two of his children in the backseat.“I'm not really worried. I'm walking away from them, so it's not like they were going to shoot me,” Blake said.Blake said that he was prepared to surrender once he put the knife in the vehicle.“Throw myself to the ground and you know, put my arms behind my back because if they did it there and they killed me there, everybody would see it,” he said.Officer Rusten Sheskey told investigators that he feared that Blake was going to stab him, so he opened fire. Blake family attorney Ben Crump, however, has questioned whether Blake threatened Sheskey with a knife, saying “nowhere does the video footage show a knife extended and aimed to establish the requisite intent.”Kenosha erupted with violent protests for several nights after Blake was shot. Hundreds were arrested, and multiple businesses were destroyed. A Wisconsin prosecutor on Jan. 5 declined to file charges against Sheskey, concluding he couldn’t disprove the officer’s contention that he acted in self-defense.In the “Good Morning America” interview, Blake, who was shot seven times, said he shouldn't have grabbed his knife. He said he “wasn’t thinking clearly.” He said he couldn't hear officers' orders to comply before he was shot.“I was counting down my breaths, my blinks and I was like 'God I’m coming. I guess this is it for me,” he said.He said his thoughts turned to his sons in the backseat.“'Daddy loves you no matter what,'” Blake said he told them. "I thought it was going to be the last thing I say to them.”During one night of unrest following the shooting, prosecutors say a white 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, shot and killed two men and wounded a third, claiming the shootings were in self-defense. This week, prosecutors in Wisconsin asked a judge to order Kyle Rittenhouse, who now is 18 and free on $2 million bond, to stay out of bars and away from white supremacist groups.The request comes a week after Rittenhouse was seen drinking at a bar in the southeastern Wisconsin city of Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Milwaukee, after he pleaded not guilty to homicide and other charges resulting from the Aug. 25 shooting in Kenosha.The Associated Press left a message seeking comment Thursday with Rittenhouse’s defense lawyer Mark Richards.After his Jan. 5 arraignment, Rittenhouse, his mother and several other adults went to Pudgy's Pub, where he was seen drinking beer, according to prosecutors. Although the drinking age is 21, Rittenhouse could legally drink alcohol in Wisconsin because he was with his mother.The prosecutors' motion states that Rittenhouse posed outside the bar for a photo with two men as they all gestured an “OK” sign with their hands, which has become a symbol used by white supremacists.The motion also said five men at the tavern serenaded Rittenhouse with the song “Proud of Your Boy," which has become the anthem of the Proud Boys, a white supremacist group whose members have been identified as being involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.“The defendant’s continued association with members of a group that prides itself on violence, and the use of their symbols, raises the significant possibility of future harm. Further, this association may serve to intimidate potential witnesses,” the motion reads.A hearing on the prosecutors’ request has not yet been scheduled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacob-blake-says-he-was-ready-to-surrender-before-being-shot-101610642381011.html
14-01-2021||World||Ex-Michigan health chief charged with manslaughter in Flint||Michigan’s former health director was charged Thursday with involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of nine people who got Legionnaires’ disease during the Flint water crisis as prosecutors revisit how the city’s water system was contaminated with lead and bacteria during one of worst human-made environmental disasters in U.S. history.Nick Lyon pleaded not guilty during an appearance in a Genesee County court. Moments later, his old boss, former Gov. Rick Snyder, also pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges of willful neglect of duty in Flint.They were among several people summoned to court to face charges, the result of a renewed 19-month investigation launched by the attorney general's office after Dana Nessel, a Democrat, was elected.The charges against Snyder carry up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine upon conviction. No governor or former governor in Michigan’s 184-year history had been charged with crimes related to their time in that office, according to the state archivist.Wearing a mask, Snyder, 62, said little during the brief hearing, which was conducted by video. He replied, “Yes, your honor,” when asked if he was living in Michigan.“We believe there is no evidence to support any criminal charges against Gov. Snyder,” defense attorney Brian Lennon told reporters Wednesday night.Snyder, a Republican, was governor from 2011 through 2018. The former computer executive pitched himself as a problem-solving “nerd” who eschewed partisan politics and favored online dashboards to show performance in government. Flint turned out to be the worst chapter of his two terms due to a series of catastrophic decisions that will affect residents for years.The date of Snyder's alleged crimes in Flint is listed as April 25, 2014, when a Snyder-appointed emergency manager, Darnell Earley, who was running the struggling, majority Black city carried out a money-saving decision to use the Flint River for water while a pipeline from Lake Huron was under construction.The corrosive water, however, was not treated properly and released lead from old plumbing into homes.Despite desperate pleas from residents holding jugs of discolored, skunky water, the Snyder administration took no significant action until a doctor reported elevated lead levels in children about 18 months later.“I’m sorry and I will fix it,” Snyder promised during his 2016 State of the State speech.Prosecutors also charged Earley with two felony counts of misconduct in office Thursday. He pleaded not guilty.Authorities counted at least 90 cases of Legionnaires’ disease in Genesee County during the water switch, including 12 deaths. Some experts found there was not enough chlorine in Flint's water-treatment system to control legionella bacteria, which can trigger a severe form of pneumonia when spread through misting and cooling systems.It's the second time that Lyon has been charged with manslaughter, but the earlier case involved only two deaths. He was accused in 2017 of failing to timely warn the public about the outbreak, but that case was dropped by prosecutors when they decided to take a fresh look at evidence.An involuntary manslaughter conviction carries up to 15 years in prison and a $7,500 fine.Lead can damage the brain and nervous system and cause learning and behavior problems. Flint's woes were highlighted as an example of environmental injustice and racism.The criminal investigation has lasted five years under two teams of prosecutors. Todd Flood, who got misdemeanor convictions from seven people, was ousted in 2019 after the election of Nessel. Fadwa Hammoud subsequently dropped charges in eight pending cases and said the investigation would start over. She said the first team had failed to collect all available evidence.Separately, the state, Flint, a hospital and an engineering firm have agreed to a $641 million settlement with residents over the water crisis, with $600 million coming from Michigan. A judge said she hopes to decide by Jan. 21 whether to grant preliminary approval. Other lawsuits, including one against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, are pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exmichigan-health-chief-charged-with-manslaughter-in-flint-101610641578859.html
14-01-2021||World||US jobless claims jump by most since March, approach 1 million||Applications for US state unemployment benefits surged last week by the most since late March, pointing to persistent labor-market pain as coronavirus infections continue to soar and potentially adding to momentum for a larger federal stimulus plan.Initial jobless claims in regular state programs rose by 181,000 to 965,000 in the week ended Jan. 9, according to Labor Department data Thursday that showed a broad number of states with large increases. On an unadjusted basis, the figure jumped to 1.15 million.The scope of the increase caught many economists by surprise; most of the several dozen surveyed by Bloomberg projected the claims number would be little changed and not a single one of them had predicted so big a jump.The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 789,000 initial claims. The S&P 500 advanced in early trading along with the yield on the 10-year Treasury on prospects for more Covid-19 relief.Continuing claims in state programs -- an approximation of the number of people receiving ongoing benefits -- climbed by 199,000 to 5.27 million in the week ended Jan. 2.“The restrictions imposed to combat the third Covid wave clearly have done great damage, but it’s not obvious that the incremental hit is still increasing,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note. “Claims will drift sideways, more or less, over the next two to three months, before restrictions on the services sector can be gradually eased as vaccination brings herd immunity into sight.”Stimulus outlookJobless claims have exceeded 750,000 each week since virus cases started surging again late last year, underscoring the impact of infection fears and business restrictions on employment. Vaccine distribution should help restore economic activity in the coming months, but the first quarter could continue to bring labor market weakness until inoculations reach a critical mass.The recently approved $900 billion pandemic aid package should provide some relief for workers and businesses in the current quarter.Enhanced unemployment benefits passed in the December bill, combined with a $300 weekly top-up for regular state benefits, may have contributed to the latest increase in claims, said Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.“From a signaling perspective, once you see that maybe you think ‘it’s worth me filing because I can get an additional $X per week.’ There’s a positive effect there in terms of signaling, but I would not say it’s a revelation of additional laziness,” Daco said.President-elect Joe Biden is expected to release details Thursday of a proposed additional relief package that could further extend unemployment benefits and aid cities and states. Biden last week put the “entire package” at “trillions of dollars,” and many Democrats believe it will be as much as $2 trillion, while others expect the coronavirus-only portion will fall closer to the value of the last package.The initial filings far exceeded the worst days of the 2007-09 recession and may skew negotiators toward a bigger relief package.Other Details||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-jump-by-most-since-march-approach-1-million-101610641864255.html

In December, India had accused Pakistan’s security establishment of pressuring a Pakistani lawyer engaged by the Indian high commission to misrepresent New Delhi’s position on Kulbhushan Jadhav during a court hearing.Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan on charges of espionage, and sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court the following year. India has asserted he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018.India has maintained that Pakistan failed to respond to core issues related to the case, including unconditional consular access to Jadhav and the provision of legal documents which will be the basis of an effective review and reconsideration as ordered by the ICJ.The Pakistan foreign Office had claimed that ”by casting aspersions” on the Indian High Commission’s own legal counsel, the Indian government was “looking for an escape from the legal proceedings in the case.”A larger bench headed by IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah and comprising Justice Amir Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb heard the Pakistani law ministry’s plea regarding provision of counsel to Jadhav for the implementation of the ICJ decision.“Is the Indian government not serious in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav?” Justice Minallah inquired on Thursday. “The government should once again contact India and ask whether it wants to pursue the Kulbhushan case or not,” he added.Further hearing of the case was adjourned till February 3.Pakistan had earlier rejected as “incorrect” and “misleading” assertions by India regarding legal proceedings in the case of Jadhav.“The government of India is reminded that in pursuance of the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Pakistan had invited the Indian High Commission to meet with commander Jadhav and appoint a lawyer on his behalf so that proceedings to review and reconsider commander Jadhav’s conviction could commence,” the Pakistani foreign ministry had said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-slow-pedalling-on-kulbhushan-jadhav-pak-court-tells-govt-to-ask-india-if-it-s-serious-on-the-case-101610642192396.html
14-01-2021||World||Covid-19: German lockdown loopholes criticized as deaths hit new high||Germany has too many loopholes in its coronavirus lockdown rules, the head of the country's disease control agency said as figures published Thursday showed the highest number of daily deaths since the start of the pandemic.The Robert Koch Institute said 1,244 deaths from Covid-19 were confirmed in one day up to Thursday, taking the total number to 43,881. There were also 25,164 newly confirmed cases, putting Germany’s total known infections close to 2 million.Lothar Wieler, president of the institute, said data indicated people in Germany are traveling more than during the first phase of the pandemic in spring, contributing to the virus' spread.German authorities have imposed restrictions on social contacts, largely closed schools and limited travel for those in areas with high infection rates, but the rules aren't uniformly enforced across the country's 16 states.“To me, these measures we're now taking aren't a complete lockdown,” said Wieler. “There are still too many exceptions and they aren't being strictly implemented.”Officials are considering tougher restrictions to curb the continued rise in infections.The 7-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 23.36 per 100,000 people on Dec. 30 to 26.03 per 100,000 people on Jan. 13.Wieler pointed to the sharp spike in infections recently seen in Ireland as an example of how quickly the outbreak can escalate again if rules are relaxed, especially given the new seemingly more contagious variant of the virus circulating there and in neighboring Britain.All infections with the variants so far confirmed in Germany involved people who had traveled outside the country, said Wieler.“We need to be very careful, especially of the British mutation of this virus,” Ralph Brinkhaus, the parliamentary leader of Merkel’s bloc, told broadcaster n-tv. ”So we don't yet know what further measures will be necessary in coming weeks."To ease the strain on working families having to look after school-age children and discourage them from using emergency care facilities, parliament passed a bill Thursday doubling the amount of paid parental leave to 40 days for 2021. Public health insurances will pay out up to 112.88 euros ($137) a day to parents if they stay home to care for children under 12 who couldn't go to school because of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-german-lockdown-loopholes-criticized-as-deaths-hit-new-high-101610637759960.html
14-01-2021||World||Europe mulls vaccine certificate to boost crippled economy||A proposal to grant special privileges to those who have been vaccinated is gaining traction in Europe ahead of a crunch call of the region’s leaders, as a rise in coronavirus infections damps hopes of a swift exit from the economy-crippling lockdowns.Over a video conference on Jan. 21, European Union leaders will discuss the introduction of a “vaccination certificate” that would allow holders to travel freely, several diplomats familiar with the preparations of the virtual meeting said. The proposal enjoys growing support, one EU official said, while another diplomat cautioned that there’s pushback by other governments, and any limits to the freedom of movement on such grounds could be illegal.The proposal to introduce such a certificate gained momentum after Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis formally requested it with a letter to the chief of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, earlier this week. With inoculation campaigns moving at a snail’s pace, a decision to extend EU-wide privileges for vaccines that are not yet available to everyone in the bloc, due to limited supplies, may not come imminently.Still, countries desperate to at least partially restore travel could go it alone, since border control is a national competence, and EU coordination, while sought, isn’t compulsory. The commission, the EU’s executive arm in Brussels, said it’s deliberating with the bloc’s national capitals about the idea of vaccination certificates as part of efforts to keep internal borders open.New proposal“We are in active discussions with member states on recognition of vaccination certificates, just like we are working on the recognition of tests,” Stefan De Keersmaecker, the commission’s transport and health spokesman, said on Thursday. “This is an important issue for free movement in the EU.”The EU official said leaders are likely to ask the commission to come up with a proposal for a vaccination certificate during next week’s call. Leaders will also ask the executive for action to speed up vaccinations and boost production capacity.Vendors have started to roll out apps that can securely store health information such as test results, vaccination status or proof of having had Covid-19, and be used by airlines to speed transit based on policies that vary by country.The calls come as the EU is falling behind the US, the UK, and countries such as Israel and the United Arab Emirates in vaccinating its population. The delays mean that lockdowns will last longer, postponing the bloc’s recovery from the steepest recession in living memory.“We should explore all possible avenues to encourage private companies to scale up production of vaccines and deliveries to the member states,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a Jan. 13 letter to von der Leyen. Finnish premier Sanna Marin, in a Jan. 11 letter to the commission president, said, “there is an urgent need to increase production capacity of different vaccines and at the same time speed up the shipments to the member states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-mulls-vaccine-certificate-to-boost-crippled-economy-101610639830056.html
14-01-2021||World||'Security concerns' push UAE to suspend issuance of visit visas to Pakistan||The suspension of visas by the United Arab Emirates to the citizens of Pakistan and 12 other countries was the outcome of alerts about possible attacks on growing numbers of Israeli citizens flocking to the emirates, people familiar with developments said on Thursday.The people, both in New Delhi and other capitals, said on condition of anonymity that the visa suspension, which remains in effect since it was introduced on November 18, was aimed at giving time to UAE authorities to streamline and bolster their procedures to more effectively screen applicants from these countries.Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who has been facing growing domestic pressure over the suspension of visas and detention of Pakistani nationals in the UAE, raised the matter during his visit to the UAE in December. A statement issued by UAE’s foreign ministry had then said the restrictions on visas were temporary in nature and due to the Covid-19 outbreak.However, three different people said the move followed specific alerts about possible attacks on Israeli citizens, who have been travelling in large numbers to the UAE since the two countries normalised their ties in August.“The foreign ministry’s statement appears to have been aimed at assuaging the Pakistani sentiments. There were alerts about possible attacks and time was needed to put in place measures to better screen visa applicants from certain countries,” said one person.In a report on November 25, Reuters had cited a source as saying that issuance of visas to citizens of Pakistan and the other countries had been stopped over “security concerns”.In the case of Pakistan, the focus apparently will be on screening visa applications from residents of the country’s so-called tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, a region where the Taliban and several other terror groups are active, and areas in Balochistan bordering Iran.Some alerts had specifically referred to the possible infiltration of Pakistan’s Shias, the people said.There have been reports since November in Iran’s state-run media about the detention of Pakistani Shias in the UAE. In a report on November 17, state-run Tehran Times sought to blame the detention of Pakistani Shias on the improved UAE-Israel ties. A Pakistani Shia lawmaker also recently raised the matter in a letter sent to the Foreign Office in Islamabad, the people said.“It has been repeatedly pointed out the visa suspension is temporary and the aim is to improve the screening of applications,” a second person said.Since the signing of the UAE-Israel peace deal, more than 50,000 Israelis have visited the Emirates, primarily for holidays. There are now about 15 daily flights from Tel Aviv to Dubai and Jewish community centre in Dubai is now a hub of activity.Zikrur Rahman, a former envoy to Palestine who also did several stints in Saudi Arabia and closely tracks developments in West Asia, noted there seemed to be no blanket ban on Pakistanis who are either living or working in the UAE or those who hold iqamas or residence permits.“There definitely are fissures on issuance of new visas, in particular visit and tourist visas to Pakistanis. This could be due to the fear of any possible attempt by radical Pakistani elements, particularly those with extremist mindset living in Pakistan’s porous border areas with Afghanistan and Iran, to infiltrate with the aim of damaging the growing relations between Israel and the UAE after the Abraham Accords,” he said.“The Iran-Israel rivalry is known to all. There is all possibility that such fears could have been expressed by the Israelis and hence, the UAE temporarily stopped new visas in order to first coordinate with Pakistan on this issue, and evolve a bilateral strategy to deal with any possible harm to Israel-UAE relations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-concerns-push-uae-to-suspend-issuance-of-visit-visas-to-pakistan-101610639200364.html
14-01-2021||World||Long-withheld Pentagon survey shows widespread racial discrimination, harassment||Nearly a third of Black US military servicemembers reported experiencing racial discrimination, harassment or both during a 12-month period, according to results of a long-withheld Defense Department survey that underscore concerns about racism in the ranks.The 2017 survey, whose results have not previously been reported, also showed that US troops who experienced racial discrimination or harassment had high levels of dissatisfaction with the complaint process and largely did not report it.The data support the findings of a 2020 Reuters investigation, which found that servicemembers feared that reporting discrimination would likely backfire and was not worth the risk."Overall, results reveal much work is needed to improve the reporting process for those who experience racial/ethnic harassment and discrimination," the Defense Department acknowledged in a report that accompanied the survey data.The Pentagon's release of the data followed a Reuters article last month disclosing how the Defense Department sat on the 2017 survey data during President Donald Trump's administration, even last month denying a Reuters Freedom of Information Act Request.Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a senior member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, condemned the Pentagon's failure to disclose the data sooner. A Gillibrand aide noted that the senator's office had been seeking the data for months."This just-released 2017 report shows that President Trump’s Department of Defense has deliberately concealed statistics exposing a racial justice crisis in the military," Gillibrand told Reuters."While Defense Department leadership paid lip service to equality, they withheld a report revealing that minority service members face rampant discrimination and harassment, and those that report it are nearly as likely to face punishment as the perpetrators."Concerns about racial discrimination in the military - the largest U.S. employer - have taken on new urgency over the past year, as America undergoes a nationwide reckoning on racism.Although the military is diverse in lower ranks, it is largely white and male at the top. Unpunished discrimination and racial harassment play a role in pushing out minorities, advocates say.President-elect Joe Biden underscored the importance of diversity at the Pentagon when he announced his pick last month to lead it: retired Army General Lloyd Austin, who would be the first Black U.S. defense secretary, if approved by Congress."More than 40% of our active-duty forces are people of color. It’s long past time that the department’s leadership reflects that diversity," Biden said.RACIST JOKES AND INSULTSThe 2017 Workplace and Equal Opportunity Survey of Active Duty Members showed that 31.2% of Black servicemembers reported suffering racial discrimination, harassment or both, compared with 23.3% and 21% for Asian and Hispanic troops surveyed, respectively, figures that were still high.The survey is unlikely to capture all the discrimination that minority U.S. troops encounter, advocates say.Daniele Anderson, a Navy veteran who is chief strategist of the Black Veterans Project advocacy group, noted that the survey only asked about discrimination over the previous 12-month period."I would hazard a guess that there's significantly more that have experienced" discrimination in their careers, Anderson said.Minorities in the US military reported everything from dealing with racially driven jokes and insults to hearing claims about racial superiority. Some 17.9% of Black servicemembers surveyed reported hearing someone use a racial stereotype about Black people."Collectively, these results suggest negative racial/ethnic experiences among active duty members are primarily comprised of racial/ethnic harassment, occur more than once, are done by someone of a different race/ethnicity, and often go uncorrected," the report said.Of the US troops who chose not to report an incident of racial discrimination or racial harassment, 39% thought nothing would be done and an even greater percentage thought it would make their work situation unpleasant. Of those who reported an incident, the vast majority did not know the outcome of their complaints, the survey found.The Defense Department has not explained why the data took so long to release. The survey, conducted every four years, is already so old that the Pentagon is required to carry out a new one for the 2021 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.Anderson, pointing to race-related incidents over the past four years, suspected that 2021 data would show a deteriorating situation for minority servicemembers."If we somehow were able to get data today on the last 12 months, or the last four years, that number would probably be significantly worse," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longwithheld-pentagon-survey-shows-widespread-racial-discrimination-harassment-101610635513418.html
14-01-2021||World||Donald Trump will try to make his impeachment about free speech||With the House of Representatives having voted to impeach President Donald Trump for incitement to insurrection, it’s time to start contemplating what Trump’s defense will be in a Senate trial. The answer can be summed up briefly: Trump’s lawyers will argue that Trump did not commit a crime of incitement and that his words were protected by the First Amendment.But wait, you may say, if you can remember Trump’s 2020 Senate trial 12 months ago (so much has happened since then that I barely can — and I testified during the House Judiciary Committee proceedings): Impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution. That doesn’t require conviction of a federal crime.That means the First Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court isn’t relevant and shouldn’t protect Trump. The framers kept the “high crimes and misdemeanors” language intentionally broad so that presidents could be held accountable for a wide array of abuses of power, including interfering with a free and fair election.Yet, still thinking back to the last impeachment, you will also recall that Trump’s lawyers — and some of his Senate defenders — never conceded that basic legal fact. In addition to arguing that Trump had done nothing wrong in his “perfect” phone call with the president of Ukraine, Trump’s defenders also maintained that Trump could not be impeached because he had not committed a federal crime. They insisted, despite the historical and logical evidence, that high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution need to be statutory federal crimes.They are going to make that argument again. And this time, they will also be able to wrap themselves in the patriotic flag of the First Amendment. Specifically, they are going to rely on an iconic 1969 free-speech decision by the Supreme Court, Brandenburg v. Ohio.The Brandenburg case reframed the law of incitement, extending the protection of the First Amendment beyond where it had been before. As late as the notorious 1951 case of Dennis v. United States, the court was still using a version of the “clear and present danger” test first devised by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1920. In the Dennis case, that standard was interpreted to allow conviction of nearly a dozen leaders of the Communist Party USA for sedition.By 1969, free-speech advocates and scholars had come to see the Dennis approach as out of step with contemporary values of political self-expression. In the Brandenburg case, the court said that the government can’t outlaw or punish “advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”The Brandenburg rule thus has two components. The first is that the speech is “directed” to inciting imminent lawlessness. The second is that the speech is actually likely to achieve its result.Again, under the Constitution’s definition of high crimes and misdemeanors, it isn’t legally necessary for Trump to have committed a federal crime. Abusing the power of his office is plenty. Nevertheless, Trump’s supporters will insist that Trump’s conduct fails the Brandenburg test and thus isn’t impeachable.Whether Brandenburg would protect Trump from federal criminal prosecution is a subtle question. There probably wouldn’t be much doubt about the second prong, “likely to incite.” Trump’s speech did in fact incite lawlessness, and so it certainly seems to have been likely to do so.The hard part is whether his speech was “directed” to incitement. Some scholars think this means that Trump’s words need to have explicitly called for violence. Read literally, they didn’t.Yet a counterargument to this requirement of literalism has long been that it would inappropriately protect speech that was artfully framed to incite violence without ever explicitly doing so. The classic example is the speech given by Shakespeare’s Mark Antony over Caesar’s dead body. The speech famously uses irony (“Brutus is an honourable man”) to incite the mob to violence. It’s therefore plausible to conclude that the Brandenburg test doesn’t require literal use of inciting language.If calls for violence don’t have to be explicit, the prosecuting side has an obligation to prove that violence is nonetheless what the speaker intended to incite. (Some scholars think both literal incitement and intent are required.) Circumstantial evidence — like whether he actually refused to call in the National Guard — could help to prove Trump’s intent. Without it, however, Trump will simply be able to say that he did not intend to incite violence, making it difficult to convict him for a crime under the Brandenburg standard.Needless to say, it would be a terrible shame if Trump’s impeachment trial devolved into a legalistic exchange about whether the First Amendment and Brandenburg apply in impeachment proceedings. That’s exactly why you can expect Trump’s defenders and lawyers to make the argument. It’s reason to worry that the result of Trump’s second impeachment trial will be no different than the result of his first one.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Feldman is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist and host of the podcast “Deep Background.” He is a professor of law at Harvard University and was a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter.

We have immediately supplied hot food and bamboo and tarpaulins to the affected people to reconstruct their homes," he said.He added that a cooking gas cylinder -- used widely in the camp -- was the suspected cause.Nayapara in southeast Bangladesh is home to tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees originally from Myanmar, including many who have been living there since the 1990s.Other squalid and congested camps in the area are home to nearly 900,000 Rohingya, most of whom fled a brutal military offensive by Myanmar's military in 2017.Save the Children's Bangladesh director Onno van Manen said the fire was "another devastating blow for the Rohingya people who have endured unspeakable hardship for years"."It stands as another ghastly reminder that children stuck in the camps... face a bleak future with little freedom of movement, inadequate access to education, poverty, serious protection risks and abuse including child marriage."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blaze-razes-500-houses-in-bangladesh-rohingya-camp-101610633340854.html

Before the pandemic, weekly applications typically numbered around 225,000. Last spring, after nationwide shutdowns took effect, applications for jobless benefits spiked to nearly 7 million — 10 times the previous record high. After declining over the summer, weekly claims have been stuck above 700,000 since September.The high pace of layoffs coincides with an economy that has faltered as consumers have avoided traveling, shopping and eating out in the face of soaring viral caseloads. More than 4,300 deaths were reported Tuesday, another record high. Shutdowns of restaurants, bars and other venues where people gather in California, New York and other states have likely forced up layoffs.Some states and cities are resisting shutdowns, partly out of fear of the economic consequences but raising the risk of further infections. Minnesota allowed in-person dining to resume this week. Michigan is poised to do the same. Some bars and restaurants in Kansas City are extending their hours.In addition to the first-time applications for unemployment aid last week, the government said Thursday that 5.3 million Americans are continuing to receive state jobless benefits, up from 5.1 million in the previous week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unemployment-claims-jump-to-965-000-as-virus-takes-toll-101610631944210.html
14-01-2021||World||Russia says 'obliged' to detain Alexei Navalny upon return||Russia's prison service said on Thursday it was "obliged" to detain Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny who has said he plans to return to Moscow from Germany on Sunday.Navalny has been in Germany since late August after he collapsed on a flight from Siberia to Moscow and was flown to Berlin by medical aircraft.Western countries say the 44-year-old opposition leader was poisoned with the Soviet-designed nerve toxin Novichok.The anti-graft campaigner and his allies accuse Russian authorities of doing everything to force Navalny into exile.On Thursday, the Moscow branch of Russia's Federal Prison Service (FSIN) said in a statement it was "obliged to take all actions to detain" Navalny pending a court decision to turn a suspended sentence he received in 2014 into a jail term.Earlier this week, authorities asked a Moscow court to turn Navalny's suspended sentence on fraud charges into real jail time for violating the terms of his sentence.FSIN said that Navalny was obliged to report to them at least twice a month as part of his probation period that ended on December 29 last year.The statement added that in 2020 Navalny did not report for registration on six occasions."For each violation by A.A. Navalny official warnings were issued about the possibility of the suspended sentence being cancelled and replaced with real incarceration," the prison service added.Last December, Russian investigators said they launched a probe into Navalny allegedly misappropriating more than $4 million of donations to his organisations.Navalny insists the poisoning attack was carried out by Russia's security agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), on the orders of President Vladimir Putin, a claim that the Kremlin denies.Navalny said Wednesday he was "almost healthy" and that he would fly back to Moscow on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-obliged-to-detain-alexei-navalny-upon-return-101610631239127.html
14-01-2021||World||Poor nations need more cash to adapt to climate change: UN||Half of the world's climate change financing should go to helping poorer nations adapt to the effects of global warming, such as droughts, rising seas and floods, the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) said on Thursday.Extreme weather last year such as torrential rains in Africa, record heat waves and warmer temperatures on tropical oceans is consistent with climate change, scientists say.Last year was one of the warmest on record and as impacts intensify, governments around the world must adapt better or face serious costs, damages and losses, the UNEP Adaptation Gap Report 2020 said.The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to curb warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5C, this century.Under the pact, governments also agreed to implement adaptation measures such as flood defences, greener homes and drought-resilient crops, with financial aid for poorer nations."As the U.N. Secretary-General has said, we need a global commitment to put half of all global climate finance towards adaptation in the next year," said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP."This will allow a huge step up in adaptation – in everything from early warning systems to resilient water resources to nature-based solutions."The UNEP annual report on progress towards adaptation revealed that 72% of countries have adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument.However, huge financing gaps remain to help developing countries adapt to the worst effects.More progress is also needed bringing adaptation projects to the stage where they bring real protection.International finance for adaptation is slowly rising from $30 billion, or 5% of tracked climate funds, annually.But adaptation costs in developing countries are estimated at $70 billion per year, the report said. This is expected to reach $140-300 billion in 2030 and $280-500 billion in 2050.According to the report, cutting greenhouse gas emissions will reduce the impacts and costs of climate change. Achieving the 2C target could limit losses in annual growth to up to 1.6%, compared to 2.2% for a 3C trajectory.The Global Commission on Adaptation, launched in 2018 by the United Nations, in 2019 estimated that a $1.8 trillion investment in adaptation measures from 2020 to 2030 would bring a return of $7.1 trillion in cost-saving and other benefits by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poor-nations-need-more-cash-to-adapt-to-climate-change-un-101610631277009.html
14-01-2021||World||Pope Francis, ex-pope Benedict get virus vaccines: Vatican||Both Pope Francis and his predecessor, former pope Benedict XVI, have received the coronavirus vaccine, the Vatican said on Thursday.The Argentine pontiff, 84, has previously spoken of the importance of the jab in the fight against Covid-19, which has severely curtailed his own love of being among his flock.Under the Vatican's vaccination programme launched Wednesday, "the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine has been administered to Pope Francis and the Pope Emeritus," spokesman Matteo Bruni said.It had already been reported that Francis, 84, had received the jab on Wednesday, but officials declined to confirm the news.The Vatican News portal said Benedict, 93, was given a dose on Thursday morning.The former pontiff, who stepped down in 2013, lives in a converted monastery in the Vatican gardens.In an interview broadcast at the weekend, Francis urged people to get the vaccine."There is a suicidal denial which I cannot explain, but today we have to get vaccinated," he told Canale 5.The Vatican in December said it was "morally acceptable" for Catholics even where the vaccines had been developed using cell lines from aborted foetuses.In his Christmas message last year, Francis also added his voice to calls for vaccines to be available across the globe, not just in rich countries.He urged "vaccines for all, especially the most vulnerable and most in need in all regions of the planet".Iraq trip in doubtThe Argentine has been forced to limit his interaction with the public since the virus first swept Italy early last year, notably switching his weekly Wednesday audiences online.Francis conceded at the weekend that his historic trip to Iraq planned for March, the first visit by a pope to the Middle Eastern country, could be in doubt.Recalling how he was forced to cancel his foreign trips last year due to the pandemic, he said: "I don't know if the upcoming trip to Iraq will happen."He added: "I cannot in all conscience encourage gatherings."There are serious concerns about how Francis would cope if he himself became infected, given both his age and his history of lung problems.The pope almost died when he was 21 after developing pleurisy, according to biographer Austen Ivereigh, and had part of one of his lungs removed.He recalled the incident in a recent book, "Let Us Dream", saying: "I have some sense of how people with coronavirus feel as they struggle to breathe on ventilators."Media reports suggested Pope Francis received the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which was authorised for use in the European Union on December 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-ex-pope-benedict-get-virus-vaccines-vatican-101610629069082.html
14-01-2021||World||UN watchdog confirms another Iranian breach of nuclear deal||The United Nations' atomic watchdog agency confirmed Thursday that Iran has informed it that the country has begun installing equipment for the production of uranium metal, which would be another violation of the landmark nuclear deal with world powers.Iran maintains its plans to conduct research and development on uranium metal production are part of its “declared aim to design an improved type of fuel,” the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said. Uranium metal can also be used for a nuclear bomb, however, and research on its production is specifically prohibited in the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action signed with world powers in 2015.The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something Iran insists it does not want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.IAEA inspectors visited the Isfahan plant where Iran has said it plans to conduct the research on Jan. 10, and officials were informed by Tehran on Jan. 13 that “modification and installation of the relevant equipment for the mentioned R&D activities have been already started," the agency said.Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, repeated that in a tweet on Wednesday, adding that “natural uranium will be used to produce uranium metal in the first stage.”He told Iran's official news agency IRNA that the move will elevate Iran to the level of “progressive nations in production of new fuels.”It was the latest in a string of violations of the JCPOA that Iran has undertaken since President Donald Trump pulled the United States unilaterally out of the deal in 2018, saying it needed to be re-negotiated.Tehran has been using the violations to put pressure on the other signatories — Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia — to provide more incentives to Iran to offset crippling American sanctions reimposed after the U.S. exited the deal.President-elect Joe Biden, who was vice president when the JCPOA was negotiated, has said he hopes to return the U.S. to the deal.Britain, France and Germany said last week, however, that Iran “risks compromising” chances of diplomacy with Washington after Tehran announced another violation — that it was starting to enrich uranium to 20% purity, a technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.The foreign ministers of the three European nations said in a joint statement then that the Iranian activity “has no credible civil justification.” They said the enrichment was a clear violation of the deal and “further hollows out the agreement.”Germany's Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment Thursday, but the announcement on the production of uranium metal now further complicates trying to get Washington back on board.Those working to save the deal also note that despite the violations, Iran continues to allow inspectors to access all sites in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-watchdog-confirms-another-iranian-breach-of-nuclear-deal-101610628422743.html
14-01-2021||World||Explained: What is WHO team looking for in Wuhan||The WHO team of international researchers that arrived in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on Thursday hopes to find clues to the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic.The visit has been shrouded in secrecy, with neither China nor the WHO revealing exactly what the team will do or where it will go. The search for the origins is likely to be a years-long effort that could help prevent future pandemics.Why Wuhan?The industrial and transportation hub on the Yangtze River is the first place the coronavirus surfaced in the world. It's possible that the virus came to Wuhan undetected from elsewhere, but the city of 11 million is a logical place for the mission to start.People began falling ill in December 2019, many with links to a sprawling food market that dealt in live animals. The growing number of patients triggered alarms that prompted China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention to send a team to investigate.The disease would ravage Wuhan before it was brought under control in March. The city was locked down on Jan. 23 with little or no warning. The hardships endured and lives lost became a source of both sorrow and pride for residents once the 76-day lockdown was lifted on April 8.What is the team's agenda?First they have to quarantine for 14 days, during which they will work with Chinese counterparts via video conference. Possible visits after quarantine are the Huanan Seafood Market, the site of the December 2019 cluster of cases, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold in the market. The market has since been largely ruled out but it could provide hints to how the virus spread so widely. Samples from the market may still be available, along with the testimony of those involved in the early response.The Wuhan Institute of Virology maintains an extensive archive of genetic sequences of bat coronaviruses built in the wake of the 2003 SARS pandemic, which spread from China to many countries. WHO team members would hope for access to lab logbooks and data, both junior and senior researchers and safety protocols for sample collection, storage and analysis.Why the secrecy?China has firmly rejected calls for an independent outside investigation. The head of the WHO recently expressed impatience with how long China took to make necessary arrangements for the expert team's visit.The ruling Communist Party keeps a tight hold on information and is particularly concerned about possible revelations about its handling of the virus that could open it up to international criticism and financial demands.China stifled independent reports about the outbreak and has published little information on its search for the origins of the virus. An AP investigation found that the government has strictly controlled all scientific research related to the outbreak and forbids researchers from speaking to the press.State media continue to play up reports that suggest the virus could have originated elsewhere. In announcing the experts’ visit, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said “the tracing of the virus origin will most likely involve multiple countries and localities."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-who-team-in-wuhan-looking-for-101610624541686.html
14-01-2021||World||Covid: Japan's new state emergency met with public indifference||Japan’s expanded state of emergency went into effect Thursday as the government seeks to stop a surge of new coronavirus infections, though with the restrictions not binding many people appeared to be ignoring the requests to avoid nonessential travel.People were still commuting on crowded trains and buses in Osaka, Fukuoka and other areas of the seven new prefectures placed under the state of emergency. In Tokyo, where the emergency decree has already been in place for a week, the governor expressed concern about people not following the official guidance."I thank for your cooperation, but the number of people up and about in town has not been significantly reduced,” Gov. Yuriko Koike told reporters.She said the state of emergency is not just about avoiding eating out at night or for restaurants to close early, but to reduce contacts among people.“The virus has no calendar, clock or even a map. Day or night, or prefectural borders doesn’t matter,” she said. “Please avoid going out for nonessential purposes.”Under the state of emergency that now covers areas home to more than half of Japan's population, bars and restaurants have been asked to close by 8 p.m., employers have been asked to have 70% of their staff work from home and residents in the affected areas have been asked to avoid going out for nonessential purposes. Reduced capacity has also been requested for sports and other events.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government has said the measures are needed to prevent an increase in infections in urban areas from spilling over to smaller towns where medical systems are vulnerable. Suga has called the situation “severe” and asked the people to cooperate, though in Japan the requests are nonbinding and those who ignore them are not punished.The Tokyo governor urged the country’s main business organization to encourage employers to do more to promote remote work and reduce commuting as requested by the government.Japan has seen coronavirus infections and deaths roughly double over the past month to about 302,000 and 4,200 respectively. Tokyo alone reported 1,502 new cases on Thursday.Yet despite the surge, Japan has reported far fewer infections than many countries of its size.Experts say people are not responsive to the emergency measures due to growing complacency.Suga has said he will seek the revision of a law to allow his government to issue binding measures with penalties for violators.The Cabinet minister in charge of the coronavirus measures, Yasutoshi Nishimura, told a special parliamentary panel Thursday that further expansion of the emergency is possible if infections spread.The emergency decree now covers Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Aichi, Gifu and Tochigi prefectures.Dr. Shigeru Omi, a former World Health Organization regional director who heads a government COVID-19 taskforce, said tougher measures such as business shutdown requests may be needed if the measures are ineffective by early February. He has previously said a month-long emergency may not be enough to slow the surge.Suga has been criticized for not taking stronger action earlier in the outbreak, when measures were largely limited to asking the public to take basic safety measures such as wearing masks and washing hands.Experts have said the surge in infections is putting pressure on hospitals in the country, especially in Tokyo, which has seen about a quarter of the country's virus cases. At least two people in Tokyo have died while waiting to be hospitalized after testing positive for the virus.To relieve manage the burden, Tokyo is working to secure hotel rooms for less-serious patients, while assigning three prefectural-run hospitals to specialize in coronavirus treatment, the governor said.“The infections are showing signs of becoming explosive. We must slow the pace as soon as possible,” said Norio Ohmagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center and a member of Tokyo’s coronavirus taskforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-japan-s-new-state-emergency-met-with-public-indifference-101610624010234.html

14-01-2021||World||Past Covid-19 infection gives at least 5 months of immunity: UK study||People who have been infected with Covid-19 are immune from contracting the virus again for at least five months, according to a major study by Public Health England (PHE), which examined more than 6,500 people between June and December 2020.The study released on Thursday, however, cautions that those with such immunity may still be able to carry the virus in their noses and throats and therefore pose a risk of transmitting it to others.PHE scientists working on the study have concluded that naturally acquired immunity as a result of past infections provide 83% protection against reinfection, compared to people who have not had the disease before. PHE said that the study called SIREN (SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection EvaluatioN) will continue to assess whether protection may last for longer, which means that people who contracted the disease in the first wave may now be vulnerable to catching it again.Between June 18 and November 24, scientists detected 44 potential reinfections (2 ‘probable’ and 42 ‘possible’ reinfections) out of 6,614 participants who had tested positive for antibodies. This represents an 83% rate of protection from reinfection, PHE said.Susan Hopkins, SIREN study lead, said: “This study has given us the clearest picture to date of the nature of antibody protection against Covid-19 but it is critical people do not misunderstand these early findings”.“We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts. Crucially, we believe people may still be able to pass the virus on”.She added: “This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections but there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others.”PHE said the study will continue to follow participants for 12 months to explore how long any immunity may last, the effectiveness of vaccines and to what extent people with immunity are able to carry and transmit the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/past-covid-19-infection-gives-at-least-5-months-of-immunity-uk-study-101610622927221.html

Sara Duterte chairs an alliance of political parties, and stepped into the national spotlight in 2019 by campaigning for Senate candidates, most of whom won.“I pity her,” the president said at the inauguration of an elevated highway in the capital. “She will go through what I went through.”Rodrigo Duterte, who has a history of making vulgar and sexist comments, also said he doesn’t intend to extend his six-year term. His allies in Congress have sought to revise the Constitution, which was enacted after the overthrow of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.“Even if you serve it to me on a silver platter or give me ten more years for free, I am done,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-says-presidency-not-for-women-tells-daughter-not-to-run-101610621965083.html

They are a part of the WHO team which is visiting China to investigate the origins of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The two members, who had tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in blood-based serology tests on their way to Wuhan via Singapore, were stopped from boarding their plane to Wuhan.They had tested negative for Covid-19 in swab tests, Bloomberg reported."The international team of 13 scientists examining the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19 arrived in Wuhan, China, today. The experts will begin their work immediately during the 2 weeks quarantine protocol for international travelers," the WHO said in a tweet on Thursday."Two scientists are still in Singapore completing tests for Covid-19. All team members had multiple negative PCR and antibody tests for Covid-19 in their home countries prior to traveling," the global health body tweeted.A global team of scientists led by the World Health Organization arrived in China's central city of Wuhan, where Covid-19 first surfaced in late 2019, to investigate the origins of the pandemic, state television said on Thursday.The team will spend about a month in the city, including two weeks in quarantine.WHO confirmed that the scientists were tested again in Singapore and were all negative for PCR. "But two members tested positive for IgM antibodies. They are being retested for both IgM and IgG antibodies."China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian did not directly comment but said, "China will strictly follow the relevant epidemic prevention regulations and requirements, and provide corresponding support and facilities for WHO experts who come to China to carry out international cooperation on tracing the origin of the virus."The rest of the team arrived at the Wuhan airport and walked through a makeshift clear plastic tunnel into the airport. The researchers, who wore face masks, were greeted by airport staff in full protective gear, including masks, goggles and full body suits.They will undergo a two-week quarantine as well as a throat swab test and an antibody test for Covid-19, according to CGTN, the English-language channel of state broadcaster CCTV. They are to start working with Chinese experts via video conference while in quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-entry-to-2-who-members-for-probe-cites-covid-19-test-report-101610619686021.html
14-01-2021||World||Hong Kong's first website takedown under national security law confirmed||A Hong Kong internet provider said Thursday it had blocked access to a website following a police order, the first confirmed takedown using a new national security law imposed by Beijing last year.Unlike mainland China, Hong Kong has open internet access, but critics of Beijing fear powers given to the police under the new law could herald the end of that freedom.Internet users noticed the website HKChronicles was unreachable from some Hong Kong-based devices last week, and its owner put out a statement saying she believed authorities were blocking access.Police declined to comment, but on Thursday Hong Kong Broadband Network -- one of the city's internet service providers -- confirmed a takedown order had been issued."We have disabled the access to the website in compliance with the requirement issued under the National Security Law," the company said.HKChronicles, which is still available overseas and in Hong Kong through virtual private networks, is a controversial site.It ran lists of businesses that support the democracy movement, and collected stories and footage from huge and often violent pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019 -- with a particular focus on allegations of excessive police violence.But after officers began removing identifying badges during clashes with protesters, the website started collecting their personal details -- a tactic known as doxxing, which is illegal in Hong Kong and many other jurisdictions.It also listed the names and details of many pro-Beijing figures.Similar websites doxxing pro-democracy supporters also exist.Access to the internet in authoritarian China is impeded by a "Great Firewall" that limits sites and information that people on the mainland can access.China also employs a sophisticated censorship network which scrubs posts deemed sensitive from the digital world.But semi-autonomous Hong Kong remains outside that firewall, a crucial component of its status as an international business hub.Last June Beijing imposed a sweeping new national security law to crush dissent.Among its many new provisions were fresh police powers to order internet providers to remove websites or content deemed to breach national security, sparking fears the "Great Firewall" might be widened to one day encompass Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-first-website-takedown-under-national-security-law-confirmed-101610619123074.html
14-01-2021||World||'Ignores current ground reality': India on UK parliament's Kashmir debate||India has expressed its dismay at some of the parliamentarians who participated in a debate on Kashmir in the Houses of Parliament complex in London relying on "false assertions" and unsubstantiated allegations propagated by a "third country" – an apparent reference to Pakistan.The debate, organised by backbench British MPs at Westminster Hall in the House of Commons on Wednesday evening, was entitled “Political situation in Kashmir” – terminology the Indian High Commission in London pointed out as problematic in itself.“Regarding the reference to ‘Kashmir’ in the title: the need is felt to differentiate between the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India, and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (when the erstwhile princely state of Kashmir legally acceded to India in October 1947, this part was forcibly and illegally occupied by Pakistan),” the High Commission said in a statement.“It was also noted that references to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, despite the volumes of authentic information available in the public domain – based on up to date and visible facts on the ground – ignored current ground reality and, instead chose to reflect false assertions of the kind promoted by a third country, such as unsubstantiated allegations of ‘genocide’, ‘rampant violence’ and ‘torture’,” it noted.Responding to the debate on behalf of the UK government, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) minister Nigel Adams had reiterated the official stance that it is not for Britain to play any mediatory role in a bilateral India-Pakistan matter, even as he accepted there were human rights concerns on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC).“The government’s policy [on Kashmir] remains stable, it’s unchanged. We continue to believe that this is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting political resolution to the situation that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people… as laid out in the Simla Agreement,” said Adams, in his capacity as Minister for Asia.“It’s not appropriate for the UK government to prescribe a solution or act as a mediator in this regard but it would be wrong to not acknowledge there are serious human rights concerns in both India-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This has been confirmed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in his reports,” he said.The minister also made a reference to the District Development Council (DDC) democratic elections held in the region in December last year, which Labour Party MP Barry Gardiner pointed out attracted the free and fair participation of over 50 per cent of the local electorate.“The people of Kashmir deserve the opportunity to thrive and succeed, so more broadly we welcome the commitment that the Indian government has made to the economic and social development of India-administered Kashmir and we continue to seek further details of their plans,” added Adams.The debate, organised by Labour’s Sarah Owen, included the participation of cross-party British MPs, many of whom have a large Kashmiri diaspora constituency base.They raised concerns of alleged human rights violations and called on the UK government to seek access to the region for direct reports from Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) to be presented in the UK Parliament in future.The Indian High Commission in London sought to highlight that since last year, a smart wi-fi project has enabled high-speed internet access in the region and that despite threats of terror attacks, challenging weather conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic, landmark DDC elections were concluded in December 2020.“Since the administrative reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019, it is well on the path of good governance and accelerated development. All administrative measures taken by the Government of India in Jammu and Kashmir are entirely an internal matter of India,” the Indian High Commission statement said.“Regarding the reference to peace and stability of our region, it is reiterated that India stands ready to engage with Pakistan on all outstanding issues – including on Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the Shimla Agreement (1972) and the Lahore Declaration (1999) in an atmosphere free from terror, hostility and violence,” it noted.The statement asserted that while it was not the policy of India to take “undue interest” in the internal discussions within a foreign Parliament, the High Commission of India continues to engage with all concerned – including the UK government and parliamentarians – to avoid “misperceptions and misinformation” by making authentic information about India available to all.

14-01-2021||World||Canada grants asylum to several Hong Kong activists: Support group||Several Hong Kong activists who protested the controversial security law imposed by Beijing have been granted asylum in Canada, according to a support group.According to a statement posted by the New Hong Kong Cultural Club (NHKCC), this makes Canada the “very first country” to accept those who claimed refugee status because of their protests against the law. This was first reported by the Globe and Mail daily.The NHKCC Canada also claimed that while 14 have been granted political refugee status, nearly another 30 had received claimant status, meaning their cases for asylum will be heard by the Immigration and Refugee Board or IRB.News of granting such asylum came even as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government faced criticism over allowing the visit of the husband and two children of a Huawei executive who is under house arrest in Vancouver.Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications firm, was arrested in December 2018, precipitating retaliation from Beijing which detained two Canadians, including a former diplomat, in what Trudeau has described was a act of “hostage diplomacy.” Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor remain in captivity in China but it now appears that Canada may have been permitted consular access to them in return for agreeing to the visit by Meng’s husband Liu Xiaozong in October, followed by their children joining them in December last year.Opposition MP Raquel Dancho said: “The Liberals rolled out the red carpet and granted a special travel exemption for the Huawei CFO’s family to reunite in time for the holidays. This is an insult to the millions of Canadians who were told by this government not to visit loved ones.”Rob Oliphant, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, accepted that there was anger over the decision at granting special exemption of Meng’s family. “Do I understand Canadians’ outrage? Absolutely?” he said during a debate on the network CTV, but added this was a decision taken by officials at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.While the decision could not have been taken without the knowledge of the country’s top political leaders, given the sensitive nature of the case, multiple media outlets said the PMO has refused to comment on whether Trudeau was aware of this allowance being given to Meng’s family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-grants-asylum-to-several-hong-kong-activists-support-group-101610616446794.html
14-01-2021||World||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny may face 3.5 years jail on return to Russia||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is on a national wanted list for allegedly violating the terms of a suspended prison sentence and risks being jailed for three and a half years when he returns to Russia this weekend, one of his lawyers said on Thursday.Navalny announced on Wednesday that he plans to fly back to Russia on Sunday for the first time since he was poisoned in August with a Novichok nerve agent, despite the risk of being jailed on his return from Germany.The Kremlin denies involvement in his poisoning, said it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned, and has said he is free to return to Russia at any time.Navalny on Wednesday shrugged off the growing list of legal threats, calling criminal cases against him -- of which there are at least two pending -- fabricated to thwart his political ambitions.Vadim Kobzev, one of Navalny's lawyers, told Reuters on Thursday that Navalny had now been put on a national wanted list because Russia's prison service accuses him of not reporting to them at the end of last year in connection with a suspended sentence for embezzlement which he was serving out.Navalny said the original case against him was trumped up and that he was in Germany at the time being treated as an outpatient for his poisoning so could not report in. The prison service says he was discharged from a Berlin hospital in September and therefore should have returned to Moscow and reported to them."In theory they can detain him as soon as he arrives (in Russia) but initially only for 48 hours," said Kobzev, who said he expected a court to hear details of the case on Jan. 29 at which point it could order his suspended sentence to be converted into real jail time."The court can change his whole suspended sentence into a real one and give him three and a half years in jail," said Kobzev.Leonid Volkov, an ally of Navalny, has said that Navalny will become the world's most high profile political prisoner if he is jailed, likening him to Nelson Mandela, and has said he would become a symbol of resistance to the Kremlin.The Kremlin, which refers to Navalny only as "the Berlin patient," says it is up to the relevant law enforcement agencies to decide how he is treated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-may-face-3-5-years-jail-on-return-to-russia-101610612880377.html
14-01-2021||World||Can the 14th amendment stop Trump from becoming President again||Some US lawmakers have said President Donald Trump should be disqualified from holding political office again following his impeachment on Wednesday for inciting a mob that stormed the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory.Now that the House has impeached Trump, the Senate will hold a trial on whether to remove him and possibly bar him from future office.Legal experts said disqualification could be accomplished through the impeachment proceedings or the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.Here is how the disqualification effort could play out.CAN TRUMP'S DISQUALIFICATION BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH IMPEACHMENT?The US Constitution says there are two ways to punish an impeached official: removal from office or “disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States."The House approved a single article of impeachment accusing Trump of inciting insurrection when he delivered an incendiary speech to supporters shortly before the pro-Trump mob rampaged the Capitol.Trump is likely to argue at trial that his remarks were free speech protected by the Constitution's First Amendment and that, while he told supporters to "fight," he did not intend it as a literal call to violence.Removing an official requires a "conviction" by a two-thirds Senate majority under the Constitution. Under precedent, only a simple majority is needed for disqualification. Historically, that vote only happens after a conviction.Three federal officials in US history have been disqualified through impeachment proceedings. All three were federal judges.Most recently, in 2010 the Senate removed and disqualified from future office a Louisiana judge found to have engaged in corruption.There is some debate over the scope of the disqualification clause and whether it applies to the presidency, said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University.Analyzing historical documents, some law experts say the founders did not intend the presidency to be considered an "office" under the disqualification clause, while others argue that the term applies.CAN TRUMP BE DISQUALIFIED IF HE IS NOT CONVICTED BY THE SENATE?This is uncharted legal territory, and there is no clear answer, scholars said.Paul Campos, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Colorado, said he believed a vote to disqualify Trump can be held even if there are not enough votes for conviction. The US Supreme Court has made clear that the Senate has wide latitude to determine how it conducts a trial, he said.But Kalt said he thought disqualification would require conviction first. To do otherwise would be the equivalent of punishing the president for an offense he did not commit, Kalt said.All three judges who were disqualified from office were first convicted.WHAT ABOUT THE 14TH AMENDMENT?Section 3 of the 14th Amendment provides an alternative path for disqualification.The provision states that no person shall hold office if they have engaged in "insurrection or rebellion" against the United States. It was enacted following the Civil War to bar Confederates from holding public office.Under congressional precedent, only a simple majority of both chambers is needed to invoke this penalty. Congress can later remove the disqualification, but only if two-thirds of both houses vote in favor of doing so.In 1919, Congress used the 14th Amendment to block an elected official, Victor Berger, from assuming his seat in the House because he had actively opposed US intervention in World War I.The text of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not explain how it should be invoked.Another section the 14th Amendment, Section 5, empowers Congress to enforce the entire amendment through "appropriate legislation.” Some scholars have interpreted this language to mean that a majority of both chambers of Congress could enact a law applying a ban to a particular president, like Trump."The 14th Amendment route is very unclear as to what it would take to get it rolling," said Kalt. "I think it would require some combination of legislation and litigation."COULD TRUMP CHALLENGE A DISQUALIFICATION IN COURT?It is certainly possible, said Kalt.A Supreme Court case from 1993 makes clear that the court is wary of second-guessing how the Senate handles impeachment. In that case, involving an accused judge, the court said whether the Senate had properly tried an impeachment was a political question and could not be litigated.If Trump is disqualified, the current Supreme Court might want to clarify whether the move was lawful, Kalt said.Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court's nine members: Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and most recently Amy Coney Barrett. The court now has a six-judge conservative majority."If you are going to say someone can't run, you want to get that litigated and settled sooner rather than later," Kalt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-the-14th-amendment-stop-trump-from-becoming-president-again-101610615038895.html

14-01-2021||World||'At 6 pm, life stops': Europe uses curfews to fight coronavirus||As the wan winter sun sets over France's Champagne region, the countdown clock kicks in.Laborers stop pruning the vines as the light fades at about 4:30 pm, leaving them 90 minutes to come in from the cold, change out of their work clothes, hop in their cars and zoom home before a 6 p.m. coronavirus curfew.Forget about any after-work socializing with friends, after-school clubs for children or doing any evening shopping beyond quick trips for essentials. Police on patrol demand valid reasons from people seen out and about. For those without them, the threat of mounting fines for curfew-breakers is increasingly making life outside of the weekends all work and no play.“At 6 pm, life stops,” says Champagne producer Alexandre Prat.Trying to fend off the need for a third nationwide lockdown that would further dent Europe’s second-largest economy and put more jobs in danger, France is instead opting for creeping curfews. Big chunks of eastern France, including most of its regions that border Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, face 6 pm-to-6 am restrictions on movement.The rest of France could quickly follow suit, losing two extra hours of liberty that have been just enough for residents to maintain bare-bones social lives.Until a couple of weeks ago, the nightly curfew didn't kick in until 8 pm in Prat's region, the Marne. Customers still stopped to buy bottles of his family's bubbly wines on their way home, he said. But when the cut-off time was advanced to 6 pm to slow viral infections, the drinkers disappeared.“Now we have no one," Prat said.The village where retiree Jerome Brunault lives alone in the Burgundy wine region is also in one of the 6 pm curfew zones. The 67-year-old says his solitude weighs more heavily without the opportunity for early evening drinks, nibbles and chats with friends, the so-called “apero” get-togethers so beloved by the French that were hurried but still feasible when curfew started two hours later.“With the 6 pm curfew, we cannot go to see friends for a drink anymore,” Brunault said. "I now spend my days not talking to anyone except for the baker and some people by phone.”Imposing a 6 pm curfew nationwide is among options the French government is considering in response to rising infections and the spread of a particularly contagious virus variant that has swept across Britain, where new infections and virus deaths have soared.Prime Minister Jean Castex could announce a curfew extension Thursday evening, as well as other restrictions, to fight the virus in a country that has seen over 69,000 confirmed virus deaths.An earlier curfew combats virus transmission “precisely because it serves to limit social interactions that people can have at the end of the day, for example in private homes,” French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says.Overnight curfews have become the norm in swaths of Europe but the 6 pm-to-6 am curfew in 25 regions of eastern France is the most restrictive anywhere in the European Union's 27 nations. Others countries' curfews all start later and often finish earlier.The curfew in Italy runs from 10 pm to 5 am, as does the Friday night to Sunday morning curfew in Latvia. Regions of Belgium that speak French have a 10 pm to 6 am curfew while in Belgium's Dutch-speaking region, the hours are midnight to 5 am.People out between 8 pm and 5 am in Hungary must be able to show police written proof from their employers that they are either working or commuting.There are no curfews in Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta, Sweden, Poland or the Netherlands, although the Dutch government is thinking about whether imposing a curfew would slow new Covid-19 cases.In France, critics of the 6 pm curfew say the earlier time actually crams people together more after work, when they pile onto public transportation, clog roads and shop for groceries in a narrow rush-hour window before they must be home.Women's rugby coach Felicie Guinot says negotiating rush-hour traffic in Marseille has become a nightmare. The city in southern France is among the places where the more contagious virus variant has started to flare.“It's a scramble so everyone can be home by 6 pm,” Guinot said.In historic Besançon, the fortressed city that was the hometown of “Les Misérables” author Victor Hugo, music store owner Jean-Charles Valley says the 6 pm deadline means people no longer drop by after work to play with the guitars and other instruments that he sells. Instead, they rush home.“People are completely demoralised,” Valley said.In Dijon, the French city known for its pungent mustard, working mother of two Celine Bourdin says her life has narrowed to “dropping kids at school and going to work, then going back home, helping kids with homework and preparing dinner.”But even that cycle is better than a repeat of France's lockdown at the start of the pandemic, when schools also closed, Bourdin says.“If my children don’t go to school, it means I cannot work anymore," she said. "It was terribly difficult to be all stuck almost 24 hours a day in the house.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-6-pm-life-stops-europe-uses-curfews-to-fight-coronavirus-101610614066742.html
14-01-2021||World||Search itensifies for black box of doomed Sriwijaya Air Flight||Indonesia’s transport ministry ordered the nation’s airlines to inspect their older, so-called classic Boeing Co. 737 aircraft following Saturday’s crash of a Sriwijaya Air passenger jet with 62 people on board.The cause of the crash isn’t yet known -- divers are still trying to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder from the wreckage in the Java Sea. The flight-data recorder was recovered Tuesday. Rescue workers have been bringing in bags of human remains for identification, along with parts of the Boeing 737-500 plane, which was nearly 27 years old.“This is a preventive action on similar types of aircraft that operate in Indonesia,” Adita Irawati, a spokeswoman for the transport ministry, wrote in a text message. “It is a common practice in other countries.”Boeing 737-300, 400 and 500 jets all fall under the classic series. Indonesian airlines that fly those include Citilink, Nam Air, Deraya Air Taxi, Xpress Air, Jayawijaya Dirgantara, My Indo Airlines, Trigana Air and Tri-MG Intra Asia Airlines, according to data from planespotters.net.Sriwijaya Flight 182 plunged into the sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta at 2:36 p.m. on Jan. 9. The aircraft had returned to service only on Dec. 20, after spending nine months in storage due to the downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The plane was traveling to Pontianak on the island of Borneo. Four minutes after takeoff, air-traffic controllers noticed it wasn’t on its assigned track and radioed the crew. Within seconds, the aircraft disappeared from radar.The retrieved flight-data recorder is “in relatively good shape,” Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee Chairman Soerjanto Tjahjono said Wednesday. The box is being dried out and the contents should be downloaded within five days, he said.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is sending a team of technical experts to assist the Indonesian government’s probe into the crash. They’ll be joined by representatives of Boeing, engine maker General Electric Co. and the US Federal Aviation Administration. Air-accident probes are typically run by the country in which the crash occurred, but investigators from the nation where the plane and its components were built can participate. Indonesia granted waivers allowing them to enter the country despite its coronavirus travel ban, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday.Representatives from the NTSC and Sriwijaya Air met with victims’ families for the first time on Wednesday to provide updates on the investigation and notify them that a preliminary report will be available 30 days after the date of the crash, the airline said in an emailed statement.The Covid-19 pandemic has forced airlines globally to park fleets due to a lack of demand and border restrictions. Aircraft require specific maintenance work during storage and when they are brought back into service to ensure that engines function properly, fuel isn’t contaminated and all systems work.Weather has been a factor in several crashes in Indonesia, a fast-growing market with one of the world’s worst safety records. Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 had been delayed for 56 minutes as heavy rain hit the Indonesian capital. The plane plunged more than 10,000 feet shortly after takeoff.Other major crashes in the Java Sea in recent years include a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max in October 2018 and an AirAsia Group Bhd. Airbus SE jet in December 2014. Both hurtled into the ocean, claiming 351 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-itensifies-for-black-box-of-doomed-sriwijaya-air-flight-101610613483252.html

We invite (the United States) to distance themselves from threatening language such as sanctions," Akar told journalists in Ankara."We want the solution of problems through dialogue. If the US side wants a solution, a solution could be found with work on the technical level," he said.The sanctions were imposed at a challenging time in the fraught relationship between Ankara and Washington. President-elect Joe Biden is set to take office on Jan. 20, replacing Donald Trump. Biden has been critical of President Tayyip Erdogan's policies in the past.Turkey has defended its acquisition of the S-400s as a necessity because it was unable to procure air defence systems from any NATO ally on satisfactory terms.Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and to NATO's broader defence systems. Turkey rejects this and says S-400s will not be integrated into NATO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-says-turning-back-on-s-400s-problematic-seeks-us-dialogue-101610604273048.html

In a long-running dispute, Google and Facebook have called the rules unfair and suggested they would force them to limit their offerings in the country.After media reports said Australian news websites were not showing up in searches, Google confirmed it was running unspecified tests in relation to news media."We're currently running a few experiments that will each reach about 1% of Google Search users in Australia to measure the impacts of news businesses and Google Search on each other," a spokesman said in an email, adding that the experiments would conclude by early February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-calls-out-google-for-experiment-blocking-some-news-sites-101610606511202.html
14-01-2021||World||China ends 2020 with record trade surplus as pandemic goods soar||China’s export boom continued into December, pushing the trade surplus to a record high in the month and bolstering what is already the world’s best-performing major economy.Fueling the shipments surge is insatiable global appetite for work-from-home technology and health care equipment as Covid-19 continues to surge in many places around the world. Demand is so strong that’s it’s contributing to a bottleneck at ports as manufacturers complain of a shortage of shipping containers and surging costs.Early control of virus cases last year allowed China’s factories to capitalize on global demand while its trading rivals were hobbled. That export momentum is expected to keep going even as vaccines are rolled out to tame the virus spread and allow industrial production to recover in the US and Europe.The bumper year also underscores China’s role as the fulcrum of global supply chains even as political tensions with the US and other trading rivals simmered.“The biggest takeaway is that China’s exports have remained surprisingly resilient despite the return of the second wave in major economies,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong.The trade data showed surging demand across the board:“Demand for China’s goods may remain strong in the next few months with the recent surge of Covid infections in the US and Europe,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong.That outperformance will inevitably wane as the virus is controlled in big markets including the US and Europe and industrial production recovers, he added.Li Kuiwen, an official at China’s General Administration of Customs, said the trade surplus may keep growing this year, supported by an expected recovery in the global economy and stable domestic growth.Jian Chang, chief China economist at Barclays Plc in Hong Kong, said the data supports regional evidence from South Korea and Vietnam of booming demand.“The external recovery has continued,” said Chang. “Chinese manufacturers have flexibly adjusted their production lines to produce goods to meet the demand through the new Covid era.” Both pandemic and non-pandemic related goods are growing strongly, she said.The data probably won’t shift the central bank from its stance of gradually withdrawing monetary stimulus but without any sharp turn in policy, Chang said, adding there’s unlikely to be an interest-rate cut or hike this year.The figures also showed shifts in China’s trading partners last year, with the 10-member bloc of Southeast Asian nations rising to the No. 1 spot, followed by the European Union and the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-ends-2020-with-record-trade-surplus-as-pandemic-goods-soar-101610606537165.html

Beijing says only it has the right to speak for Taiwan on the world stage, something Taipei's democratically-elected government rejects.Tsai told Craft that Taiwan would keep pushing for access to the United Nations and U.N.-related meetings, and hoped that the United States would continue to support this, Taiwan's presidential office said."We will continue to let the world know that Taiwan is a force for good and an important partner. We are capable and determined to contribute to the international community," the office cited Tsai as saying.It added that David Feith, Deputy US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs was also on the call.Beijing has been angered by stepped-up support for Taiwan from the administration of outgoing President Donald Trump, including trips to Taipei by top US officials, further straining Sino-U.S. ties.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday said he was lifting restrictions on contacts between US officials and their Taiwanese counterparts.Craft's Taiwan trip appeared to be another part of an effort by Pompeo and Trump's Republican administration to lock in a tough approach to China before Democratic President-elect Biden takes office on Jan. 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-stands-by-taiwan-envoy-says-after-cancelled-trip-101610609232320.html

I want to stress that the government’s policy remains stable, it is unchanged, we continue to believe that this is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting political resolution to the situation that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people”.“It is not appropriate for the UK government to prescribe a solution or act as a mediator in this regard but it would be wrong to not acknowledge that there are serious human rights concerns in both India-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This has been confirmed by the UN high commissioner for human rights in his report”.He added: “The situation in India-administered Kashmir has been a particular concern to many here today including as well this government, particularly since the revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in 2019”.The UK government, he said, welcomed the recent release of former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, and noted that several restrictions had been relaxed in recent days and weeks.Adams said: “We repeatedly raise our concerns about detentions and restrictions with the Indian government. The foreign secretary (Dominic Raab) raised Kashmir with his counterpart, including during his visit to New Delhi last month”.“The situation in Kashmir remains an important issue for the government. We continue to talk frankly to the governments of India and Pakistan about our human rights concerns and for all remaining restrictions on India-administered Kashmir to be lifted as soon as possible”.India was the focus of debates in the Westminster Hall for the second day on Wednesday. On Tuesday, MPs highlighted alleged persecution of Muslims, Christians and religious minorities in the country, with Adams assuring MPs that such issues are often raised with New Delhi.Noting the debates, the Indian high commission extended an invitation to British MPs to discuss all India-related issues so that they have authentic and factual information, including issues of concern to them or their constituents.It said: “It is not the policy of India to take undue interest in internal discussions within a foreign parliament. High Commission of India is engaging with all concerned – including the UK Government and H’ble Parliamentarians to avoid misperceptions and misinformation by making authentic information about India available to all”.“The measures taken since 2019 have brought an unprecedented sense of safety and security that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have long yearned for as they are now able to secure their lives , livelihoods and futures – safe from externally-induced violence and terror”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kashmir-situation-of-great-concern-uk-minister-101610605646407.html

The province has 16 active severe cases in hospitals. In a sign of the new wave spreading across the country, northeastern Heilongjiang declared an “emergency state” on Wednesday, telling its 37.5 million residents not to leave the province unless absolutely necessary and saying public gatherings would be cancelled.The death comes as China readies for the arrival of an expert team of scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO), who will start a politically sensitive investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.The team is expected to arrive in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the new coronavirus was first detected in late 2019, directly from Singapore on Thursday.Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO’s top expert on animal diseases that cross to other species who went to China on a preliminary mission last July, is leading the 10 independent experts, a WHO spokesperson said.Hung Nguyen, a Vietnamese biologist and part of the 10-member team, told Reuters that he did not expect any restrictions on the group’s work in China, but cautioned against finding firm answers.Embarek said the group would start with a two-week quarantine at a hotel due to China’s border requirements.“And then after the two weeks, we would be able to move around and meet our Chinese counterparts in person and go to the different sites that we will want to visit,” he said.“The idea is to advance a number of studies that were already designed and decided upon some months ago to get us a better understanding of what happened,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-death-in-china-since-may-as-who-team-set-to-land-101610604866467.html

The U.S. Capitol that proved such a soft target last week was visible only through lines of tall, black fence.Also Read: Impeachment or the 14th Amendment: Can Trump be barred from future office?Two blocks from the White House, a group of uniformed National Guard troops emerged from a tour bus and headed into a hotel as a state of lockdown descended on Washington that will last through the Jan. 20 inauguration.“Clearly we are in uncharted waters,” said Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser.Last week’s “violent insurrection” at the Capitol by supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump has “impacted the way we are approaching working with our federal partners in planning for the 59th inauguration,” Bowser said Wednesday.The FBI has warned that armed protests by violent Trump supporters were being planned in all 50 state capitals as well as in Washington for the days leading up to the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.Between the pandemic and the security threat, Bowser is flat-out asking people not to come to the District of Columbia for the inauguration. And at Bowser’s request, a National Special Security Event declaration was moved up to Jan. 13, a distinction which she said "puts in place an entirely different command and control structure” for security.The NSSE status is normal for a presidential inauguration and other major events like an international summit or the Super Bowl. But it's rare to start the lockdown so far in advance of the event.Police vehicles sealed off a huge swath of downtown D.C. Wednesday, causing immediate traffic snarls. Starting Wednesday, Bowser said, anyone inside the inauguration perimeter might be stopped and questioned. Starting Friday, all parking garages in the downtown restricted zone will be sealed through the inauguration.Also Read: Now that Trump is impeached (again), what's next?Bowser is also being pushed to deny lodging options to potentially violent protesters. The local Black Lives Matter affiliate and Shutdown DC issued a joint statement Wednesday urging all downtown hotels to voluntarily close and pay their staffs. In addition to the threat of violence, the activist groups say Trump supporters are a threat to the health of hotel staff for their general refusal to wear facemasks amid the pandemic. Several downtown hotels, including one which had become a favorite hangout of the militant Proud Boy faction, chose to avoid trouble by closing last week.“Closing hotels completely for these six nights is the only way to guarantee the safety of hotel workers, neighbors, vulnerable and unhoused residents, incoming administration officials, members of Congress, and our democracy,” the statement said. “If hotels do not willingly close, we ask Mayor Bowser to extend today’s emergency order and close all hotels in the city.”On Wednesday, Airbnb announced it was cancelling all reservations in the Washington metro area. Bowser said she had been in regular contact with Airbnb officials since last week, but did not specifically request this step.“We are aware of reports emerging yesterday afternoon regarding armed militias and known hate groups that are attempting to travel and disrupt the Inauguration,” a company statement said. “We are continuing our work to ensure hate group members are not part of the Airbnb community.”On the ground, much of the most visible security will come in the form of more than 15,000 National Guardsmen from multiple states, some of them armed.According to officials, the number of Guardsmen who will actually be carrying guns will be limited. Some Guard members nearer the Capitol will have long guns, and others will have their sidearms.It is likely that those closer to the crowds or on fence lines won’t be armed, but those up closer to the building may be. National Guard members operate under strict rules of engagement on the use of force. But generally speaking, troops can use lethal force to protect the lives of others and themselves.Officials also said that while 15,000 Guard members have been activated, more may be called. D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee estimated Wednesday that more than 20,000 National Guardsmen would be active in the District of Columbia on Inauguration Day.Officials are continuing to review requests from law enforcement, and some believe several thousand more could be brought in. Defense and military officials have been calling governors and adjutants general to ask if they might have people they could send, if requested.So far, officials said state leaders have said that protecting their own capitols will be their top priority, but they still have some Guard members they will be able to send, if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expecting-trouble-washington-locks-down-a-week-before-biden-inauguration-101610603978789.html

Researchers at the institute are still studying whether it’s more easily spread and if it causes more severe illness, according to the newspaper.Since the onset of the pandemic, scientists at the institute have sequenced about 500 genomes, most of them collected during the second wave, according to the Nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-detect-covid-19-variant-unique-to-kenya-nation-says-101610603354074.html
14-01-2021||World||Vaccines and masks: Biden plan aims to break pandemic cycle||A coronavirus action plan being unveiled by President-elect Joe Biden centers on a mass vaccination campaign and closer coordination among all levels of government.The Biden plan comes as a divided nation remains caught in the grip of the pandemic’s most dangerous wave yet. So far, more than 380,000 Americans have died.Biden hopes his multidimensional strategy, expected to be detailed in a Thursday evening speech, will put the country on the path to recovery by the end of his first 100 days. “It’s going to be hard,” Biden said Monday after he got his second vaccine shot. “It’s not going to be easy. But we can get it done.”A more disciplined focus on vaccination is the new and widely anticipated game-changing element, but that's far from the whole story. Biden is asking Americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. That's still the surest way to brake the Covid-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on Tuesday.Biden has also talked about asking Congress to pump more money to states, to help their efforts to contain the pandemic and replenish depleted coffers that pay for basic services. And Democratic lawmakers are eager to push for $2,000 economic stimulus payments to Americans.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the Biden Covid-19 package will be the first order of business this year.But Biden's biggest challenge is to “win the hearts and minds of the American people to follow his lead,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.With the backing of Congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the Trump administration has delivered two highly effective vaccines and more are on the way. Yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation's vaccination campaign is off to a slow start with about 10.3 million people getting the first of two shots, although more than 29 million doses have been delivered.Biden aims to speed that up by delivering more vaccine and working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. The Trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.“This is going to entail coordination at all levels, as well as resources,” said Dr. Nadine Gracia, executive vice president of the nonpartisan Trust for America's Health. “There is a commitment the (incoming) administration has articulated to address the needs of communities.”Biden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. The pace of vaccination is approaching 1 million shots a day, but it needs to be nearly double that to reach his mark.President Donald Trump repeatedly asserted the coronavirus would go away on its own. Early on, he said it would disappear with warmer weather, and later he said after the election. But Biden sees the pandemic on the level of an existential threat. "That’s my No. 1 concern, to get the virus under control," he said last week.At the pinnacle of power, Trump's leadership during the pandemic has been erratic. He did back “Operation Warp Speed ” to quickly develop vaccines and treatments, but he also picked fights with leading government scientists like Dr. Anthony Fauci and his own appointees at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Biden has pledged to take his lead from science, and has named Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as his top medical adviser. He has tapped businessman Jeff Zients, who has a reputation for successfully tackling complex missions, to coordinate the government's coronavirus response. He's also selected Yale medicine professor Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, to head an effort to ensure equity and fairness for racial and ethnic minorities in access to vaccines and treatments.But he'll need more than top-resume talent, experts say. It's still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. Polls show it's particularly a problem among Black Americans. “It's important to acknowledge the reasons why it exists and work to earn trust and build vaccine confidence in communities,” said Gracia.Next Wednesday, when Biden will be sworn in as president, marks the one-year anniversary of the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-and-masks-biden-plan-aims-to-break-pandemic-cycle-101610600868962.html
14-01-2021||World||Boris Johnson warns hospitals on the brink as UK deaths hit record||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned intensive care units could be overwhelmed as the country hit its highest daily coronavirus death toll since the pandemic began.The premier said there is a “very substantial” risk of intensive care capacity in hospitals being “over-topped,” and urged people to follow lockdown rules to curb the spread of the disease.The UK reported a further 1,564 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test Wednesday, the highest number in a single day. It brings the total British death toll so far to 84,767.“We’re in for a pretty grim period, I’m afraid,” UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said on ITV’s “Peston.” “We’re in a period of high death numbers that’s going to carry on for some weeks.”England is currently in the second week of its third national lockdown amid a sharp rise in infections and hospitalizations in recent weeks. Schools are closed to most pupils, restaurants and non-essential shops shuttered, and people ordered to stay at home.The closures threaten to tip the economy into a double dip recession, prompting the government to hand out billions of pounds in additional aid to businesses.Despite the lockdown, Johnson’s government has faced calls to go further amid concerns the current rules are not working. Medical services are under intense pressure to treat an influx of patients, with more than 36,000 people in the hospital with the virus, according to the latest data, including almost 3,500 on ventilators.Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there have “now been more deaths in the second wave than the first.”Johnson told a panel of lawmakers on Wednesday there are 70% more inpatients than at the peak of the pandemic in April.“The risk is very substantial, and we have to keep the pressure off the NHS,” he said when pressed on intensive care capacity. “The only way to do that is follow the current lockdown.”There are signs the national lockdown is working, he said, with a “flattening, leveling off” of cases in some areas -- but it is “far, far too early” to say lockdown rules could be relaxed in mid-February as initially planned.A new strain of the disease from Brazil is a cause for concern and the government is looking at measures to prevent it being imported into the UK, Johnson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-warns-hospitals-on-the-brink-as-uk-deaths-hit-record-101610600599982.html
14-01-2021||World||Trump considering lawyer John Eastman for impeachment defense: Reports||President Donald Trump may hire a law professor who spoke at his rally before the riot at the U.S. Capitol to help defend him in an impeachment trial over a charge that he incited the violence, according to two people familiar with the matter.John Eastman, who joined Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on stage at the Jan. 6 rally, is being considered for a role on Trump's defense team, the people said.Giuliani, 76, who told the crowd they should engage in "trial by combat," may lead the impeachment defense, Reuters reported on Sunday, citing a source. Giuliani has not responded to requests for comment.Eastman, 60, who made unsubstantiated claims of election fraud at the rally, would neither confirm nor deny whether he will represent Trump, citing attorney-client privilege.Asked whether he would be willing, Eastman said: "If the President of the United States asked me to consider helping him, I would certainly give it consideration."The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Eastman and has declined to comment on Giuliani.The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday made Trump the first U.S. president to be impeached twice, charging him with inciting an insurrection as lawmakers sought to certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the Nov. 3 election.A former clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Eastman represented Trump last month in unsuccessful challenges to the election.At the rally, Eastman, who until Wednesday was a professor at Chapman University in California, spoke about "secret folders" of ballots used to defraud the election before Trump took the stage and repeated the discredited claim that the election was stolen from him.Faculty members and students, among others, subsequently called for Chapman to fire Eastman. In a statement on Wednesday, the university president said an agreement had been reached under which Eastman would immediately retire from Chapman.Eastman told Reuters he did not believe he did anything wrong. He does not think Trump has culpability, either. "None, whatsoever," he said.Eastman came under fire last summer for an op-ed he wrote in Newsweek that questioned whether Vice President-elect Kamala Harris was eligible to serve because her parents were not U.S. citizens or permanent residents.Newsweek later apologized for publishing the piece.Trump may have a tough time retaining legal talent. He has had trouble hiring lawyers since former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and the widespread condemnation of the violence at the Capitol and pressure from anti-Trump groups may discourage others from signing up.Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House in 2019 on charges that he pressured Ukraine's president to announce an investigation of his rival Biden, but was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate in February 2020.Giuliani’s own pressure on Ukraine helped lead to Trump’s impeachment trial.White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who helped lead the defense effort during the impeachment over Ukraine, is not expected to participate in the latest effort, according to one person familiar with the matter. Cipollone will leave his post on Jan. 20, when Biden becomes president.Jay Sekulow, another personal lawyer for Trump who played a role during the first impeachment, also is not expected to be involved.John Yoo, a conservative legal scholar who also clerked for Thomas and worked in the Department of Justice during the George W. Bush administration, said on Wednesday he did not think Trump would want him to represent him."I think he committed impeachable acts," said Yoo, although he added that he thought incitement was the wrong grounds and "the Senate should not convict him."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-considering-lawyer-john-eastman-for-impeachment-defense-reports-101610601826484.html
14-01-2021||World||Mitch McConnell open to convicting Donald Trump in impeachment trial||Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pointedly did not rule out that he might eventually vote to convict the now twice-impeached President Donald Trump, but he also blocked a quick Senate impeachment trial.Minutes after the House voted 232-197 on Wednesday to impeach Trump, McConnell said in a letter to his GOP colleagues that he’s not determined whether Trump should be convicted in the Senate's upcoming proceedings. The House impeachment articles charge that Trump incited insurrection by exhorting supporters who violently attacked the Capitol last week, resulting in five deaths and a disruption of Congress.“I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,” McConnell wrote.McConnell's openness was a stark contrast to the support, or at times silence, he’s shown during much of Trump’s presidency, and to the opposition he expressed rapidly when the House impeached Trump 13 months ago. McConnell will be Washington’s most powerful Republican once Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated, and McConnell’s increasingly chilly view of Trump could make it easier for other GOP lawmakers to turn against him.McConnell’s burgeoning alienation from Trump, plus the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him, underscored how the GOP’s long, reflexive support and condoning of Trump’s actions was eroding.McConnell also issued a statement saying Congress and the government should spend the next week “completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power” to Biden. He suggested Trump's Senate trial would begin no earlier than Jan. 19 — in effect rejecting a drive by the chamber's Democrats to begin the proceedings immediately so Trump could be ousted from office.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that unless McConnell reverses himself and agrees to quickly start the trial, it would begin after Jan. 19. That's a day before Biden is inaugurated as president and about the time Democrats take over majority control of the Senate. The timetable essentially means McConnell is dropping the trial into Democrats' laps.“Make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate," Schumer said. He added, “If the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again."The Constitution requires a two-thirds majority to convict a president, meaning at least 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats to oust Trump. If Trump were convicted, it would take only a simple majority of the Senate to prohibit Trump, who's mentioned running again in 2024, from holding federal office again.Earlier Wednesday, a GOP strategist said McConnell has told people he thinks Trump perpetrated impeachable offenses. McConnell also saw House Democrats’ drive to impeach Trump as an opportune moment to distance the GOP from the tumultuous, divisive outgoing president, according to the strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.McConnell's views were first reported by The New York Times.McConnell spoke to major Republican donors last weekend to assess their thinking about Trump and was told that they believed Trump had clearly crossed a line, the strategist said. McConnell told them he was finished with Trump, according to the consultant.The Democratic-led House approved an impeachment article accusing Trump of inciting insurrection, an unprecedented second impeachment of his clamorous presidency. Trump exhorted a throng of his followers to march on the Capitol last Wednesday, where they disrupted Congress' formal certification of Biden's win in a deadly riot that produced widespread damage.McConnell is looking out for his party’s long-term future, but moving toward a political divorce from Trump could mean that congressional Republicans will face challenges in GOP primaries.It is unclear how many Republicans would vote to convict Trump in a Senate trial, but it appears plausible that several would.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Wednesday told Alaska's News Source, an Anchorage news outlet, that Trump “has committed an impeachable offense." She stopped short of saying if she'd vote to convict him.Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., has said he would “definitely consider” House impeachment articles.Complicating GOP thinking about Trump’s second impeachment is that Republicans will be defending 20 of the 34 Senate seats up for election in 2022. Thanks to Democratic victories this month in two Georgia runoffs, Democrats are about to take control of the chamber by 50-50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes.Speaking out against impeachment Wednesday was Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. A once-bitter Trump foe, Graham became one of his closest allies during his presidency, then lambasted him over last week's Capitol invasion but has since spent time with Trump.Impeaching Trump now would “do great damage to the institutions of government and could invite further violence," Graham said in a statement. He said Trump's millions of backers “should not be demonized because of the despicable actions of a seditious mob," but he did not specifically defend Trump's actions last week.“If there was a time for America’s political leaders to bend a knee and ask for God’s counsel and guidance, it is now. The most important thing for leaders to do in times of crisis is to make things better, not worse," Graham said.When the Senate voted against removing Trump in February after the House impeached him for pressuring Ukraine to provide political dirt on Biden, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, was the only Republican who cast a vote to oust him.Trump has falsely insisted that November’s presidential election was stolen from him by fraud. Those allegations have been rejected by state officials of both parties, state and federal courts and members of his own administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mitch-mcconnell-open-to-convicting-donald-trump-in-impeachment-trial-101610601547171.html

Seeing our City in so much pain breaks my heart.”In the video, released on Twitter, he put forth an agenda that included a guaranteed minimum income, bringing universal high-speed Internet, starting a “people’s bank,” and reopening New York City “intelligently” from the pandemic.Yang joins more than two dozen people running for the seat, including Ray McGuire, the former vice chairman of Citigroup Inc.; Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams, city Comptroller Scott Stringer and former US Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan. Incumbent Mayor Bill de Blasio is prevented by term limits from running again. Some initial polling shows Yang will start as one of the early frontrunners in the race.Born in Schenectady, New York, to immigrants from Taiwan, Yang worked for several startups before becoming chief executive officer of a Manhattan test-preparation company that was sold to Kaplan Inc. in 2009. In 2017, he declared his run for president.Yang built his presidential campaign on a promise of $1,000 a month in universal basic income to every adult, with a tax on tech companies. He ended his bid in February 2020, but a longer-than-expected run throughout the Democratic primaries brought him a national platform that he used to campaign for President-Elect Joe Biden and Democrats who took control of the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/andrew-yang-officially-announces-candidacy-for-nyc-mayor-101610600579022.html

14-01-2021||World||WHO team lands in Wuhan to search for pandemic origins, quarantined for 2 weeks||A global team of researchers arrived Thursday in the Chinese city where the coronavirus pandemic was first detected to conduct a politically sensitive investigation into its origins amid uncertainty about whether Beijing might try to prevent embarrassing discoveries.The 10-member team sent to Wuhan by the World Health Organization was approved by President Xi Jinping's government after months of diplomatic wrangling that prompted an unusual public complaint by the head of the WHO. They arrived Thursday, state media CGTN reported on Thursday.Scientists suspect the virus that has killed 1.9 million people since late 2019 jumped to humans from bats or other animals, most likely in China's southwest. The ruling Communist Party, stung by complaints it allowed the disease to spread, says the virus came from abroad, possibly on imported seafood, but scientists reject that.The WHO team includes virus and other experts from the United States, Australia, Germany, Japan, Britain, Russia, the Netherlands, Qatar and Vietnam.A government spokesman said this week they will “exchange views” with Chinese scientists but gave no indication whether they would be allowed to gather evidence.They will undergo a two-week quarantine as well as a throat swab test and an antibody test for Covid-19, according to a post on CGTN’s official Weibo account. They are to start working with Chinese experts via video conference while in quarantine.China rejected demands for an international investigation after the Trump administration blamed Beijing for the virus's spread, which plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s.After Australia called in April for an independent inquiry, Beijing retaliated by blocking imports of Australian beef, wine and other goods.One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan, one of the WHO team members, zoologist Peter Daszak of the U.S. group EcoHealth Alliance, told the Associated Press in November.A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the virus's origins; pinning down an outbreak's animal reservoir is typically an exhaustive endeavor that takes years of research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.“The government should be very transparent and collaborative," said Shin-Ru Shih, director at the Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections at Taiwan's Chang Gung University.The Chinese government has tried to stir confusion about the virus's origin. It has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of tainted seafood, a notion rejected by international scientists and agencies."The WHO will need to conduct similar investigations in other places,” an official of the National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said Wednesday.Some of the WHO team were en route to China a week ago but had to turn back after Beijing announced they hadn't received valid visas.That might have been a “bureaucratic bungle,” but the incident "raises the question if the Chinese authorities were trying to interfere,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a health expert at the University of Sydney.A possible focus for investigators is the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the city where the outbreak began. One of China's top virus research labs, it built an archive of genetic information about bat coronaviruses after the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.According to WHO's published agenda for its origins research, there are no plans to assess whether there might have been an accidental release of the coronavirus at the Wuhan lab, as some American politicians, including President Donald Trump, have claimed.A “scientific audit” of Institute records and safety measures would be a “routine activity,” said Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. He said that depends on how willing Chinese authorities are to share information.“There’s a big element of trust here,” Woolhouse said.An AP investigation found the government imposed controls on research into the outbreak and bars scientists from speaking to reporters.The coronavirus's exact origin may never be traced because viruses change quickly, said Woolhouse.Although it may be challenging to find precisely the same Covid-19 virus in animals as in humans, discovering closely related viruses might help explain how the disease first jumped from animals and clarify what preventive measures are needed to avoid future epidemics.Scientists should focus instead on making a “comprehensive picture” of the virus to help respond to future outbreaks, Woolhouse said.“Now is not the time to blame anyone," Shih said. “We shouldn’t say, it’s your fault.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-lands-in-wuhan-to-search-for-pandemic-origins-quarantined-for-2-weeks-101610597639838.html

14-01-2021||World||Now that Trump is impeached (again), what's next?||The US House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump on Wednesday for a second time -- just days before he is scheduled to leave office -- raising questions about what happens next.The House voted 232-197 to impeach the president, with 10 members of Trump's Republican Party joining 222 Democrats.Here are some of the possible scenarios after the House impeached Trump for inciting last week's attack by his supporters on the US Capitol as Congress certified Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory:- Senate trial -Now that Trump has been impeached, it is up to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to submit the article of impeachment to the Senate at a time of her choosing.The Senate would then hold a trial.That's what happened last year after Trump was impeached in 2019 by the Democratic-controlled House for pressuring the leader of Ukraine to dig up political dirt on Biden.Trump was acquitted by the Republican-majority Senate in February 2020.This time, however, Trump has only a week left in the White House and Biden is to be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on January 20.The Senate is currently in recess and is not scheduled to return until January 19.Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could call the Senate back early and hold an emergency session -- but McConnell ruled that out.Even if the Senate did move "promptly," there is no way it could conduct a trial before Biden is inaugurated and Trump leaves office, McConnell said in a statement."Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week," he said.McConnell noted that the three previous presidential impeachment trials had lasted 83 days, 37 days, and 21 days.Schumer, in a statement welcoming Trump's impeachment by the House, said that regardless of when it starts "make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate.""Donald Trump has deservedly become the first president in American history to bear the stain of impeachment twice over," Schumer said. "The Senate is required to act and will proceed with his trial and hold a vote on his conviction."- Post-presidency trial? -While three US presidents have been impeached, none has ever been tried by the Senate after leaving office.All three previous presidential impeachments -- those of Trump and presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton -- occurred while the leaders were still in the White House.Like Trump, both Johnson -- in 1868 -- and Clinton -- in 1998-99 -- were impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate.Some constitutional scholars argue that an ex-president cannot be tried by the Senate.But the House has impeached and the Senate has tried former senators and judges after they were no longer in office or on the bench.If a trial begins after January 20, Republicans would no longer hold a majority in the Senate and Schumer would be the majority leader.While no longer in control of the Senate, McConnell would continue to have a powerful voice among his Republican colleagues and he has not ruled out convicting Trump."While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate," McConnell said.The Republican senator from Kentucky thwarted the last bid to convict Trump in the Senate, managing to rally all Republican senators with the exception of Mitt Romney of Utah to vote for acquittal.But McConnell believes Trump did commit impeachable offenses, according to press reports, and sees an opportunity to rid the Republican Party of the real estate tycoon once and for all.A two-thirds majority of the senators present is needed to convict the president, meaning that if all of them are in the chamber at least 17 Republicans would have to join Democrats in voting for conviction.Schumer said the Senate will not only vote on convicting Trump for "high crimes and misdemeanors" but will also hold a vote that could bar him from running again for federal office.Trump has expressed interest in potentially running for president again in 2024 and a simple majority vote of the Senate could bar him from another White House run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-that-trump-is-impeached-again-what-s-next-101610589744201.html
14-01-2021||World||Armed guards, fences: Washington under heavy security as Donald Trump impeached||Downtown Washington was fenced off and boarded up Wednesday, with concrete barriers blocking avenues, police at street corners, and armed National Guard soldiers patrolling Capitol Hill as Congress impeached President Donald Trump for a second time.The city at the heart of US democracy has been a shadow of itself during pandemic shutdowns, but now it is also under heavy guard after the January 6 deadly attack by Trump supporters on the Congress building.Also Read: US House convenes to impeach Donald Trump for his role in Capitol assaultNational Guard soldiers in body armor and camouflage spent the night inside the Capitol, their black rifles leaning against the polished stone walls of the building's halls.Some 20,000 National Guard soldiers are expected in Washington for Biden's inauguration, more than the combined number of US troops officially deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.Lawmakers on Wednesday formally accused Trump of inciting the mob that attacked the Capitol last week in a failed effort to stop Congress from finalizing the president's November loss to Joe Biden.The House voted 232-197 to impeach the president, with 10 members of Trump's Republican Party joining 222 Democrats.The Capitol building grounds are ringed by a security fence erected after the attack, similar to the one raised around the White House months ago when protests erupted nationwide against police killings of African Americans.The US capital, known for its historical monuments, museums and crowds of tourists, has had a rough ride over the past 12 months.'Ghost of itself' Navigating the once humming downtown on foot, it is difficult to tell which buildings have been shuttered by the pandemic and which simply shut up shop due to the violent protests the city has been seeing."This is my first time (in downtown Washington) in a year. There's usually people walking all over the place. This is very, very quiet. I almost think it's like a ghost of itself," said Jaime, a mother from Maryland who did not wish to give her full name.Also Read: Move to impeach continuation of greatest witch hunt in political history: TrumpHordes of schoolchildren who normally travel from all over the country to visit museums and see the White House now stay away, as do most foreign tourists.The hectic jostle of politicians, lobbyists and lawyers on the street has also fallen quiet, while the large metro stations that bring workers in from suburbs are quiet and little-used.The city of more than 700,000 inhabitants is subdued, one week before the inauguration of Biden on the steps of the Capitol."The city is basically desolate," said Nadine Seiler, 55, who has been demonstrating every day since the end of October near the White House in favor of anti-racist causes."Usually it's very stressful, but here it's like everybody's away on vacation," she added.As in many Western cities, many workers have been signing in from home -- especially staff at big institutions headquartered in Washington such as the World Bank and the IMF, as well as the countless government agencies.Eateries must try to survive by erecting tents and marquees along sidewalks, and tempting customers to sit down next to heaters of varying efficiency battling the winter cold."I went to the Christmas market... that's gone, all that's gone. You go into bars, (previously) packed bars -- it's gone," laments Timothy Bartholomew, a resident of Arlington, just over the Potomac River in neighboring Virginia.Violent protestsAccording to the specialist site Eater, nearly 70 restaurants have permanently closed in Washington since the start of the pandemic, and many others are boarded up with no certainty they will ever reopen.Violent protests and unrest have shaken Washington repeatedly in the last year.After the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis in May, Washington became one of the hotspots of nationwide anti-racist demonstrations.City authorities painted huge yellow letters reading "Black Lives Matter" across a wide street outside the White House, and the location became a popular site for rallies.But over the months, clashes between anti-racism activists and pro-Trump protesters have brought an edge of tension to the city.Roads and sidewalks have been gradually shut down around the White House, with the security cordon now holding people far back from Trump's residence.Police patrol vehicles keep their flashing lights on at all times and block streets normally streaming with traffic, while high metal fences surround many government buildings such as the US Treasury.Crowds cheering Biden's inauguration on January 20 will be thin on the ground, as authorities have urged Americans to avoid the city, fearing more violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-guards-fences-washington-under-heavy-security-as-donald-trump-impeached-101610589435397.html
14-01-2021||World||Trump urges no more violence as his impeachment looms in House||President Donald Trump called for no more violence or vandalism ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration after inciting a deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol last week.“In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,” Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.”Trump issued the statement ahead of an impeachment vote Wednesday afternoon in the House of Representatives. He continues to face bans across social media sites for stoking the mob that stormed the Capitol last week, leaving at least five dead.Trump rebuffed calls for him to resign, and Vice President Mike Pence has said he won’t force him out. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate wouldn’t return early from recess, all but guaranteeing that any impeachment trial will take place after Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.Before the attack, Trump delivered a speech to his supporters gathered near the White House in which he repeated falsehoods about vote fraud and then urged them to march to the Capitol and “fight much harder” to ensure he remained president.Trump called for peace after last Wednesday’s riot but never accepted responsibility for the attack, describing his remarks as “totally appropriate.” He acknowledged a “new administration” would take office on Jan. 20 but didn’t concede that he lost the November election, which he has baselessly claimed was tainted by fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-urges-no-more-violence-as-his-impeachment-looms-in-house-101610589080919.html
14-01-2021||World||Trump confronts political future with burden of historic rebuke||Donald Trump’s political future suffered a grave blow on Wednesday after the House impeached him for a second time, an unprecedented rebuke that may result in the White House doors being forever shut to him.Ten Republicans crossed the aisle to join all House Democrats in declaring that Trump deserved removal from office for inciting an insurrection, offering a withering coda to the president’s inglorious fall.Unable to manage the coronavirus pandemic and persuade voters to return him to the White House, the president instead inspired a violent and conspiracy-fueled attack on the seat of American democracy.The backlash against Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol has been swift, creating an unprecedented test of the vise-like grip he’s held on his party since his 2016 political ascendance. The Capitol riot the president helped incite sparked a wave of resignations across the administration, led to the president’s banishment from Twitter, and prompted corporate leaders to suspend donations to Republicans who peddled false allegations of widespread voter fraud.The Senate now must hold its second impeachment trial of Trump, likely after he’s already left office. A post-presidential conviction could bar Trump from ever seeking federal office again.While few Republican senators have said where they stand on the matter, the GOP leader, Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, left open the possibility he’ll vote to convict in a letter to colleagues on Wednesday.Regardless of the outcome, the events of the past week have shaken the pillars of American politics and point to a fraught road ahead for the Republican party.Trump’s impeachment will undoubtedly cement his status as a martyr among his most loyal followers, who have cast the move as the latest effort by Washington to attack and undermine an outsider who threatened the status quo. But several Republicans, including Representatives Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and John Katko, spoke out forcefully against Trump’s actions and voted to impeach.“This is a vote of conscience,” Cheney said Wednesday. “It’s one where there are different views in our conference. But our nation is facing an unprecedented, since the Civil War, constitutional crisis. That’s what we need to be focused on.”Some members of the party, though, tried to have it both ways. Loath to defend Trump’s actions, they instead argued that impeachment undermined President-elect Joe Biden’s call for the country to unify in the aftermath of a presidency that has worn the nation thin. Trump was impeached by a 232-197 vote.‘Tremendous Anger’Trump, for his part, has maintained the same vaguely threatening posture that helped foment the crisis in the first place. On Tuesday, he blamed the media and Democrats for “a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics.”“I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country and it’s causing tremendous anger,” he said.He issued a statement Wednesday, as the House debated impeachment, that called for peace.“In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,” he said. “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for.”But the violent riot has tested the loyalty of some of Trump’s longtime enablers and allies. He alienated Mike Pence by tweeting that the vice president “didn’t have the courage” to illegally declare Trump the winner of an election he had lost, further inflaming his supporters before the riot.Pence, in the Capitol at the time presiding over the congressional count of Electoral College votes, had to flee the mob with other lawmakers.Several top administration officials canceled international travel or cut trips short this week out of concern that foreign adversaries might seek to exploit the U.S. political crisis and a White House under strain.Trump’s attention will now turn to minimizing fallout from the impeachment vote on any possible second act in political life, while attempting to paint the consequences for his role instigating the riot as overblown and unfair.His most immediate concern may be whipping support in the Senate, which needs a two-thirds vote to convict. More than a dozen Republicans would need to join Democrats to remove him from office. While Trump’s electoral loss and subsequent behavior has eroded his standing with many in the party, only one GOP senator -- Utah’s Mitt Romney -- voted to convict during Trump’s first impeachment trial less than a year ago.Even out of office, Senate conviction would be more than an embarrassment for the president. He would go down in history as the only president ever impeached and convicted, and senators could subsequently move to disqualify Trump from seeking federal office ever again, a measure requiring only a simple majority vote.And fighting conviction could prove financially costly to Trump as well. Since he won’t be president, he won’t have a taxpayer-funded White House counsel’s office to defend him.He already faces mounting financial pressure. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will cancel some $17 million in contracts with the president’s company, Trump Organization, including deals to operate skating rinks and a golf course. Stripe Inc. said earlier this week it would halt payment processing for Trump’s campaign.And investigators for New York’s attorney general continue to examine Trump’s tax records and whether he broke the law by making hush-money payments to women who claimed he’d had affairs with them before his election.Impeachment could also mean the loss of pensions for the president and first lady Melania Trump, as well as federal funds for a post-presidential office and staff, though legal opinions are split on the matter.Trump’s FutureSeparately, the president will try desperately to frame the impeachment effort within a broader narrative of persecution and grievance that he’s channeled throughout his presidency.It worked before, when his approval ratings rebounded in the aftermath of the special counsel investigation into his campaign’s alleged ties with Russia, and after the Senate failed to convict him following his impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to launch an investigation into Biden and his son.But Trump’s role in the riot -- which broke out shortly after he encouraged supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight much harder” against his political opponents -- is less complicated. Just 33% of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of his job in a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday.And the mob scene at the Capitol only exacerbated perceptions Trump had become politically toxic. Not only was the president unable to win re-election, but GOP control of the Senate evaporated when two incumbent Republicans in Georgia lost despite the president campaigning on their behalf -- all before the chaos unfolded in the halls of Congress.Trump will hope once again to defy expectations by operating outside the mainstream, though his options may prove dwindling. Fringe conservative cable channels have found themselves under threat of legal action for echoing the Trump campaign’s allegations about rigged voting machines, while Cumulus Media told conservative talk radio hosts to stop suggesting the election had been stolen, according to Inside Music Media.And Trump’s role in the riot cost him his most important megaphone, his @realDonaldTrump Twitter account, now permanently suspended.Trump has already said he is considering launching his own alternative social media network in the wake of his ban and on Wednesday sought to place his troubles with technology companies within a broader conservative narrative alleging discrimination and persecution.“They shouldn’t be doing it,” Trump said. “But there’s always a counter move when they do that.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-confronts-political-future-with-burden-of-historic-rebuke-101610586380559.html
14-01-2021||World||Covid-19 infection gives some immunity for at least five months, UK study finds||People who have had Covid-19 are highly likely to have immunity to it for at least five months but there is evidence that those with antibodies may still be able to carry and spread the virus, a UK study of healthcare workers has found.Preliminary findings by scientists at Public Health England (PHE) showed that reinfections in people who have Covid-19 antibodies from a past infection are rare - with only 44 cases found among 6,614 previously infected people in the study.But experts cautioned that the findings mean people who contracted the disease in the first wave of the pandemic in the early months of 2020 may now be vulnerable to catching it again.They also warned that people with so-called "natural immunity" - acquired through having had the infection - may still be able carry the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in their nose and throat, and could unwittingly pass it on.“We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts," said Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE and co-leader of the study, whose findings were published on Thursday.“This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections. But there is still a risk you could acquire an infection and transmit (it) to others."A statement on the study said its findings did not address antibody or other immune responses to vaccines now being rolled out against Covid-19, or on how effective vaccines would be. Vaccine responses will be considered later this year, it said.The research, known as the SIREN study, involves tens of thousands of healthcare workers in Britain who have been tested regularly since June for new Covid-19 infections as well as for the presence of antibodies.Between June 18 and Nov. 24 scientists detected 44 potential reinfections - two "probable" and 42 "possible" - out of 6,614 participants who had tested positive for antibodies. This represents an 83% rate of protection from reinfection, they said.The researchers plan to continue following and assessing the participants to see if this natural immunity might last longer than five months in some. But they warned that early evidence from the next stage of the study already suggests some people with immunity can still carry high levels of virus and could transmit it to others."It is therefore crucial that everyone continues to follow the rules and stays at home, even if they have previously had Covid-19," they said in the statement about their results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-infection-gives-some-immunity-for-at-least-five-months-uk-study-finds-101610587612065.html
14-01-2021||World||Impeachment or the 14th Amendment: Can Trump be barred from future office?||Some U.S. lawmakers have said President Donald Trump should be disqualified from holding political office again following his impeachment on Wednesday for inciting a mob that stormed the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory.Now that the House has impeached Trump, the Senate will hold a trial on whether to remove him and possibly bar him from future office.Legal experts said disqualification could be accomplished through the impeachment proceedings or the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.Here is how the disqualification effort could play out.CAN TRUMP'S DISQUALIFICATION BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH IMPEACHMENT?   The U.S. Constitution says there are two ways to punish an impeached official: removal from office or “disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States."The House approved a single article of impeachment accusing Trump of inciting insurrection when he delivered an incendiary speech to supporters shortly before the pro-Trump mob rampaged the Capitol.Trump is likely to argue at trial that his remarks were free speech protected by the Constitution's First Amendment and that, while he told supporters to "fight," he did not intend it as a literal call to violence.Removing an official requires a "conviction" by a two-thirds Senate majority under the Constitution. Under precedent, only a simple majority is needed for disqualification. Historically, that vote only happens after a conviction.Three federal officials in U.S. history have been disqualified through impeachment proceedings. All three were federal judges.Most recently, in 2010 the Senate removed and disqualified from future office a Louisiana judge found to have engaged in corruption.There is some debate over the scope of the disqualification clause and whether it applies to the presidency, said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University.Analyzing historical documents, some law experts say the founders did not intend the presidency to be considered an "office" under the disqualification clause, while others argue that the term applies.CAN TRUMP BE DISQUALIFIED IF HE IS NOT CONVICTED BY THE SENATE?This is uncharted legal territory, and there is no clear answer, scholars said.Paul Campos, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Colorado, said he believed a vote to disqualify Trump can be held even if there are not enough votes for conviction. The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that the Senate has wide latitude to determine how it conducts a trial, he said.But Kalt said he thought disqualification would require conviction first. To do otherwise would be the equivalent of punishing the president for an offense he did not commit, Kalt said.All three judges who were disqualified from office were first convicted.WHAT ABOUT THE 14TH AMENDMENT?Section 3 of the 14th Amendment provides an alternative path for disqualification.The provision states that no person shall hold office if they have engaged in "insurrection or rebellion" against the United States. It was enacted following the Civil War to bar Confederates from holding public office.Under congressional precedent, only a simple majority of both chambers is needed to invoke this penalty. Congress can later remove the disqualification, but only if two-thirds of both houses vote in favor of doing so.In 1919, Congress used the 14th Amendment to block an elected official, Victor Berger, from assuming his seat in the House because he had actively opposed U.S. intervention in World War I.The text of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not explain how it should be invoked.Another section the 14th Amendment, Section 5, empowers Congress to enforce the entire amendment through "appropriate legislation.” Some scholars have interpreted this language to mean that a majority of both chambers of Congress could enact a law applying a ban to a particular president, like Trump."The 14th Amendment route is very unclear as to what it would take to get it rolling," said Kalt. "I think it would require some combination of legislation and litigation."COULD TRUMP CHALLENGE A DISQUALIFICATION IN COURT?It is certainly possible, said Kalt.A Supreme Court case from 1993 makes clear that the court is wary of second-guessing how the Senate handles impeachment. In that case, involving an accused judge, the court said whether the Senate had properly tried an impeachment was a political question and could not be litigated.If Trump is disqualified, the current Supreme Court might want to clarify whether the move was lawful, Kalt said.Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court's nine members: Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and most recently Amy Coney Barrett. The court now has a six-judge conservative majority."If you are going to say someone can't run, you want to get that litigated and settled sooner rather than later," Kalt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impeachment-or-the-14th-amendment-can-trump-be-barred-from-future-office-101610587186543.html
14-01-2021||World||Twitter CEO breaks silence on ban on Trump, says he doesn't feel proud||For the first time after imposing a permanent ban on US outgoing president Donald Trump, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey broke his silence on the contentious move and said that he was not proud of the action as it has been a failure of the microblogging site to promote healthy conversation. But it was the right decision for Twitter, he said.Defending the decision, Jack wrote that the action was taken only after a clear warning and the decision was made with the best information on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter.Also Read: Twitter permanently suspends Donald Trump's accountBut now that the action of the tech company has triggered a debate over freedom of expression, he took it on himself to explain why it was the right decision.Here is what he said in his statement."I do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here. After a clear warning, we’d take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter. Was this correct?"I believe this was the right decision for Twitter. We faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all. That said, having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications. While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us."Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation. They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation. The check and accountability on this power has always been the fact that a service like Twitter is one small part of the larger public conversation happening across the internet. If folks do not agree with our rules and enforcement, they can simply go to another internet service. This concept was challenged last week when a number of foundational internet tool providers also decided not to host what they found dangerous. I do not believe this was coordinated. More likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others."This moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term, it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet. A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same. Yes, we all need to look critically at inconsistencies of our policy and enforcement. Yes, we need to look at how our service might incentivize distraction and harm. Yes, we need more transparency in our moderation operations. All this can’t erode a free and open global internet.Also Read: Twitter suspends Trump's campaign account @TeamTrump for violating its rules"The reason I have so much passion for #Bitcoin is largely because of the model it demonstrates: a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity. This is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be. We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet. We call it @bluesky."This will take time to build. We are in the process of interviewing and hiring folks, looking at both starting a standard from scratch or contributing to something that already exists. No matter the ultimate direction, we will do this work completely through public transparency. It’s important that we acknowledge this is a time of great uncertainty and struggle for so many around the world. Our goal in this moment is to disarm as much as we can, and ensure we are all building towards a greater common understanding, and a more peaceful existence on earth. I believe the internet and global public conversation is our best and most relevant method of achieving this. I also recognize it does not feel that way today. Everything we learn in this moment will better our effort, and push us to be what we are: one humanity working together."Twitter, the San Francisco-based company, first suspended Donald Trump's account after he posted tweets misleading users about the presidential election results, which apparently encouraged the mob violence at US Capitol. After his account was restored, he tweeted that he would not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration which Twitter said violated the company's policies when "read in the context of broader events in the country".It was then that Twitter decided to ban Trump completely on the platform citing "risk of further incitement of violence".The action evoked strong reaction from other world leaders most of whom concurred that social media platforms should be accountable.United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said private social media companies make their own moderation decisions, but they should be accountable.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has reservations about the way Donald Trump's Twitter account was suspended, her spokesman said, adding that legislators, not private companies, should decide on any necessary curbs to free expression.Addressing these concerns, Jack in his statement endorsed the way Bitcoin functions — a technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity.Twitter's 'BlueSky' initiative may lead Twitter to a Bitcoin-like operation, Jack said. In 2019, Jack first talked about 'Blue Sky' which is aimed at developing an open and decentralised standard for social media. Twitter is in the process of interviewing and hiring people for Blue Sky, he said in his statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-ceo-breaks-silence-on-ban-on-trump-says-he-doesn-t-feel-proud-101610586309067.html
14-01-2021||World||Biden Inauguration Day: Agencies gear up to prevent repeat of US Capitol chaos||Overwhelmed during the deadly attack on Congress by President Donald Trump's supporters last week, U.S. security forces are mounting a national operation to thwart any violence before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.Federal and state officials are evaluating online threats and menacing messages to members of Congress and making sure the security operation has the force to repel an attack.The incoming Biden administration has significantly ramped up security around his team ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration.The riot at the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6 forced lawmakers to flee the inner chambers of the building, fearing for their lives.One police officer and four protesters died in the siege, which began after Trump called on thousands of supporters to march on Congress in a bid to stop the final certification of Biden's election victory.Trump, who falsely claims he lost the election because of fraud, faced impeachment in the House of Representatives on Wednesday for encouraging his supporters to march on Congress. He has also faced growing calls to resign.The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned that armed protests in support of Trump were planned for Washington and all 50 U.S. state capitals this weekend or around Biden's inauguration.Local officials have been ramping up security, especially in the battleground states where Biden narrowly beat Trump."It is clear that more must be done to preempt, penetrate, and prevent deadly and seditious assaults by domestic violent extremists in the days ahead," two senior House Democrats, Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff, said in a statement on Tuesday.The biggest single security operation is in Washington, where Biden will be sworn in outside the Capitol next Wednesday.Some 20,000 National Guard troops will be available for Biden's inauguration, and half of those will be in the city by Saturday in case protests explode this weekend.National Guard troops were assigned to provide 24-hour security inside the halls of Congress and deputized as Capitol Police officers, enabling them to make arrests.The National Park Service has closed the Washington Monument through Jan. 24, and home-sharing company Airbnb said it was blocking and cancelling all reservations in the Washington area to discourage protesters from descending on the capital.In Wisconsin, Governor Tony Evers authorized National Guard troops to support security efforts in the state capital of Madison. Georgia's top court canceled all in-person proceedings on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20 as a precaution."While individual state capitals have been subject to threats and actual violence across the years, the current environment is unique at least since the weeks following Sept. 11, 2001," said James Nash, spokesman for the bipartisan National Governors Association.FAR-RIGHT PLANS UNCLEARConflicting messages have surfaced in far-right chat rooms and forums about possible protests around Biden's inauguration.The website of Patriot Action for America, which was recently taken down, called for supporters to encircle the White House, Congress and Supreme Court days before "to, at all costs, prevent Joseph Biden, or any other democrat from being inaugurated."An image posted to the pro-Trump website The Donald called for protesters to "stand up for liberty" with armed marches on Jan. 17 at the U.S. Capitol and in state capitals, according to SITE Intelligence Group, a Maryland-based organization that tracks extremists.But users on some other far-right forums cautioned people not to attend the events, which they warned might be part of a plot to ensnare them.Trump has defended his Jan. 6 speech to supporters before they marched to Congress as "totally appropriate," but he had a different message on Wednesday as public criticism from his fellow Republicans grew."In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind," Trump said in a statement.Acting U.S. Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli on Tuesday appeared to downplay the threat at state capitols."There's a lot of statements out there. And while we need to take them seriously, at the same time it would be an incredible unlikelihood to see what is described in those threats actually take place," Cuccinelli said in an interview with Fox News Channel.Still, a congressional source familiar with intelligence reporting and analysis said the FBI is "taking pretty seriously" the warnings of Inauguration Day protests.Multiple investigations are under way into how Trump's supporters were able to storm the Capitol building, and whether some public officials participated. IAt least two Capitol police officers have been suspended and more than a dozen others are under investigation for alleged dereliction of duty, aiding or abetting rioters. Off-duty police alleged to have participated in the riot have also been suspended by departments outside Washington.Dozens of cases are being investigated for potential charges ranging from sedition to felony murder related to the riot, in what acting D.C. Attorney General Sherwin called a "significant" counterterrorism probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-inauguration-day-forces-gear-up-to-prevent-repeat-of-us-capitol-chaos-101610585672666.html
14-01-2021||World||'Can begin immediately': Senate minority leader on Trump impeachment trial||After US House impeached President Donald Trump for his role in inciting last week's deadly riot at Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that a trial can "begin immediately" if the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agrees."A Senate trial can begin immediately, with agreement from the current Senate majority leader to reconvene the Senate for an emergency session, or it will begin after January 19," CNN quoted Schumer as saying in a statement.He further said, "But make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again."Senate leader McConnell had earlier said that he would not reconvene the upper house of the Congress before January 19. He also said that he has not made a final decision on how he will vote in the impeachment trial, stating he intends to listen to the arguments when they are presented.According to a report by CNN, McConnell has sent a note to his Republican colleagues this afternoon on impeachment, writing "while the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate."The House of Representatives on Wednesday (local time) impeached President Donald Trump for "inciting" last week's deadly violence at Capitol Hill.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed the impeachment making Trump the first US president to be impeached twice. Congress voted 232 to 197 on the single article of impeachment charging Trump with "incitement of insurrection".Trump now faces a trial in the Senate. According to McConnell, the trial is unlikely to be held before January 20, the inauguration of incoming president Joe Biden.

14-01-2021||World||Donald Trump becomes first US President to be impeached twice||President Donald Trump was impeached by the US House for a historic second time Wednesday, charged with “incitement of insurrection” over the deadly mob siege of the Capitol in a swift and stunning collapse of his final days in office.With the Capitol secured by armed National Guard troops inside and out, the House voted 232-197 to impeach Trump. The proceedings moved at lightning speed, with lawmakers voting just one week after violent pro-Trump loyalists stormed the US Capitol, urged on by the president’s calls for them to “fight like hell” against the election results.Ten Republicans fled Trump, joining Democrats who said he needed to be held accountable and warned ominously of a “clear and present danger” if Congress should leave him unchecked before Democrat Joe Biden’s inauguration January 20.Trump is the only US president to be twice impeached.The Capitol insurrection stunned and angered lawmakers, who were sent scrambling for safety as the mob descended, and it revealed the fragility of the nation’s history of peaceful transfers of power. The riot also forced a reckoning among some Republicans, who have stood by Trump throughout his presidency and largely allowed him to spread false attacks against the integrity of the 2020 election.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invoked Abraham Lincoln and the Bible, imploring lawmakers to uphold their oath to defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign “and domestic.”She said of Trump: “He must go, he is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.”Holed up at the White House, watching the proceedings on TV, Trump took no responsibility for the bloody riot seen around the world, but issued a statement urging “NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind" to disrupt Biden's ascension to the White House.In the face of the accusations against him and with the FBI warning of more violence, Trump said, “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.”Trump was first impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine, but the Senate voted in 2020 acquit. He is the first to be impeached twice. None has been convicted by the Senate, but Republicans said Wednesday that could change in the rapidly shifting political environment as officeholders, donors, big business and others peel away from the defeated president.The soonest Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell would start an impeachment trial is next Tuesday, the day before Trump is already set to leave the White House, McConnell's office said. The legislation is also intended to prevent Trump from ever running again.McConnell believes Trump committed impeachable offenses and considers the Democrats’ impeachment drive an opportunity to reduce the divisive, chaotic president’s hold on the GOP, a Republican strategist told The Associated Press on Wednesday.McConnell told major donors over the weekend that he was through with Trump, said the strategist, who demanded anonymity to describe McConnell’s conversations.In a note to colleagues Wednesday, McConnell said he had “not made a final decision on how I will vote.”Unlike his first time, Trump faces this impeachment as a weakened leader, having lost his own reelection as well as the Senate Republican majority.Even Trump ally Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, shifted his position and said Wednesday the president bears responsibility for the horrifying day at the Capitol.In making a case for the “high crimes and misdemeanors” demanded in the Constitution, the four-page impeachment resolution approved Wednesday relies on Trump’s own incendiary rhetoric and the falsehoods he spread about Biden’s election victory, including at a rally near the White House on the day of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.A Capitol Police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot and killed a woman during the siege. Three other people died in what authorities said were medical emergencies. The riot delayed the tally of Electoral College votes that was the last step in finalizing Biden’s victory.Ten Republican lawmakers, including third-ranking House GOP leader Liz Cheney of Wyoming, voted to impeach Trump, cleaving the Republican leadership, and the party itself.Cheney, whose father is the former Republican vice president, said of Trump's actions summoning the mob that "there has never been a greater betrayal by a President” of his office.Trump was said to be livid with perceived disloyalty from McConnell and Cheney.With the team around Trump hollowed out and his Twitter account silenced by the social media company, the president was deeply frustrated that he could not hit back, according to White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing who weren’t authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.From the White House, Trump leaned on Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to push Republican senators to resist, while chief of staff Mark Meadows called some of his former colleagues on Capitol Hill.The president’s sturdy popularity with the GOP lawmakers’ constituents still had some sway, and most House Republicans voted not to impeach.Security was exceptionally tight at the Capitol, with tall fences around the complex. Metal-detector screenings were required for lawmakers entering the House chamber, where a week earlier lawmakers huddled inside as police, guns drawn, barricade the door from rioters.“We are debating this historic measure at a crime scene,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.During the debate, some Republicans repeated the falsehoods spread by Trump about the election and argued that the president has been treated unfairly by Democrats from the day he took office.Other Republicans argued the impeachment was a rushed sham and complained about a double standard applied to his supporters but not to the liberal left. Some simply appealed for the nation to move on.Rep. Tom McClintock of California said, “Every movement has a lunatic fringe."Yet Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo. and others recounted the harrowing day as rioters pounded on the chamber door trying to break in. Some called it a “coup” attempt.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., contended that Trump was “capable of starting a civil war.”Conviction and removal of Trump would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate, which will be evenly divided. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania joined Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska over the weekend in calling for Trump to “go away as soon as possible.”Fending off concerns that an impeachment trial would bog down his first days in office, Biden is encouraging senators to divide their time between taking taking up his priorities of confirming his nominees and approving COVID-19 relief while also conducting the trial.The impeachment bill draws from Trump’s own false statements about his election defeat to Biden. Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases challenging the election results, and former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud.The House had first tried to persuade Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke their authority under the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Pence declined to do so, but the House passed the resolution anyway.The impeachment bill also details Trump’s pressure on state officials in Georgia to “find” him more votes.While some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, there is precedent. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-becomes-first-us-president-to-be-impeached-twice-101610576864652.html
14-01-2021||World||US bans entry of Xinjiang cotton products, tomatoes over forced labor claims||The US will bar entry of all cotton products and tomatoes from China’s Xinjiang region, where it says Beijing is oppressing Muslim-minority Uighurs.The move is the latest in a string where the US is raising pressure on China over some companies’ alleged ill-treatment of workers. The US says the Chinese government has detained more than 1 million Uighurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in “re-education” internment camps, allegations that the Foreign Ministry in Beijing denies.“Forced labor is a form of modern slavery,” Acting Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli said on a call with reporters Wednesday. “‘Made in China’ doesn’t just indicate country of origin -- it’s a warning label.”The US imported $9 billion of cotton products in the past year and $10 million of tomatoes from China, Brenda Smith, the executive assistant commissioner in the office for trade at Customs and Border Protection, said on the call.In September, CBP said it planned a so-called withhold release order, or WRO, covering all cotton, textile and tomato products from the country’s northwestern Xinjiang region. CBP has already issued WROs against three Xinjiang-based hair-product and garment producers in 2020 and plans six more in addition to the blanket Xinjiang order.In December, the US-based Center for Global Policy published a report alleging new evidence from Chinese government documents and media reports of hundreds of thousands of Uighurs in Xinjiang being forced to pick cotton by hand through coercive state-mandated labor.President-elect Joe Biden has labeled China’s mass detention and re-education program for Xinjiang’s Uighur minority as “genocide” and called for an international effort to make a united stand against the campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bans-entry-of-xinjiang-cotton-products-tomatoes-over-forced-labor-claims-101610559674082.html
14-01-2021||World||Rare Tintin comic book art set to sell for millions in Paris||Not even the coronavirus can get in the way of intrepid Belgian reporter and comic book legend Tintin.Comic book lovers and tourists alike can catch a socially distanced glimpse of a Tintin drawing by Herge in Paris before it goes under the hammer Thursday, estimated to sell between 2 and 3 million euros and possibly break the record for the most expensive comic book art in history.The 1936 work in Chinese ink, gouache and watercolor, was destined as a cover for The Blue Lotus, the fifth volume of the Belgian journalist's adventures. But it never sat on any book store shelves because it was rejected for being too expensive to reproduce on a wide scale - a victim of its own rare craftsmanship.“They had to do a four colour process printing, so an additional colour and (the publisher) thought that the comic albums were already expensive and reproducing this cover would increase the production costs,” said comics expert Eric Leroy at Art Curial auction house by the Champs-Elysees avenue.As the name “Blue Lotus” suggests, the art work places Tintin in Asia. A huge red dragon appears on a black background by the Belgian reporter's petrified face. It is a prized addition to the universe of Tintin, the subject of recent shows in London and Barcelona, a 2011 Hollywood adaptation, a videogame and an app.In “Blue Lotus,” Tintin travels to China during the 1931 Japanese invasion to investigate and expose - along with his dog Snowy - Japanese spy networks, drug-smuggling rings and other crimes.But the huge interest in this work has raised a host of questions among French media regarding the work's provenance - whether it was a gift to the son of Tintin's printer or a drawing simply never returned to the artist.There is no question, however, of its authenticity. On Thursday, Hergé, whose real name was Georges Remi, could break the record for the most expensive piece of comic book art at 2.6 million euros that was previously set by himself.“We set the previous record for the 'Pages de Garde' in 2014 ..it would be fair for this piece to break this record. Hergé had done only five comic covers using this technique of direct color so it's very rare,” Leroy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rare-tintin-comic-book-art-set-to-sell-for-millions-in-paris-101610552270054.html
14-01-2021||India||Both doses should be of same vaccine; pregnant, lactating women must avoid||Citing precautions and contraindications for Covid-19 vaccination ahead of massive immunisation scheduled on January 16, the Union Health Ministry has said that interchangeability of vaccine is not permitted while pregnant and lactating mothers should not receive Covid-19 vaccine at this time.In a letter to the States/Union Territories, the health ministry has shared the competitive factsheet for both the vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin). They contain information on vaccine platform, physical specifications, dosage, cold storage requirements, contraindications and minor AEFIs.The health ministry has directed the States/UTs to disseminate information to program managers across all levels and through them to call chain handlers and vaccinators for ready reference.Mentioning precautions and contraindications for Covid-19 vaccination, the letter noted: "Under the emergency use authorisation, Covid-19 vaccination is indicated only for 18 years and above. Interchangeability of Covid-19 vaccine is not permitted. The second dose should also be of the same Covid-19 vaccine which was administered as the first dose."In case of co-administration of vaccines: if required, Covid-19 vaccine and other vaccines should be separated by an interval of at least 14 days, the ministry said.Explaining contraindication, the letter said, "A person with a history of an anaphylactic or allergic reaction to a previous dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Immediate or delayed onset anaphylaxis or allergic reaction to vaccine or injection able therapies, pharmaceutical products, food items etc.""Pregnancy and lactation: pregnant and lactating women have not been part of any COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial so far. Therefore, women who are pregnant or not sure of the pregnancy, and lactating women should not receive Covid-19 vaccine at this time," the government said.Provisional and temporary contraindications: in these conditions, Covid-19 vaccination is to be deferred for 4 to 8 weeks after recovery."Persons having active symptoms of SARS-CoV2 to infection. SARS-CoV2 patients who have been given anti-SARS-CoV2 monoclonal antibodies on convalescent plasma. Acutely unwell and hospitalized patients (with or without intensive care) patients due to any illness.Special precautions: vaccine should be administered with caution in persons with a history of any bleeding or coagulation disorder, for example, clotting factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet disorder.Following conditions are not contraindicated for Covid-19 vaccines: a person with a past history of SARS-CoV2 infection or and or RTPCR positive illness. History of chronic diseases and comorbidities (cardiac, neurological, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, malignancies).Immuno-deficiency, HIV, patients on immunosuppression due to any condition (response to the Covid vaccine may be less in these individuals. Other important issues to consider are that vaccine-specific contraindications may apply as the new information becomes available.India has got two Covid-19 vaccines--Covishield and Covaxin Emergency Use Authorisation after meeting going through established safety and immunogenicity through a well prescribed regulatory process.This vaccine may cost in the range of ₹200 to 295 in India. Earlier in the day, the health ministry said that full initial procurement amount of 1.65 crore doses of COVISHIELD and COVAXIN vaccines have been allocated to all states and Union Territories in the proportion of Health Care Workers database.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/both-doses-should-be-of-same-vaccine-pregnant-lactating-women-must-avoid-101610646916699.html
14-01-2021||India||After 10-month long Covid-19 isolation, Naveen Patnaik holds 1st public meet||Ahead of civic polls this year and panchayat polls next year, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday broke his 10-month-long Covid-19 isolation as he addressed a meeting in Kalahandi calling it a model of development for the entire country.“Some people were trying to turn Kalahandi into a laboratory of poverty, but the concerted efforts of my government have turned it into a development model for the entire country. It has turned into the rice bowl. Farmers of Kalahandi are now providing food to the nation,” said Patnaik at his first-ever post-Covid-19 public meeting in Kalahandi district where he inaugurated a 43-km long lift irrigation canal. The canal will irrigate over 25,000 hectares of farmland in 38 gram panchayats from Upper Indravati project. Patnaik also announced development projects worth ₹2085 crore.Recounting the experience of his late father and former chief minister Biju Patnaik in Kalahandi, he said Biju Patnaik had visited Bhawanipatna in the 1990s when he was hurled stones at the Statue Chhak.“But, he was least bothered about it as he immensely loved Kalahandi and always dreamt of its development and prosperity. People of Kalahandi love me a lot and I also love them. I will work 10 times more for the development of Kalahandi in comparison to the drops of blood I have shed in Kalahandi,” he said.For Thursday’s meeting 2500 people were allowed into a barricaded area after they tested negative for Covid-19. However, leader of opposition in the Odisha Assembly and BJP’s Bhawanipatna MLA Pradipta Naik boycotted the meeting protesting erection of a separate stage for the chief minister.“A separate special stage has been set for the Chief Minister while another stage has been constructed for other leaders. Then why did we undergo a Covid-19 test? Even after being diagnosed Covid-19 negative, we were not allowed to share the stage with the CM in today’s mega event in Kalahandi district. This is a clear sign of the feudal system in a democracy. Even though it is completely a government programme, the chief minister has organised the event on his party lines” said Naik, alleging that despite the canal being built with 90% central funds, the state government was claiming sole credit for the projects.BJP MP from Kalahandi Basant Panda welcomed the launch of a slew of development projects on Thursday. While refusing to comment on the boycott of the meet by Odisha Assembly LoP, Panda said, “We support the development of Kalahandi. But the state government should also clear land requirements for the wagon factory in Narla and medical college at Kalahandi.”Political analysts said the chief minister's visit to Kalahandi amid the Covid-19 pandemic was a signal that the party is desperate to rebuild its base in western Odisha that has come under siege from BJP. For Thursday’s meeting, the party had sent 69 of its MLAs and ministers to arrange crowds in 38 gram panchayats where farmlands would be irrigated by the Indravati waters.Maheswar Duriya, assistant professor of political science in the government autonomous college in Bhawanipatna, said the ruling party is making a concerted attempt to mount a challenge to the rising BJP. “In 2017 panchayat polls, BJP won 33 of the 36 Zillah Parishad seats while in 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, it won the MP seat and the Bhawanipatna assembly seat. Though BJD won more number of MLA seats in Kalahandi, its popularity has gone down considerably due to the image of its local leaders. I think BJD will hold more such meetings of Patnaik in western Odisha to check BJP's support base,” said Duriya.Rabi Das, another political analyst, said Patnaik is well aware of BJP's plan to mount a serious challenge to BJD's rule after the Bengal assembly polls are over in April. “The CM knows BJP will not wait till 2024 for a chance to win Odisha. It's natural for Patnaik to keep BJP engaged in western Odisha and win back its voters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-10-month-long-covid-19-isolation-naveen-patnaik-holds-1st-public-meet-101610647531745.html

Families of the deceased were given a compensation of ₹2 lakh each while those seriously ill were given ₹50,000 each.The condition of three others who are under treatment is critical, officials said.The district collector has formed a committee to investigate the matter.On Tuesday evening, around a dozen people had drank illicit country-made liquor at Chak Samari village in the district, following which their health deteriorated.They were rushed to Rupwas community health centre, where two of them were declared brought dead. Five others died during treatment, principal medical officer Dr Navdeep Saini said.The deceased were identified as Pappu Kushwaha, Maangi Kushwaha, Kampotar Kushwaha, Ramjeet Kushwaha, Vasudev Kushwaha, Padam Singh and Mangilal.Three others, Santosh, Lallu Ram and Ravi were referred to Jaipur on Thursday morning after their condition deteriorated, officials said.“Seven have died so far while the condition of three is critical. They have been sent to Jaipur for treatment. The reason behind the incident is poisonous liquor,” said Nathmal Didel, district collector, Bharatpur.Bharatpur superintendent of police Devendra Kumar BIshnoi and Bharatpur range inspector general of police Prassana Kumar Khamesara visited the village after the incident.“Police and excise department officials were directed to trace illegal liquor selling points to take action against them. Prima facie, the incident took place due to poisonous liquor, but the exact reason will be known after the post mortem reports,” Didel said.Villagers accused the district administration of not paying attention to their demand for action against the sale of illicit liquor in the area. “We approached officials many times to request action against the sale of illegal liquor, but no action was taken,” said a villager on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharatpur-hooch-tragedy-toll-rises-to-7-district-excise-officer-cops-suspended-101610646800551.html
14-01-2021||India||‘Working on bringing home 16 Indian sailors stranded in Chinese waters’: MEA||India on Thursday said it is working with Chinese authorities to finalise procedures to bring back 16 Indian seafarers stranded in Chinese waters for nearly four months.Last week, another 23 Indian sailors stranded in Chinese waters for almost seven months began their journey home after a crew change was arranged for their vessel at a Japanese port.The 39 sailors were part of the crew of MV Jag Anand and MV Anastasia, which were carrying Australian coal and weren’t allowed to discharge their cargo at Chinese ports. The situation is believed to be the outcome of the China-Australia trade dispute.Great Eastern Shipping Company, the owner of MV Jag Anand, decided to undertake a crew change in the Japanese port of Chiba, where the ship will disembark its 23 Indian crew members, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “The disembarking crew will be flown back to their hometowns in India from Tokyo,” he said.“As regards MV Anastasia, we are closely coordinating with the Chinese authorities who are finalising the process or standard operating procedures to effect crew change at anchorage. As soon as this is received from the Chinese authorities, the company is expected to initiate the process of crew change,” he added.MV Jag Anand had been at anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13, while MV Anastasia – with 16 Indians on board – has been on anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20.The external affairs ministry and the Indian mission in Beijing have been continuously pursuing the matter with China so that the two vessels could carry out a crew change and the Indian seafarers could be brought home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-on-bringing-home-16-indian-sailors-stranded-in-chinese-waters-mea-101610646127198.html

We will decide what to do next based on how the government will behave. One committee member has already resigned which is a good thing,” Pal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier on Thursday, Mann recused himself from the committee and said that his allegiance remains with farmers across the country. While staying the implementation of the three central farm laws on January 12, the Supreme Court had appointed committee with Mann, president of Maharashtra's Shetkeri Sangthana Anil Ghanwat; Pramod Kumar Joshi, the director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute, and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati as members to resolve the impasse between the government and the farmers who have been protesting for the past seven weeks.Mann is the national president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).“I am thankful to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India for nominating me in the four-member committee to start dialogue with kisan unions on the three laws brought in by the central government. As a farmer myself and a union leader, in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions among the farm unions and the public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as to not compromise the interests of Punjab and farmers of the country,” Mann said in a letter tweeted by BKU.The government and the farm unions held eight rounds of discussions but could not arrive at a resolution regarding the farm bills. Farmers claim that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, will allow corporates to enter and earn profits from the agricultural sector affecting farmers’ incomes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darshan-pal-welcomes-mann-s-decision-to-recuse-himself-101610645636939.html

On Twitter, health minister Harsh Vardhan dispels myths||On a day when the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) gave details about the nationwide vaccination drive which will begin on Saturday, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan took to Twitter to dispel myths about the vaccines.India's drug regulator has given approval to two vaccines - Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute of India and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech - which will be given to 30 million healthcare and frontline workers in the first phase of the vaccination.Vardhan answered some questions about the vaccines, saying there is no scientific evidence to prove that they can cause infertility in men or women. In a series of tweets, he also answered questions about side effects and catching Covid-19 even after getting vaccinated.Vardhan used informative tweets, along with graphics, to allay fears of the people before the vaccination begins.After being administered #COVID19Vaccine, some individuals may have side effects like mild fever, pain at injection site & bodyache. This is similar to the side effects that occur post some other vaccines.These are expected to go away on their own after some time. #StaySafe pic.twitter.com/VCnJzXu70SYou cannot contract #COVID19 because you have been inoculated with a #COVID19VaccineTemporary side effects such as mild fever should not be confused as having contracted #COVID.#StayInformedStaySafe @PMOIndia @MoHFW_INDIA pic.twitter.com/ZkZgLU8tpyThere is no scientific evidence to suggest that #COVIDVaccine could cause infertility in either men or women.

The caller tune disseminates information about the disease and how to prevent it.In the last few months, Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan lent his voice for the novel initiative. But now, there are reports that his voice is being replaced with a new one.Some media reports quoted sources in the Union health ministry to say that the new voice - which will be that of a female - will inform people about the vaccination drive which will begin from January 16.The drive, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called the world's biggest, will see inoculation of healthcare and other frontline workers who have been engaged in treating and helping the people affected by Covid-19. About 30 millions such workers are expected to be vaccinated in the first phase of the drive.Earlier this month, a Public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the Centre to remove Bachchan’s voice from the caller tune on the grounds that he himself, along with some family members, had been infected by the virus.The matter has been listed for hearing on January 18.Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Thursday released details about the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive scheduled to begin on Saturday.In a statement, the PMO said that over 3,000 sites across all states and union territories (UTs) will be virtually connected when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launches the drive via video conferencing on January 16.In the second phase, people above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities numbering around 270 million will be inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-caller-tune-with-amitabh-bachchan-s-voice-to-be-replaced-with-new-one-report-101610643531417.html
14-01-2021||India||NCP to decide Maharashtra Minister Dhananjay Munde's fate over rape allegations||NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday said that the allegations or rape and sexual exploitation against Maharashtra social justice minister and a senior leader of the party Dhananjay Munde are serious and the party will take a call on his fate.Pawar's statement is being seen as an indication that the party leadership may ask Munde to tender his resignation. Munde also said he will accept any decision taken by the party.“The allegations being made against Munde are serious in nature. Being a political party we will have to discuss it and take a decision considering all the views. Munde has explained the matter in detail and it is my responsibility to convey it to the senior leaders and take the next step as soon as possible. I don’t think this should be delayed,” Pawar told reporters, in his response on allegations against the social justice minister.Munde has found himself in the centre of a controversy after a woman accused him of rape on the pretext of marriage and other favours. The woman, an aspiring singer, alleged that the police were not accepting her written complaint against the minister and that her life is under threat. Munde, however, claimed that the woman is trying to defame and blackmail him.On Thursday afternoon, Munde went to the NCP headquarters and conducted proceedings of the weekly janata darbar. Before that, he also met the state NCP chief Jayant Patil. Senior NCP leader Praful Patel also met Pawar at his residence where the leaders are said to have discussed the issue in detail.Patil said that it would be unfair to take any action without going into details of the allegations. “Munde has already gone to the Bombay high court over calls of threat and blackmail from a woman and police are investigating the matter. Allegations are serious but taking action without verifying the fact would be improper,” Patil told reporters outside NCP headquarters.Meanwhile, in a new twist to the drama, BJP leader and former MLA Krishna Hegde on Thursday accused the same woman of a honey trap and harassment for years. He also filed a complaint with the Mumbai police against the woman."The woman used to call and say we are in a relationship but I kept avoiding her. It started in 2010 and continued till 2015. Although I blocked her many times she used to call me from another number. I didn’t know her intention so I did some background check and found out things were not very right. I didn’t want to come out and say anything about a lady as it also didn’t concern me because I never met her.”"But when this episode of Mr Munde came to the fore I realised she is a serial offender. First she did it with me, she must have done it with someone else and now doing it with Dhananjay Munde. I felt somewhere this thing had to be stopped and thus registered an official police complaint. When I was going to the police station, Manish Dhuri from MNS also called me and informed me that he had a similar experience with that lady,” Hegde said.Manish Dhuri from Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in Mumbai also alleged that the woman first tried to honey trap him by calling at her flat in Andheri a few years ago.“It was in 2008-2009 when she messaged me from a VIP number and a conversation started between us. It turned into a friendship and one day she asked me to come at a flat saying her sister wanted to meet. She tried to get intimate with me saying that no one was at home. But I felt someone was there who may want to click our pictures. I could sense her intention and left the place as soon as possible. Since then, I started avoiding her calls and messages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-to-decide-maharashtra-minister-dhananjay-munde-s-fate-over-rape-allegations-101610643706103.html
14-01-2021||India||Go to Delhi, BS Yediyurappa dares BJP MLAs dejected with cabinet expansion||A day after Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa finally completed a long-awaited cabinet expansion by adding seven new members and dropping one, several BJP leaders on Thursday expressed unhappiness over regional and caste imbalance.In the 33-member cabinet, 13 ministers belong to just two districts of Bengaluru and Belgavi, with several of the remaining 28 districts not even having token representation in the ministry.While capital city Bengaluru has eight ministers, Belgavi has five representatives in the state cabinet.Senior BJP leader and former minister S A Ramdas expressed unhappiness at Mysuru district not having a representative in the cabinet."It is unfortunate that no legislator from Mysuru was considered for induction. It is essential to have a region wise balance," Ramadas told HT. The CM's political secretary M P Renukacharya too lammented the lack of representation to Davangere district. Renuckacharya who failed to get a cabinet berth despite intense lobbying now intends to take his grievance to the party high command in Delhi."Unlike other leaders who hide the real reason for going to Delhi, I am openly saying that I will go to Delhi and meet party seniors to seek justice," Renukacharya told reporters on Thursday.Apart from the regional imbalance, the other grouse that several BJP leaders have is about over representation of some castes and under representation of others.Analysts point out that the cabinet has 11 Lingayat members including the chief minister. Lingayats are estimated to be a sixth of the population but have a third of all cabinet berths.A senior BJP leader who did not want to be identified said the party hopes to rectify the imbalance. “Yes, it is a fact that the Lingayat community has backed the party more than others and thus we have more legislators belonging to that community and thus higher representation. However, this is something which we hope to rectify in the long run."Vokkaligas the second largest community has seven representatives, four Kurbas and five Scheduled Caste and two Scheduled Tribes members. Brahmins and OBCs have two representatives each.Sunil Kumar, a three-term MLA from Karkala who was expecting a cabinet berth but did not make it, even tweeted about saying that while he was a loyal party worker, he did not know the method of 'caste glorification' to get a cabinet berth.Despite the grumblings of unhappy lawmakers, Yediyurappa remained unfazed and said "If any of them (legislators) have reservations (about cabinet expansion), let them go to Delhi and complain to the national leadership of BJP."However Yediyurappa's bitter critic within the party, Vijaypura MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal continued his tirade against the CM and alleged that he had been blackmailed."It is unfortunate that blackmailers have got cabinet berths. Some of Yediyurappa's CDs recorded by his own grandson are not viewable and some have used it to blackmail him and get cabinet berths," Yatnal told reporters.Karnataka’s Congress unit president DK Shivakumar demanded that a judicial inquiry should be held into what these CDs are and who are the people who allegedly have the possession.Leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramiah said, "A BJP MLA himself is alleging that several BJP leaders got cabinet berths by blackmailing the CM. Does Yediyurappa have the courage to file a criminal case against those who have blackmailed him?"The CM has not responded to Yatnal's allegations even as state unit chief Nalin Kumar Kateel had earlier said that he had recommended disciplinary action against the Vijaypura MLA for making accusations against Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/go-to-delhi-bs-yediyurappa-dares-bjp-mlas-dejected-with-cabinet-expansion-101610640966047.html

Usually five to six lakh pilgrims throng the hill temple on Makara Vilakku day marking the end of the pilgrimage season, but this time policemen and officials outnumbered pilgrims.The state government has restricted the number to 5.000 due to Covid-19 and put severe conditions on pilgrims. Though the cash-strapped Travancore Devasom Board (TDB), which runs the temple asked the government to hike the number to 20,000 the government has turned the request down considering the surge of Covid-19 cases.Once lauded for its Covid-19 control management, the state has turned a virus hotspot since last month. On Thursday, it reported 5,490 new cases with a test positivity rate of 8.11%. The active caseload in the state is 66,503-- now at least one-fourth of the total cases in the country are from Kerala, latest statistics show.The meagre footfall at the temple has drained the plush coffers of the temple and it has asked the government for a bail-out package. “Our total revenue reduced by 20 per cent when compared to the last few years. We have approached the government for ₹100 crore to tide over the crisis,” said TDB president N Vasu. He said usually Sabarimala revenue was pumped to fund other temples in Travancore region (south Kerala) and low returns have affected even salaries of the employees.During the last pilgrimage season— November 2019 to January 2020—the total revenue of the temple was ₹263.57 crore. Aravana payasam -- a black kheer made of rice, jaggery, ghee and cardamom-- forms 60 per cent of the temple revenue. But this time it was reduced to 20 per cent and in the last two weeks the revenue was ₹15 crore, said Vasu adding it was less than a single-day revenue during the normal season.Pilgrims from five south Indian states swarm the temple nestled in the Western Ghats in Pathanamitta district during the annual season and it is often considered the largest seasonal pilgrimage after Mecca. During peak season at least 5 lakh pilgrims trek to the shrine on a day, temple statistics show.The temple had witnessed unrest in 2018 after the Supreme Court opened its doors for women of all ages-- women of reproductive age are barred at the temple citing the eternal celibate status (naishtika brahmachari) of the deity, Lord Ayyappa. A larger bench of the SC is hearing the case now.Pilgrimage to the temple is unique in many ways-- a secular temple, all are welcome here. There is a small mosque at the hilltop (Vavar Swami, considered a disciple of presiding deity Lord Ayyappa) and devotees will have to pay obeisance there before entering the sanctum sanctorum. A devotee will have to take a 40-day fast abstaining from all worldly affairs and he will be known as ‘Swami’ once he puts the black bead and dress. At the top of the temple there is an inscription in Malayalam ‘Tatvamasi’, which translates “I am you”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-sees-subdued-makara-vilakku-cash-strapped-temple-seeks-govt-help-101610640466699.html
14-01-2021||India||Joint commission meet with Nepal not right forum for taking up border row: India||India on Thursday signalled that a joint commission meeting with Nepal on Friday was not the appropriate forum for discussing a border row, as Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali began a two-day visit aimed at shoring up bilateral ties.Gyawali is the senior-most Nepalese leader to visit India in more than a year after the Covid-19 outbreak. He is also the first leader to visit New Delhi since Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli triggered political turmoil by dissolving Nepal's Parliament last month and calling early elections.Nepal’s foreign ministry, while announcing the visit on Tuesday, said in a statement that the joint commission will discuss the gamut of bilateral relations, including the boundary issue, Covid-19 cooperation, infrastructure, connectivity, trade and transit.However, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava made it clear the joint commission wouldn’t be the right forum to discuss the border issue. “Our position on the boundary issue is well known. Let me say that the joint commission meeting and boundary talks are separate mechanisms,” he told a weekly briefing.“The joint commission is an important mechanism that provides the opportunity of reviewing at a high level the entire gamut of our bilateral partnership and providing political guidance to further enhance the special and unique ties that we enjoy,” he said, adding India is looking forward to “constructive discussions” on numerous sectors.Gyawali will meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar for talks on Friday, after which they will chair the joint commission meet. This will be only the sixth meeting of the body since 1987, though it has convened four times since 2014. Gyawali also held several private meetings on Thursday.The Nepalese delegation includes the foreign secretary and health secretary, reflecting the focus on Covid-19 cooperation. Though Nepal has formally reached out to India and China for vaccines, Kathmandu has indicated a preference for sourcing doses from New Delhi because of factors such as pricing, logistics and well-established links between the health sectors of the two countries.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Nepal is hoping India will provide vaccines as assistance to inoculate some portion of the 12 million people it plans to cover in its first phase of vaccinations. Nepal also plans to buy millions of doses from foreign suppliers, including the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.India has said its ability to export vaccines after meeting domestic needs will become clear over the next few weeks. Officials have also said India’s neighbours will get priority for the supply of vaccines.India-Nepal ties came under the shadow of the border row last year after Oli issued a new political map that included Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, which are part of Indian territory. The map was published in response to India’s opening of a strategic road to Lipulekh, located on the border with China.The external affairs ministry described Nepal’s new map as “unjustified cartographic assertion”, and the people said the focus of Friday’s meeting will be taking forward development cooperation, including India-backed projects in Nepal.Given that Oli currently heads a caretaker government, there is unlikely to be any substantive movement on the border issue. One option the two sides could look at is asking the bilateral boundary working group to look afresh at ways to finalise the border in disputed sections at Kalapani and Susta.Before Oli’s sudden decision to dissolve Parliament, normalcy was restored in bilateral ties by back-to-back visits to Kathmandu last year by Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Goel, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla.India has been keeping a wary eye on China’s efforts to broker an understanding between Oli and his main rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, in order to keep the Nepal Communist Party united.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said Nepal is among the “borderline countries” in India’s neighbourhood, with which ties require “constant nurturing and hand-holding”.“India’s thrust over the past few months shows that it has adopted a very clear and calibrated approach while keeping political and diplomatic channels open. Cordial cooperative ties are in the interest of both sides, though there are challenges,” he said, adding the Nepalese side may opt to raise the border issue but the joint commission wasn’t the forum to discuss such matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joint-commission-meet-with-nepal-not-right-forum-for-taking-up-border-row-india-101610638644786.html

14-01-2021||India||Delhi extends 14-day quarantine order till January 31 for UK returnees||The Delhi government on Thursday extended its order pertaining to a 14-day quarantine for passengers arriving in Delhi from the United Kingdom till January 31 in the wake of a new variant of the coronavirus.The extension of this order comes on the back of a set of rules announced by the Delhi government on Friday last week to keep a tight check on import of the new variant of coronavirus through people returning from virus-hit UK.The protocol was to be strictly followed in Delhi on a trial basis for a week till January 14.In the order, the Delhi government has decided to mandatorily test all the travellers arriving from the UK through self-paid RT-PCR tests.“All those arriving from the UK, who test positive will be isolated in an isolation facility. Negative ones will be taken to a quarantine facility for 7 days followed by 7 days home quarantine,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted.He had further said that this has been done “to protect Delhiites from exposure to virus from UK”.“As a matter of abundant precaution, in view of the increased transmissibility of the new variant, it is decided that all travellers coming from the UK to India would be mandatorily subjected to self-paid RT-PCR tests on arrival at the airport. Those who are found positive shall be isolated in an institutional isolation facility in a separate (isolation) unit as per existing laid down protocol. Those who are found negative shall be kept in compulsory institutional quarantine for a period of seven days followed by seven days of home quarantine,” read the order.The new variant of coronavirus disease – B.1.1.7 – has been dubbed as highly infectious by scientists and medical experts as the UK government has confirmed that the infection rates have increased faster than expected in the affected areas where the new strain has been circulating and stronger measures are required to get the virus under control.Delhi on Thursday reported 340 new cases of coronavirus taking the total count of cases to 6,31,249.So far, a total of 109 cases from the UK strain of coronavirus have been reported from across the country.In a proactive approach to fight the virus outbreak, the Delhi government on Thursday announced a Covid-19 vaccination drive that is scheduled to start on January 16 and will be done across 81 locations in the national capital."So far, we have received 2,74,000 doses of vaccine from the Centre. Each person will be administered two doses and Centre provides 10 per cent extra vaccine, taking damage into account. So the 2,74,000 doses will be sufficient for around 1,20,000 health workers," Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-extends-14-day-quarantine-order-till-january-31-for-uk-returnees-101610636055606.html
14-01-2021||India||Activist Anna Hazare writes to PM seeking assurance on fixing MSP for farmers||Social activist Anna Hazare on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that farmers should get 50 pc more than the cost of inputs but they do not get it though the government had given assurances in this regard in the past.The letter in Hindi said, "The written assurance given by your government on March 29, 2018 after seven days of my fast at Ramlila Maidan, New Delhi, has not yet been complied with. This is with regard to complying with the assurance and regarding fast in January.""Your government has accepted the Ahwal (recommendations) of Swaminathan Commission. If accepted, it is necessary to follow them. The recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission says that 50 per cent of the cost price of agricultural produce should be increased while fixing the MSP. On this demand, we had a fast in Ramlila Maidan on 23 March 2018. On 29/03/2018 you sent the Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the then Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis with written assurance from the Prime Minister's office," the letter read.Hazare stated in the letter that it was written in the assurance that the decision has been taken by the Central Government to fix the minimum support price (MSP) 50 per cent more than the cost. And it is also mentioned in the budget speech. And it will be followed. Such assurance was given in writing.As per the letter, while fixing the minimum support price of agricultural produce which comes at the cost of the crop the flowing are included-- the labour of the farmers, cattle or machine is hired, the cost of the seed, the value of the fertilizer, the value of electricity, the value of the irrigation, the land revenue, the insecticide (the insecticide), the herbicide (the herbicide), the khurpani (weeding), and the nangarni (ploughing).As per Swaminathan Commission, the farmers should get 50 per cent more than the cost price. But due to the reduction by the Central Agricultural Price Commission (Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices), the farmers do not get more than 50 per cent of the cost price. Also the farmers do not even get the cost price of their produce. That is why they commit suicide, Hazare said in the letter.He said, "As per our Constitution, it is the responsibility of the public welfare government to ensure that no one is exploited. They get the right labour price. This is their right. But the farmer of our country who nourishes the public is only exploited. Because of that, he commits suicide. It is necessary to give 50 per cent more than the cost price for agricultural produce. You gave us a written assurance."Hazare then said that he will go on a hunger strike in January end."I have corresponded with you five times in this matter so far. But no answer has come. That is why I have decided to go on a hunger strike in the end of January. To get Ramlila Maidan as venue, four letters have been written to that authority. I did not get an answer yet," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-anna-hazare-writes-to-pm-seeking-assurance-on-fixing-msp-for-farmers-101610636909755.html

Some of supplies may be free and treated as aid, they added.The first batch of the vials will be shipped over the next two weeks, the people said. The government will then offer the vaccines to countries in Latin America, Africa and the former Soviet republics. A spokesperson for Bharat Biotech couldn’t immediately comment while a spokesman at Serum declined to comment.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to tap country's leadership in vaccine manufacturing by helping countries battling the pandemic and raise the South Asian nation’s profile to rival China, which is also supplying its home-grown inoculations around the world. Brazil, with more than 8 million cases, has sought urgent supplies and so has South Africa.Brazil is sending an aircraft to India after Modi agreed to expedite vaccine shipments, according to the nation’s Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello. Serum will supply 2 million vaccines to the South American nation.Serum’s Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla in an interview this month said he expected overseas supplies to only start around March, adding that the government will enable overseas sales after first meeting India’s initial requirements.The Serum Institute is manufacturing a coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca Plc while Bharat Biotech’s is an indigenous one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-start-vaccine-for-covid-19-supply-with-20-million-doses-to-neighbors-101610636452210.html

He responds||Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Thursday said that the soon-to-be ordered LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jets would be way ahead of the JF-17 fighter planes operated by the Pakistan Air Force.The JF-17 has been jointly developed by China and Pakistan.With its advanced weapons and sensors, the LCA Mk-1A jets will have good strike capability, he told news channels a day after India’s Cabinet Committee on Security, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved a ₹48,000-crore proposal to buy 83 advanced jets to bolster the IAF’s combat potential.“There is no comparison with the JF-17,” he said.The air chief added that even the existing final operational clearance (FOC) variant of the LCA was superior to the JF-17. He said the LCA Mk-1 jets would be equipped with the indigenous Astra beyond visual range missiles.Also Watch | ‘LCA Tejas well ahead of Pakistan-China’s JF-17 aircraft’: IAF chief BhadauriaThe CCS approval came 10 months after the ministry gave a green light to the purchase of 83 Mk-1A jets from state-owned plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).The aircraft to be ordered include 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft. HAL is expected to deliver the first Mk-1A jet to the IAF three years after the deal is signed, with all the aircraft likely to be delivered by 2028-29. The Mk-1A programme is expected to generate thousands of jobs and will involve the participation of more than 500 Indian companies.The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by the IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced FOC configurations.The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejas-jets-no-comparison-to-china-pak-s-j-17-fighters-air-force-chief-101610635825525.html

There is no stock of perishable items in this whole sale market. Whatever surplus like onions and potatoes we had after the snowfall has almost finished,” said Bashir Ahmad Bashir, President of the Parimpora Mandi and chairman of Kashmir Fruit Growers cum Dealers Union.He said that whatever little is left is with the retailers that are being sold at very high rates. “At this time we mostly get our vegetables from outside because it is winter time with no local production,” he said.He said that hundreds of fruit laden trucks on the way to Jammu were also stranded on the highway.The prices of vegetables like onion have almost doubled while meat is also in short supply.“The vegetables are also in short supply. Onions are ₹70 per kg while potatoes are ₹50. Peas are not available. People are now mostly relying on locally produced Haakh and turnips. The highway is still feared to be closed for another 10 days. Let’s see how much we will sustain,” said Mohammad Amin, a grocery and vegetable seller in Srinagar’s Old City.Director Food Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department Kashmir, Bashir Khan said that the valley has enough stock of food grains to last for two months, gas for 15 days, petrol and diesel for 8-10 days. He conceded that there is less quantity of these things in the market and if in a few more days they get depleted further, the people should opt for dry vegetables.“What can be done we have to bear with the system till the highway is opened. Although we still have availability of green leafed vegetables, if there is scarcity after a few days, we should change our food taste,” he said.He said there are examples of snow-locked places like Karnah and Tanghdar. “They switch over to dry vegetables,” he said.Manzoor Ahmed Mir, Superintendent of Police (Traffic), Rural Kashmir said over 8,500 vehicles including empty and fruit laden trucks were stranded on the Kashmir side of the highway. “Most of these drivers are spending their nights in their vehicles,” he said.The minimum temperatures in Kashmir have been plunging to records levels. Srinagar recorded minus 8.5 degree Celsius on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, lowest to be recorded in January in the past 25 years.Jatinder Singh Johar,SSP Traffic, National Highway in Ramban, said that the work on the repair of the wall as well as on the construction of a Bailey bridge was underway.“The actual bridge will take 10-15 days to be motorable as it takes time for the concrete to set in. The BRO is also working on the Bailey bridge and let’s see how much time it will take,” Johar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammusrinagar-road-blockage-sparks-scarcity-of-essential-commodities-in-kashmir-101610635733801.html

The court approved the decision of the state and sought details of the probe undertaken by the new officer to be submitted in court within four weeks.The victim’s mother had approached the court seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in July 2020. In her petition, she highlighted instances to show unwillingness on tpart of the police to follow leads to identify the culprits behind her daughter's tragic end. The victim died on October 17, 2019 and a suicide note left by her described the manner in which she was tormented and sexually harassed by her supervisor and colleagues at Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Hyderabad. An attempt to rape her at the office premises traumatized her, acting as the trigger for her suicide. The victim had revealed this fact to her sister a day before her death.A three-judge bench of the apex court headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar heard the petition on January 11 and examined the affidavit presented by VC Sajjanar, Commissioner of Police, Cyberabad giving details of the investigation conducted so far. The Telangana government on its own assured to entrust some senior official to conduct further investigation with immediate effect. The bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, recorded this assurance in its order and sought a detailed progress report from the state by February 10, the next date of hearingEarlier, on December 5, the Court had made strong observations with regard to the insensitivity shown by the police in handling the probe in this case. The Court directed the Telangana Home Secretary to personally examine the matter and issue appropriate orders. The probe since then picked up pace.Advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava who appeared for the victim’s mother said, “Following the Supreme Court monitoring, the investigation is now progressing in a just and fair manner. In the light of the recent evidences gathered, which I cannot disclose, the petitioner is quite confident of getting justice.”The bench told the state not to reveal details of investigation as the probe was still on. The top court clarified in the order that the move to entrust probe of the case to a senior police official shall not be seen as a reflection on the investigation conducted so far.The victim, aged 33, had joined BHEL in July 2009 and maintained a good track record. A week prior to the incident, the victim filed a complaint before the Cyber Cell of the Telangana Police alleging that her colleagues (named in the suicide note) hacked her mobile phone. No action was taken on her complaint. After her death, the police took 40 days to unlock her phone and made no attempts to retrieve data from the phones of the accused named in the suicide note, the victim’s mother stated in her petition.The mother accused the police of botching up the probe in order to give a clean chit to the accused. She had earlier approached the National Commission for Women (NCW) with a complaint. In response, the Telangana Police filed a report on June 2, 2020 telling the Commission that no material was available against the persons named in the suicide note. For eight months after the victim’s death, no charge sheet was filed. The police alleged that the death was a result of her alleged mental illness although BHEL testified her to be mentally fit.Bringing all this on record before the Supreme Court, the victim’s mother, a resident of Bhopal filed a writ petition seeking investigation of the case to be transferred from Telangana Police to an independent agency such as CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-hyderabad-police-officer-to-probe-bhel-suicide-case-telangana-tells-sc-101610634463120.html

14-01-2021||India||The return of traffic congestion||Traffic congestion in four of India’s major cities – Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, and Pune – have crawled back very close to levels seen before the Covid-induced lockdown, which had caused global annual traffic congestion to fall for the first time in at least 10 years, a report released on Wednesday showed.Every year, Amsterdam-based location technology specialist TomTom releases the TomTom Traffic Index, a report detailing the traffic situation in 416 cities in 57 countries. The firm’s traffic data is powered by 600 million connected devices ranging from cellphone carrier data to vehicular GPS data.What is Congestion level percentage?Congestion level percentage is the extra travel time a driver experiences compared to an uncongested situation. The report determines a baseline by calculating the pace of free-flow travel time in a region. For instance, a 50% congesting level means that an hour-long journey would take 30 minutes more (so an hour-and-a-half) than it would during the city’s uncongested conditions.Indian cities congested again In India, the big change is how far congestion levels have fallen due to the global pandemic, and how by the end of December, most cities were again very close to levels before the pandemic.New Delhi saw a decrease (average of 9%) in congestion, and an 18% and 14% average decrease in congestion during morning and evening rush hours respectively. The other three cities from India featured in the Index – Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Pune saw an average decrease in congestion levels by 12%, 20%, and 17% respectively.Global rankings Overall, Moscow was the world’s most congested city in 2020, despite a congestion fall of 8% from 2019. Bengaluru was the most-congested city in the world in 2019, but it fell to 6th spot in 2020 with nearly a 30% of drop in traffic year-on-year.Despite drop in congestion levels, three cities from India featured in the TomTom Traffic Index’s global top 10 list – Mumbai (2nd), Bengaluru (6th), and New Delhi (8th). Pune, the only other Indian city mapped in the overall rankings, was on the 16th spot.Need for action Werner van Huyssteen, TomTom India, general manager, said, “Although traffic congestion in India was down in 2020, it’s not going to become a trend unless we take action. We might even see traffic levels shoot up again as people get back to work and back into old routines. That’s why now is the time that India’s city planners, policy makers, employers – and drivers – must take stock of what they will do to make the roads less congested in the future."Source: TomTom Traffic Index, 2020||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-return-of-traffic-congestion-101610611876079.html

14-01-2021||India||SC-appointed panel on farm laws should have been truly independent: Sharad Pawar||NCP chief Sharad Pawar has questioned the composition of the committee appointed by the Supreme Court to discuss the contentious farm laws with protesting farmers and the government and make recommendations to the court.He welcomed the intervention in the issue by the apex court but said that the members of the committee have supported the three farm laws in the past and thus farmers do not have faith in the panel. He said that the committee should have been independent in the true sense.The Supreme Court formed a four-member committee on Tuesday to discuss the legislation with both farmers and the government and make recommendations to the court on Tuesday. It comprises Dr Pramod Kumar Joshi (agricultural economist, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati (agriculture economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices), Bhupinder Singh Mann (national president, Bhartiya Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), and Anil Ghanwat (president, Shetkari Sanghatana).On Thursday, Maan opted out of the committee citing “farmers’ interests”.“I welcome the intervention made by the SC but if you see the composition of the committee, all the members have supported the farm bills at different points of time in some or other way. This is the reason farmers do not have faith in the committee and believe that nothing will come out of the discussions with it and I share the same view,” Pawar told reporters in South Mumbai on Thursday."An independent committee in the true sense should have been appointed," the former agriculture minister said.He also expressed discontent at the way the Centre has handled the farmers' agitation.“It would have been better if the central government would have understood the seriousness of the issue," Pawar said.Despite a severe cold wave, the farmers, many of them with their families have been protesting at Delhi’s borders for 50 days now seeking the repeal of the farm laws.The farm unions have said they would not interact with the committee because all the members in it had previously indicated their support for the controversial laws. They have also insisted that the protest would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scappointed-panel-on-farm-laws-should-have-been-truly-independent-sharad-pawar-101610632545583.html
14-01-2021||India||Ban on Delhi poultry markets lifted after samples test negative for bird flu||The three civic bodies — north, east and south — on Thursday decided to withdraw its order regarding ban on the storage, packaging and sale of poultry and live birds across the national capital. The development comes after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that laboratory reports suggested that the avian influenza had not affected poultry birds in Delhi. He had instructed the civic bodies to allow poultry markets to re-open and withdraw the temporary restrictions on import of live birds and packaged chicken from other states.The ban on sale and storage of poultry, its products and chicken was imposed by the three municipalities on Wednesday.Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “The ban on sale-purchase, processing and packaging of poultry meat and products, including serving of cooked or half cooked poultry products, in restaurants and hotels has been withdrawn with immediate effect.”He said that the decision has been taken after due discussion in the video conference with Union minister of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, Giriraj Singh. The meeting was attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, all the three mayors and commissioners of the three civic bodies.Municipal officials said that bird flu tests of the samples collected from Ghazipur poultry market were found to be negative and orders were issued on Thursday to open the wholesale market by the Delhi government.Nirmal Jain, mayor East Delhi Municipal Corporation, also confirmed the development and said that precautions for bird flu would be continued to be taken by the concerned departments. He appealed to the public to follow the guidelines, and safety procedures.The Delhi government on Monday had confirmed that the avian influenza has hit the national Capital and accordingly had shut the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market for 10 days and banned the entry of live birds into the city without proper health certification from authorised veterinarians.The government, later, also had prohibited the sale of packaged or processed chicken brought from outside Delhi.

On Thursday, the formal announcement was made.“Due to the global Covid-19 situation, it has been decided that this year, there will not be a foreign head of state or head of government as the chief guest for our Republic Day event,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a regular news briefing.The only other years when a foreign chief guest wasn’t present at the Republic Day parade were 1952, 1953 and 1966.This year’s parade will also be shorter, involve fewer participants and only a fourth of the usual number of spectators will be allowed at Rajpath because of Covid-19-related restrictions.A 122-member tri-services contingent from Bangladesh will be part of the Republic Day parade, only the second time foreign troops have joined the annual showcase of military might and the country’s diverse culture. In 2016, a French contingent had participated in the parade.Bangladesh has been invited to participate in this year’s parade because the two countries are commemorating 50 years of diplomatic ties this year. The Bangladeshi tri-services contingent was flown into New Delhi on a C-17 heavy-lift aircraft of the Indian Air Force.“This is testimony to our ties, which are forged in shared sacrifice. This year will be historic in our relations as we are also commemorating the 50th anniversary of [Bangladesh’s] liberation war,” Srivastava said.During a virtual summit of the prime ministers of the two countries in December, New Delhi and Dhaka agreed to jointly organise several activities to commemorate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties and the liberation war in India, Bangladesh and third countries.“A number of events and activities are being planned and these will celebrate the legacy of our shared history,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-foreign-chief-guest-at-republic-day-parade-amid-covid-19-says-centre-101610631159803.html

It crossed the 100-mark in the next seven days. On Wednesday, the number stood at 102, the health ministry announced.India's tally of the variant increases gradually at the time Britain is recording another 563 fatalities from the virus, bringing its deaths to over 81,400, one of the highest tolls in Europe.Soaring cases are forcing UK medical chiefs to try to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed and the government to reinforce its campaign for people to abide by stay-at-home orders.The B.1.1.7 variant genome, which is much more infectious, has prompted comprehensive contact tracing for co-travellers, family members and others of those who have travelled to the UK in the last 38 days.From November 25 to the midnights of December 23, 2020, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from the UK, the government said. All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by states to RT-PCR tests to detect the presence of the new variant.The government took cognisance of the reports of the virus reported from the UK and said it has put in place a proactive and preventive strategy to detect and contain the mutant variant.This strategy included temporary suspension of all flights coming from the UK from December 23 to January 7 and mandatory RT-PCR test for all UK-returnees.The samples of all those found positive in the RT-PCR test will be genome sequenced by a consortium of 10 government labs.Countries like Russia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore have also reported cases of the new variant so far.Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention states that preliminary epidemiologic indicators suggest that this variant is associated with increased transmissibility, which implies that it is more efficient and is transmitted rapidly.Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that the variant has any impact on the severity of disease or vaccine efficacy, the CDC has stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/109-cases-in-16-days-how-uk-strain-of-coronavirus-has-progressed-in-india-101610624854807.html

Delay in projecting Bhupendra Singh Hooda as CM in Haryana, ousted the party from the power while in Punjab and Karnataka the party got the advantage as it had declared a CM face before the elections”, he said.A few days ago, Harish Rawat had urged the party leadership to project the CM face under whose leadership the coming election would be contested. Other than Tamta, no one has yet backed Rawat as a chief ministerial candidate. In one of his social media posts, Rawat had ruled himself out of contention.Congress unit president in Uttarakhand, Pritam Singh and leader of opposition in the assembly Indira Hridayesh opposed Rawat, saying the party should contest assembly election under collective leadership.Amid the tug of war in the party, Tamta's backing of Rawat may now fuel more controversy in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mp-pradeep-tamta-bats-for-harish-rawat-as-cm-face-in-uttarakhand-101610627795455.html

14-01-2021||India||Farmer unions welcome Mann's decision, but say won't accept any committee||Protesting farmer leaders welcomed Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann's decision on Thursday to recuse himself from a Supreme Court-appointed committee, and reiterated that they do not want any panel and will not settle for anything less than the repeal of the three contentious laws.They said the other three members of the committee should follow suit as the agitating unions had never demanded formation of any committee to resolve the impasse between farmers and the Centre over the new agri laws.Some leaders also invited Mann to join the agitation against the legislations.Mann said he is thankful to the apex court for nominating him on the panel but would give up any position to prevent farmers’ interests from being compromised.Farmer unions and opposition parties had raised doubts over the composition of the panel, insisting that its members have been in favour of the three laws in the past."Mann's decision is a good step as there is no importance of any committee for farmer unions as it has not been our demand. Mann knew that no farmer union would appear before the court-appointed committee that's why he has taken this decision," farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni told PTI.Chaduni is a senior member of the Sankyukt Kisan Moarch -- an umbrella body of around 40 protesting unions. He said that farmer leaders will not appear before the committee even if the rest three members also recuse themselves and new members are appointed.He asserted that farmers will not settle for anything less than the repeal of new agriculture laws.Another farmer leader, Abhimanyu Kohar, said that government knows that the court cannot repeal the laws and that it should stop playing with the sentiments of farmers who have been camping at several Delhi borders since November 28."This is a good thing that Mann has recused himself from the committee. Forming a committee is not a solution. The new farm laws have been enacted by Parliament and the court cannot do much. The government knows this that's why we are asking the government to repeal these three laws," Kohar said.Asked whether union leaders would attend the next round of talks with the government scheduled for Friday, he said that they are not against any dialogue and that they will hold talks with Union ministers.Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait also welcomed Mann's decision and invited him to join the ongoing agitation against the three laws.Sukhdev Singh, Punjab general secretary of BKU Ekta Ugrahan, said that they will accept any committee only if the government repeals the three farm laws first.Farmer leader Harinder Singh Lakhowal also said that they will not call off their protest until the government repeals these laws and gives a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.Earlie this week, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three central laws till further orders and announced the formation of the committee to hear the grievances of the farmers and the opinion of the government.Apart from Mann, Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat, International Food Policy Research Institute's Pramod Kumar Joshi and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati were appointed on the panel.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-unions-welcome-mann-s-decision-but-say-won-t-accept-any-committee-101610627260311.html
14-01-2021||India||Air pollution shot up in some northern towns last year despite lockdown||A new analysis has found that air pollution increased in small towns and cities outside Delhi and NCR in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region last year.Even though the average PM 2.5 levels for summer and monsoon months last year is considerably lower than in 2019, winter pollution levels increased in Punjab and Haryana (north of NCR) leading to an increase in their annual average PM 2.5 levels.Bigger cities and towns including Delhi recorded a significant reduction in annual PM 2.5 concentrations during the pandemic year. Delhi for example recorded an almost 13% improvement in 2020 compared to 2019.The analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment suggests air pollution levels spiked in certain parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains mainly because of a combination of reopening of the economy after the national lockdown (March 25 to May 31 and phased reopening till December) and adverse meteorology in winter.Several bigger cities have witnessed a reduction in annual PM 2.5 levels, smaller towns and cities have recorded an increase: Fatehabad in northern Haryana is the worst performer with 35% increase from 2019 level. It is followed by Bhatinda at 14%; Agra 9%; Khanna 7%; Mandi Gobindgarh 6%; Moradabad 5.5% and Kurukshetra recorded a 1% increase.Sirsa recorded a 44% decrease in PM 2.5 levels; Varanasi 31%; Gaya 27%; Muzaffarpur 13%; Delhi 13% and Hisar recorded a 12% reduction among others.CSE used real-time data (15-minute averages) for 26 cities in the IGP region from the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) Central Control Room for Air Quality Management for the analysis. The analysis highlights that Fatehabad which recorded the highest increase in PM 2.5 concentrations last year and Sirsa which recorded the highest improvement are only 40 km apart.“Therefore, this massive variation cannot be attributed to meteorology and has to do with local factors. The annual average of these towns along with other smaller towns like Hisar and Jind in the north-west is heavily influenced by episodic pollution caused by burning of crop stubbles. The influence is so strong that it can elevate their monthly PM2.5 levels for November to that of Delhi’s, but unlike Delhi, these towns are directly exposed to the smoke. The elevated November levels do not linger on for the rest of the winter in these towns (as is the case in Delhi),” said Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager in CSE’s Urban Lab team of the Sustainable Cities programme.“This brings out the impact of the extraordinary disruption that 2020 has caused. Despite the dramatic reduction in air pollution during the lockdown, pollution has bounced back across the region post-lockdown unmasking the high impacts of local and regional pollution. This demands quicker regional reforms and action to curb pollution from vehicles, industry, power plants and waste burning to further bend the air pollution curve on a regional scale,” explained Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-shot-up-in-some-northern-towns-last-year-despite-lockdown-101610626154993.html
14-01-2021||India||Day before ninth round of talks with farmers, agriculture minister Tomar says hopeful of positive discussion||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has confirmed that the ninth round of negotiations with protesting farmer unions will take place as scheduled on Friday and hoped that it would lead to positive discussions regarding the newly implemented farm bills."Hopeful of positive discussion at the ninth round of talks with farmer unions on Friday," Tomar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI on Thursday. The minister reiterated the government's stance and said that the Centre is ready to hold talks with farmer leaders with an open mind.The farmer union too said that they will attend the scheduled talks on Friday asserting that it is necessary to continue the dialogue to resolve the deadlock and end the agitation. "Let's see what happens tomorrow. But, our meetings will continue with the government till our protest ends as it is necessary. We will not oppose the meetings with the government," Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said.The government and representatives of the farmers' unions have previously held eight rounds of discussions but both sides continue to stick to their original stance. After the last round of discussions, Tomar had asked farmers to suggest an alternative for the farm laws and made it clear that the government will not repeal the laws.On their part, the farmers have maintained that they will not end their protest till the time the three laws - passed by Parliament in September - are repealed. They have also sought a legal guarantee that the system of procurement under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) will continue unaffected.The Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the implementation of the farm laws and ordered the formation of a four-member committee to end the impasse between the government and the farmers who have been protesting near Delhi since late November.The three contentious laws are Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act after several petitions were filed against them.The farmers' unions representatives after the Supreme Court order had said that they do not want the four-member committee to resolve the issues citing government's stand on the farm laws. They highlighted that discussions with the committee will not lead to any results if the government remains firm on not repealing the laws.Farmer unions believe that these laws allow multinational companies to enter the agricultural sector and earn profits at the expense of the farmers. They also believe that these laws will affect government procurement of crop yields under the MSP system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-before-ninth-round-of-talks-with-farmers-agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-says-hopeful-of-positive-discussion-101610626250771.html
14-01-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi watches Jallikattu, says message to Centre; BJP slams 'hypocrisy'||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday watched the bull taming sport jallikattu here, noting the animals were not getting injured as was being made out and said his visit was a message to the Centre that wants to "suppress" the Tamil culture. The BJP ridiculed Gandhi for his 'hypocrisy' by witnessing jallikattu and praising the sport, reminding that the Congress-led UPA had banned it in 2011.Sharpening his attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA government over the three contentious farm laws which have put farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana on the warpath, he accused the government of "conspiring to destroy" peasants to benefit a select few businessmen.Flanked by senior Congress leaders KC Venugopal, Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy and TNCC President K S Alagiri, Gandhi witnessed jallikattu at Avaniapuram here and said his visit was aimed at sending out a message to "those who think they can run roughshod on Tamil people." The former party president was joined by DMK Youth Wing Secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin on the dais. Jallikattu is held in the state, especially with much vigour in this district, coinciding with the Tamil harvest festival Pongal which heralds the auspicious Tamil month Thai."One of the main reasons I came is, today the government in Delhi is under the impression that they can destroy the cultures of this country. They believe that they can suppress the emotions of Tamil people, they believe they can crush the language of the Tamil people, they can suppress the spirit of the Tamil people.""I came to give them a message that nobody can suppress the Tamil spirit," he told reporters at the airport here before returning to Delhi.After witnessing jallikattu he got a sense of why Tamil people appreciate it, Gandhi said."There was a sense. Many people had mentioned to me that jallikatu is harmful to the bulls. I witnessed it today and I must say that the way it was done there was absolutely no chance of the bull getting injured.""In fact if it was anyone to get injured it was the young men doing jallikattu. I am happy to say that there have been some changes to make it safer for everybody," he said.Gandhi further said he flew down from Delhi to watch the hugely popular event "because I think Tamil culture, Tamil language (and) Tamil history are essential for the future of India and need to be respected by everybody." The Tamil spirit cannot be crushed, he said, adding he was 'completely' against the idea of one particular idea, language and notion."There are many different languages, ideas and all these contribute to our strength and that is my message," he said.However, the BJP lashed out at the Congress leader over his visit to the temple town today. Party national general secretary and Tamil Nadu in-charge, C T Ravi accused Gandhi of insulting Tamil 'makkal' (people) on jallikattu with his hypocrisy.Taking a dig at Rahul's visit to Avaniyapuram, Ravi made a referrence to the UPA government banning the sport by adding bulls in the list of performing animals."Dear @RahulGandhi, Your Govt in 2011 labelled #Jallikattu as cruel & barbaric. Your Party manifesto supported ban on Jallikattu. Today, you are in Tamil Nadu to watch this traditional sport live. Aren't you insulting lovely Tamil Makkal with your hypocrisy? Happy Pongal," Ravi said in a tweet.Hitting out at the Centre on the contentious farm laws, Gandhi alleged that the government was "conspiring to destroy" the ryots and asserted that his party will stand with them. "The government is not just neglecting them (farmers), the government is conspiring to destroy them. There is a difference. Neglecting is ignoring...they are not ignoring them," he said in response to a query. "They are trying to destroy them, because they want to benefit two or three of their friends. They want to give what belongs to the farmer to two or three of their friends," he alleged. "You are suppressing the farmers (and) helping handful of businesses," he said. Extending his party's support to the farmers, Gandhi said the laws will indeed be repealed."Mark my words..these laws-- the government will be forced to take them back," he said, adding he was "proud" of what the farmers were doing (protesting against the laws). Charging Narendra Modi with "not supporting" the common man during the coronavirus pandemic, Gandhi asked "whose Prime Minister are you?" "Are you the Prime Minister of the people of India or the Prime Minster of two-three selected businessmen?" he asked. He also sought to know why Modi was "silent" on the months long Sino-India standoff, asking "why are the Chinese people sitting inside Indian territory." Earlier, Gandhi attended the Pongal celebrations with people of Thenpalanji village in the district and also had food with them. He took photos with local youth and interacted with some elderly people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-watches-jallikattu-says-message-to-centre-bjp-slams-hypocrisy-101610625280817.html
14-01-2021||India||Politicians against farmers' protest not allowed in this UP village||The villagers of Saroorpur Kala in western Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat district have banned the entry of those leaders who are not supporting the ongoing farmers’ agitation against three contentious agriculture laws. The decision was taken by a panchayat of 36 caste groups in the village on Wednesday. The village has a population of about 25,000.Subhash Nain, a farmer who attended the panchayat, said, “The entire panchayat unanimously condemned those leaders (of political parties or farmers' organisations) who are not extending their support to the ongoing movement and unanimously decided to ban their entry in the village.”“What's their relevance if they can't stand with the farmers during their battle for survival?” asked Nain while quoting the panchayat's views.The panchayat also decided to visit the protesting farmers in Delhi with ration and other essential items on January 16.It was decided to collect donations, monetary or otherwise, from each family of the village, irrespective of their caste and community, in support of the movement.“Villagers have so far donated ₹4.5 lakh and spared at least nine tractors to take ration and other commodities (mainly firewood to protect farmers from the cold),” said Nain. He added that the village pradhan Jeet Singh had made a contribution of ₹21,000 and spared his tractor for Delhi.Similarly, former pradhan Tejveer Singh and Jagveer Singh had contributed ₹5,000 and ₹2,100, respectively, he added. Other villagers have also donated in support of the protesting farmers, he said.The villagers claimed that they had nothing to do with any party."What to do with a government which doesn’t listen even to the genuine demands of people?” asked a villager.Meanwhile, the farmers’ indefinite dharna (sit-in) continued on the 28th day in Baraut town of Baghpat district. Earlier, farmers led by khap chaudharies (khap or clan leaders) sat on dharna on the Delhi-Saharanpur highway on December 17 in order to extend their support to the ongoing protest.Activists of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tomar) led by their divisional president Padam Singh staged a day-long dharna at the Meerut Cantt railway station on Tuesday to show their solidarity with the farmers' movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politicians-against-farmers-protest-not-allowed-in-this-up-village-101610623665119.html
14-01-2021||India||Harish Rawat insists Congress names a ‘CM face’ for Uttarakhand polls||Congress national general secretary and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat has sparked a debate in the party by insisting that it should declare its chief ministerial candidate for the 2022 assembly election.Rawat had recently said that the party leadership should declare the CM face for the polls which would help end the factionalism and clear confusion among party workers.On Tuesday, he took to social media urging the party national leadership to declare Pritam Singh, Uttarakhand Congress unit president as the CM face for 2022. In the same media post he also named leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh as another possible candidate saying he "doesn't have a problem with her either as the CM face."His statements have made the state leadership including Singh and Hridayesh uneasy. Both Singh and Hridayesh have been saying that the party would fight the elections under a "collective leadership."In one of his social media posts on Tuesday, Rawat wrote, "Pritam Singh is our ‘General’ (Senapati). Hence, I request the leadership to declare him the CM face of Congress in 2022 polls. I will also welcome the name of Hridayesh as I have already ended the speculations regarding my name for the same."In the same post, he also underlined that he wants to exit the “collective leadership.”"I request the party leadership to free me from the collective leadership as sometimes it is also important for one to stay free. Also, the debacle of 2017 polls has made me a burden on the state leadership which I want to end by keeping myself away."Even before the unease that his posts had sparked died down, he put out another post on Wednesday saying he would “stand behind whosoever the party declares the CM face.""From a strategic point of view also, it is important to do so as it would end the winning streak of BJP. It could be our strategy to go in with a Congress CM face vs a BJP CM face. I believe doing so will improve the party’s performance in 2022," he said.Amid the discomfort in the Congress, Pritam Singh tried to play it down saying that it was Rawat’s “personal suggestion.”"Declaring CM face is his suggestion. Our party had earlier fought the previous assembly polls without declaring the CM face whether it was 2002, 2007 or 2012. We will do the same in 2022 also. Moreover, our party state unit in-charge Devendra Yadav has already said that the party would fight the polls under collective leadership and accept whoever the central leadership decides for the CM candidate," said Singh.Leader of Opposition, Hridayesh however, countered Rawat's suggestion by reminding him of his loss on both seats from where he contested in 2017 as the party's CM face."Rawat himself was the CM face in 2017 polls and lost on both the seats from where he fought which anyway was a bad decision. Also, all know we have never declared the CM face before polls. In 2017 when he was the CM face, we failed to win in all the districts which could have given us 13 seats instead of the present 11," she said.Rawat’s pitch for a chief ministerial face seemingly also has not yet made an impression on the party’s national leadership.The Congress party’s Uttarakhand in-charge Devendra Yadav said, "We are at present focused on our preparations for the 2022 polls. We will fight it under collective leadership and think about the CM face later after winning it."MM Semwal, a political observer, believes the “CM face” is a clever card by Rawat to jockey for the chief minister’s post."Rawat is a very shrewd and seasoned politician. Whatever he says or does is very well planned and he knows what the results would be. Rawat also knows that he is the only major face for the Congress in Uttarakhand and what he had said about a CM face is just to burnish that image in the state before the polls. If Congress wins the 2022 elections, there is every chance that Rawat will again become the CM and he too knows that," Semwal said.The ruling BJP insists that a CM face will make no difference to the Congress’ fate in the polls."Congress is divided into factions which is an open secret. They are now fighting over the CM face for the next assembly polls which is like swinging a stick in the air. We will win more than 60 seats and again come to power while Congress will keep dreaming to win it," said Bansidhar Bhagat, BJP president in Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harish-rawat-insists-congress-names-a-cm-face-for-uttarakhand-polls-101610623427814.html
14-01-2021||India||'If any superpower wants to hurt our self-esteem...': Rajnath Singh's stern message to China||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday indirectly gave a stern message to China saying that India's soldiers are capable of giving befitting reply to any "superpower" that wants to hurt India's self-esteem."We don't want war, but if any superpower wants to hurt our self-esteem, then our soldiers are capable of giving a befitting reply," Singh said on the occasion of Armed Forces Veterans Day without naming China, according to new agency PTI."India does not want conflict with anyone; it wants peace and friendly ties since it's in our blood and culture," PTI further quoted him as saying.The defence minister is in Bengaluru at Indian Air Force's HQ Training Command.Talking about the ₹48,000 crore defence deal cleared by the Centre on Wednesday, Singh said, "We have given approval for the acquisition of 83 indigenous LCA Tejas fighter jets from HAL. This decision will help generate more than 50,000 job opportunities in the country."The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the largest indigenous defence procurement deal to buy 83 LCA Tejas Mark1A fighter jets.The deal would strengthen the Air Force's fleet of homegrown fighter jet. Singh had earlier called the deal "game-changer for self-reliance".The defence minister's remarks come amidst the Ladakh standoff which has now entered its ninth month, with soldiers holding forward positions at friction points in extreme weather conditions. The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-level officers.Singh today said that during the standoff, India's soldiers displayed exemplary bravery and patience and "if that can be narrated then every Indian will feel proudChief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria visited forward areas in eastern Ladakh on Monday for a security review.In a year-end review of major developments published on January 1, the defence ministry had said that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) escalated the situation in the sensitive theatre by using unorthodox weapons against Indian soldiers and amassing a large number of troops during the ongoing border standoff along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).The ministry said the PLA attempted to alter the status quo in the sector by force but the Indian Army was well-entrenched to counter any misadventure by the adversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-forces-veterans-day-rajnath-s-superpower-remark-is-a-message-to-china-101610623620542.html
14-01-2021||India||It’s time to reward party workers in Rajasthan, says Pilot||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Thursday said that with a compact and comprehensive state Congress committee in place, political appointments will also be completed in January itself. “We welcome the new, compact and comprehensive team formed by Rajasthan in-charge Ajay Maken and party’s state president Govind Singh Dotasara. After discussing with everybody, as decided, political appointments in board will be done [in January]. The government has completed two years and it is time to reward hardworking party workers,” he said. He added that the Congress was left with 21 seats in 2013 and came back with full majority only because of its workers. “The sacrifice of workers at the time when the BJP was in power should be rewarded. It is time to appreciate such workers. Congress workers are demanding not only posts but respect and appreciation as well,” he said. The former deputy CM also said he was with the farmers as far as the Supreme Court orders were concerned. “The government should leave its stubbornness and repeal the farm laws...the questions raised by the famers on the panel formed by the Supreme Court are valid,” he said. Meanwhile, the state president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed his party’s morale was high. Satish Poonia said, “People across the country accept our ideology.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-time-to-reward-party-workers-in-rajasthan-says-pilot-101610623767178.html
14-01-2021||India||BSP chief Mayawati asks party workers to celebrate birthday by helping the poor||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati on Thursday called upon party workers to celebrate her 65th birthday on Friday as Jankalyankari Diwas.“The birthday should be celebrated in a simple manner following Covid-19 guidelines,” she said.In a series of tweets, Mayawati told the party workers to assist the poor and impoverished people who have had to suffer due to the pandemic.On the occasion, she will release the 16th edition of her book “A Travelogue of My Struggle Ridden Life and BSP Movement”. The travelogue will generate self-respect among party supporters and guide them towards taking the movement launched by the BSP forward, she said.A BSP leader said the party chief would celebrate her birthday with party leaders at the party’s central office in New Delhi.In Uttar Pradesh, the party’s state unit had directed party leaders to celebrate her birthday in all 75 districts by assisting migrants, farmers, labourers and the poor people who were facing problems due to the economic slowdown, he said.In Lucknow, the birthday programme would be organised at the divisional office located near Pasi Qila.“We will visit hamlets or hospitals to distribute sweets and fruits,” he said.The BSP used to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner when the party was in power in Uttar Pradesh. It began the practice of observing Jankalyankari Diwas after being voted out of power in the 2012 assembly elections.Mayawati has been camping in Delhi, where she is holding regular review meetings to gear up the party cadre for the 2022 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. She has directed party office bearers to expedite the process of strengthening the organisation at the booth level. To regain lost ground, the BSP plans to win back the support of the Brahmins, backward classes and Muslims, the party leader said.The BSP did not win any seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. It bagged 19 seats in the 2017 UP assembly polls and 10 in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when it had an alliance with the Samajwadi Party, but parted ways with the SP soon after the results were declared.After Mayawati became the UP chief minister for the fourth time in 2007, there was a grand celebration across the state on January 15, 2009. The display of opulence was quite palpable, the state capital was draped in blue and a massive stage was set up on the ground near the chief minister’s residence. BSP supporters were transported from all the districts and neighbouring states to participate in the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsp-chief-mayawati-asks-party-workers-to-celebrate-birthday-by-helping-the-poor-101610622781268.html

14-01-2021||India||Congress links Kerala chief minister to gold smuggling||Congress lawmaker PT Thomas on Thursday targeted Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over the recovery of 30 kg of gold smuggled into India in baggage addressed to the UAE consulate last year, saying he cannot get away by sacrificing some of his officials. He called Vijayan the “main accused” in the case. Thomas claimed Vijayan was aware of the activities of his former principal secretary M Sivasankar, who was arrested three months back in connection with the recovery at the Thiruvananthapuram airport of the gold hidden inside the bathroom fittings.“How can a chief minister who supported the smuggling activities be called a Communist and continue in power? The arrested secretary even said if he approaches the chief minister with a tissue paper, he will sign on it in seconds. They were so close and how can he wash off his hands now?” asked Thomas while introducing an adjournment motion over the matter in the state assembly. He accused Vijayan of turning a blind to the matter as the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) members tried to shout him down with counter-allegations. Also read | ED denies Sivasankar’s allegations of pressure to name political targetsThomas claimed Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the case, was threatened in jail “not to take big names.” He added Vijayan was aware of Sivasankar’s foreign trips with Suresh. Thomas said initially Vijayan gave “a good certificate” to the probe agencies but turned against them after they summoned his close aide C M Raveendran.Thomas said after he questioned an IT company owned by Vijayan’s daughter, Veena, the site of the Bengaluru-based firm disappeared.Vijayan rubbished the charges saying the government took immediate action after the case came to light. He added he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a central agency probe into the case. Vijayan said some opposition members were unnecessarily blaming him and spreading “loads of canards”.“We sacked the secretary immediately... We want to get to the bottom of the smuggling. So, we asked for a central agency probe. I criticised them when they deviated from their path. Now they are in a race to portray the government in a bad light but they will never succeed because people are with us.”Vijayan wondered whether opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala agreed with the repeated charge of the Congress leadership that the Centre was using central agencies to target opposition leaders. He cited cases against Congress leaders including P Chidambaram to make his point.After a two-hour discussion, opposition members stormed out of the House as Speaker P Sivaramakrishnan denied permission for the adjournment motion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-links-kerala-chief-minister-to-gold-smuggling-101610621187088.html
14-01-2021||India||Med students can seek course transfer in case of permanent disability: Bombay HC||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court recently upheld a rule laid down by the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) that allows medical students seek mid-course transfer from one college to another only if they acquires permanent disability of 40℅ or above.The division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice Avinash Gharote was hearing petition filed by Manali Barde, a medical student pursuing MBBS course at Government Medical College at Akola who had sought transfer claiming that she suffered from allergic bronchitis with chronic bronchial asthma, of a moderate persistent nature, frequently leading to breathlessness, and was this highly susceptible to Covid-19.She moved HC after her application for transfer to a medical college in Nagpur was rejected by the DMER on August 20, 2020, primarily on the ground that in terms of clause 13(a)(ii) of the DMER brochure, transfer of medical students from one college to another was permitted only if the student acquires permanent disability of 40% or above.Barde then challenged validity of the clause. Her counsel, Dr. Uday Warunjikar, submitted that clause 13(a)(ii) was ultra vires the power of DMER or state, and was therefore required to be quashed and set aside.Dr. Warunjikar pointed out that the clause was completely contrary to Medical Council of India (MCI) Regulations of December 2018, which allow mid-course transfer of medical students on “genuine grounds.” He asserted that it was impermissible for DMER to lay down the guidelines and specify specific conditions for migration of medical students.“There cannot be any two views that the regulations framed by the MCI, being framed by virtue of the Statutory power under Section 33 of the Medical Council of India Act, 1956, have primacy, over any guidelines, which may be framed by the DMER and the State,” said the bench.The bench, however, said under the MCI Regulations, state governments, universities and institutions have been authorised to frame guidelines for grant of no-objection certificate for migration, and the MCI regulations do not define or clarify what “genuine ground” would mean.The court said in absence of defining the expression “genuine ground” by the MCI in its regulations, it would be open and permissible, for the DMER or the state to lay down guidelines, defining the parameters of the expression “genuine ground.”The bench also ratified the DMER brochure, saying “the requirement of 40℅ or above permanent disability, so as to be considered as a genuine ground is based upon Section 2(Zc) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and the schedule as appended thereunder, and thus has a statutory backing to it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/med-students-can-seek-course-transfer-in-case-of-permanent-disability-bombay-hc-101610620827186.html

14-01-2021||India||Farm leader opts out of SC panel citing farmers’ interest||Bhupinder Singh Mann, a key farm union leader appointed by the Supreme Court to a panel it had formed to scrutinise three contentious farms laws has declined the job, citing the “interests” of farmers. Mann, a former MP and the national president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, a farm union, said he was “recusing” himself from the committee of four set by the Supreme Court to look into farmers’ grievances over the laws. On January 12, the court had kept in abeyance the laws that have prompted hundreds of thousands of farmers to stage a months-long protest. It also set up a committee to start a dialogue with protesting farmers, comprising economists Ashok Kumar Gulati and PK Joshi as well as farm union leaders Anil Ghanwat and Mann as members. The panel formed by the Supreme Court has attracted public criticism because all four members named for the panel had either endorsed the farm laws or suggested improvements. Protesting farm unions said such a committee was already biased in favour of reforms. “As a farmer myself and a union leader, in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions among the farmers and public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as not to compromise the interests of Punjab and the farmers of the country,” Mann said in a press statement. Mann is the chairman of the All India Kisan Coordination Committee, a platform of farm unions who have supported the farm laws. Mann had met Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in December, urging him not to repeal the laws. This pitted him against hundreds of other farm unions demanding a repeal. An official of the agriculture ministry declined to comment on Mann’s move, saying this was a Supreme Court-monitored process. Farm unions protesting the laws to open up agricultural markets said they were indifferent to Mann’s decision. “Our stand is we will not take part in any consultations by the court-appointed committee because our only demand is repeal of the laws,” said Darshan Pal, a senior member of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, the organisation leading the farmers’ protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-leader-opts-out-of-sc-panel-citing-farmers-interest-101610618008144.html

I was working on the post of a secretary and don't have any political background. To bring a person like me into the party, only PM Narendra Modi and BJP can do it," Sharma later told reporters.Sharma, who assumed the charge as Secretary in the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) in April last year, took voluntary retirement from service recently ahead of his scheduled superannuation in July 2022.The central government accepted his voluntary retirement plea on Monday, when the BJP state unit was busy finalising names of candidates for the biennial election to 12 seats in the UP Legislative Council. The quick acceptance of his application for voluntary retirement has started a buzz in the BJP circles that Sharma may be sent to the Legislative Council.Elections are being held on 12 seats and the last date for filing of nominations is January 18.Even while senior BJP leaders are maintaining a silence over Sharma’s candidature for the council, those privy to the developments on the issue said, he may be made the deputy chief minister in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet. Another view on his role suggests he may be given a key assignment at the Centre.Sharma is considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had worked in the Gujarat government and as Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his tenure as the chief minister of Gujarat. Sharma also served as additional secretary in the Prime Minister Office (PMO).A postgraduate in political science from Allahabad University, Sharma is a native of Kajha Khurd village in Muhammadabad Gohna tehsil in Mau district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bureaucrat-arvind-sharma-joins-bjp-buzz-over-his-role-in-up-politics-101610617566697.html

Farmers have said that they will not hold any talks with the committee as all four members are pro-government.The other members of the court-appointed committee are economists Ashok Gulati, Dr Pramod Kumar Joshi and farmer leader Anil Ghanwat. The committee has been asked by the Supreme Court to submit its report in two months.Tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of Delhi against the farm legislation enacted by the Parliament in September last year. So far, eight rounds of talks have taken place between the government and farmers but have failed to resolve the deadlock. Both sides will now meet on January 15 to discuss the matter.Farmers have been demanding a complete withdrawal of the laws which has been refused by the government. Instead, it has offered to make amendments.Farmers are also demanding a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) system for the procurement of their crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-view-of-apprehensions-member-opts-out-of-supreme-court-appointed-panel-on-farm-laws-101610617112085.html
14-01-2021||India||Nepal foreign minister Gyawali in New Delhi to discuss Covid-19 cooperation, boundary issue||Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali arrived in the Indian capital on Thursday for a two-day visit expected to focus on procuring Covid-19 vaccines and development cooperation, though Kathmandu has also signalled its intent to raise the border row. Gyawali will meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar for talks on Friday, and the two ministers will chair a meeting of the bilateral joint commission. This will be only the sixth meeting of the body since 1987, though it has convened four times since 2014. Gyawali was also set to hold several private meetings on Thursday. The minister is the most senior Nepalese leader to visit India in more than a year after the Covid-19 outbreak. He is also the first leader to visit New Delhi since Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli triggered political turmoil by dissolving Parliament last month and calling early elections in April-May. Gyawali’s delegation includes both the foreign secretary and health secretary, reflecting the focus on Covid-19 cooperation. Though Nepal has formally reached out to India and China for vaccines, Kathmandu has indicated a preference for sourcing doses from New Delhi because of factors such as pricing, logistics and well-established links between the health sectors of the two countries. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Nepal is hoping India will provide vaccines as assistance to inoculate a part of the 12 million population it plans to cover in its first phase of vaccinations. Nepal also plans to buy millions of doses from foreign suppliers, including the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.Also read | Nepal PM Oli pledges to ‘retrieve’ Kalapani region from India through talksThe Indian side has said the country’s ability to export vaccines after meeting domestic needs will become clear over the next few weeks. Officials have also said India’s neighbours will get priority for the supply of vaccines. India-Nepal ties came under the shadow of a border row last year after Oli’s government issued a new political map that included Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, which are part of Indian territory. The map was published in response to India’s opening of a strategic road to Lipulekh, located on the border with China. In a statement announcing Gyawali’s visit on Tuesday, Nepal’s foreign ministry said the joint commission meeting will discuss the gamut of bilateral relations, including “trade, transit, energy, boundary, Covid-19 cooperation, infrastructure, connectivity, investment, agriculture, tourism, culture, among others”. The people cited above said India had made its position on the border row very clear – the external affairs ministry last year described Nepal’s new map as “unjustified cartographic assertion” – and the stance hadn’t changed. They added the focus of the upcoming meeting will be taking forward development cooperation, including India-backed projects in Nepal. Given that Oli currently heads a caretaker government, there is unlikely to be any substantive movement on the border issue, the people said. One option the two sides could look at is asking the bilateral boundary working group to look afresh at the border issue to help finalise the border in the disputed sections at Kalapani and Susta, the people added.

Many matters relating to life and liberty, including bail, which require immediate attention remain unheard, creating a helpless situation for litigants and lawyers," the letter said.There are many flaws in the virtual court hearing, including network connectivity issues and no proper management by the Registry, it said.The letter, which was also signed by more than 500 lawyers including many senior lawyers of the Apex Court, stated that the members of the Bar, particularly young practitioners, have been going through a difficult stage in the past 10 months between the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent virtual functioning of the Supreme Court.The letter also claimed that the virtual hearing of the Top Court has more lacunae than benefits and that it has failed to adequately serve the cause of justice."In this regard, it is also noted that judges, as well as the Attorney General of India, had expressed reservations about the virtual system's functioning," the letter stated.No response to the calls by the dealing officers when it comes to mentioning, said the letter, seeking a direction of the CJI to start physical hearings in the Supreme Court.Dismissing of mentioning of urgent matters by mentioning bench without providing any reason, over 50 per cent of young practitioners have been constrained to leave Delhi as they are unable to meet living expenses, the letter claimed.It further underlined that various High Courts in the country have also started physical hearings and the Apex Court should also consider starting the same with precautionary measures in the view of COVID-19.

"When the laws were passed, he had congratulated the prime minister saying that Mahendra Tikait's soul must be in peace after 27 years and his dreams are being fulfilled through these laws," the minister told PTI.Mahendra Tikait was an influential and well-known farmer leader of Uttar Pradesh.Also Read | Farmers' protest: Centre willing for 9th round of talks but farmers doubtfulThe minister's comments came ahead of the 9th round of meeting between the Centre and farmers, which hangs in balance after the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the farm laws and set up a committee to broker peace between the Centre and the farmers. Since the new committee will now listen to the grievances of the farmers, union leaders are questioning whether there is any use of continuing the parallel talks which so far has not yielded any result.The protest against the laws which farmers see as pro-corporates commenced on November 26 and is still going on. Farmers will not go back unless the laws are completely repealed, union leaders have said. The Centre, on the other hand, reiterated their stance that the laws will not be withdrawn, though some amendments can be accommodated.Farmers are not willing to appear before the Supreme Court panel as well as they think the members of the panels are supporters of the farm laws."Unions are saying that the members in the committee had at some point supported the laws, but I would like to say union leader Rakesh Tikait had also supported the laws," the minister said.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-rakesh-tikait-congratulated-pm-modi-on-farm-laws-minister-attacks-farmer-leader-101610613457796.html

This would be the world's largest immunisation exercise. Therefore, it has been decided by the Ministry of Health in consultation with the office of the President of India to reschedule the Polio vaccination day, also known as the National Immunisation Day (NID) or 'Polio Ravivar' to 31st January."A limited number of sites out of the 2,934 inoculation centres have been shortlisted from where the beneficiaries can interact with the prime minister and the authorities in those centres have been asked to make provisions for IT infrastructure for providing a two-way interactive communication facility to enable it to link and interact with the national launch site through a video link, the sources said.Officials at New Delhi's AIIMS and Safdarjung hospitals, which are among the shortlisted facilities, said they are "ready for a two-way communication".Around three lakh healthcare workers will get vaccine shots at 2,934 sites across the country on the first day of the massive nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive, a senior official said.Each vaccination session will cater to a maximum of 100 beneficiaries.According to the guidelines issued to the shortlisted vaccination centres, healthcare workers (those registered in Co-WIN to be vaccinated) on the launch shall include not only doctors, nurses but also nursing orderlies, safai karamcharis, ambulance drivers, and would be from a mixed age group, including above 50 years.The full initial procurement of 1.65 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin-- has been allocated to all states and UTs in proportion to their healthcare workers database."Therefore, there is no question of discrimination against any State in allocation of vaccination doses. This is the initial lot of supply of vaccine doses and would be continuously replenished in the weeks to come. Therefore, any apprehension being expressed on account of deficient supply is totally baseless and unfounded," the ministry said.States have been advised to organize vaccination sessions taking into account 10 per cent reserve/wastage doses and an average of 100 vaccinations per session per day.Therefore, any undue haste on the parts of the states to organize unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day is not advised, the ministry had said on Wednesday.The states and UTs have also been advised to increase the number of vaccination session sites that would be operational every day in a progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilizes and moves forward.According to the government, the shots will be offered first to an estimated one crore healthcare workers, and around two crore frontline workers, and then to persons above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities.Cost of vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers will be borne by the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-covid-19-vaccination-drive-on-january-16-101610612470716.html

Eight rounds of talks have failed to resolve the deadlock between the government and farmers’ unions representing the protesting farmers, with the government insistent on not rolling back the laws and the unions adamant on a total repeal.Here are some key dates of an agitation that looks unlikely to end anytime soon:Nov 26 and 27: Farmers, majority from Punjab, begin their "Dill Chalo" march on November 26, Constitution Day. A confrontation takes place with the Haryana Police but the farmers arrive on the outskirts of Delhi. They have a faceoff with the Delhi Police the next day, but are eventually allowed to go to Nirankari grounds in Burari.

Farmers reject Shah’s appeal the next day.Dec 1, 3 and 5: Third, fourth and fifth round of talks take place between the government and farmers’ unions but fail to break the deadlock. December 9 is fixed for the next round of talks.Dec 8: A nationwide Bharat Bandh takes place. Late at night, Shah hosts an “informal” meet with farmers’ leaders. Talks remain inconclusive and leaders decide not to come for December 9 talks.Dec 9: Leaders of various opposition parties, including former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, meet President Ram Nath Kovind seeking a repeal of the farm laws.Dec 13: Thousands of farmers march from Rajasthan’s Shahjahanpur to Delhi but are stopped by the Haryana Police.

Chief Justice SA Bobde-headed bench says protests should be allowed to continue “without any breach of peace either by the protesters or the police.”Dec 20 and 24: Centre invites farmers’ unions to propose next round of talks at a time and date as per their convenience. Farmers propose December 29 but the government fixes December 30 for the next round of talks.Dec 24: Gandhi leads a four-member Congress delegation to meet President Kovind. The delegation submits to Kovind letter containing “3 crore signatures” against the laws.Dec 30: Sixth round of talks take place as the two sides manage to arrive at a consensus on two out of four demands raised by the unions. Impasse continues on legal assurance for Minimum Support Price (MSP) and total repeal of laws.Jan 2: Farmers’ unions announce a series of programmes to build pressure on the government to repeal the laws. This includes a mega tractor march in Delhi on Republic Day and a “trailer” on January 6.Jan 4 and 8: Seventh and eighth round of talks take place but once again no resolution is found. January 15 fixed as the next date.Jan 7: Farmers hold their “trailer” for the Republic Day tractor march: a tractor rally on the Kondli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway after earlier postponing it by a day due to bad weather.Jan 11: The Supreme Court hears a clutch of pleas challenging the laws and indicates it would order a stay on their implementation for the time being.Jan 12: Implementation of farm laws stayed until further orders and a four-member committee formed to handle the negotiations. Unions, however, reject the committee saying that the four members have already supported the laws publicaly, and announce that the agitation would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-days-of-farmers-protests-a-look-at-some-key-dates-101610610803136.html

However, both the AIMIM and the BJP have rejected these claims.Sakshi Maharaj’s statement assumes significance in the view of AIMIM’s impressive showing in Bihar polls, which is believed to have dented the prospects of the candidates from the Mahagathbandhan on several seats in close contests with the winning National Democratic Alliance or the NDA.The Mahagatbandhan suffered a big setback in the Seemanchal region where AIMIM put up a strong show, which could have cost GA the elections in Bihar, claim analysts.After gaining a foothold in Bihar, AIMIM has announced its plan to strengthen party organisation and fight elections in other key states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.Owaisi’s party is likely to contest the upcoming panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh under an electoral pact with regional outfit Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP).The SBSP, headed by former UP minister Om Prakash Rajbhar, is garnering smaller and regional parties under the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha."Candidates belonging to Asaduddin Owaisi's party are likely to be fielded in the panchayat elections as the Morcha's joint candidate," PTI quoted Rajbhar as saying on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/owaisi-would-help-bjp-in-up-and-west-bengal-polls-says-skashi-maharaj-101610608732513.html

Differently-abled passengers and cancer patients were also permitted to use the rail services, and later, women passengers and lawyers were given stipulated time slots within which they could travel.“During our regular checking, we have found many passengers trying to travel with fake identity cards. Majority of cards have been found by pharmaceutical companies, diagnostic and imaging centres,” said a senior CR official.Train services were suspended from March 23 due to the spread of coronavirus in the city.Most recently, a woman passenger was detained at Kalyan railway station on Tuesday for attempting to travel by a local train carrying a fake identity card. The Kalyan GRP registered a case against the passenger.Last Friday, CR officials caught 58 fake identification card-holders at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT).Meanwhile, passenger associations have stated that many daily wage workers have no other options and train services should resume for the general public with staggered office hours.“Most of the people who have started to go to work daily cannot afford road travel. Local trains are an affordable means of commute. The state government and railways should introduce staggered office timings for private and government employees, and allow the general public to travel,” said Lata Argade, secretary, Suburban Railway Passenger Association.Further, the CR anti-tout squad arrested three people and seized 400 e-tickets worth ₹6.43 lakh in December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hundreds-booked-for-travelling-on-mumbai-local-trains-with-fake-ids-101610607326541.html

She advocated in favour of the farm laws and alleged that farmers were being misled and were not protesting on their own. She held that the Central government passed the farm laws for farmers’ benefit.Hema Malini, who was visiting her parliamentary constituency after 10 months, interacted with the media on Wednesday.“Farmers should say what is wrong in the farm laws and what needs to be done. Farmers are opposing farm laws without understanding them. During talks with the Centre, farmer representatives do not point out any problems in the farm laws but simply call for their withdrawal. If farmers understand, they will find the farm laws to be beneficial,’” said Malini.She accused the opposition of hypocritical behaviour on the issue. ‘The Opposition is opposing the farm laws just for the sake of it. Congress wanted to bring such laws during their regime but is now opposing them,” Malini said, while welcoming the Supreme Court order aimed to break the deadlock between the protesting farmers and the Central government.Speaking in favour of setting up industries in Mathura, the BJP MP favoured decreasing the area of Taj Trapezium Zone so that big industries could come up in Mathura. There are certain restrictions on industries in TTZ area on environmental pretext.She also welcomed the proposal for setting up a film city in NOIDA and reiterated her commitment to get Mathura included in the National Capital Region (NCR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-don-t-understand-farm-laws-are-being-misled-hema-malini-101610606877262.html

The ministry has advised the states to not organise "unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day".The emergency vaccination for healthcare workers has been much awaited as several countries started vaccination last year December.The Centre has also urged the states to take into account 10 per cent wastage of doses, which is a general possibility.After the Drug Controller General of India on January 3 gave restricted, emergency-use authorisation to two vaccines, preparations were on to officially procure them to kick off the vaccination drive.The Centre procured 1.65 crore vaccine doses including 1.1 crores of Serum Institute's Covishield and 55 lakh of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. The doses have been dispatched to all states.Some states have raised complaints that the number of doses they have received will not be adequate to cover all their healthcare workers, but the ministry has said that the procurement was done according to the database provided by the state governments. Also, this is the initial supply of vaccine doses which will be replenished in the weeks to come, the ministry has said.Instead of trying to accommodate more people than recommended per session, the state governments should gradually increase the number of vaccination sites "in a progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilises and moves forward".Based on which vaccines are being administered, sites will be identified as Covaxin (Bharat Biotech) and Covishield (Serum Institute) sites as beneficiaries will have to be inoculated again after 28 days.Amid a raging debate of healthcare workers not being able to choose between Covaxin and Covishield, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan earlier said no country has given this option to those who are being inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-room-for-10-wastage-don-t-rush-centre-s-advise-to-states-on-vaccination-101610602137297.html

We do not expect the temperatures to fall beyond this.” He added Srinagar recorded a minimum temperature of minus 7.8 degrees Celsius two days earlier.

However, light rain and snowfall cannot be ruled out,” he said.The lowest temperature ever-- minus 14.4 degrees Celsius--was recorded in Srinagar in 1893.The mountainous resort town of Pahalgam was the coldest place in the Valley as it recorded a minimum temperature of minus 11.1 degrees Celsius, up from minus 11.7 a day earlier. The mercury plunged to minus 7 in Gulmarg, the famous ski resort over 150 km away.The freezing temperature has added to the woes of people as water supply pipes have frozen and roads have become risky for motorists amid complaints about delays in snow clearance following the heaviest snowfall in the Valley this season last week.Kashmir is in the middle of the harshest 40-day phase of winter known as Chillia Kalan that ends on January 31.“Saw big icicles hanging around house roofs in Srinagar after a long, long time. Chilai Kalan, this year, is showing its full might. Clearly reminiscent of the childhood days when such scenes would be a routine every winter,” wrote a netizen Mir Faheem on social media.

He is responding to the treatment," the official said.The team from AIIMS arrived in Goa on Tuesday and reviewed the health condition of the Union Minister of State for Defence and AYUSH.On Wednesday, the team of AIIMS doctors extubated Naik (removed the tube inserted to assist him in breathing) and he was put on HFNC, the official said.Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday said Naik is conscious and recovering.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who visited the GMCH on Tuesday, had said that if required, Naik will be shifted to New Delhi for further treatment.Naik received injuries, while his wife Vijaya and an aide died on Monday when their car met with accident near Ankola in Uttar Kannada district while he was returning to home state Goa from Dharmasthala in neighbouring Karnataka.GMCH's Dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar on Tuesday said when Naik was brought to the GMCH on Monday night, he was critical and four major surgeries were performed on him.Bandekar had also said that Naik will continue to be in the hospital for another 10 to 15 days, and it will take at least three to four months for him to recuperate completely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-shripad-naik-s-health-improving-doctors-101610598280597.html
14-01-2021||India||Govt to set up faceless digital mechanism to levy income tax penalties||After implementing faceless assessment and faceless appeal systems on income tax matters, the government has decided to set up a National Faceless Penalty Centre to have an unbiased and transparent digital faceless mechanism for imposing penalties on tax defaulters.The government on Tuesday notified the faceless penalty scheme, which will have a National Faceless Penalty Centre at the apex level. It will be assisted by regional centres, local penalty units and penalty review units, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said requesting anonymity.Also read | 5% more income tax returns filed this year“The system will provide adequate opportunity to assessees to be heard and also have provisions for review on legal and technical grounds. A review could also be initiated on the ground of arithmetical correctness of computation of penalty,” one of the officials said.Till the time the National Faceless Penalty Centre, its regional centres and local units are set up, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) will direct the National e-Assessment Centre (NeAC) and its units to also act as faceless penalty system, he said.Faceless schemes – inspired by the concept of digital governance -- are in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s August 13, 2020, announcement of three key structural tax reforms under the Transparent Taxation - Honouring the Honest platform. They are – Faceless Assessment, Faceless Appeal and Taxpayers Charter. The technology-driven faceless systems aim to end overreach by officials, while the charter defines the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers, a second official said.Naveen Wadhwa, DGM at Taxmann, the publisher on taxation matters, said that faceless systems will certainly curb corruption, but it will also serve the larger purpose of reforms in tax administration. “The income tax department is aiming to build a complete eco-system of an end-to-end digital solution for all proceedings under the [Income-Tax] Act,” he said.“India is the first country to build a system for faceless assessment, appeal and penalty proceedings. This is just another step to harness the power of technology in reforming the income tax department,” he said. Currently, all key processes related to income-tax administration, such as permanent account number (PAN) enrolment, filing of returns, assessment proceedings, penalty proceedings and appeals, are governed digitally.Sanjay Kumar, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India, said, “Faceless system does remove person-to-person contact. It also ensures that any tax or penalty imposition is not done by an individual, but is technically reviewed by a panel of senior officers.” This peer-review is essential to make sure that tax adjustments and penalties are not imposed on the basis whims of officials, he said.“Faceless system also ensures that the cases are picked up in a centralised manner, and dealt in a centralised manner, ensuring uniformity of approach and proper application of law,” he said, adding that a fair and efficient system is now evolving. “Though the output is still to come, but I’m quite confident that it would be able to achieve the desired fairness and efficiency,” he added.The faceless penalty centre would help in creating a fair and efficient system, said Wadhwa. “Currently, AO [assessing officer], who is assessing the taxpayer, is required to conduct penalty proceedings. It is often seen that the penalty order passed by the AO is challenged by the taxpayer on the grounds that it has been passed without following the principles of natural justice or an incorrect assumption of law. Under the Faceless Penalty Scheme, this issue will be ruled out as the penalty proceedings shall be done by an entirely different unit, and not by the unit conducting the faceless assessment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-set-up-faceless-digital-mechanism-to-levy-income-tax-penalties-101610598145924.html

Dr Vinod Paul, member (health) Niti Aayog and chairman, national expert group on vaccine administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) will inaugurate the laboratory on Thursday morning, in the presence of Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, SpiceJet, and Avani Singh, chief executive officer, SpiceHealth.India had started genome sequencing of Covid-19 positive samples of UK returnees soon after the flights from UK were suspended on December 23, 2020. The total number of persons found to be positive with the new UK variant genome stands at 102 as on Wednesday. India has begun sequencing the genes of at least 5% of all Covid-19 positive samples in an attempt to better track mutations in the Sars-CoV-2 virus. To do this, the government has set up a genomic surveillance consortium under the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Ten highly advanced labs in reputed institutes from across the country have been designated to perform genome sequencing of samples. The laboratory network-- Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (Insacog) was specifically created for this purpose last month. The labs are NIMHANS, Bengaluru, CCMB, Hyderabad, NIV, Pune, IGIB, Delhi, NCDC, New Delhi, NCBG, Kolkata, NCBS, InSTEM, Bengaluru, CDFD Hyderabad, ILS Bhubaneswar, and NCCS Pune. The presence of the new UK variant has already been reported by Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore, so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-international-airport-to-get-genome-sequencing-lab-today-101610595926134.html

14-01-2021||India||Farmers’ protest: Youth Congress collects soil for India’s map as a tribute||The Youth Congress is collecting soil from across the country to draw a map of India as a mark of respect to those, who have lost their lives in the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws enacted in September. Launched on January 9, the nationwide campaign titled Ek Mutthi Mitti Shaheedon Ke Naam is expected to conclude in Delhi within a month, Youth Congress president Srinivas BV said. He said the campaign is inspired by the historic Dandi March of Mahatma Gandhi against the British salt monopoly.Thousands of farmers, mainly from northern India, have camped on the borders of Delhi since November 26 to protest against the laws they say will weaken their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of powerful agribusinesses.“Over 65 farmers have lost their lives at Delhi borders since past 50 days agitating in a peaceful and democratic manner. They are braving extreme weather conditions and have remained undeterred by the excessive force used by the central government against them,” said Srinivas BV.During the campaign from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, the soil will be collected, especially from villages and home towns of the 65 farmers, who have lost their lives during the agitation. Srinivas BV visited Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh last week to collect the soil.“With that soil, we will create a map of India, the one built on the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and sacrifices made by martyrs who laid their lives during the freedom struggle of India,” said Krishna Allavaru, the national in-charge of the Youth Congress.Srinivas BV has organised health, blood donation campaigns and provided food and medicines to the protesting farmers at different places along Delhi’s borders with Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.The Congress has also announced countrywide protests on January 15 against the three farm laws.A delegation of Congress leaders, led by former party chief Rahul Gandhi, on December 24 met President Ram Nath Kovind to demand a special Parliament session to repeal the laws.The Congress-ruled states have also passed bills bypassing the central laws that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for scale, and lay down new contract farming rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-youth-congress-collects-soil-for-india-s-map-as-a-tribute-101610594725824.html

The Yojana has increased coverage, mitigated risk & benefitted crores of farmers. I congratulate all beneficiaries of the scheme.”On Wednesday, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar reviewed the scheme, calling it a “milestone” to protect farm incomes. “The scheme is a milestone crop insurance scheme covering full crop cycle against the losses occurring due to non-preventable natural risk. A total of ₹90,000 crore has been paid as claims to farmers till now,” the minister said, addressing stakeholders through video conferencing.He cited disbursements of claims during drought in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, aside from hailstorms in Haryana and locust attacks in Rajasthan, in 2019, as some notable examples when the scheme safeguarded the interests of the farmers.

14-01-2021||India||Govt clears ₹48k-cr Tejas deal, first deliveries in 2024||India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved a much-awaited ₹48,000-crore proposal to buy 83 advanced Tejas jets to bolster the Indian Air Force (IAF)’s combat potential, with defence minister Rajnath Singh calling the largest indigenous defence procurement deal “a game changer for self-reliance in the Indian defence manufacturing” sector.The CCS approval came 10 months after the ministry gave the green light to the purchase of 83 LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jets from state-owned plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). The indigenous content of the jets will progressively increase as the production moves along.“The LCA-Tejas is going to be the backbone of the IAF fighter fleet in years to come. LCA-Tejas incorporates a large number of new technologies many of which were never attempted in India. The indigenous content of LCA-Tejas is 50% in Mk-1A variant which will be enhanced to 60%,” Singh said in a statement posted on his Twitter timeline.The aircraft to be ordered include 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft, the defence ministry said in a statement.The sheer number of fighters to be ordered and the capability that the Mk-1A variants will bring along with their modern weapons will significantly enhance the staying power and combat potential of the IAF, said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“The approval for the deal couldn’t have come at a better time considering the strong message it will sent to India’s neighbourhood. Also, it reflects the government’s sharp focus on the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India movement,” Nohwar said.HAL is expected to provide the first Mk-1A deliveries to the IAF three years after the deal is signed, with all the aircraft likely to be delivered by 2028-29. The Mk-1A programme is expected to generate thousands of jobs and will involve the participation of more than 500 Indian companies, the officials said. “HAL has already set-up second line manufacturing facilities at its Nasik and Bengaluru Divisions. Equipped with the augmented infrastructure, the HAL will steer LCA-Mk1A production for timely deliveries to the IAF,” Singh said in another tweet.The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123.The 40 LCAs already ordered by the IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far. The Mk-1A variant is expected to come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability.The AESA radar, BVR missiles, electronic warfare (EW) suite and air-to-air refuelling are critical capabilities that will make the LCA Mk-1A a potent platform that meets the operational requirements of the IAF, the defence ministry said in a statement. “The decision taken today will considerably expand the current LCA ecosystem and help in creating new job opportunities. HAL follows a system integrator model in LCA Mk-1A program and acts as an umbrella organisation, fostering manufacturing & design capabilities in pvt. Industry,” the defence minister tweeted. The Tejas programme will boost the Atmanirbhar drive in the aerospace and aeronautics sectors, said HAL chairman R Madhavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-clears-48k-cr-tejas-deal-first-deliveries-in-2024-101610569100193.html
14-01-2021||India||Probe all custodial deaths, rules NHRC||Ten years after it wrongly interpreted section 176 (1A) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has revoked a 2010 order which limited the scope of enquiry into custodial deaths to only those cases where there was reasonable suspicion of foul play or well-founded allegations of an offence.The human rights body issued a revised order in September 2020 that was not made public. The order, seen by HT, stated that the enquiry in all cases of custodial deaths, including natural deaths or deaths due to any illness, shall be conducted by a judicial magistrate or metropolitan magistrate.Section 176 (1A) was inserted in the statute in 2005, mandating an enquiry by judicial magistrate or metropolitan magistrate in cases of death, rapes and disappearances in custody; such enquiries were done by executive magistrates before 2005.However, a full bench of NHRC, on April 5, 2010, misinterpreted the law and issued an order saying that “when there is no suspicion or foul play or where there is no evidence or allegation of an offence, an enquiry by a judicial magistrate is not mandatory”.As a result, state police forces have been registering most custodial deaths incidents as natural deaths or suicides, according to experts. For example, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) , out of 85 total cases of custodial deaths in 2019, 33 were recorded as suicides and 36 as being caused by illnesses. Only two deaths were recorded due to physical assault in police custody. Similarly, almost 70% of deaths in police custody in the past decade (out of a total 1,004) have been attributed to illness, suicide or death from natural causes.NHRC’s full commission, led by its former Chairperson H L Dattu, observed the anomaly in the 2010 order and decided to withdraw it.In its recently revised order, reviewed by HT, and circulated to all states and Centre, NHRC has said – “…in three circumstances viz. death, disappearance or rape alleged to have been committed on any woman within the police or judicial custody, there must be an inquiry to be conducted by the Judicial Magistrate or Metropolitan Magistrate, in whose jurisdiction, the incident has taken place.”The provision, it said, cannot be diluted by qualifying that such an inquiry will be conducted only in suspicious circumstances.Dattu, who completed his five-year tenure as NHRC Chairperson last month, said: “I felt it required some sort of tinkering to bring it to proper perspective as there was something missing in the judgement (referring to the NHRC 2010 order). We noticed that several complaints were coming to the NHRC regarding natural death or suicide cases not being inquired by judicial or metropolitan magistrates. This required correction”.Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch (HRW) said “In most of the cases, to cover-up the store of abuse, the deaths are recorded as natural death or due to illness. It’s important that there is course correction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-all-custodial-deaths-rules-nhrc-101610567294556.html
14-01-2021||India||BSF finds tunnel used by Pulwama attackers||The Border Security Force (BSF) and Jammu Police on Wednesday detected a 150m long cross-border tunnel at the international border that intelligence agencies believe may have been used by Mohammad Umar Farooq, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Maulana Masood Azhar’s nephew, to enter India to execute the February 14, 2019, Pulwama terror attack in which 40 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed.The tunnel, approximately 100m long on the Indian side and believed to be 50-60m long on the Pakistani side, is suspected to have been used by JeM terrorists to infiltrate India at least four times since April 2018, intelligence officials added on condition of anonymity.It was the National Investigation Agency (NIA) that mapped Farooq’s route from Pakistan to India using GPS data recovered from his phone, satellite imagery and the interrogation of several suspects.NIA recovered a video from his phone in which Farooq and others were seen praying at the launchpad just before infiltrating into India in the Shakargarh area.A counterterrorism official, who did not want to be named, said the information about the tunnel was shared by NIA with central intelligence agencies, BSF, and the Jammu & Kashmir Police in March 2020, and since then, efforts were made to locate it. “However, the terrain and the tall elephant grass on the Pakistani side makes it difficult to detect tunnels at the border,” added this person.BSF inspector general NS Jamwal gave details of the tunnel to reporters in Jammu on Wednesday: “The tunnel detected along the International Border in Hiranagar sector of Kathua is approx 150m long, [and] proper engineering effort has gone into its construction. It was dug 25 to 30 feet beneath the ground. We have found 10-15 sand bags with Pakistani markings in the tunnel. It seems that it hasn’t been used recently.”The counterterrorism official said that its possible that JeM may have stopped using the tunnel after Indian investigators cracked the Pulwama case.Farooq, 24, a skilled bomb-maker trained in hybrid camps of al Qaeda, Taliban, JeM and the Haqqani network inside Afghanistan, is believed to have entered India in April 2018 using this particular tunnel in Hiranagar Sector of Kathua along with four others, including Mohammad Ismail alias Saifullah. He soon took over as the JeM commander of Pulwama, officials said. Farooq was killed in an encounter with the security forces on March 29, 2019, but not before bringing India and Pakistan on the brink of war by executing the deadliest terror attack in the Valley. Saifullah is believed to be the current chief of Jaish in the Valley.This is third such sophisticated tunnel detected by central agencies since August 29, 2020, in Jammu-Samba Sector. Counterterror and security officials believe these are used for infiltration, the smuggling of arms and ammunition, and also to ferry across money to fund terror strikes.An intelligence official, who asked not to be named, said Indian agencies have reason to believe that there may be two similar tunnels in the area which need to be detected.Former BSF director general DK Pathak said: “Ever since we got fencing on the border, Pakistani infiltrators try to dig tunnels that are not clearly visible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-finds-tunnel-used-by-pulwama-attackers-101610564042524.html

He has bought residences in Noida with disproportionate assets. He has used district budget plans to purchase fodder from Punjab at twice the cost without having any authority to do so and beyond the prescribed rates of the Government of Uttarakhand. He has taken a large number of officers on deputation in the Sheep Board without creating any posts thereby causing veterinary hospitals in districts to shut down. These officers have no work but get salaries. This has clearly been done after monetary gratification…”She urged that the programme be stopped immediately and the appropriate action is taken. “This is equivalent to the scandals of coal, Bofors etc.”Reacting to the allegations, Anand had said, “I am preparing a reply which will be submitted to the secretary of the department and other senior authorities of the state government. Whatever money has been spent has been done following all protocols.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-orders-probe-after-maneka-gandhi-alleges-scam-in-wool-board-101610561896708.html
14-01-2021||India||4-tier workforce to oversee vaccination drive||The authorities have put in place a four-tier supervisory and management system that stretches down to the district and block levels to ensure a smooth roll-out of the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination programme, which will begin on January 16.Assisted by committees, task forces and control room personnel, an army of government officials and representatives of foreign aid agencies will monitor the complex immunisation drive at every level and act quickly to keep the programme on track if anything goes amiss, people familiar with the matter said.This command structure will also include dedicated units to tackle any adverse events following immunization that include side-effects of the vaccines. At the state as well as district levels, special committees on adverse events have been formed, in line with the official guidelines.The National Expert Group on Covid Vaccine (NEGVAC), the nerve-centre of the Narendra Modi government for all vaccine-related issues, has played its role since August 202. Now, as the vials started reaching the hinterland of India and vaccination, it is the turn of the rest of the machinery to get into the act.Every state will have a steering committee as well as a task force and a control room to monitor the immunisation drive. The steering committee will be headed by the chief secretary and the health secretary will head the task force.The steering committee, comprising representatives of several departments, has been assigned tasks such as oversight on the creation of a database of health-care workers, review of the preparedness of the cold chain, operational planning and even to devise strategies to tackle “anticipated state-specific challenges,” the people cited above said.This panel will also be in charge of financial planning and explore the use of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to pay for activities related to the Covid-19 vaccination drive.The state task force, which meets at least once a fortnight, will oversee the roll-out of the vaccines, develop a media plan to address rumors and will be responsible for social mobilization of the vaccine recipients. It will resolve issues of micro-planning, logistics, human resource availability, training and waste management.The control rooms, with a clear chain of command, will be involved in day-to-day planning for mobilization of workforce as well as logistics. The guideline issued by the Centre said: “They need to oversee that while planning for the sessions and session site allocation” and “ensure that there is no delayed decision making.”The urban centres, which are expected to see a higher concentration of vaccine recipients and vaccination sites, will have their own separate task forces. Headed by the municipal commissioner, their work will be similar to that of their district counterpart.The block task force, headed by a sub-divisional magistrate or a block development officer, will meet every week and are entrusted with identifying vaccinators across government and private sectors, monitor the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines at the block level and ensure minimal disruption of other routine health services.The immunization will see a mega workforce—mostly comprising government officials—with specific duties.“For us, it is an extension of the ongoing universal immunization programme. But this is the first time, a vaccination of such a large scale is taking place in a time-bound manner. No wonder there will be several backroom boys and managers playing crucial roles behind each vaccination,” an official familiar with the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4tier-workforce-to-oversee-vaccination-drive-101610561483774.html
14-01-2021||India||Debate over vaccine approval intensifies, Paul says have faith in regulator||The controversy around the use of Bharat Biotech’s coronavirus vaccine candidate Covaxin continued on Wednesday as the inoculation began shipping for the first time, with leaders from the Congress questioning the government’s decision to roll it out even though it had not progressed far enough in its human trials – concerns that officials attempted to allay afresh later in the day.Covaxin is one of two manufactured-in-India coronavirus vaccines cleared by regulators for emergency use on January 3. Bharat Biotech, the Hyderabad-based manufacturer, began phase III clinical trials in mid-November and is expected to require several months more before it can determine how effective the vaccine is.The first vaccinations will be carried out on January 16.“Covaxin was licensed by government for emergency use. Now government is saying that the recipient won’t be able to pick and choose the vaccine which is administered to them. When phase 3 trial of Covaxin is not complete, it raises various concerns on its efficacy,” Tewari told news agency ANI on Wednesday.His reference was to comments by government representatives on Tuesday that recipients selected for vaccination in the first phase will not have a say in which shot they will get.“You can’t use rollout as phase 3 trial, Indians are not guinea pigs,” he added.“Deeply disturbing report. It is imperative that the Covaxin trials meet the highest standards and that no one is pressed into participation without their informed consent,” Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said in a tweet, while linking to a news report that said trial volunteers had been misled.The Union ministry of health and family welfare announced on Wednesday it had allocated all procured doses of Covaxin to States and Union Territories in proportion of health care workers database, and concerns regarding its safety were baseless.Officials in non-BJP ruled states too have expressed concerns over the vaccine. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee took up the matter in a meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday and Chattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo on Saturday said the shot should not be used until its complete results are out.“People should have faith in India’s drugs regulator; the product has been approved after due diligence. Having said that we are still in the process of learning; we are adapting based on the evidence before us and it is an accepted norm. The research is going on and we are keeping a close watch,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.“No government currently is offering a Covid vaccine choice to its people; not even US and UK. There simply aren’t enough supplies in market. It is a public health emergency and the government’s are regulating the vaccination drive so that all those who need the vaccine are not left out,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/debate-over-vaccine-approval-intensifies-paul-says-have-faith-in-regulator-101610561423296.html
14-01-2021||India||Decriminalising adultery could lead to ‘instability’ in armed forces: Govt to SC||The Centre has sought a clarification from the Supreme Court to the effect that the 2018 order decriminalising adultery would apply only to civilians and not defence personnel because not prosecuting soldiers for adultery could cause “instability” in the armed forces.Maintaining that “honour is the sine quo non of the services,” a plea by the ministry of defence (MoD) asserted that adultery must remain a valid ground to prosecute defence personnel under army laws.In September 2018, a five-judge constitution bench struck down Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, declaring it to be unconstitutional and violative of right to equality of women in treating them as “chattel” (an item of property) and inferior to their husbands. Section 497 made adultery an offence only with respect to a man, who has a relationship with wife of someone else.The wife was considered neither adulterous nor an abettor in law, while the man could be jailed for up to five years. In that case, the Centre defended the law, saying it protected sanctity of marriages.On Wednesday, MoD’s clarification plea was argued by Attorney General KK Venugopal before a bench, headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman, where the law officer submitted that the armed forces required a completely different standard of discipline and that, therefore, the army act and other pertinent laws must be treated as outside the scope of the 2018 judgment.“Adultery can be defined as an ‘unbecoming act’ or punishable under “good order and discipline” rule under the army act. Such officers can be court martialed and cashiered. We thus want a clarification that the constitution bench judgment is not applicable to personnel of the armed forces,” Venugopal told the bench, which also included justices Navin Sinha and KM Joseph.Venugopal added that this clarification was required to obviate any counter-argument by an officer sought to be prosecuted that the armed forces were acting contrary to the Supreme Court’s verdict.Agreeing with the AG, the bench responded that it was also of the prima facie view that the IPC and the army act or other laws governing navy and air force stood on different footings and therefore, even as adultery was no more an offence under the IPC, it could constitute an ‘unbecoming conduct’ under the army act.But the bench, at the same time, added that it was not competent to issue a clarification in this regard since the 2018 judgment was passed by a constitution bench of five judges. “This will have to be put up before the constitution bench,” the bench told the AG.The bench then referred the matter to the Chief Justice of India for constituting a five-judge bench to examine the MoD’s application. It, however, issued a notice to the PIL petitioner in the case, Kerala-resident Joseph Shine, who was represented in the court through advocate Kaleeswaram Raj.The plea by the MoD has stated: “The aforesaid judgment passed by this court may cause instability within the Services, as defence personnel are expected to function in peculiar conditions, during the course of which many a time they have to stay separated from their families for long durations, when they are posted on borders or other far-flung areas or in areas having inhospitable weather and terrain.”It sought to highlight that since the Supreme Court has decriminalised adultery, “there will always be a concern in the minds of the army personnel who are operating far away from their families under challenging conditions about the family indulging in untoward activity.”Drawing a distinction between Section 497 in the IPC and the relevant laws in the armed forces, the MoD stated that unlike Section 497, the army laws did not make a difference between a male or a female and that it was a gender-neutral provision prosecuting soldiers of both the sexes for such acts.“In other words, the army would equally proceed against a female subject to the act, if she enters into an adulterous/illicit relationship,” said the application, adding the laws governing the defence personnel were not discriminatory in nature.The Attorney General’s arguments in the top court are based on inputs obtained from the defence ministry and the armed forces, army officials familiar with the case said on the condition of anonymity. Adultery definitely amounts to conduct unbecoming of a soldier and those guilty have to be punished, the officials said.The armed forces see adultery -- “stealing the affections of a brother officer’s wife” -- as an offence that is just a notch below the worst offence an enlisted person can be accused of, cowardice. The provision to deal with this, drawn from Section 497, exists in all three services, and the punishment is usually dismissal.The MoD underlined the necessity of retention of adultery as an offence for the defence personnel: “That one has to remember that the Armed Forces exist in an environment wholly different and distinct from civilians. Honour is a sine qua non of the service. Courage, and devotion to duty, even at the risk of one’s lives, is part of the unwritten contract governing the members of the armed forces.”It also relied upon Article 33 of the Constitution to make a point that this provision allowed Parliament to restrict or modify operation of fundamental rights with regard to armed forces so as to ensure proper discharge of duties and maintenance of discipline.Looking from this prism too, the MoD said, its laws to govern defence personnel could not be held bad only because they abridged some of their fundamental rights.In 2018, months after the top court’s judgment, then finance minister Arun Jaitley had said that the Supreme Court had ventured into areas best left alone with its landmark verdicts against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and adultery.Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Jaitley wondered if sexual activity was treated as part of free speech, then if it could be restrained in any form in a school hostel, prison or army frontier.“While writing these historical judgments the judges get carried away and want to be part of history,” he had said. “You go a step further.”With the adultery judgment, Jaitley felt the court overstepped when it said adultery was like other matrimonial offences and were personal wrongs and not public wrongs, therefore outside the criminal law.“Now will it cover bigamy and polygamy also? Will it cover cruelty? Will it cover dowry offences – if this was the case, the judgment would be wholly anti women,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-adultery-a-crime-in-forces-says-centre-101610561363314.html
14-01-2021||India||Stage set for vaccine roll-out as Covaxin adds to supplies||As the first supplies of Bharat Biotech International’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, Covaxin, were dispatched from its Hyderabad base on Wednesday, the Centre intends to instruct state administrations on the number of sites where it should be deployed, a top government official said on condition of anonymity.It will be up to the governments to decide the locations of the sites where Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Covaxin, the indigenous vaccine Bharat Biotech has developed with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) , will be administered..“The Centre will communicate to the states the number of vaccination sites where Covishield and Covaxin will be deployed respectively. The states will decide the specific sites, that is site names, on their own where the vaccine supply is to be directed,” said the official, who is involved in the vaccine delivery process.Bharat Biotech announced in a statement on Wednesday that the company had shipped Covaxin to 11 cities: Ganavaram, Guwahati, Patna, Delhi, Kurukshetra, Bengaluru, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Chennai and Lucknow.Although 5.5 million doses of Covaxin have been procured by the government, the company did not disclose how many had been shipped on Wednesday.“After having received the government purchase order for 55 lakh doses, Bharat Biotech shipped the first batch of vaccines (each vial containing 20 doses)… While some shipments have arrived in the respective cities, others will be delivered later this evening. Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated 2 dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses,” the company said in a statement.Most of the states that have received Covaxin will be administering it in bigger health-care facilities such as medical colleges so that adverse reactions after immunisation, if any, are better tracked.Covaxin is still in Phase 3 trials, and is to be administered in a clinical trial mode, according to a condition in its regulatory approval.“As per the Centre’s guideline, Covaxin is to be sent to bigger facilities, which for us will mean medical colleges. I will discuss it with the principal secretary and firm up a vaccine distribution plan tomorrow,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, who is also the state nodal officer for the Covid-19 vaccination.Bihar has received 1,000 vials of Covaxin that is equal to 20,000 doses.Individual consent has to be taken before administering Covaxin to any heath-care workers who will be vaccinated in the first phase of immunisation from January 16, added Kumar.In Odisha, Covaxin will be administered to 9,000 health-care workers.“Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech will be administered to 9,000 front-line health-workers in Bhubaneswar while Covishield of Serum Institute of India will be given to shortlisted people in all other districts across the state,” said Dr Bijay Panigrahi, nodal officer for Covid vaccination in Odisha.Even though 1.65 million vaccine doses were given by Bharat Biotech to the government of India for free, the total number of doses that the government has purchased from the company is 5.5 million. The remaining doses will be sold at a price of ₹295 plus government taxes.“The evaluation of COVAXIN™ has resulted in several unique product characteristics including long term persistence of immune responses to multiple viral proteins, as opposed to only the spike protein, and has demonstrated broad spectrum neutralizing capability with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains, thus potentially reducing or eliminating escape mutants,” the company statement read.“This vaccine has also shown to generate memory T cell responses, for its multiple epitopes, indicating longevity and a rapid antibody response to future infections. Its most critical characteristic is the demonstrated safety profile, which is significantly lower than several other vaccines with published data…,” it added.With inputs from states||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stage-set-for-vaccine-roll-out-as-covaxin-adds-to-supplies-101610561243255.html

This was kind of Christmas and New Year gift for the entire Estonia nation. We are very happy about it because this is proof of our bilateral relations, trust and common interest to promote further bilateral relations," Kivi told ANI.The opening embassy in Estonia is not just an announcement, it also means the expansion of India's trade into the entire northern region and a kind of gateway to enter in European Union, said Kivi."The opening of a new embassy in Estonia has many benefits for both countries. One of the best benefits is to open an Indian mission in European soil or Estonian soil, through which Indian businesses will reach out not only in Estonia but to the entire European Union market, and this is a very dynamic and very comprehensive business reach out in northern Europe. I would say not only India could open up the resident mission in Estonia but it also concludes the free trade agreement with European Union that might be getting more beneficial for both the countries," the Estonian envoy told ANI.The Estonian envoy further said the way of aggressiveness shown by India against terrorism is welcome and it is known to all that India has always raised the concern of terrorism in all global fora."Estonia absolutely condemns terrorism in any form and all forms. Dr S Jaishankar and our defence minister had said yesterday in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) about terrorism in the Security Council and stressed the emerging threats of terrorism are also using open internet and high bits and they use their capabilities like drones," she added.The envoy added that it is very important to raise awareness about terrorism and the rise of cyber threats and cyber terrorism, a situation that no single country has able to tackle.She also said mutual cooperation and unison together against terrorism must be promoted.The relations between the two countries are getting stronger day by day, as Estonia and India are ready to celebrate their 30 years of diplomatic relations in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/envoy-calls-indian-embassy-in-estonia-new-year-gift-for-citizens-101610555233489.html
14-01-2021||India||Secret Indo-Pacific strategy: How the US sees China||The US sees China as a strategic competitor bent on circumventing international rules and norms and a key security concern across the Indo-Pacific region, where Beijing wants to establish “new, illiberal spheres of influence”, according to a newly declassified strategy document.The document framed in 2018 envisaged bolstering India’s capacities so that it could work with other like-minded countries to act as “a counterbalance to China” and maintain the capacity to counter challenges from Beijing such as “border provocations”.According to the US Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific, one of the main national security challenges for the US in the region is maintaining its primacy and promoting a “liberal economic order while preventing China from establishing new, illiberal spheres of influence”.Also read | Bolster India’s rise to counter China challenge: Secret US strategy for Indo-PacificThe 10-page document, declassified on January 5 by the outgoing Trump administration’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien, also states that China’s economic, diplomatic and military influence will “continue to increase in the near-term and challenge the US ability to achieve its national interests in the Indo-Pacific”.Under President Donald Trump, the US adopted a confrontational approach to China on both trade and security issues and called out Beijing for not doing enough to contain the initial spread of the Coronavirus in early 2020. The incoming Biden administration hasn’t fully spelled out its China policy though most experts believe president-elect Joe Biden will be less confrontational even as he counters challenges from Beijing.The strategy document states that China “seeks to dominate cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and bio-genetics”, and use them in the “service of authoritarianism”.China’s dominance in these technologies poses “profound challenges to free societies”, and China’s proliferation of “digital surveillance, information controls, and influence operations will damage US efforts to promote our values and national interests in the Indo-Pacific region” and even in the Western hemisphere, the document adds.The strategy also envisages China taking “increasingly assertive steps to compel unification with Taiwan”.One of the strategic goals of the US, according to the document released on Wednesday with slight redactions, is working with partners on every continent to resist “Chinese activities aimed at undermining their sovereignty, including through covert or coercive influence”.In a specific section on China, the document points to US efforts to counter China in the trade and military spheres, including Beijing’s industrial policies and “unfair trading practices” that distort global markets, and its use of military force against the Washington and its allies or partners.On the military front, the US’s objective is deterring China “from using military force against the United States and US allies or partners”, and developing capabilities and concepts to “defeat Chinese actions across the spectrum of conflict”.According to the document, the US will work to “enhance combat-credible US military presence and posture in the Indo-Pacific region, to uphold US interests and security commitments”, and help its allies and partners “improve their security posture, including military capabilities and interoperability, to ensure strategic independence and freedom from Chinese coercion”.The US will also expand “partnerships and capabilities that limit China’s ability to coerce allies and partners”, the document adds.In order to counter China’s intelligence activities, the US will equip its allies and partners to counter “China’s clandestine activities in their countries” and expand American intelligence and law enforcement activities that counter “Chinese influence operations”.The US will also help allies and partners develop high standards in counterintelligence, counter-proliferation, cyber-security and industrial security.China’s “predatory economic practices” freeze out foreign competition, undermine US economic competitiveness, and abet the “Chinese Communist Party’s aspiration to dominate the 21st century economy, and the US will build “international consensus that China’s industrial policies and unfair trading practices are damaging the global trading system”, according to the strategy document.While seeking to maintain American industry’s innovation edge vis-a-vis China, the US will work with allies and like-minded countries to “prevent Chinese acquisition of military and strategic capabilities; broaden the scope of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to cover venture capital and other forms of investment by China; and adopt domestic policies that promote growth in key technologies”.In order to promote US values across the Indo-Pacific to counterbalance Chinese models of government, the US will develop “public and private messaging and promote initiatives that show the benefits of democracy and liberty...including economic, technologic, and societal benefits”, and coordinate efforts to “protect and promote internationally recognized rights and freedoms”.The US will also enhance its engagement in the Indo-Pacific while “educating governments, businesses, universities, Chinese overseas students, news media, and general citizenries about China’s coercive behaviour and influence operations around the globe”, and invest in capabilities that “promote uncensored communication between Chinese people”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/secret-indo-pacific-strategy-how-the-us-sees-china-101610517981601.html
