30-01-2021||Delhi||Case against Rajdeep Sardesai, 7 others for trying to provoke a riot on R-Day||New Delhi Delhi Police on Thursday filed a case against journalist Rajdeep Sardesai and six others for allegedly trying to start a riot on Republic Day, among other sections. Others named in the FIR include Congress Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor,and journalists Mrinal Pande, Zafar Agha, Paresh Nath, Anant Nath, Vinod K Jose. The case filed at the IP Estate police station has been registered under Indian Penal Code sections of 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), and 505(1)(b) (intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). Police in Gurugram, Bhopal and Noida have also filed similar cases against the seven for allegedly misreporting and spreading disharmony during the violent clashes in Delhi on Republic Day. On Friday, the Editors Guild of India condemned the police action, saying it was an attempt to “browbeat” and “intimidate” the media.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh tweeted though his verified Twitter handle that due to false and misleading information that a farmer had died due to police firing on Republic Day, a case has been registered. Singh said that the post mortem report in the farmer’s case regarded the cause of death to be shock and haemorrhage due to a head injury received, after his tractor overturned. Also, on Saturday evening, Mandeep Punia, a freelance journalist who contributes to The Caravan magazine, was detained at Alipur police station while he was reporting the farmers sit-in protest. Though, no senior police officer wished to comment on journalist Punia’s detention, his friends alleged he had been arrested.A police officer, who did not wish to be named, said Punia was not carrying any identity card. “He was part of a group of protesters who were pulling down the police barricades. Mild use of force was done during which he was caught. A case under section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) has been registered against him at Alipur police station, He is likely to be arrested in the case. There was another journalist with him. He had an identity card. We are verifying his identity,” a police officer said on Saturday evening. A group of 200 persons, who claimed to be locals, had on Friday crossed barricades and gone near the main stage of protesting farmers, which resulted in a clash between the two groups. Police after that stopped entry of anyone beyond the barricades that have come up on the main road at Singhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/case-against-rajdeep-sardesai-7-others-for-trying-to-provoke-a-riot-on-rday-101612031301283.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||No more institutional quarantine for UK returnees to Delhi||Passengers flying in to Delhi from the United Kingdom (UK) will no longer have to complete a mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine if they test negative for Covid-19 on arrival, an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) – the nodal body that decides on implementation of Covid-19 guidelines in the Capital — said.The seven-day institutional quarantine rule for UK fliers, even if they tested negative for Covid-19 on arrival, was introduced on January 8, when the Central government resumed flight operations between India and the UK after a temporary suspension since December 22 in the light of a new strain of Covid-19 which had emerged there.The new DDMA order, which was issued on Friday, cites “low positivity rate” among UK returnees as the reason for the relaxation. Fliers, however, will have to continue adhering to a seven-day home quarantine rule, government officials said.“As a matter of abundant precaution in view of the increased transmissibility of the new variant, DDMA orders dated January 8 and (another on) January 12 mandated compulsory institutional quarantine for a period of seven days, followed by seven days of home quarantine for those travellers who are found negative in RT-PCR test at airport,” said the DDMA order, which HT has seen.The order was signed by Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev, who also heads the executive committee of the DDMA. The DDMA is chaired by Delhi’s lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal. Its vice-chairperson is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.The order further said, “The situation has now been reviewed and considering the low positivity rate of UK returnees it has been decided that the aforesaid additional measure of compulsory institutional quarantine of travellers tested negative may not be required furthermore… Strict surveillance (has) to be kept on persons who test negative in the airport and (are) kept in home quarantine.”Two senior DDMA officials, who did not wish to be identified, however, clarified that the seven-day home quarantine rule for those who tested negative on arrival would still continue and they will be monitored by district surveillance teams.Travellers who test Covid-19 positive on arriving from the UK are isolated in special wards set up at the government’s Lok Nayak hospital and four other private hospitals. Their contacts are further traced and isolated in similar wards on testing positive for Covid-19. Their swab samples (both UK returnees and their contacts who test positive) are sent for further examination to determine the strain of the virus with which they were infected.In Delhi, so far 13 Covid-19 patients were found infected with the UK strain. All of them had returned from the UK and none of them were cases of local transmission, said a senior official in the government’s health department.“Surveillance of people who have returned from the UK should be scaled up,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). He further said, “The UK variant is spreading fast across several countries. It is replacing the old variant. Initially, it was found to be more transmissible. Now, several research groups based in the UK have said that it is likely to cause more deaths too. Fortunately, vaccines have been found to be effective against it. But we cannot let our guards down.”(ends)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-more-institutional-quarantine-for-uk-returnees-to-delhi-101612031182500.html
30-01-2021||Chandigarh||Lockdown delayed admission time among head injury cases: PGI study||The restrictions imposed to curb the Covid-19 pandemic also led to amplification of the already-delayed admission process among head-injury patients at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, a study has found.The study called “Collateral fallout of Covid-19 lockdown on patients with a head injury from north-west India” has appeared in Acta Neurochirurgica, the European journal of neurosurgery, which states that out of a total 3,372 patients, there were 83 head-injury admissions per week before Covid-19 restrictions, which decreased to 33 every week (60% drop) during the lockdown and stabilised at 46 per week during the unlock phases.The researchers have noted that timely transportation to an appropriate trauma care facility is an essential component that affects the final outcomes in case of head injuries, and during Covid-19, the proportion of patients who reached PGIMER within optimal time decreased.“Covid-induced restrictions caused a significant increase in the proportion of patients arriving directly without resuscitation at peripheral centres and later than 6 hours of injury. Post Covid-19, the proportion of patients reaching later than 6 hours increased significantly from 66% to 74%,” the study states, adding that this may have led to a significant increase in severe head-injury mortality rate from 47% before pandemic to 59% during the lockdown.Need to improve inter-hospital transfer The researchers impute factors such as hindrance in arranging transport and disruption of routine transfer services to the increase in mortality rate. The findings also imply that inter-hospital transfer coordination was a domain that needed to be relooked at.On the other hand, some positive effects were noticed such as head-injury cases under the influence of alcohol saw a decrease.“Lockdown restrictions with restricted access to alcohol can explain this trend. A decline in head-injury patients with comorbidity was also seen after the pandemic. With increased awareness that comorbidities constitute a significant risk factor for Covid infection, persons with pre-existing illnesses were not venturing out of the home during the pandemic,” the researchers said.Researchers, however, have acknowledged that this was a single-centre study, and hence the observations may not be generalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lockdown-delayed-admission-time-among-head-injury-cases-pgi-study-101612031182069.html
30-01-2021||Chandigarh||After slow start, placements pick up pace at Chandigarh institutes||Due to the economic slowdown in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, the placement season at Panjab University and other institutions in Chandigarh did not kick off on a high note this academic year, but has finally started to pick up the pace.After the outbreak last year, there were apprehensions that placements will be majorly affected this year. However, experts say the impact is not that big. In fact, online placements are going on at several PU departments, including University Business School (UBS) and University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET). Interviews are being conducted through videoconferencing.Placements are also going on at Punjab Engineering College (PEC), Chandigarh College of Engineering and Technology (CCET) and other institutes. Due to a late start, the process is expected to stretch over the coming months.Meena Sharma, head of PU’s central placement cell, said: “We had apprehensions in the beginning, but now placements have picked up the pace. There is also an increasing demand from the market, and we are getting a good response now.”Unlike previous years, the special placement week was not held at UBS this year and the placements are being conducted online. Placement coordinator Tejinder Pal Singh said: “We are expecting to reach close to previous years’ numbers in the coming months. We are also trying to bring more companies for placements.” Last year, a UBS student had received the highest package of ₹55 lakh, while the average package was ₹9.5 lakh.Slowdown in some sectorsHowever, a slowdown has been witnessed in some sectors. JD Sharma, head of career development and guidance centre at PEC, said: “Presently there is a slowdown for recruitment in some specific sectors, such as capital goods, automotive and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). It may or may not affect the total placements of the institution. It will take time to assess the situation.”However, sectors such as coding, software, consulting, sales and e-marketing are recruiting a good number of students, he said. KG Sharma, head of training and placement at CCET, said: “There is a slight impact on the placements, especially in mechanical and civil engineering branches, because these companies are in a ‘wait-and-watch’ mode. For electronics and computer science engineering, placements are almost similar to previous years.”At UIET, there has not been much of an impact on the placements in computer science and IT branches, and none of the usual recruiters has backed, said a placement coordinator, who did not wish to be named. Professor Kapil Dev, training and placement officer at GGDSD College, said: “Our regular recruiters are already carrying out placement drives. Even packages being offered to students have increased compared to the last year. We have not seen any major impact on the process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-slow-start-placements-pick-up-pace-at-chandigarh-institutes-101612031002037.html

According to the divisional forest department, several birders have been invited for a quick assessment of the species density in the sanctuary, which also happens to be Gutam Budh Nagar’s only eco-sensitive zone. “We have planned the event to spread awareness about wetlands and also assess the species density in the sanctuary. For this, invitations are being sent to different birders of the city, as Gautam Budh Nagar happens to have a good birding community. We have also sent an invitation to the minister of state for forest, environment and zoological garden, Anil Sharma,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. He added that the birding would help the department with constructive analysis, which may help it to take measures to improve the habitat of the sanctuary. Earlier in January, the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC)-2021, which was conducted by Wetlands International South Asia and the divisional forest department fund, showed that while the number of species in the sanctuary has increased since last year, their population has decreased. The census returned a total 8,068 birds across 73 species, of which 27 were residential and 46 were migratory species. The AWC-2020 in comparison recorded only 62 species – 28 of which were resident species and 34 were migratory. However, their population stood at 8,776.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/okhla-sanctuary-to-see-bird-festival-on-feb-2-101612030941197.html
30-01-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly unseats Kalka MLA Pradeep Chaudhary||The Haryana Vidhan Sabha on Saturday issued a notification to unseat Congress MLA from Kalka, Pradeep Chaudhary, 58, who was convicted and sentenced to three-year imprisonment in a case of rioting by a Himachal Pradesh court on Thursday. With his disqualification, bypolls have been necessitated from Kalka assembly seat, along with Ellenabad seat in Sirsa from where INLD MLA Abhay Chautala had resigned last week. Chaudhary stood disqualified with effect from January 14, the day he was convicted along with 14 others by the court of judicial magistrate, first class, Nalagarh. The court also imposed ₹85,000 fine on each of them. The case dates back to May 31, 2011, when one Suchha Singh, a resident of Paploha village near Kalka, climbed up an electricity pole at Barotiwala village in Nalagarh to evade checking by traffic police. Singh came into contact with a live wire and was grievously injured. He succumbed at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh.After Singh’s deaths, a mob from nearby Haryana villages placed his body at the Red Light Chowk and staged a protest. The protest turned violent and protestors attacked the police personnel present on site. They had also blocked traffic on the highway and set two government vehicles, including a bus and a pick-up vehicle, ablaze. Chaudhary was part of the unruly mob led by one Mahesh Kumar .Having a house in Sector 2, Panchkula, Chaudhary in October 2019 had wrested the Kalka Assembly seat by defeating sitting BJP MLA Latika Sharma by 5,931 votes.He has been disqualified as per Section 8 (3) of the Representation of the People Act. The disqualification provision says that a person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years after release. Additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain said the MLA will also continue to be disqualified and barred from contesting elections for a further period of six years after his release. “However, if the high court stays the conviction of the MLA, then his membership of the assembly will get restored from that day. But the restoration of membership will not be applicable if the high court only grants him bail,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-assembly-unseats-kalka-mla-pradeep-chaudhary-101612030881768.html

30-01-2021||Noida||Work on Noida e-surveillance project to start soon||NOIDA: Work on the ₹83 crore e-surveillance project for Noida, which will put at least 60 traffic intersections and large part of the city under electronic monitoring, is likely to start soon as the authority is going to select an agency for the same, said officials.“We are about to open the price bid submitted by the three agencies. As all the laid down procedures are finished, we now need to select one successful bidder. We have a target to start work at the site in the next 15 days, as per rules,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer of the Noida authority.To begin with, 60 busy traffic intersections will be put under surveillance to intensify enforcement and ensure discipline on roads, so that the thousands of motorists plying on city roads do not face traffic congestion or safety hazards. Later, the authority will install cameras at all intersections and cover the entire city if all goes well, said officials.The authority had started the process of hiring the agency in September 2019.“As per the terms and conditions, the agency will be given six months’ time to install high definition CCTV cameras at 60 intersections and other areas, and connect the same with a control room to be set up at the Sector 94 building. The agency will have the onus of looking after the operations from the control room. It will speed up the process of issuance of e-penalties for violation and bring order on city roads,” said Mishra.The project had been conceived in 2012 with an aim to address deteriorating law and order of the city. It had planned to put 203 square kilometres areas under real-time surveillance. In 2016, officials prepared detailed project reports for this project. The Indian institute of technology (IIT) Delhi, a consultant for Noida, had given its green signal for the project in 2016 and also approved a budget of ₹114 crore which was later scaled down, said officials.On May 3, 2016 the then Uttar Pradesh chief secretary had asked administration in 12 cities including Noida to improve traffic to reduce pollution. But this project could not be implemented on the ground. The project was revived in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/work-on-noida-e-surveillance-project-to-start-soon-101612030761750.html

30-01-2021||Noida||Rakesh Tikait emerges as face of UP Gate protests||Ghaziabad: Buoyed by the support of the people, Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU’s) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait has become a popular face at the UP Gate protest site, where farmers have been camping since November 28, 2020 demanding repeal of the three new farm laws. Many in the ranks at UP Gate feel that Tikait’s stature has grown considerably during the past two days and more so after his emotional appeal in which he also broke down in tears in front of supporters and media persons late on January 28. Many youngsters who flocked to the UP Gate site after his appeal have termed him “Baba Tikait”, which otherwise is referred to Rakesh Tikait’s father late Mahendra Singh Tikait, who led various farmers’ movements for about 25 years and is a founder of the BKU, with one of the most famous ones being a seven-day massive dharna at the Boat Club in Delhi in 1988, besides cordoning the office of the divisional commissioner (Meerut) for about 25 days in January 1988.Rakesh, however, said that “it was absolutely wrong” to term him so.“His (Rakesh) image has seen a sharp rise during the past couple of days and it will skyrocket if the government repeals the three farm laws. The face of the agitation has changed a lot in the past couple of days. For us farmers the country comes first, then the farmer himself and thereafter the caste system. When people saw him crying on television, they were touched and many of the Jaats also arrived here to stand by his side,” said Harendra Tomar, a farmer from Kishanpur Baral in western UP’s Baghpat district. Rakesh had also led a major farmers’ rally through western Uttar Pradesh in October 2018 and arrived at UP Gate in Ghaziabad where farmers had then clashed with the Delhi police. But, as things unfolded, the farmers retreated on the night of October 2, 2018. Some of the BKU leaders at the site said that many farmers who were part of the October 2018 agitation were not ready to come out again to participate in the ongoing protest against the three new farm laws. “Now the situation has changed and for the past two months, Rakesh Tikait has emerged as a leader of farmers and even more so after January 28, when he broke down. After that day, the people seem to have connected with him emotionally and it is for the first time that panchayats are being held in areas of Baraut, Shamli, Bulandshahr, Muzaffarnagar and Mathura, among others,” said Arun Panwar, another farmer who is from Bulandshahr city. The farmers, during the ongoing protests, have scribbled phrases such as “Kisan Kranti Gate” at the UP Gate flyover, and also put up a picture of Mahendra Singh Tikait. Panwar said that the current support enjoyed by Rakesh Tikait will also help him in the future, in case he has any political ambitions. “He will have a majority of people standing by his side and will give leverage to any party whom he wishes to support, in case he wants. The current situation in western UP is also likely to have an impact for the ruling party as the state will go to polls in the upcoming assembly elections,” he added.Rakesh had also contested the 2007 UP assembly elections from the Khatauli seat, and the the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Amroha on a ticket given by the Rashtriya Lok Dal.However, he lost both elections. From the dais of the UP Gate protest site on Friday, Rakesh told people that he “voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party while his wife voted for another party.”His elder brother Naresh Tikait, who heads the “non political” BKU, is the head of the Balyan Khap. During the ongoing protest against the three new farm laws, many of the Khap leaders from western UP lent their support to Rakesh. Gaurav Tikait, the youth wing president of the BKU, said that “personality” and “people” cannot be compared. He said his grandfather, Mahendra Singh Tikait, was a force to reckon with as thousands of farmers rallied behind him in times when there were no means of communication to spread messages. “Present times are different. He (Rakesh) is leading the protests well and has become a prominent face in the farmers’ protest against the three laws. The agitation is continuing, and the outcome will provide the answers. Since the agitation is our priority, it will not be right to comment on western UP politics scenario,” he added. Ever since January 28, Rakesh has been at the dais of the UP Gate site for most of the time, delivering speeches for the large gathering that is swelling up every day.“Everyone who comes here tries to meet him and even take pictures with him, and he is not in a habit of denying. This is why he tries to stay here, even giving necessary directions from time to time. His popularity has increased so much that people have created several social accounts in his name and are posting messages,” said Digambar Singh, state president of the BKU’s youth wing.Dharmendra Malik, the media in-charge of the BKU, said that they have come across eight such social media profiles and are now trying to approach the social media companies to get a “verified” badge for Rakesh’s social media account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rakesh-tikait-emerges-as-face-of-up-gate-protests-101612030703485.html
30-01-2021||Gurugram||New GMDA roads to have cycle tracks||New roads constructed by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will have a cycle track, the authority’s chief executive officer, VS Kundu, said on Saturday, while discussing plans for the same on Anaath Road, near Shankar Chowk, and the new sector road from Rampura Chowk, on National Highway-48, to Pataudi Road. Besides these, a survey is also underway at Genpact Chowk on Golf Course Road to assess the feasibility of a cycle track.“Under the city’s comprehensive mobility plan, we realised that the right of way on Gurugram roads is heavily lopsided towards motorists. We want to change this pattern, prioritising pedestrians first, followed by cyclists, public transport and motorists. Hence, barring some areas in Old Gurugram where the road width is narrow, we have decided to construct cycle tracks and footpaths on all new roads falling within GMDA’s jurisdiction,” said Kundu, adding that the GMDA is aiming to construct at least 60 kilometres of cycle tracks and footpaths across Gurugram this year. GMDA has a total road network of roughly 270 kilometres, of a total 1,267 kilometres in the district, as per a Haryana Vision Zero report. For all cycle tracks and footpath projects, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and GMDA work together. Prior to the commencement of on-ground constructions, MCG clears all encroachments.Anaath Road runs parallel to Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and houses the passport office, besides many multinational corporations. The 2.5-kilometre stretch also leads to several factories in Udyog Vihar area and is used by more than 6,000 pedestrians and cyclists every day.“The building of cycle tracks is part of the bigger objective of redesigning Anaath Road entirely for the benefit of pedestrians and cyclists as a model street. The redesigning is being carried out in two parts — in one part, a cycle track, footpath and green belts are being set up, while in the other, the existing carriageway is being relaid,” said Kundu.Kundu said that work on redesigning Anaath Road will commence in March-end and the authority is aiming to complete the work by September. A Raahgiri event was also held on the Anaath Road on Saturday, wherein Kundu stressed on the importance of addressing the needs of pedestrians and cyclists.The new sector road in Manesar links two major road networks, the NH-48 and Pataudi Road, and it provides access to residential areas in sectors 81, 82, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93 and 94.GMDA officials said that the base of the six-kilometre pothole-ridden stretch is being strengthened to sustain the weight of high traffic volume and also provide Manesar residents with an alternative route to Pataudi and Dwarka Expressway.Kundu said that the GMDA is also considering building a cycle track from the GMDA office, near Huda City Centre till the Genpact Chowk on Golf Course Road. “A topography survey for this stretch is underway. The GMDA had done a survey of this route in the past as well. However, some aspects were not fully covered. Hence, it is being redone. Depending on the outcome of the survey, we will take a call on constructing a cycle track on this stretch right away,” said Kundu.Over the past six months, the infrastructure for cyclists has witnessed a growth in the city. The city’s first cycle track along the Netaji Subhash Marg, between Subhash Chowk and Huda City Centre, opened last October, and a month later, another track, between Gold Souk Mall and Hamilton Court on Vyapar Kendra Road, was also opened.To ensure all cycle tracks are safeguarded, the GMDA has placed bollards at all entry and exit points to prevent vehicles from entering the main tracks. At a few points, the GMDA is also planning on deploying security guards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/new-gmda-roads-to-have-cycle-tracks-101612030701709.html

The authority on Friday issued a notice to the developer of Adani M2K project in Sector 102A for neither seeking permission from H-Rera nor registering the project before launching it in the market and opening units for booking — both of which are against the rules. The action was taken after a decoy customer was sent to a property dealer, who helped him to book a project in the unregistered project.  “A decoy customer was sent to the property dealer. The customer paid the booking money in both cash and cheque, and he was allotted booking. This is illegal as the project has no registration, no permission and is only on papers of the developer. Such practices would not be tolerated and a heavy penalty will be imposed on the violators,” said Dr KK Khandelwal, chairman, H-Rera, Gurugram.The authority has also directed penal proceedings to be initiated against the developer. The penalty of violations may go up to ₹12 crore against the promoter and ₹2.7 crore against the real estate agent. The authority said that a show-cause notice has been issued to promoter and they have been directed to produce records pertaining to the properties they have sold.Khandelwal said that it is mandatory under the H-Rera Act for all commercial and residential real estate projects, where the land is over 500 square metres, or eight apartments, to register with the authority for launching a project, in order to ensure a greater transparency in marketing and execution of the project. “It has been observed that not only the promoters but also property dealers are involved in such unscrupulous activities. They not only try to sell unregistered projects but also do not care to get themselves registered with the authority. The act itself mandates that no real estate agent can participate in the advertisement, marketing, or sale of any project without getting himself or his association registered with H-Rera,” said Khandelwal. Despite repeated phone calls and messages, a representative of the developer did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hrera-sends-notice-to-developer-for-selling-units-in-unregistered-real-estate-project-101612030702202.html
30-01-2021||Noida||As gathering swells at UP Gate, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait appeals to govt to hold talks||Ghaziabad: Rakesh Tikait, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader who is spearheading the farmers’ protest at the UP Gate site, on Saturday appealed to the government to hold talks over the farmers’ issues, saying that a solution to the ongoing crisis can be reached only through discussions.His statement comes two days after he broke down before supporters and media persons late Thursday, when the gathering at the protest site had considerably reduced and the Ghaziabad administration had served him a notice under section 133 of the CrPC for vacating the site. Back then, Tikait had alleged that some ruling party MLAs had allegedly come close to the protest site and had allegedly wanted to attack the farmers after his arrest. Later, his tearful appeal had drawn thousands again to UP Gate.“We want the government to talk to us and if they have reservations, they must share them with us. We will uphold the honour of the government and will not allow the name of our country, government or farmers to sully. If they have any issues or reservations, they must tell us and we will help them resolve issues with the farmers,” Tikait said to a large gathering at UP Gate in the afternoon, adding that the day will come when the government will say “jai kisan” (hail the farmer).He said he doesn’t mind the police using lathicharge against him but said that the police personnel at the site should ensure the safety of people there. With reference to the past two days, he said the storm has passed and that the “bigger trees” have fallen.“Now, those left are standing strong here; they will not break and will continue with the protest. We are people who obey panchayats and want peaceful resolution of issues. We appeal to the government to hold talks. We will also welcome opposition leaders if they come here but they will not be allowed to share the dais. We thank them if they stand with the farmers,” he added. Tikait, along with other farmers’ leaders, also face FIRs after the violent incidents in Delhi, including at the Red Fort on Republic Day, after a major tractor rally by the farmers entered the national Capital. Since Tikait’s emotional appeal on Thursday, a number of leaders and politicians of various parties have flocked to the UP Gate site to meet Tikait and to offer their support.Prominent among those were Delhi’s deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, UP Congress committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda, while many others have already spoken to him over the phone and extended help and support. On Saturday, Tikait was joined by Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Singh Chautala, who backed the farmers in their protest and had also carried out a tractor rally from Punjab’s Ambala earlier this month. “When Mahendra Singh Tikait carried out protests to support UP farmers, Chaudhary Devi Lal used to support him. Their friendship and their struggle are well known, and I have come here to put a stamp on the same friendship,” Chautala, who is the grandson of former deputy prime minister Chaudhary Devi Lal and the son of Haryana’s former chief minister, Om Prakash Chautala. Mahendra Singh Tikait is the founder leader of the BKU and Rakesh’s Tikait’s father.“The Prime Minister had told us that he will increase the income of farmers and waive their loans, and will also implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee report. When the country was facing tough times during the pandemic, farmers worked in fields and provided food to people. During these testing times, the three farm laws were brought in. Farmers’ leaders also held discussions several times and the government let the agitation to linger on, but the farmers were not deterred,” Chautala said, recalling incidents in Delhi on Republic Day, blaming the government for lodging cases against farmers’ leaders. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday chaired an all party meeting ahead of Monday’s budget session where he said the government stands by the offer made to the farmers by agriculture minister Naresh Tomar at the last meeting between the government and farmer representatives.Parliamentary affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi told media persons that the Prime Minister, at the meeting, said that whatever was discussed between the Agriculture minister and the farm leaders at the 11th meeting still stands good. “Agriculture minister Tomar had said that the government is open for discussions; he also said that I (Tomar) am a phone call away and I am ready for discussions and this still stands good,”Joshi said.The farmers at UP Gate have been on protest there since November 28, 2020, demanding repeal of three new farm laws, besides a new law on minimum support price. The government and farmer union leaders have held several rounds of talks but the deadlock continues. During the last round of talks, the government had proposed staying the implementation of the farm laws for a period of one-and-a-half to two years but the union leaders insisted on a complete rollback.(With HTC inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/as-gathering-swells-at-up-gate-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-appeals-to-govt-to-hold-talks-101612030701190.html
30-01-2021||Noida||Noida: Domestic help, four others held for demanding ₹60 lakh extortion||Noida: Police on Saturday evening arrested five suspects of a gang, including a domestic help, in connection with an extortion racket. The suspects had demanded ₹60 lakh from the president of Bulandshahr Zila Panchayat who presently lives in Noida Sector 50, the police said. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, in a press conference, said that on January 20, the gang members had dropped an extortion letter to Chaudhury Omveer Singh’s house seeking the extortion money. The suspects had identified themselves as members of the Bawana gang and threatened the victim for consequences if the demands were not met, the police said. Soon, the suspects started making internet calls, to escape surveillance, to the victim. The suspects had also opened one round fire outside the victim’s house to threaten him, the police said. The victim then filed a complaint at Sector 49 police station on Friday, and a case was registered under IPC sections 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation), said the addl DCP.The police arrested the suspects from a rented accommodation in Barola village. The suspects were identified as complainant’s former domestic help Kuldeep Yadav, current domestic help Suresh Sahu, both from Darbhanga in Bihar, and three accomplices Aman Nautiyal from Uttarakhand; Omu Bhadauria from Agra and Vansh Dagar from RK Puram in Delhi. The addl DCP said that Yadav had left the job in December last year and went to Delhi to run a tiffin service. “In Delhi, he found a Facebook group named Neeraj Bawana gangster fans. In the group, he met three other suspects and planned to extort money from his former employer,” he said. Yadav told the police that he needed money and hence he hatched a plan for extortion. Police said that Yadav had also roped in the complainant’s present domestic help Sahu in the plot. “Sahu used to leak the movement of his employer to the gang,” the police said. The police arrested the five persons from Yadav’s rented accommodation in Noida. Police also recovered four mobile phones used in making calls, one countrymade gun and one live cartridge from their possession. The suspects will be produced in court on Sunday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-domestic-help-four-others-held-for-demanding-60-lakh-extortion-101612030521206.html

30-01-2021||Noida||Noida: Arun Vihar Institute club gets new management team||NOIDA: Established in the memory of the youngest Param Vir Chakra awardee Arun Khetrapal who had lost his life during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, the Arun Vihar Institute (AVI) club at Sector 29 in the city elected its 23rd management committee recently. During the annual election held on January 10 this year for the new committee, Lt Col (retd) Mahendra Kumar was elected as the new president, while Col (retd) Subhash Sharma won the post of vice-president with a thumping majority. For the first time, the eight-member management committee included three female members, including Anuradha Singh, Kavita Malhotra and Sushma Malhotra. The other elected members are Col (retd) Rai Singh Deopa (VSM), Col (retd) AK Upreti and Lt Col (retd) SK Sharma. Formed to provide sports, catering and entertainment facilities to ex-servicemen living in sectors 28, 29 and 37, the club is believed to be one of the best clubs for ex-servicemen in the national capital region (NCR). The club, which was started in 1991 by army veterans, has presently 3,900 members.The new chief of the club, who is also the director of Shaheed Smarak in Noida, said that the new team is already on its job to make the club the best in Delhi-NCR. “The club activities were suspended for three months due to the Covid-induced lockdown last year. But after getting permission from the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration, on June 14 last year we started take-home facilities of food for the senior citizens living in all three societies associated to it. From September 21 last year, we opened our library following all essential safety protocols. Since we have a very dedicated team of veterans in this committee, we will leave no stone unturned to develop the infrastructure of the club, which will provide the best sports, catering and entertainment facilities to our members,” he said. Echoing similar views, new vice-president Sharma said that at present the club has a wide range of outdoor and indoor sports facilities, including badminton, tennis, table tennis, billiards and bridge. We regularly organise cultural shows for our members. Very soon, we’ll organise a cultural show on the eve of Saraswati Puja and Valentine’s Day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-arun-vihar-institute-club-gets-new-management-team-101612030461130.html
30-01-2021||Noida||Noida transport dept makes high security registration plates mandatory by April 15||Noida transport department has asked vehicle owners to get High Security Registration Plates (HSRPs) by April 15, after receiving directions for the same from Lucknow for its enforcement. Vehicles not having HSRPs may be fined after April 15. The UP government on Thursday issued a staggered time slot for installation of HSRPs. All vehicles in NCR will need HSRPs by April 15. For other districts, the vehicle owners have been given different time slots based on their vehicles’ last digit. Uttar Pradesh has about 3.28 crore vehicles and the government aims to equip them all with HSRPs by July 2022. AK Pandey, ARTO (administration) said that the government has already made HSRPs mandatory for all the vehicles. “Recently the Association of Registration Plate Manufacturers of India wrote to the state government which has issued a direction for all vehicles to be fitted by HSRPs by April 15 this year in the NCR,” he said. Gautam Budh Nagar has around 7.34 lakh vehicles registered, of which 1.5 lakh vehicles have so far been fitted with the HSRPs. On Thursday, special transport secretary Akhilesh Kumar Mishra wrote a letter to the transport department about the staggered time slot for systematic installation of HSRPs on vehicles. As per directions, districts in NCR — like GB Nagar, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Hapur — will need to ensure HSRPs by April 15. For other districts, vehicles having 0 and 1 as last digit registration number will need HSRP by 15 July 2021; 2 and 3 as last digit by October 15, 2021; 4 and 5 last digit by January 15, 2022; 6 and 7 last digit by April 15, 2022; and 8 and 9 last digit by July 15, 2022.People can book their HSRP slots on www.bookmyhsrp.com and https://www.makemyhsrp.com. They need to fill the vehicles’ details and make the payment in advance to get time slots to visit their dealers’ office to get HSRP. They can also request for home delivery of the number plates. Radha Krishna Shrivastava, assistant general manager Rosmerta, the firm which runs bookmyhsrp.com, said that the company has production units in Noida and Greater Noida. “We have been efficiently delivering these HSRPs at the dealers’ office and also at customers’ residence. The staggered time slot will ensure smooth installation of HSRPs on vehicles,” he said.The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has mandated that all vehicles sold in India before April 2019 need to have an HSRP. HSRPs are tamper-proof, as compared to the conventional number plates. These plates are issued only after the vehicle owner provides information such as engine number, chassis number, etc. This is a crucial step in preventing counterfeiting of high security registration plates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-transport-dept-makes-high-security-registration-plates-mandatory-by-april-15-101612030341612.html
30-01-2021||Noida||Noida gets respite from cold wave; air quality improves||Noida: Facing cold wave and extreme winter conditions for the past three days, Noida saw a slight respite on Saturday as the minimum temperature went up by over a degree. Also, the air quality of the city on Saturday improved to ‘very poor’ again. The air quality of Noida and its neighbouring cities had turned ‘severe’ on Friday after having remained within the ‘very poor’ category for the past two weeks.However, the cold wave-like conditions in the region will prevail till February 2 with foggy morning. According to weather analysts, cold wave-like conditions will return on January 31, along with dense fog, in the western Uttar Pradesh that includes Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida. However, due to another western disturbance, the wind directions are set to change from February 3 onwards, leading to possibilities of thunderstorm, light rains and rise in mercury, they said. “Friday was comparatively warmer due to better sunshine. However, the mercury may fall by a degree on Sunday and Monday, leading to cold wave-like conditions again. The mercury will significantly rise around February 3 and 4 due to change in the wind directions from icy cold north-westerly to warmer south-westerly,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet, a private weather forecaster. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperature for Noida on Saturday was recorded at 7.6 degrees Celsius against 6.3 degrees a day earlier. The maximum temperature for the city was recorded at 20.9 degrees Celsius against 20.1 degrees a day earlier. The average minimum and maximum for NCR, based on Safdarjung observatory, was 5.4 degrees Celsius and 21.5 degrees Celsius, respectively. “The minimum may hover around 4 to 5 degrees Celsius on Sunday, along with moderate to dense fog in the morning hours,” said an IMD official. For a cold day, the maximum temperature should be either below 15 degrees Celsius or it should be 4.5 degrees Celsius below the season’ average. For cold wave, either the minimum temperature should be below 4 degrees Celsius, or it should be below 4.5 degrees of the season’s average.Meanwhile, the air quality of Noida and adjoining areas saw a remarkable improvement as the ventilation improved. However, the air quality index (AQI) of the three cities -- Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad -- are still under ‘very poor’ category. The three cities have been suffering ‘very poor’ or ‘severe’ levels of AQI since January 13, while the best air quality last realised was under ‘moderate’ category on January 4 this year. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), AQI of Noida on Satuday was 302 against Friday’s 423. Greater Noida’s AQI was 308 against 420 a day earlier, while Ghaziabad witnessed an AQI of 338 against 415 on Friday. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. “The wind speed was better on Saturday reaching up to 20 kmph in certain areas, which helped with dispersion of the particle pollutants. The wind speed will be good for the next few days until February 2 when the wind directions change,” said Palawat of Skymet. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality may improve due to winds. “High winds are forecasted to continue for the next 24 hours. Due to the better ventilation index, AQI is likely to improve further to the lower end of very poor to poor. AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate on 1st and 2nd February but within the very poor category,” said a SAFAR statement on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-gets-respite-from-cold-wave-air-quality-improves-101612030341089.html
30-01-2021||Mumbai||Indian researchers discover new gecko species in Arunachal Pradesh||A team of researchers from five institutes across India have discovered a new gecko species in Arunachal Pradesh. Their discovery was published in the international peer-reviewed journal Evolutionary Systematics on Thursday.The new species, which belongs to the genus Cyrtodactylus commonly known as bent-toed geckos, was discovered by Zeeshan Mirza of the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bengaluru, Harshal Bhosale and Mandar Sawant of the Bombay Natural History Society in Mumbai, Faizan Ansari of the Madras Crocodile Bank in Chennai, Gaurang Gowande of Ferguson College in Pune, Pushkar Phansalkar from Pune, and Harshil Patel of the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University in Surat.The researchers have named the species Cyrtodactylus arunachalensis after the state in which it was discovered.“The finding of this lizard species is important because it proves that the state of Arunachal Pradesh is rich in biodiversity which is yet to be documented. With many development projects lined up in the state, some of these species may be wiped out even before they are discovered,” said Mirza.The team found the gecko on a month-and-a-half-long expedition across Arunachal Pradesh during late June to early August 2019 in an attempt to study undocumented biodiversity in the state with the help of DNA data. The gecko is the fourth new reptile species to be discovered by the team during the trip. The other three species that have been discovered were snakes, one of which was a pit viper species — Trimeresurus Salazar which was named after the character Salazar Slytherin from the Harry Potter series.“These geckos are strictly nocturnal and are found usually around rocky areas or under culverts. Most members of this group look quite similar and hence a close look is necessary to separate the species. In many cases, comparison of DNA sequences is necessary to confirm identification,” said the researchers in a statement.“When it comes to lesser invertebrates and insects, only about 50% species have been documented. However, with newer techniques and concerted efforts by more people, these species that have existed for long are coming to be known to science,” said Varad Giri, veteran herpetologist, who was not a part of the research team.The research team has, since then, been working on comparing the morphology and DNA of the gecko species with related species.“We are currently working on the other specimens collected during our trip. We are sure that there are many more species to be discovered,” Mirza added.Since the team had visited Arunachal during the monsoons the last time, members plan to visit again during a different season for a fresh survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indian-researchers-discover-new-gecko-species-in-arunachal-pradesh-101612030282041.html

The municipal corporations in MMR will continue with their tracking and testing drive, to keep the spread under control, besides keeping the Covid Care Centers (CCCs) intact for the next few months.After vaccinating 261,319 healthcare workers till Friday evening, the state machinery has announced to begin inoculation of frontline workers simultaneously from Monday. The district administrations have been directed to increase or shift the number of the vaccination centres, from 239 on Friday, as per the requirement. The state government has been assured by the Centre of an adequate supply of the vaccine doses.“Healthcare workers and frontline workers will be simultaneously inoculated across the state from Monday. We have asked the district administrations to increase or shift the centres as per the requirements. Large scale medical institutions with the Centres will have a greater number of booths. We have already started sending out the messages to the frontline workers. We have been communicated by the Center that the vaccine will be supplied as per the requirement,” said Dr Archana Patil, director, state health services.The enrolment of the frontline workers is incomplete and is expected to add up to 200,000 more in the coming days. “Police personnel, armed forces personnel, sanitation workers, employees of municipal corporations and councils, revenue who are directly involved in Covid-19 related activities are covered as frontline workers. Around 200,000 of them enrolled so far are from Mumbai. The simultaneous vaccination of both the priority groups will help us in increasing the percentage of the vaccination too,” said another health department official.The state government expects spurt in cases in MMR after opening up of the train services from Monday. “There could be a slight spurt in cases in Mumbai and surrounding areas, but it will be manageable as the timings have been staggered. If the government kept opening up activities slowly over the next 3-4 months, the surge could be minimal and controllable,” said Dr Avinath Supe who heads the state-appointed deaths audit committee. Before the lockdown was imposed in March 2020, over 7 million people used to travel by Mumbai suburban trains every day. Though the timings are restricted for the general public, the administration is expecting overcrowding in trains, which could lead to a surge in cases. Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said, “We do not expect much of the surge if the people adopt Covid appropriate behaviour by wearing masks and keep sanitizing hands. Our Covid centres will be functional till March 31 and the current number of tests will continue. We have continued strict surveillance of the passengers coming from countries like the UK and from other states too. All precautions are being taken.”Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said that crowding due to trains may lead to the surge if people let their guard down. “Municipal corporations in the MMR all prepared it there is any surge,” he said. Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Corporation said, “Though a surge is expected it would not be more than double in our jurisdiction. Our Covid centres in KDMC have the capacity to take up 900 patients daily. If required we will increase the testing centres at Railway stations to contain the spread. We have been strictly implementing the Covid-19 related protocol,”Meanwhile, the state reported 2630 more cases and 42 deaths of Covid-19 on Saturday taking the tally to 2,023,814 and toll to 51,042. Mumbai’s case tally touched 3,08492 and toll went up to 11345 after the city clocked 429 cases and 7 deaths on Saturday.The state has 44,199 active cases including 13,504 in Pune, 7677 in Thane and 5769 in Mumbai. State’s case fatality rate stands at 2.52% and the recovery rate at 95.23%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19inoculation-of-frontline-workers-in-maharashtra-from-monday-101612028962887.html
30-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Corporators affiliated with NCP in Beed municipal council join Shiv Sena||In a development that may cause unease between ruling partners Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena, four councillors from a local alliance led by NCP in Beed municipal council joined Sena, on Saturday. The defection is attributed to the rivalry between former state minister and Shiv Sena leader Jaidutt Kshirsagar and his member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) nephew Sandeep Kshirsagar (NCP) at the local level.Leaders from the ruling parties, however, felt that the issue is unlikely to cause any friction between the ruling parties as corporators were not elected on NCP symbol.Sandeep defeated Jaidutt in Assembly elections last year after the latter quit the NCP ahead of the elections and joined Shiv Sena.The 40-member municipal council is controlled by Sena with the help of independent corporators. Jaidutt’s younger brother Bharatbhushan is a council chairman. After the defection of the four corporators, Sena-led alliance’s strength has risen to 25.“It’s the tussle between Kshirsagar uncle-nephew at a local level and would not have any repercussions at the state level. I am not fully aware of the details, but the local level alliance is in power in the municipal council comprising of many corporators elected without party symbols. This episode cannot be compared with the one in Parner and will have no connotations at the state level,” said state minority development minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik.Municipal council elections were held before Assembly polls when Jaidutt was in NCP. The corporators shifted to Shiv Sena with him and continued ruling in the council. On the other hand, Sandeep revolted and formed his own alliance in the council. The corporators later came under NCP. On this backdrop, there would not be any repercussion at the state level.“The corporators joined us owing to the trust they have in (Jaidutt) Kshirsagarsaheb. The corporators inducted today will be treated respectfully in the party. It has been proved now that people do not respect the people who disrespect their elderly,” said Bharatbhushan Kshirsagar.In July last year, five Sena corporators from Parner municipal corporation had a crossover to NCP leading to friction between the two parties. NCP had to send them back to their party after Sena leadership reacted strongly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-corporators-affiliated-with-ncp-in-beed-municipal-council-join-shiv-sena-101612028781741.html

A meeting with the agitating sanitation employees was convened today (Saturday) where we assured them to consider their other demands of regularisation as well. Sanitation employees along with nurses and paramedic staff have called off their strike. We have also released two months salaries of teachers and other employees and we appeal to them to return to work.”The mayor said that the sanitation employees will return to work from Sunday and clear the streets that are filled with garbage.The civic employees of the north corporation had gone on an indefinite strike from January 7 against non-payment of their salaries for the last 4-5 months and pending pensions.“The sanitation employees and nurses have called off their strike as their salaries have been cleared till December and demands have been met. But the Confederation does not acknowledge the pick and choose method of the civic body hence employees of other departments such as engineers, teachers, horticulture staff etc will continue their strike. A decision on the further strategy will be taken on February 1,” Ramniwas Solanki, general secretary of the Confederation said.Confirming the development, president Hindu Rao Hospital Nurses’ Union, Indu Jamwal said that their pending salaries have been cleared so the strike has been called off.“The strike at all the hospitals of the north civic body (Hindu Rao, Kasturba and Rajan Babu TB hospitals) have been called off and we have returned to work,” Jamwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nurses-sanitation-staff-call-off-strike-after-north-corp-clears-pending-dues-101612025960884.html

30-01-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand BJP MLA faces ire for likening farmers' demands to 'eagle's urine'||Amid the ongoing protest by the farmers demanding the Centre to repeal the three farm laws, BJP MLA from Uttarakhand's Jhabreda constituency of Haridwar stirred a storm by likening farmers' demands to "eagle's urine". BJP MLA Deshraj Karnwal said that that the "farmers don't know what their demands are".A video of the MLA making the aforementioned statement to some local media persons in Haridwar went viral on the social media on Saturday morning drawing sharp criticism from opposition Congress and local farmer leaders. Karnwal reportedly made the statement two days ago.HT has access to the video in which the ruling party MLA could be purportedly seen making the derogatory statement while condemning the violence in Delhi during tractor parade on Republic Day.Karnwal while condemning the violence said, "What happened on January 26 in Delhi was very unfortunate. I fully condemn it. It was completely a conspiracy by the Congress and other Opposition parties."Also read: What the Union Budget needs to get rightHe further stated, "Initially the farmers had demanded amendments in the farm laws which the government accepted. Then also they didn't end the agitation. The government is asking them about their demands but they are like we want eagle's urine, which is a non-existent thing. How can the government meet their demand for a thing which doesn't exist?"Karnwal couldn't be contacted despite several attempts.As soon as the video went viral on social media, Karnwal and BJP came under attack by the Congress and farmer leaders which termed his statement "highly condemnable and unpardonable."State general secretary of Rashtriya Kisaan-Mazdoor Sangathan, Anil Choudhary termed Karnwal as a "blot in the name of an elected public representative.""What he said for the farmers shows his mindset. And the shameful thing is that a person like him is an MLA. He knows nothing about the laws and is using such derogatory words for the farmers. They will answer him and the BJP in the next election," said Choudhary.Congress state vice president Suryakant Dhasmana attacked the ruling BJP on Karnwal's statement."What he said about the farmers is not just his words but the mentality of the BJP which has been labelling our farmers' as terrorists, anti-nationals and people funded by Pakistan and China. It is just unpardonable," said Dhasmana adding, "BJP leaders like Karnwal are just towing the line of their senior leaders sitting in Delhi."The state BJP leadership, meanwhile, said that they have come to know the matter through media and would ask Karnwal for a "clarification."Bansidhar Bhagat, BJP state president said, "The matter has come to our notice through media. We would seek a clarification from Karnwal on his use of words for the farmers following which an appropriate action would be taken."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-bjp-mla-faces-ire-for-likening-farmers-demands-to-eagle-s-urine-101612016996724.html

In a letter written to union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, the Maharashtra state goods and passenger transport association has demanded an alternative to scrapping of vehicles. “The decision taken by the union transport ministry is unfair and needs a rethink as lives of millions of people are dependent on it. There are a large number of people across the country who earn their daily bread and butter through autorickshaws, trucks, transport vehicles, buses and other private vehicles. Most of them have vehicles above 15 years of age and suddenly scrapping the vehicle will impact them financially. Already all of us are struggling to recover from losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Baba Shinde, president of the association. “Earlier the government told us to covert to CNG, so we accepted that decision and most of the vehicles installed CNG kits. We have requested Gadkari to arrange a meeting with the association to try and find a solution,” added Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/transporters-assoc-opposes-scrapping-of-15-year-old-vehicles-101612004299995.html

Dalmiya, a businesswoman and daughter of former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, joined politics in 2016. So did Ghosal, a senior journalist.“I was contacted by people from Shah’s office after I resigned from the assembly on Friday. BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, who is the observer for Bengal, also contacted me. I was supposed to meet Shah at his hotel on Friday night but his trip was cancelled. I will contest from Domjur again. The voters have seen how I worked for them. Positions are not important for me. I want to work for people. I needed the right political platform to achieve that. I never liked mudslinging in politics,” Rajib Banerjee told reporters before boarding the flight.Also read: Centre stands by offer made to farmers: PM Modi at all-party meetShah was scheduled to arrive in Kolkata around 11 pm on Friday but he had to cancel the trip in view of the security threat in the national capital.

30-01-2021||Chandigarh||Most people have access to basic needs in Punjab, Haryana: Economic survey||The economic survey for 2020-21, presented by the Union government in Parliament, shows that Punjab and Haryana are among top four states where the rural and urban population have the highest access to bare necessities. These include housing, water, sanitation, electricity, clean cooking fuel and other facilities. The survey reveals that as compared to 2012, access to bare necessities has improved across all states in the country in 2018, but are highest in Kerala, Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat, while it is the lowest in Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Tripura. The survey revealed that 50% to 70% of the Punjab population had access to bare necessities in 2012 whereas it improved and remained above 70% in 2018. “It has improved disproportionately for the poorest households as compared to the richest households across rural and urban areas. The improvement in equity is particularly because while the rich can seek private alternatives, lobby for better services, or if need be, move to areas where public goods are better provided for, the poor rarely have such choices,” the survey observed. It said that the highest access to bare necessities in rural areas in 2018 is recorded in Punjab, Kerala, Sikkim, Goa and Delhi. The central government has launched schemes, including the Jal Jeevan Mission, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana and others, to address these gaps. The economic survey also said that Punjab reported a high attendance rate of 61.6% of the children in the age group of 3-5 years in 2017-18. The survey said the age specific attendance ratio (ASAR) indicated that children in the age-group of 6-13 years have reported almost 95% and above attendance across states but the attendance rate in the early childhood education is low and diverging. Threat of labour shock on PunjabThe economic survey cautioned Punjab about the impact of Covid-19 on gross value added (GVA), labour markets and fiscal position, saying that Punjab is expected to experience informal labour shocks in the services sector. The economic survey also highlighted that Punjab had higher a unemployment rate in 2018-19, as it recorded a 7.4% unemployment rate (urban and rural) as compared to the national 5.8%.

30-01-2021||Chandigarh||Kalka Congress MLA faces disqualification from assembly||Congress MLA from Kalka (Haryana) Pradeep Chaudhary, who was convicted and sentenced for three years of imprisonment in a 2011 case of rioting by a Himachal Pradesh court on Thursday, faces disqualification as a member of the legislative assembly.Legal experts said that the MLA will be disqualified as per Section 8 (3) of the Representation of the People Act. The disqualification provision says that a person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release.Since the Supreme Court in a 2013 judgment had declared sub-section 4 of Section 8 of the Act ultra vires (beyond legal power), Chaudhary will not be saved from disqualification under this provision.Section 8(4) provided that disqualification of an MP or MLA will not take effect until three months have elapsed from that date or if within that period an appeal or application for revision is brought in respect of the conviction of the sentence, until the appeal is disposed off by the court.In its ruling, the apex court had held that if any sitting member of Parliament or a state legislature is convicted of any of the offences mentioned in Section 8 of the Act and by virtue of such conviction or sentence suffers disqualifications after the pronouncement of this judgment, his membership of Parliament or the state legislature will not be saved by sub-section (4) of Section 8 “which we have by this judgment declared as ultra vires the Constitution notwithstanding that he files the appeal or revision against the conviction or sentence.”Former Haryana advocate general, Mohan Jain, said that Chaudhary is liable to disqualified from the membership of the assembly as per the law.Additional solicitor general (ASG), Satya Pal Jain, said that the MLA stands disqualified the moment he is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years.He will also continue to be disqualified and barred from contesting elections for a further period of six years after his release, said Jain, an expert on constitutional law.“However, if the high court stays the conviction of the MLA, his membership of the assembly will get restored from that day. But the restoration of membership will not be applicable if the high court only grants him bail,” the ASG said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kalka-congress-mla-faces-disqualification-from-assembly-101611999320485.html

This means that the animal has moved away from the main Najafgarh city. We have issued alerts around Ghummanhera and Jharoda Kalan and other nearby villages asking people to not step out after dark and also to keep their pets inside," Srivastava said.He said that cages have been placed and round-the-clock patrolling is being conducted by the forest department teams to capture the animal."Once the animal has been captured, we will discuss the possibility of moving it either to the Delhi zoo or to the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary. In case, we don't have the space or facility to move the leopard within the city, we will look at options from other cities. However, that will be a decision taken by the higher authorities," Srivastava said.Meanwhile, cabinet minister and Najafgarh legislator Kailash Gahlot also wrote a letter to the forest department urging teams to ensure the quick capture of the animal for the safety of the residents of the area."On the matter of a leopard sighting at Najafgarh, the forest department officials have been asked to capture the animal as soon as possible. People are requested to not panic and alert the authorities if they spot the leopard. Leopard is a protected wildlife animal so residents are requested to refrain from attacking it," Gahlot said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/leopard-spotted-in-delhi-alert-issued-101611994248546.html

The affidavit added the report said three channels had bribed households to bolster their ratings.“The Respondent [Singh] in pursuance of his duty was within the realm of law to inform the public at large about the crime registered, background, and nature of crime. It is submitted that the answering Respondent [Singh] holds periodic briefings as per the procedure and practice established in sensitive cases and was providing credible information to the extent it was fit and proper to disclose and answering the queries as received from the journalists/reporters without divulging any secret and confidential information/material collected during investigation, the disclosure whereof could affect administration of justice. It is submitted that media briefing was held strictly in confines of the law and the principles enunciated by this Hon'ble Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”Shashank Sandbhor, assistant commissioner of police, in a counter-affidavit has submitted that the petition filed by Hansa Research Group seeking reliefs similar to those sought by ARG Outlier Media in their petition indicates that it is trying to "somehow protect them from prosecution". He added the group has moved the court “to stall on-going investigations as they have revealed a nexus between the Hansa Group and the channels”.The affidavit and counter-affidavits were filed before the bench of justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale by senior counsel Kapil Sibal, representing the state and Mumbai police, on January 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allegations-of-malafides-related-to-trp-fraud-case-baseless-mumbai-top-cop-101611989884341.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC dismisses plea by judge challenging his removal for sexual harassment||The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed the plea by a judicial officer challenging his removal from service on charges of sexual harassment of a female Ahlmad at the Dwarka District court in 2016, where he was posted as an additional judge.A bench of justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and justice Asha Menon said that the Delhi Higher Judicial Service (DHJS) officer was given ample opportunity by the Full Court of the Delhi high court to justify his stand. The court also said that even the Supreme Court in 2019 had held that there was no perversity with the order passed by the disciplinary committee.“….having judicially examined the report, not only as to the procedure followed and opportunities at each and every stage provided to the petitioner but also on merits, we are more than convinced, of the conclusion having been rightly drawn on the basis of material on record that the allegations of sexual harassment against the petitioner, stand proved,” the bench said in a 32-page judgment.The court’s decision comes on the plea by the officer, who had challenged his dismissal from service by the Delhi government in March last year, on the recommendations of the Full Court of the Delhi high court on charges of sexual harassment. The officer had sought his restoration in service, with all consequential benefits.The incident of sexual harassment dates back to July 5, 2016, when the accused judicial officer was an additional district judge posted at Dwarka courts in Delhi. A junior judicial assistant working in his court alleged sexual harassment by the officer and forwarded her complaint to the chief justice of the Delhi high court for appropriate action.The woman had said that she worked in the court of the accused officer as Ahlmad (judicial assistant) between May 18, 2015 and May 18, 2016. The registrar general of the Delhi high court, after the incident, had directed the station house officer (SHO) to register an FIR against the accused officer and he was suspended from service.The officer in his plea, however, contended that false charges were levelled against him by the Ahlmad since he had issued notice to her in connection to some missing documents on July 5, 2016 and in the counterblast, she had filed a complaint against him on July 11, 2016.He, through his counsel, stated that on 19th July, 2016, an Internal Complaint Committee (ICC) under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (Sexual Harassment Act) was appointed, which did not exonerate the judicial officer, even when it should have.The officer also said that he was not given a copy of the report of March 9, 2018 by the ICC, detailing its findings. He added that the report did not find any “proved allegation”.The bench, while referring to Aug, 2019 judgment of the SC, noted that the apex court had held that there was no error in the decision of the Full Court of the Delhi HC of July 13, 2016 to suspend the petitioner and initiate inquiry proceedings against him.The court also said that the defence taken by the officer at this stage has already been exhausted before the SC. It also said that the SC had held the proceedings culminating in the report, proving the sexual harassment charge was validly instituted against him.It also said that the SC was seized of all details of the communications sent to the judicial officer, but did not direct the Full Court to consider the ICC report afresh, considering it as a report of the inquiring authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-by-judge-challenging-his-removal-for-sexual-harassment-101611985992564.html

30-01-2021||Mumbai||Raj Thackeray to visit Ayodhya Ram Mandir in March; Shiv Sena takes a veiled dig||Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray will visit the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in March, according to a senior party leader. The decision was taken in a party meeting held at Bandra in Mumbai.“Rajsaheb will visit Ayodhya between March 1 and 9 to seek the blessings of Lord Ram. He will also visit the Hanuman temple there. He will be accompanied by his party colleagues,” announced senior MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar.Political analyst Hemant Desai said that Raj Thackeray was aiming to project himself as a Hindutva icon with an eye on ascendency in Maharashtra politics.“Raj wants to fashion himself as a Hindutva leader and become close to the BJP. Since the current Shiv Sena no longer advocates a stringent Hindutva line like its founder Bal Thackeray, Raj wants to fill that vacuum,” Desai reasoned.After the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, when Raj’s party could only win one seat while his rival and cousin, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray outmanoeuvred the BJP to become the chief minister of Maharashtra, Raj Thackeray was seen to be warming up to the BJP with a more pronounced pro-Hindutva line.A year ago, he unveiled a saffron flag for his party and later raised the issue of reopening of temples when the restrictions imposed to contain Covid-19 pandemic were being lifted gradually.“Even BJP would like to have Raj at their side as he can split Shiv Sena votes and benefit them,” Desai argued further while pointing out that even on the issue of farmers' agitation against the three Central farm laws, Raj did not criticise the BJP.The Shiv Sena was quick to taunt Raj Thackeray, saying the party-- once seen as Maharashtra’s original Hindutva outfit-- was ready to guide his visit to Ayodhya.“If Raj Thackeray feels like going to Ayodhya, he should do so. We will guide him,” said Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut.After he floated the MNS in 2006, Raj Thackeray pursued an aggressive and violent agenda guided by regionalism and sons of the soil policy.He launched a violent campaign against north Indians, accusing them of “stealing” jobs meant for the locals. His party men resorted to physical attacks on north Indians youth appearing for railway recruitment examinations and also migrant labourers in Mumbai and in other parts of the state.Also Read: Maharashtra Congress raises questions over fundraising for Ram templeThe campaign seemed to pay off initially as the MNS won 13 seats in the 2009 assembly elections, however, the appeal soon wore off with the party getting reduced to just one assembly seat after 2014 polls.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he campaigned against the BJP with bitter criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, that did not turn his political fortunes. For a year now, after the formation of Uddhav Thackeray led Maha Vikas Aghadi government, he appears to be moving closer to the BJP.BJP leaders have said in the past that they are open to an alliance with the MNS provided Raj gives up his opposition to north Indians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raj-thackeray-to-visit-ayodhya-ram-mandir-in-march-shiv-sena-takes-a-veiled-dig-101611975630088.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Farm agitation swells after surge in Jatland||Thousands of farmers poured into Ghazipur on the eastern fringes of Delhi on Friday after an emotional appeal for support by farm leader Rakesh Tikait, indicating that the government crackdown on the two-month-old agitation following violence on Republic Day may have partially backfired.Farmers from 10 districts in western UP, a stronghold of the influential Jat community, congregated at a massive gathering in Muzaffarnagar, where they announced the social boycott of anyone not backing the movement. In Haryana, khaps, or clan-based bodies, vowed to send at least one person from each family to bolster the ongoing stir against three agriculture laws passed in September.Throughout the night, cultivators took tractors, trucks and motorbikes to reach the Delhi border, where numbers swelled and morale mounted with the arrival of a new contingent of protesters determined to defend the honour of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Tikait.While just about a thousandfarmers had gathered at Ghazipur on Thursday, the number swelled around 10,000 on Friday.“If the police use force on us for not leaving, it is not a problem. But if some political organisations attempt to trouble us, that is unacceptable...Now, I will not surrender (to the police), we’ll continue to protest here,” Tikait told the gathering.It was a dramatic reversal from Thursday afternoon, when dwindling numbers, bitter public fallout of violence by farmers at the Republic Day tractor rally, and increasing police presence, left the protesters demoralised.The Ghaziabad administration served Tikait, son of legendary farm leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, with an ultimatum to vacate the site or face penal consequences, part of a wider crackdown on the agitation since January 26. Farmers also said that the authorities cut off their water and power supply to the site.But instead of caving in, Tikait broke down in front of television cameras and vowed to not leave the site until the government repealed the laws. “If the farm laws are not repealed, Rakesh Tikait will commit suicide,” he had said, biting back tears.These visuals were beamed on television channels and went viral on social media, triggering calls for mobilisation from temples, mosques and panchayats across western UP throughout the night. Tikait’s resolve to not drink water unless it was brought from his village in particular touched a chord with the people, who carried water in bottles and pouches from their homes in the heartland to the Capital’s edge.Prabhjeet Singh, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar who returned to Ghazipur a day after he left for his home, said, “We couldn’t leave him (Tikait) to battle it alone when he needed us the most”By morning, the agitation seemed to have regained some of the momentum it lost when on Republic Day, farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed violently with police, ran riot on the Capital’s streets, and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts.The violence and vandalisation were widely condemned and sparked statements of remorse and anguish from farm groups across north India, even as unions leading the stir blamed fringe elements, a government “conspiracy”, and Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu for stoking passions.The improvement in morale was visible in the principal protest site at the Singhu border despite violence by a mob of around 200 people earlier in the day. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body leading the stir, said farmers will hold a one-day hunger strike to mark Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary on January 30.“Today, we just saw farmers arriving in Ghazipur. In a couple of days, more protesters will arrive at Tikri, Singhu, and Shahjahanpur border from Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan,” said Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab.Ghazipur is the smallest of the three protest sites — after Singhu and Tikri on the Capital’s northwestern and western borders respectively — where farmers have camped since November.But on Friday, it was the focal point of the agitation as politicians, journalists, ordinary people made a beeline to meet Tikait, and union leaders scrambled to put up more tents, and set up community kitchens for the incoming crowds.Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia met Tikait and extended unconditional support on behalf of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “It is in such tough times that one aandolankari (protesters) come to help other aandolankari (protesters),” Tikait responded.Other politicians to visit were Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, and Congress leader Deepinder Singh Hooda. Opposition politicians across the country also extended their support.“I want to tell the farmers, don’t retract even by an inch. These laws will give a shock to middle class too, as food prices will skyrocket. The only solution is to repeal these laws,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said.In Haryana, khaps held meetings across the state and decided to send members to the farmer protests, and socially boycott leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party (JJP). Haryana is governed by a BJP-JJP coalition. The move came even as the Haryana government suspended mobile internet in 17 districts.In Muzaffarnagar, Tikait’s brother Naresh Tikait organised a show of strength attended by tens of thousands of farmers. “The ongoing movement is a battle for the honour of farmers and, if it ends, it will damage our very existence,” said Naresh Tikait after the seven-hour mahapanchayat.In the face of increased mobilisation, police retreated from the Ghazipur site even as UP additional director general of police (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar said they were in touch with farmer leaders to find an amicable solution through talks.(with inputs from HTC in Lucknow, Chandigarh and Rohtak)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farm-agitation-swells-after-surge-in-jatland-101611970909266.html

The donations have come from across the country.“Temple construction is being done in three phases with the technical committee supervising the whole construction process. We will also be bringing pilgrims and religious scholars from foreign countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand to visit Ayodhya and other religious-spiritual sites of the country,” he added.On January 15, President Ram Nath Kovind donated ₹5 lakh to the drive.

The construction of the temple was launched on August 5 last year with a prayer presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/230-crore-collected-for-ram-temple-trust-101611967625703.html

30-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The thermocol man||He has a theory on dreams. “These sapne (dreams) don’t come to all,” says Balram. “People with less money don’t dream.”He patiently explains that by dream he doesn’t mean what one sees while sleeping, but the things one aspires for when fully conscious.Ok, but surely there must be at least one thing he aspires for?Balram takes some time to think before answering—“To earn enough to keep my family well-fed, to keep having a job.”The nature of his work is part of a niche. He pedals around the Capital on his rickety cart collecting thermocol pieces, the kind that are used to cushion electrical gadgets or delicate furniture items from breaking during transport. In fact, this afternoon in south Delhi’s Green Park he is on a roadside, piling up a mound of such pieces into a gigantic bundle bond in a net.A native of Gorakhpur, in UP, Balram, 35, arrived in the city 8 years ago. “I had no dreams back then too. I left my village because finding work in a big city seemed worth the trouble of leaving your des.” He has no regrets, he confirms.By now, Balram is a full-fledged Delhiite, having set up his roots firmly in the city’s soil. He lives in Okhla with wife, Meena, and sons, Soni and Kishen. “They go to school,” he points out.Firmly tying the knot of the net in which he has gathered the thermocol, Balram says that over the years he has developed work-related contacts and while leaving his house at 8 every morning, he knows exactly where he has to go to find spare thermocol. “Sometimes I go to factories or warehouses, and sometimes to houses where people have just shifted.” Every evening he sells the collection to a dealer in Okhla.Now Balram single-handedly transfers the pile onto his cart. He climbs on the rider’s seat and says, confession like, “I don’t have a dream but I do want, someday soon, to rid myself from the cycle of byaj (interest)... I had borrowed money to build a house in the village... earlier we had no house of our own. My real savings for the future can only start after I’ve paid all my interests.”He now pedals away, the thermocol on the cart glinting from far away, like a snow-encrusted mountain peak. He returns home at 5pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-thermocol-man-101611966894964.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Questions raised after police fail to stop breach||Multiple barricades, deep trenches, and at least 1,000 personnel of Delhi Police and paramilitary forces failed to stop a mob of 200 people from reaching the stage of the farmer protest at Singhu border, attacking the protesters with sticks, and pelting stones at them in a breach that sparked clashes at the site on Friday afternoon.This was the first incident of violence at the protest site, and forced police to lob tear-gas shells and lathi-charge both farmers and the mob, who claimed to be local residents. Television visuals also showed police and some counter-protesters beating a farmer.Many farmers at the site accused Delhi Police of being mute spectators while the mob came dangerously close to the farmers and attacked them. They also pointed out that the security forces had stopped several journalists and politicians from reaching the stage of the site earlier.“If police wanted, they could have stopped those goons. Carrying national flags and shouting slogans, it was clear that they were protesting against us. Police should have stopped them from coming here. It wasn’t difficult to make out that they are not among us protesters. The violence could have been avoided,” said Joginder Kaur, 55, a farmer from Kot Budha village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, who was near the stage when the violence started.The site is divided in two parts. First is the Kisaan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) stage, and then a larger Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) stage about 500 metres away. Vehicle coming to Singhu are stopped at the first barricade set up a kilometre away from the KMSC stage. Only police officers, media personnel, and people connected to the protests are allowed to pass through the barricaded highway.But on Friday, the mob managed to walk past barricades and security forces from the first barrier to the KMSC stage. The farmers also alleged that the mob shouted slogans like “Goli Maaro... ”.“Police stopped water tankers from reaching us. This morning, I walked up to the barricades requesting them to let the tankers enter but the police did not allow. Some politicians were also stopped . Then, why did they allow the mob shouting provocative slogans reach till the stage area? The videos are there for everyone to see,” said Jaswant Singh, 32, a farmer from Jalandhar district.He was referring to videos on social media -- not verified independently -- that showed a group of men pelting stones while police personnel stood next to them. One video showed a masked man throwing stones. Another showed some police personnel in anti-riot gear standing during the stone pelting.A photograph of a man, who was identified by many on social media as Aman Dabas, husband of Bharatiya Janata Party councillor from Bawana Anju Dabas, also went viral on social media. Anju Dabas confirmed her husband was in Singhu but said he was not there as a party representative. “He was there as any other local who is facing problem due to the ongoing agitation of farmers,” said Anju.Delhi Police issued a statement, which said that around 1.30pm, around 200 locals reached the GTB Memorial, towards Singhu and went to meet the farmers. “They said they have been providing all kinds of help to protesters for last two months but now their livelihood is getting affected, hence they are requested to open the border and vacate the road,” a Delhi police spokesperson said.“This was resisted by some farmers and pushing-pulling of the police barricades kept to secure the langar tents...during this stone pelting started,” the spokesperson added. The statement did not clarify which group pelted the stones.A senior officer in Singhu said police did not let the locals reach the stage. “The place near the stage, where the locals reached today is an open area. People are free to walk until this point. After today’s incident, people will not be allowed to walk up to that point too,” said the officer.Until late Friday, police arrested 44 persons from both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/questions-raised-after-police-fail-to-stop-breach-101611966151021.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Sticks, stones at Singhu as group enters site, clashes with farmers||A group of around 200 people who said they were locals entered the Singhu border protest site despite heavy barricading and police presence on Friday, and clashed with both cops and farmers in an incident that led to injuries to an SHO and several others.The SHO of Alipur, Pradeep Paliwal, was injured after he was hit on his left palm by the sword of a protesting Sikh farmer. Eyewitnesses said that the farmer was intending to drive the stone-pelting mob away, even as police said that he attacked the officer. There were also visuals of police personnel and members of the group of counter-protesters beating the farmer with lathis.Gurkirat Singh, 22, a farmer from Gulalipur village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, said the incident unfolded before him. “The violent crowd which had come to attack us was throwing stones, sticks, and bricks. The farmer was trying to chase the mob away. Instead, he was attacked by police and the mob, and the officer got hurt in the process,” he said.Delhi Police said they have registered a case of attempt to murder, rioting, obstructing public servant on duty and other sections against the 25-year-old farmer, Ranjeet Singh from Nawanshahr district in Punjab. Police said 44 people from both groups, who were indulging in violence, were caught at the spot.“At least five police personnel sustained injuries. The 25-year-old protester who injured inspector Paliwal has been arrested, and the sword has been recovered. We are verifying the identity and the affiliation of the 43 persons arrested in the case. They belong to both groups,” said a senior police officer.Farmer leaders said at least 15 protesters were hurt during Friday’s clashes.How it beganThe main protest site at Singhu border -- where hundreds and thousands of farmers have gathered at different points over a 64-day protest, and where tents now stretch for more than 10km -- is divided into two parts. First is the Kisaan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) stage, and then a larger Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) stage about 500 metres away.At around 12.30pm, over 100 people claiming to be locals managed to come close to the KMSC stage by crossing police barricades set up over 1km before the tents begin. They were raising slogans of “goli maaro...” (shoot the traitors) and branding the farmers as “Khalistanis”. Some of them had covered their faces with mufflers and handkerchiefs.These protesters claimed to be anguished by the insult to the national tricolour during the Republic Day tractor rally by farmers that descended into violence, and particularly by the hoisting of a Sikh religious flag alongside the national flag at Red Fort.Many among them had come to the protest area on Thursday as well, demanding the removal of farmers. HT reported on Thursday that the protesters included members of groups called the Hindu Sena, the Hinda Yuva Seva Sangh, and the Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch (DDVM), which is a collective of about 50 villages.“Some of us had gone to Alipur police station to submit a letter calling for clearing the highway and we sent a similar letter via email to Delhi police commissioner and Lieutenant Governor. While we were returning, we got to know of the incident. Our people told us that farmers had become hostile leading to the clashes. If we had been there, we could have stopped the situation from escalating,” said Anup Singh Maan, general secretary, DDVM.Ravi Das, who was part of the group, said he was a local resident and was bothered by the farmers’ protests. “We wanted farmers to clear the highway. They were carrying weapons like swords, so we had to save ourselves. They started throwing stones,” he alleged.The group was briefly stopped by the police at the point of entry at the barricades set up on one carriageway near the Singhu border toll plaza. However, they soon jumped over to the other side and rushed at the tents set up by the farmers, disrupting their lunch langar.Rare breachIt was a rare breach of the security setup on a day when Delhi Police did not allow any vehicles to cross the barricade. Only those on foot were allowed after stating the purpose of their visit. Aam Aadmi Party leaders Satyendar Jain and Raghav Chadha were also not allowed to visit the protest site on Friday morning.“We had come here to ensure that the farmers have water and adequate facilities for toilet and cleaning. But the police are not allowing the Delhi Jal Board water tankers to pass. This is a human rights violation. The BJP government is treating farmers like terrorists,” said Chadha, AAP MLA and DJB vice chairperson. Jain added, “The police are telling us that they have orders from above to not allow water tankers. We asked them to show the orders, but they didn’t do that.”At around 1.40pm, the counter-protesters began pelting stones at farmers, and they retaliated. The two groups threw sticks, stones, and bricks at each other, injuring several people and leading to the police firing several rounds of tear gas shells to control the situation.Kashmir Kaur, 60, a farmer from Wali Pur village in Tarn Taran district, said she was sleeping inside a tent set up for women – close to the flashpoint. “We were resting when the first tear gas shell entered the tent. I couldn’t see because of it and had to run towards the other side. Our blankets and clothes caught fire as well. I don’t know why police were firing tear gas shells towards us when they [the mob] was the one attacking us,” she said.Though police were able to take the counter-protesters away from the main site around 2pm, nearly 30 minutes later, another round of stone-pelting began despite the presence of personnel from the Rapid Action Force. The police then led the group to around a kilometre from the protest site.Around 3pm, however, the group entered a Guru Tegh Bahadur memorial on the side through a gate near the barricades and replaced farmer union flags with the tricolour, before being chased away by the security forces.KMSC member Kuldeep Singh, 56, a farmer from Lohian in Jalandhar district, said: “These elements were sent here to provoke us. How is it possible that when water tankers are not being allowed, a mob of around 100 people managed to enter, damage our langar, and throw stones at us amid police presence,” he said.Near one of the concrete barricades set up on Friday after the incident, a group from Tarn Taran district sat huddled. “Around a dozen of us will participate in vigil and patrol in batches of three. Today, all of us will stay awake and keep an eye,” said Karaj Singh, one of the protesters in the group.(with inputs from Abhishek Dey)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sticks-stones-at-singhu-as-group-enters-site-clashes-with-farmers-101611965723289.html

30-01-2021||Delhi||Tears, water, and a protest rekindled||It was around 9pm on Thursday when Gaurav Sangwan, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar, back with his wife and two children for only three hours after spending a fortnight at the Ghazipur protest site, received a video message on WhatsApp. It showed farmer leader Rakesh Tikait breaking down in tears while speaking to the media.Tikait, facing a situation where water and power at the encampment was cut off and an eviction notice served by the Uttar Pradesh Police and the district administration, was saying in the video that he would not leave. He also vowed that he would not drink water until it was brought from his village in the heart of western UP.Less than 30 minutes after he watched the clip, Sangwan was driving back to Delhi in a car with five other farmers. “If a man cries, he is a good man. I will be betraying a good man if I stayed back at home,” Sangwan said at the Ghazipur site on Friday, summing up his decision to return.Sangwan was among thousands of agitators who were swayed by Tikait’s tears and his call for water from back home; they rushed to Ghazipur despite the possibility of a midnight crackdown on the protesters days after the Republic Day tractor march in the national capital descended into violence and chaos.This time, apart from old-timers who had been here before, farmers who initially sat out of the protest landed up as well. Instead of winding up, by Friday morning the protest spot had crowds much larger than at any time over the past two months. Farmers there said the crowd would swell even more by Saturday morning.As they streamed in, most of the farmers did not head to tents or langars (community kitchens) ; instead, they went straight to the stage to hear their leader speak. And Tikait -- son of the legendary late farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait who headed the Bharatiya Kisan Union -- addressed them again and again, until his voice cracked and broke.Each time he could speak no more, the crowd called out to him. “Tikait tum aage badho, hum tumhaare saath hain (Tikait, you move ahead. We are right behind you).”Farmers flocked to click pictures with him, journalists queued up to interview him, and protesters all around discussed his video message from the previous evening.For the first time since the protests began in November, attention , restricted largely to the two larger protests sites, Singhu and Tikri, inhabited largely by farmers from Punjab and Haryana, moved to Ghazipur.From the stage, Tikait hit out at the local administration for cutting the water and power supply to the protest site.“If the government (local administration) doesn’t send water tankers within two hours, we’ll dig our own bore wells here and draw water. The ground and its water belongs to everyone,” he told a gathering that was growing through the day.But neither Tikait, nor the other farmers here, were short of water on Friday.While some locals arranged for water tankers, as did the Delhi government -- it was visuals of people bringing drinking water directly from their villages to Tikait that stood out.A man from Meerut brought an old plastic bottle, only half filled with water; a young boy from Muzaffarnagar, sitting on his father’s shoulders, carried a large tumbler in his hands; someone from Amroha brought water straight from the Ganga; and lots of the returnees carried water to the stage in large plastic jugs. Tikait’s associates would pour some of the water in a small steel container as a symbol of respect.A woman who sang on the main stage offered to sell a recently constructed house if the movement needed funding; some residents of Noida and leaders from the Ghazipur Mandi said from the stage that, despite the inconvenience, they did not mind farmers occupying the road.Support also arrived in the form of political leaders. Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia extended unconditional support, and said that he was sent by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to ensure that all arrangements were in place.“Kejriwal ji sent me to ensure you don’t face any problems,” Sisodia told the gathering.“It is in such tough times that one aandolankari (protester) come to help other aandolankari (protester),” Tikait responded.Other politicians to visit were Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, UP Congress Committee chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, Haryana Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda, Swaraj India founder Yogendra Yadav, and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad.As more people poured in -- some tractors made multiple rounds to nearby villages to ferry people; others took public buses -- the Ghazipur site was clearly not prepared for the surge. Tents brought down by the departing farmers on Thursday afternoon were hurriedly re-erected; new ones came up as well. At the langars, the lunch was mostly limited to rice and dal, and the snacks to tea and rusk.“Now we won’t make the mistake of leaving in large numbers until our demands are met. Tikait’s cries made us realise that taking one step back would mean government taking many steps forward to remove us,” said Harminder Singh, a farmer who returned from Bareilly.Tikait assured the farmers that there was no going back a second time.On Thursday, he offered to surrender to the police before saying he would not leave -- for the sake of the agitation to repeal three contentious farm laws, and for the sake of his “Sikh brothers”, who, he said, were being branded as traitors over the Republic Day violence, which he said was part of the “conspiracy” to malign the movement.“The government conspired to insult us. But now I’ll ensure the farm laws are repealed and you return homes safely and with pride,” he told the gathering.By repeatedly waving a large national flag from the stage, he did his bit to undo the damage caused to the movement by the violence and vandalism on Republic Day.The UP Police were on the sidelines throughout Friday.A Delhi Police officer, who did not want to be named, said the barricades were made more secure to negate any chance of people from either side mingling with each other. “But we did not stop any media persons. They were allowed to pass, upon producing identity cards,” said the officer.Delhi Police personnel stayed beyond the barricades, several hundred metres from the stage, where the gathered crowd raised their hands each time Tikait sought their assurance for a peaceful protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tears-water-and-a-protest-rekindled-101611963311489.html
30-01-2021||Mumbai||Thane civic body tops Covid vaccination chart with 124% success rate||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has completed 124 per cent vaccination till Friday, the highest across Thane district.Thane is closely followed by Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) at 101 per cent and Navi Mumbai Municipal corporation (NMMC) at 89 per cent overall.The district overall has completed 86 per cent immunisation till Friday. The vaccination drive began within Thane district on January 16 with 23 vaccination centres. The number of centres has increased to 42 centres from Wednesday.TMC and NMMC have the most number of centres at 10 each. However, on the first day of the vaccination, KDMC had completed 100% immunisation. With a good start, the KDMC has managed to complete immunisation of 3,146 health workers overall, despite a target of 3,100.Moreover, TMC, which started with 88.25 per cent vaccination on the first day, saw more than 100 per cent vaccination till last Saturday. They also took special permissions and increased the number of vaccination centres to 10 from the previous four. This helped surpass the target of 6,000 vaccinations. TMC has immunised 7,422 beneficiaries till now.Both TMC and KDMC have initiated walk-in vaccination facilities for health workers, contributing to an increase in the daily target.“We have the Indian Medical Association, Thane chapter’s members and also have reached out to Asha workers across the city to come forward for the vaccination drive. This has helped us surpass the target. We have been provided with 19,000 doses of the vaccine by the district and will soon rope in the police personnel, revenue department and senior citizens with co-morbidities for the vaccination drive,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC.On Friday, a total 451 beneficiaries were vaccinated while the target for the day was 400. Presently, there are four centres that carry out vaccination in KDMC limits.“Although the turnout is more than the target, there is still confusion among the paramedical staff. They are not willing to come for the vaccination. We will try and counsel them and make sure all of the listed beneficiaries take the dosage,” said Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.She added that there was no wastage in the entire drive. “We have not wasted a single dosage till date. In case if the vaccine was left for the day, we go for walk-in immunisations to make sure it was used because once removed, it cannot be restored,” added Panpatil.The highest number of vaccinations carried out by the civic body in a day is 467, which was on Thursday. The civic body has listed 5,116 health workers for the first phase of vaccination. They, however, do not have a timeframe to complete all the health workers yet. NMMC vaccinates 5,424The NMMC has successfully vaccinated 5,424 out of the 6,100 people targeted till Friday. The ones who didn’t turn up were due to issues like being out of station, allergy, pregnancy or lactation.NMMC medical officer, Ratnaprabha Chavan, said, “No one was unwilling to get vaccinated. There has been no untoward incident post vaccination besides a few minor side effects. Headache and heaviness are common side effects after any vaccination for some people. Around two or three people faced the same daily. Besides that, no one has faced any major side effects.”On Friday alone, 1,008 out of 1,100 patients were vaccinated, giving a 92 per cent success rate. NMMC has a total of 10 booths and target per day is now 1,100 as one booth has capacity of 200 beneficiaries and the rest have 100.“As per the government approvals, we would add booths. As of now, we have the capacity of 50 booths if required,” NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said. In phase I, the total beneficiaries to get vaccinated are 19,085 in NMMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-tops-covid-vaccination-chart-with-124-success-rate-101611948678703.html

However, the contractor appointed by the civic body did not rebuild the wall. This is the only crematorium in Kalyan East and it does not have a proper wall,” said Dhananjay Jogdand, president, AAP, Kalyan.“Ten days ago, we had written to the civic officials to build the wall or we will build it from our pockets. There was no response from the civic body and today we are doing it by ourselves,” he added.Baban Baraf, deputy engineer, sewage department, KDMC, said, “When the public toilet was opposed, we asked the contractor to stop the work. We had given orders to rebuild the wall, which was demolished. They were supposed to carry out the work in 2-3 days.

30-01-2021||Mumbai||‘Thane Mental Hospital structures need urgent repairs’||The portion of a plaster that collapsed in one of the Thane Mental Hospital’s structures last week had brought to the fore the urgent need for repairs. Around 102 inmates were shifted to a different ward after the collapse while the mental hospital authorities had put forth a proposal for the renovation of the buildings in hospital premises two years ago and are awaiting funds for the same.Dr Sanjay Bodade, medical superintendent, Thane Mental Hospital, said, “There are some structures within the hospital that are very old and are in urgent need of redevelopment. We are waiting for the earlier grant of ₹24Cr towards the renovation of the hospital. It has been two years since the wait.”There are 73 buildings in the hospital premises. Among these, 14 are for men and 15 are for women. Around 12 buildings among these are in a dangerous condition.The staff are worried that if the renovation is not completed before the monsoon, some of the structures may collapse. A structural audit was conducted last week after a portion of the slab from the ceiling between building Nos. 13 and 14 fell down. These buildings are now vacant as a precautionary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-mental-hospital-structures-need-urgent-repairs-101611948078240.html

30-01-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination for those aged over 50 by March-April: Mumbai civic body||If all goes as per plan, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) aims to start phase 3 of vaccination for general public above 50 years of age and those with comorbidities by March or April, and phase 2 for frontline workers by mid-February. While the civic officials said general public may have to pay for the vaccine, there is no decision on the cost. The BMC is also exploring enrolment of private hospitals for vaccination. Currently, the BMC is carrying out the first phase of vaccination for healthcare workers (HCW), which began on January 16. Speaking at the Social Sanchar event organised by V-Citizens Action Network (VCAN), Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner of BMC, said, “We aim to complete the first phase by February 14. Post this, we aim to kick off the second phase, which will cover police, solid waste management workers and Mumbai Fire Brigade. But it will depend on when we receive the vaccine deliveries, considering it is regulated by the Central government.” Kakani added, “By March or April, we aim to kick off the third phase in which the general public will be vaccinated. This will include those above the age of 50 and those who have comorbidities. This too will depend on the deliveries. We can augment our daily vaccination capacity to 50,000. For the third phase, our capacity needs to increase further…We are in touch with the chiefs of several private hospitals, and in the coming days, we plan to complete the shortlisting process.” The BMC officials also plan a Covid awareness programme to rule out rumours and misinformation about the vaccines. On Friday, the BMC clarified that vaccination is voluntary. It also added that administering Covid-19 vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, is not advisable for individuals below the age of 18 years. Meanwhile, the civic body on Friday completed its ninth day of immunization at 12 centres, with the addition of NESCO Covid jumbo facility in Goregaon. Friday’s vaccination drive saw a turnout of 72%, as 5,510 healthcare workers were vaccinated out of 7,697 expected to turn up for the day. Among these, four people experienced minor giddiness, called adverse event following immunisation (AEFI), and were kept under observation for 30 minutes before being discharged. So far, the BMC has completed vaccination of 33,505 healthcare workers in the city. The BMC has shortlisted about 125,000 healthcare workers for the first phase, who will receive two doses of the vaccine. “We have to wait 28 days before we can administer the second dose. We will be able to administer the second dose to those who came in for immunization on January 16, from February 13 or 14.” The BMC will also open vaccination centres at jumbo facilities in Dahisar, Mulund, and Richarson and Cruddas (RC) in Byculla, in the coming days. The number of teams carrying out the immunisation drive also increased to 80 on Friday, from 77 on Thursday and Wednesday, from 65 on Monday, 45 on January 23, 39 on January 22, 33 on January 20, and 32 on January 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-for-those-aged-over-50-by-march-april-mumbai-civic-body-101611947418700.html

Cold north-western winds brought chill to the city, forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has revealed.IMD’s Santacruz station, which is indicative of temperatures in Mumbai and the suburbs, recorded a minimum temperature of 14.8 degree Celsius, down from 15.2 degree Celsius on Thursday and 2.7 degrees below normal. The Colaba station, which is indicative of south Mumbai, recorded the minimum temperature at 17.5 degree Celsius, which is 0.2 degree Celsius below normal and 0.1 degree Celsius below Thursday’s minimum temperature. “Mumbai Santacruz recorded lowest min temperature of this season today (Friday) morning from Dec 2020. [There was] Good chill in air and a pleasant morning again, with first time in this season, the Santacruz Met Observatory recorded below 15°C. No large change expected in next 24 hrs. Thereafter gradual rise [of temperature is expected] (sic),” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general (western region), IMD, on Twitter.

The air quality also improved marginally on Thursday, though it remained in the ‘poor’ category. An overall air quality index (AQI) — the air quality indicator— of 290 was measured in the city, as compared to Wednesday’s 293 (poor).“Due to calm wind conditions prevailing in Mumbai and the surrounding regions, continental air coming into the region is not getting dispersed. This condition is leading to poor AQI in Mumbai. With current calm weather conditions, local emission with continental pollution is likely to keep AQI in poor-very poor categories for Mumbai in the next two days,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in Mumbai. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.

The bench also continued to provide interim relief to the minister and asked the woman to restrain from posting private pictures and videos with Munde on social media till the mediation process is completed.While accepting the proposal of mediation justice Menon said, “The mediator is requested to fix a preliminary meeting at her earliest convenience.”On Thursday, a bench of justice AK Menon, while hearing Munde’s interim application in a defamation suit filed by him last year against the woman, was informed by the counsels for both the parties that they had decided to refer their disputes for mediation. Munde had sought an order to restrain the woman from posting his private pictures and videos on her social media accounts and thus safeguard his right to privacy. His counsels had informed the court on December 16, 2020, that he apprehended that further materials may be published and hence, sought ex parte (without hearing the other side) protection. While accepting Munde’s contentions, justice Menon passed an interim order of injunction against the woman, restraining her from “distributing or publishing any private photo, private video or private audio-recording of the plaintiff or containing the plaintiff in any print, electronic or social media platform including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or WhatsApp,” till February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-appoints-mediator-for-maharashtra-min-dhananjay-munde-his-ex-partner-to-resolve-disputes-101611946939424.html

Thackeray also inaugurated the Charkop depot, an operation and control centre for the two lines and a receiving substation at the depot; a branding manual, and a common mobility card designed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). The CM said that compared to its predecessor, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is completing works at a faster pace. The driverless-enabled Metro rake that Thackeray unveiled on Friday had earlier been unveiled in Bengaluru by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and Maharashtra’s urban development minister Eknath Shinde, who had visited Bharat Earth Movers Limited’s (BEML) manufacturing unit earlier. Shinde on Friday said, “The two Metros will be operational in the next four months. Work on rest of the lines is also in progress.” The trial runs for the two Metros are expected to begin in March and commercial operations are expected to start from May 2021, officials said. “The coming years are very important for Mumbai. With the Metro network, the coastal road, the Goregaon-Mulund Link Road, the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link and the Samruddhi Corridor, commute in Mumbai will be different,” Thackeray said at the unveiling on Friday. “I am not saying that the previous government did not undertake works, but we are completing works at a faster pace,” he said. Previously, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which led the previous state government, had criticised the MVA government for staying the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) works. Metropolitan commissioner of MMRDA RA Rajeev said this was “the first Make-in-India train” and was at par with international metro trains. He said that 120 kms of metro network will be completed by 2022. At the event held at Charkop depot, seven women train operators and controllers welcomed the dignitaries. HT had earlier reported that Maha Mumbai Metro Operation Corporation Limited (MMMOCL), which will handle the operations of all Metros, has already trained 18 women operators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cm-unveils-first-train-for-metro-2a-7-says-mva-working-faster-than-bjp-101611946878763.html
30-01-2021||Lucknow||'Can't display list of top 10 criminals in public for surveillance purpose': HC||The Allahabad High Court on Friday directed the Uttar Pradesh director general of police (DGP) to forthwith remove the names/identities of top-10 criminals, along with their criminal antecedents, from the flysheet board from all the police stations in the state as the same is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.The court, however, held that there is nothing wrong in preparing a list of top criminals in a district for surveillance.The court directed the Director-General of Police to ensure that a circular in the light of the judgment is sent to all the police heads of the districts to ensure strict compliance with the order.The court held that the action of police officers in disclosing the identity of criminals in police stations in the public gaze is absolutely unwarranted and uncalled for as well as violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.The bench comprising Justices Pankaj Naqvi and Justice Vivek Agarwal passed the order while allowing three petitions filed by Jeeshan alias Jaanu, Balveer Singh Yadav and Doodh Nath Yadav.Also read: ‘Have full confidence’ - PM Netanyahu messages PM Modi after blast near embassyHowever, the court said that the benefit of the judgment will not be given to any “claimed offenders and fugitives in law”.The three petitioners were aggrieved by the publication of their names in the list of top 10 criminals displayed at various police stations in the districts of Prayagraj and Kanpur Nagar.“In the above backdrop, it is apparent that neither socially nor politically it is desirable to curtail human dignity, which is infringed when the names of accused persons are displayed on the flysheet board of the police station concerned or anywhere else without there being any proclamation issued against them under Section 82 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Thus, this practice of putting the names on the flysheet board is derogatory to the concept of human dignity and privacy,” the court stated.The court held that there was nothing wrong in selecting top 10 criminals in a district for surveillance and observed, “The circular of DG, Police, UP dated 6.7.2020, envisaging a criteria to select top-10 criminals in a district and each police station is in exercise of power to maintain surveillance, to which no illegality could be attached. I also hold the circular dated 6.7.2020 to be lawful and valid. However, there is nothing in the circular which enables the police to disclose the identity of an accused and his criminal antecedents in public gaze.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cant-display-list-of-top-10-criminals-in-public-for-surveillance-purpose-hc-101611946501455.html
30-01-2021||Mumbai||Media can’t disclose survivors’ identity even indirectly, says Bombay HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) last week issued additional restraints on print and electronic media to ensure that the identity of rape or child abuse survivors is not disclosed indirectly by publishing details of their parents, address or name of school. Acting in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the mother of a rape survivor from Ahmednagar, the division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar restrained the media from also publishing the names of parents of the survivors, their residential or office addresses, name of the educational institute where the survivor studies, or the survivor’s relationship with the accused, in case they are related. The bench issued the guidelines after noticing that although Section 228 (A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) had provisions to penalise those disclosing the identities of rape survivors directly or indirectly and detailed guidelines were laid down by the Supreme Court (SC) in Nipun Saxena’s case in 2019, the identity of the petitioner was brought before HC. The petitioner had brought newspaper cuttings to HC’s notice to point out how her name and detailed address, along with full particulars of the accused, were given out by local newspapers, while reporting the incident of kidnapping and rape of her daughter in 2011. The petitioner had also pointed out recent newspaper reports regarding an offence registered by Ahmednagar police against an assistant police inspector for raping his sister-in-law. While reporting the incident, the newspapers had given details of the locality and residential address of the accused, revealing the identity of the survivor. The court, therefore, found it necessary to issue further directions to ensure that identities of survivors of rape and child sexual abuse are not indirectly disclosed by anyone, especially the print and electronic media. Besides, the court has also directed the lower courts conducting trials in rape and cases under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, to conceal the name of the survivor, by referring to them with some abbreviations or letters such as “X”, while framing charges, recording statements or evidences of the survivor or of any other witness. “The name, place of residence, age, occupation shall be kept in a sealed cover and in the name column, they can be referred in the same manner described while framing charge, keeping the address column, occupation column blank,” said the bench. It has also directed police to avoid naming rape survivors under the Pocso Act and instead refer to them as “X” in remand reports forwarded to the jurisdictional magistrates or special courts. Section 228A and the Nipun Saxena case Section 228A of IPC prohibits printing or publishing the name or any matter which may reveal the identities of a rape accused and survivor and prescribes punishment of imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years and fine for revealing the identities. The section also forbids printing or publishing any matter relating to the trials in rape cases and prescribes the same punishment for doing so. In Nipun Saxena’s case, the Supreme Court (SC) declared that “no person can print or publish in print, electronic, social media, etc. the name of victims in rape and Pocso Act cases or even in a remote manner disclose any facts which can lead to the victim being identified and which should make their identity known to the public at large.” In the same case, SC has also restrained the police from putting first information reports (FIRs) in rape and Pocso cases in public domain and mask the name of the victims whenever documents relating to these cases are required to be made public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/media-can-t-disclose-survivors-identity-even-indirectly-says-bombay-hc-101611946698556.html

30-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Inching closer to Hindutva, Raj Thackeray to visit Ayodhya in March||Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray seems to be adopting Hindutva hardline to revive his political fortunes as he is set to visit Ayodhya in March. Thackeray will visit the Ram temple in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. This was decided in a party meeting held at Bandra in Mumbai. “Rajsaheb will visit Ayodhya between March 1 and 9 to seek the blessings of Lord Ram. He will also visit the Hanuman temple there. He will be accompanied by his party colleagues,” said senior MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar.After his 2019 electoral debacle where he was able to win just one Assembly seat while his rival and cousin Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray became the chief minister of Maharashtra, Raj Thackeray has taken up the Hindutva hardline and is also becoming close to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A year ago, Thackeray unveiled a saffron flag for his party. Even as the lockdown restrictions were being eased, he advocated for reopening of temples which were closed due to Covid-19 pandemic.“Raj wants to fashion himself as a Hindutva leader and become close to the BJP. Since the current Shiv Sena no longer advocates stringent Hindutva line like its founder Bal Thackeray, Raj wants to fill that vacuum,” said political analyst Hemant Desai. “Even the BJP would like to have Raj at their side as he can split Shiv Sena votes and benefit them,” he added. Desai also pointed out that Raj did not criticise the BJP even in the farmers’ agitation. The Shiv Sena, however, taunted Thackeray saying it was ready to guide him in his visit to Ayodhya. “If Raj Thackeray feels like going to Ayodhya, he should do so. We will guide him,” said Sena MP Sanjay Raut.The Supreme Court in 2019 awarded the disputed site on which the mosque was demolished in 1992 to build Ram Mandir. In August this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had performed the ground-breaking ceremony where the grand temple is being built.After he floated MNS in 2006, Thackeray adopted sons of the soil agenda and launched a violent campaign against north Indians, accusing them of stealing jobs of the locals. His party workers resorted to attacks on north Indian youths appearing for railway recruitment examinations as well as migrant labourers in Mumbai and other parts of the state. He reaped political benefit as the MNS got 13 MLAs in 2009 Assembly elections, but the tally came down to one in 2014 polls. Ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he campaigned against the BJP and bitterly criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but did not see any reversal in his fortunes. However, a year after formation of the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government, he seems to be moving closer to the BJP. BJP leaders have said they are open for alliance, provided Thackeray gives up his opposition to north Indians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-inching-closer-to-hindutva-raj-thackeray-to-visit-ayodhya-in-march-101611946518188.html

Time-bound targets will be given to the officials for completion of the pending work. I have ordered ward offices to levy fine against use of banned plastic materials. We will also be forming a special team at the headquarter level to tackle the issue.”The beautification work in the city will be completed by January 31 with special stress being given to such work in villages and slums.Bangar added, “We will send out a message in the village and slum areas that the garbage should be handed over only after the garbage collection vehicles arrive.

30-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress raises questions over fundraising for Ram temple||The Congress has raised questions over collection of donations for Ram temple in Ayodhya by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), saying there is a possibility of misappropriation of the funds. The BJP, on the other hand, said the Congress should not poke their nose in the issue as the drive has been accepted by the common people.Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that though the donation collection for the Ram temple is being done through Ram Mandir Trust, BJP and RSS workers are collecting donations by going door-to-door and there was a possibility of use of the funds for the party. “In the past, the funds collected have been misused by the organisations related to Sangh parivar. There are many cases of misappropriation registered in various parts of the country. The state government should examine that the funds collected by BJP and RSS reach the trust,” said Sawant.“Nirmohi Akhara, which has been fighting for the Ram temple for the past several years, has accused the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) of pilfering ₹1,400 crore collected for the temple in Ayodhya. The All India Hindu Mahasabha (AIHM) had also accused the VHP of misappropriating ₹1,400 crore and several quintals of gold in 2015,” he said. He added, “Neither has the Sangh Parivar given any reply to the allegations nor has the BJP government investigated it. The AIHM had lodged a complaint with the Prime Minister’s office on August 4, 2017 related to this.” The Congress leader further said that the AIHM has opposed BJP’s fund raising for the temple saying it was just a political and money-making programme.The BJP has alleged that the Congress’s accusation is out of jealousy because of the response to the donation programme. “The fundraising is being done transparently. The receipts are being given to the donors on the spot. Even poor people have been responding to the drive because of the confidence they have in the organisations collecting it,” said BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye. Citing that the Congress’s leadership is out on bail in the National Herald case, he said, “We will not divert the donation collected for Ram temple like funds were diverted to the National Herald.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-raises-questions-over-fundraising-for-ram-temple-101611946338096.html

With ever-evolving lockdown rules and travel restrictions, the focus will be on curating high-quality performances featuring local artistes and concerts by our resident musicians of the SOI Chamber Orchestra,” NCPA chairperson Khushroo N Suntook told HT. “We are prioritising safety with protocols designed in adherence with rules laid down by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. We’ve made sure that all venues, green rooms and washrooms are sanitised and will have temperature checks upon entry, for the safety of audiences.” Meanwhile, the NCPA will continue to engage with audiences through its digital offerings too.

Baroda beat Punjab by 25 runs and will take on Tamil Nadu in the finals on Sunday.Baroda captain Kedar Devdhar and Kartik Kakade stitched a match-winning 93-run partnership to fashion their team’s victory. While Devdhar scored 49-ball 64 runs, Kakade made 53 runs off 41 deliveries.Upon winning the toss, Punjab chose to field. Baroda scored 160 runs for the loss of three wickets. Punjab were sloppy on the field and gave away too many runs. Siddharth Kaul dropped Devdhar’s catch on leg-spinner Mayank Markande’s bowling and Baroda captain made most of it.Punjab lost their in-form openers Abhishek Sharma and Prabhsimran Singh early in the innings. Baroda pacers bowled with speed and great line. Punjab batsmen struggled to go for big shots. Prabhsimran and Anmolpreet Singh made 15 runs each. Gurkeerat Singh’s knock of 39 runs was the only good one in the Punjab batting line-up.The fact that Punjab captain Mandeep Singh injured his shoulder while fielding also dented Punjab’s chances. He came out to bat at number six in pain and scored an unbeaten 41 off 23 balls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/syed-mushtaq-ali-t20-trophy-punjab-lose-to-baroda-in-semis-101611946277502.html
30-01-2021||Mumbai||In race for cleanest city title, Navi Mumbai civic body puts up dustbins, works on feedback||With Swachh Survekshan 2021 barely a few days away, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) is now focussing more on the residents’ feedback section to win the title of the cleanest city in Maharashtra for the sixth consecutive year.From installing dustbins every 200m, and beautifying gardens and roads, to mapping the public toilets in the city, the corporation is going out of its way to impress the residents.Of the total 6,000 marks for the survey, the residents’ feedback section has been allotted 1,800 marks (it was only 1,500 last year). Ever since the government of India started conducting this survey, Navi Mumbai has retained the tag of ‘cleanest city of Maharashtra’. In an effort to give an impressive look to the city, the NMMC is now cleaning and painting the walls and road dividers. They have also replaced broken dustbins with new ones and have ensured that dustbins are placed every 200m. Roads are being swept twice a day in the residential and commercial areas.The NMMC also initiated creek clean-up drives at several places.Babasaheb Rajale, deputy municipal commissioner of NMMC (solid waste management), said, “The central government officials will randomly call residents and ask if the roads are swept in Navi Mumbai properly or if the public toilets can be located on maps, among others. We are doing all this but if the residents are not aware, they will not give positive replies.“NMMC eyes the tag of cleanest city in India, not only in Maharashtra. Last year, Navi Mumbai was declared the third cleanest city in India. And for the past five consecutive years, Navi Mumbai has retained the tag of the cleanest city of Maharashtra.”The NMMC is distributing pamphlets in the housing societies mentioning all the initiatives they are undertaking. “Awareness is also made through public announcements in vehicles and playing a jingle made by Bollywood singer Shankar Mahadevan, the brand ambassador of Swachh Navi Mumbai,” he said.The NMMC has also upgraded nearly 50 gardens and also installed open air gyms in 60 of them. Around 100 gardens in NMMC have composting pit while the defunct toilets and fountains have been repaired.According to Rajale, almost all the housing societies in the city are now segregating dry waste from the wet ones before handing those to the waste collection vehicles. The NMMC stopped collecting waste from those societies that did not segregate during the lockdown as a punitive measure.Certain places in Navi Mumbai fall in the jurisdictions of other agencies such as Cidco and MIDC. The NMMC is also conducting meetings with these agencies to ensure measures from their end.Hemant Sharma, an activist from Vashi, said, “As far as cleanliness is concerned, the NMMC is doing an impressive work. But the scenario may not be the same in slums and gaonthan areas. For example, many of those people are still not segregating their wastes. The NMMC should pay due attention to those areas so that they can achieve the desired results.”Another official from the solid waste management department said, “Our officials are regularly visiting those places and instructing the residents to segregate wastes. Our regular waste collecting vehicles cannot enter certain areas due to narrow roads. Therefore, we have arranged smaller vehicles and handcarts for those areas. The slums and gaonthan areas are also being swept twice a day.”HOW NMMC KEEPS NAVI MUMBAI CLEAN:Fine of ₹200 per flat imposed on a daily basis for not segregating dry waste from wet ones.Door-to-door campaign started so that every household segregates wastes before handing them to society sweepers.Agencies roped in for collecting and disposing of e-wastes in a scientific way. Such wastes collected at public places and disposed of free of cost.Wall-painting drive started to create awareness among the people. Road dividers are cleaned and colourful flowers planted. Parks and gardens modernised. Open air gyms and playing instruments installed in many of them.Dustbins have been installed every 200m even though the government standard is one every 500m.Public toilets cleaned, water connection provided. City roads cleaned twice a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-race-for-cleanest-city-title-navi-mumbai-civic-body-puts-up-dustbins-works-on-feedback-101611946218297.html

This will be possible as the BEST on Friday inaugurated its new command control room (CCR) with intelligent transport management system (ITMS) at its Wadala bus depot. The dedicated BEST bus control system was inaugurated through video conferencing by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Using ITMS, BEST management will be able to keep a track of bus movements through vehicle tracking, bus schedule as well as of drivers and conductors operating the buses. “The control centre will also provide information for passengers coming from outside Mumbai. During the lockdown, BEST buses were used to transport essential services workers. The employees of BEST have contributed the best and Mumbai will be grateful for that,” said Thackeray. The ITMS includes a mobile application which will provide information regarding the buses which will arrive in the next 10 to 15 minutes, capacity of buses and number of buses plying. The management will update and sync the system with its present mobile application ‘BEST pravas’.In addition, information regarding the buses, routes will also be displayed at bus stops along with ETA of buses. The control room will be manned by 16 staffers to monitor buses on a regular basis. “Sixteen staffers will be present in the control room with computers and phones.

30-01-2021||Gurugram||Schools to reopen for students of classes 6-8||Schools across the state will reopen for students in classes 6 to 8 from February 1 — nearly 11 months after they were closed across the country amid Covid-19 outbreak in March last year. Students are required to produce a medical well-being certificate and a parental consent letter for school visits as per the SOP(standard operating procedure) issued by the education department on Friday.In a directive shared with all district education officers on Friday, the directorate of education said that the state government had decided to reopen schools for students in classes 6 to 8, while taking cognisance of the importance of learning and classroom lessons for students. Both government and private schools will be allowed to conduct classes of three-hour duration from 10am till 1.30 pm for students in these classes, as per the directive. Voluntary visits to schools for doubt-clearing sessions were allowed from September, followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. In mid-November, the Haryana government decided to shut schools till November 30, over concerns of a spike in Covid-19 cases among students. Government and private schools reopened on December 14 for students of classes 10 and 12 and on December 21 for classes 9 and 11. Prior to visiting the school, students need to get a basic health check-up done from the nearest primary health centre (PHC) or any other health facility and get a health clearance stating that they do not exhibit any Covid-19 symptoms and are healthy. Students need to produce the health clearance letter before visiting the school. This check-up should have been conducted within 72 hours prior to visiting the school. Along with the health clearance, students need to bring a written proof of parental consent. “The idea behind the health clearance is to ensure that students coming to school do not have a cold, cough or fever and are healthy. Written consent from students will also be sought prior to visits,” said Kalpna Singh, deputy district education officer. The department said that free health check-ups at PHCs and other facilities will be coordinated by the district administration in consultation with the chief medical officer to avoid any inconvenience to students and no tests will be conducted on the school campus. The directive also mentioned that cooked meals will not be provided in schools and the delivery of dry ration to students’ houses will continue for now.Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that the school had received the order pertaining to school reopening on Friday evening and would apprise students about the development. “Students in classes 9 to 12 have been visiting the school regularly for sessions. From February 1, students in 6 to 8 will also join us. We will reach out to all students, inform them about the requirements, and ensure that adequate measures are taken for physical distancing in classes,” said Raghav. Most private schools said that they were likely to continue with online classes for students in these classes. They said that feedback from parents will be taken before arriving at any decision pertaining to school visits. Aparna Erry, principal of the DAV Public School in Sector 14, said that while the school had started calling students in classes 9 to 12 for sessions, online classes were continuing for all other classes. “As always, we will seek feedback from parents. Based on their feedback, we will make a decision. For now, students seem to be comfortable with online classes,” said Erry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/schools-to-reopen-for-students-of-classes-68-101611945737450.html
30-01-2021||Other||AAP reiterates support to protesting farmers, party MPs stage sit-in outside Parliament||New Delhi Three days after protests against the contentious farm laws passed by the Central government turned violent in the city, the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) reiterated their support to the farmers who are demanding that the laws be repealed.Kejriwal on Friday morning deployed deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and urban development minister Satyendar Jain to visit the agitating farmers at Delhi’s borders and ensure, once again, that they get access to water and sanitation facilities.At the same time, a bunch of AAP MPs, led by Sanjay Singh, held a sit-in protest at the Parliament demanding the farm laws be withdrawn. The AAP was also among the opposition parties which boycotted the President’s address in the Parliament on Friday morning over the same issue. Later in the day, Singh also represented the AAP by participating in the Kisan Mahapanchayat rally held in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar area. In his first tweet on the matter ever since violence rocked the Capital on Republic Day (Tuesday), Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Kejriwal on Friday assured farmers that he continues to support their demands, which he said are “justified”.Responding to a tweet from an unverified account, purportedly of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, Kejriwal said in Hindi: “Rakesh ji, we are fully with the farmers. Your demands are valid. It is completely wrong to discredit the farmers’ movement, calling the farmers as traitors and making false cases against the farmer leaders who have been agitating peacefully for so many days.”The number of farmers participating in the sit-in swelled overnight at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border at Ghazipur after a video of an appeal made by Tikait, in which he said he would not leave the venue, went viral.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia who reached Ghazipur at around 11.25am oversaw the arrangements made by the city administration and met Tikait.“Yesterday (Thursday), chief minister Arvind Kejriwal spoke to Tikait, who told him that the UP government had removed all arrangements for water from the Ghazipur protest site. Kejriwal assured him that the Delhi government would get the matter sorted. So, today, mobile toilets have once again been installed here and water facility has also been provided by us,” said Sisodia, while talking to reporters during his visit.He, however, refused to get on the stage where Tikait was seated saying he did not want to mar the sanctity of the ongoing “non-political movement” of the farmers.Welcoming Sisodia, Tikait briefly addressed the protestors and rebutted questions raised by reporters on allowing politicians to participate in their movement.“It is in such tough times that one aandolankari (protester) comes to help another aandolankari. Kejriwal is also an aadolankari and we respect aandolankaaris. They are guests, how can we turn them away,” said Tikait referring to Kejriwal’s life prior to politics as an RTI activist and anti-corruption crusader. Sisodia, who is also a senior AAP leader, reiterated that the AAP stands in support of the farmers. “The farmers who have been giving food to the entire nation are being called traitors. They (farmers) are being abused and called violent. It is for the first time in India’s history that the Sikh community, known for their hardcore nationalism, are being called traitors by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Central government,” he said.The deputy chief minister questioned the BJP-led Central government for not withdrawing the three farm laws till now even as the farmers had been protesting for more than two months against it.“The BJP and the Central government will have to answer what kind of pressure they are facing from a few big private businessmen that they are refusing to hear the voices of crores of farmers and the public in general,” Sisodia said.At Singhu border, minister Satyendar Jain and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha said they have not been allowed by the Delhi Police to station water tankers for the farmers.Chadha is also the co-incharge of AAP’s Punjab unit. Punjab, where AAP is the principal opposition, is scheduled to go to polls in early 2022.On Thursday, Kejriwal had announced that the AAP will fight Assembly elections in six states over the next two years. These include Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.From Singhu, Chadha said, “The BJP government is not letting us set up even the basic facilities for the protesting farmers here. Jain, other AAP MLAs and me are here to provide water facility to the farmers. If there is any specific order by the Central government that water should not be provided to the farmers then they should show us the order. They cannot stop us. Delhi government will ensure that sanitation and water facilities are set up at Singhu border today [Friday].”At the Parliament, the AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and Lok Sabha MP Bhagwant Mann alleged that the party MPs were not being allowed to enter the Parliament.“We have not been allowed entry into the Parliament. They shut the door on us because we were vehemently opposing the three farm laws. The BJP has ensured that only political parties which support their decisions are allowed entry into the Parliament. We will continue our sit-in here outside the door of the Parliament,” said Mann.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-reiterates-support-to-protesting-farmers-party-mps-stage-sit-in-outside-parliament-101611945678586.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Locals march with tricolour in Chandni Chowk amid heavy police presence||A group of people, claiming to be local residents, on Friday afternoon took out a parade in Chandni Chowk holding a big tricolour and shouting slogans against the farmers who are protesting against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws. The protestors, according to local police, did not have permission to carry out the parade, prompting heavy police deployment in the area for about 2-3 hours. “A group of 50-100 people with no masks or social distancing held on to a life-size tricolour and made two rounds starting from the Gauri Shankar mandir to the Town Hall. In their third and last round, they stopped at the fountain. Someone then spread a rumour that the group had entered the gurdwara, prompting heavy police deployment in the area,” said a resident of the area, who did not wish to be named. A senior police official said the group was later dispersed after the DCP and a battery of police personnel in full riot gear carried out a march across the Chandni Chowk area. “The counter protests, followed by the heavy police deployment, led to a lot of confusion and fear among the locals in the area,” said a member of the market association in the area, on condition of anonymity.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said around 10-20 people from Chandni Chowk had gathered with a tricolor for carrying out a march. “We called in adequate number of policemen and the group was dispersed. There was no violence reported. No one was detained or arrested,” Alphonse said.The DCP said sufficient police presence is being maintained in the area to ensure law and order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/locals-march-with-tricolour-in-chandni-chowk-amid-heavy-police-presence-101611945678012.html

The police also released a notice appealing to citizens, including media personnel, to submit videos and any other information related to the Republic Day violence.Senior police officers, who asked not to be named, said the law enforcement agency’s special cell (anti-terror unit), which is probing the alleged conspiracy behind Tuesday’s violence, has issued notices to several farmer leaders and other protesters, including Punjab actor Deep Sidhu and gangster-turned activist Lakha Sidhana.A second police officer, who asked not to be named, said they also visited the protest sites at Delhi’s borders on Friday, but found neither Sidhu nor Sidhana.Apart from the incidents of violence and rioting, the two are being probed on charges of sedition under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for allegedly conspiring to trigger violence in the national capital on Republic Day and “create an international embarrassment for the government on Republic Day,” as per the Delhi Police FIR.Meanwhile, the police have arrested a 22-year-old farmer for robbing a police officer of a wireless set during the tractor rally at Nangloi on Tuesday.“The suspect, Ajay Rathee, robbed the wireless set from a constable deployed in a Vajra van (a special police vehicle) at Nangloi Chowk. We recovered the device and arrested him based on intelligence inputs,” said A Koan, deputy commissioner of police, in a press release.The officer said Rathee, a resident of Rohtak in Haryana, was found to be involved in three previous criminal cases registered in Delhi — one under the Arms Act and two under the Excise Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/forensic-teams-visit-ghazipur-as-part-of-jan-26-violence-probe-101611945677475.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Not deterred by violence, more will join us, say farmer protesters at Singhu||As the dust settled after the violence at Singhu border — where a group of locals claiming to be residents of nearby neighbourhoods clashed with protesters on Friday, leaving at least 15 farmers and five police officers injured — leaders of the agitation said that more protesters will join their stir in the coming days in a press conference.“When there is police protection and the roads are closed, how did the mob manage to reach the stage? Farmers are not scared of blood or bullets. We are farmers who feed the people of this country as well as protect its borders. We send our sons to the border. The ones who tell us about the tricolour should know that it is our sons who come home wrapped in the tricolour,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union. Farmers have also announced that on the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on Saturday, they will observe Sadhbhavna Diwas, along with observing a hunger strike from 9am to 5pm. During a press conference on Friday, farmer leaders also said that more people would be joining the protest in the coming days. Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said, “This is the turning point of our agitation, which has been going on for 65 days. They have shut off the internet so that we can’t share our truths with the country.” President of Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab Darshan Pal, who has been served a notice by Delhi police for the Republic Day violence, said, “Internet should be restored across protest sites, otherwise people will start agitating against this as well. Today, we just saw farmers arriving in Ghazipur. In a couple of days, more protesters will arrive at Tikri, Singhu, and Shahjahanpur border from Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.” The farmer leader added that around 800 trolleys from Mohali and 1,000 vehicles from Ludhiana were already on their way. “There are attempts being made to intimidate or threaten us by incidents like the ones at Ghazipur or Singhu. But these will only cause more anguish among farmers and thousands will join the agitation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/not-deterred-by-violence-more-will-join-us-say-farmer-protesters-atsinghu-101611945619675.html

30-01-2021||Chandigarh||Dog park to come up in Chandigarh’s Sector 42||With more funds in its kitty from the UT administration, the municipal corporation (MC) has revived its plan to create a dog park in the city.The Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC) of the MC on Friday approved the creation of the park within the Mango Park in Sector 42, at an estimated cost of ₹49 lakh, to facilitate pet dogs in the city.Last year in the wake of the pandemic-induced financial crisis, the MC had put the plans for the park on hold. Recently, the administration released ₹172 crore to the MC, promising additional funds in the coming fiscal.The park will come up on 1.5-acre land within the Sector 42-park. It is to be north India’s first dog park, and was mooted by Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore.Pet dog population on the riseAs per the 2019 animal census of the UT animal husbandry and fisheries department, there are around 11,100 pet dogs in Chandigarh, up from 9,800 as per the 2012 census.Figures collected from the MC reveal that it has so far registered around 8,000 pets ever since the bylaws came into force in 2010.Though the city has 1,800 small and big neighbourhood parks, pet dogs are not allowed there. Hence, the dog park was planned as an exclusive park for them.The park’s concept, based on one in Hyderabad, incorporates a number of facilities like a swimming pool and swings meant for pets, equipment to train pets and a veterinary doctor for vaccination, besides a facility for pet dog registration.Depending on the success of the first dog park, the MC will plan more in other sectors of the city.Other projects approved by F&CCA ₹1,627-crore draft budget proposal for 2021-22 has been approved. Capital expenditure will be ₹443 crore and ₹1,184 crore will be under the revenue head.Provision of ATM machines and setting up of a pollution check centre at both MC petrol pump sites in Industrial Area, Phase 2 and Sector 51A.Providing and fixing 50mm thick PCC tiles in passage of EWS Colony near houses 6364 to 6573 in Sector 56, at an estimated cost of ₹44.54 lakh.Amendments in the terms and conditions of the Night Food Street, Sector 14.Regarding the fixation of rent of commercial shops of 13 villages transferred to the MC, the members were of the view that a sub-committee may be constituted to conduct a survey and the final decision may be taken in this regard after their study report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dog-park-to-come-up-in-chandigarh-s-sector-42-101611945560065.html
30-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmer leader Tikait’s emotional appeal leads to fresh mobilisation in Haryana||In a quick turnaround of events, farmers’ mobilisation in Haryana seemed to be heading towards reinvigoration on Friday as the ripples of protesting farmer leader Rakesh Tikait’s emotional outburst continued to be felt across the state. Amid reports of the protests petering out at various places, following incidents of violence in Delhi on Republic Day, Tikait’s emotional speech gave a fresh impetus to the ongoing agitation, especially among the Jat farmers of the state, said protesters. Farmers from the Jat community seemed to be throwing their weight behind Tikait after his breakdown in front of television cameras, where he lashed out at the ruling party and appealed to farmers to not give up. Mintu Ram, a farmer from Bhiwani in Haryana, who recently returned from the protest site at Shahjahanpur after nearly a month, said that fresh mobilisation was taking place in villages in Haryana in support of the ongoing agitation. “We returned from Shahjahanpur ahead of Republic Day. Since then, a lot has happened. There was uncertainty over the last two days but the developments at Ghazipur have changed the sentiments,” said Ram. He said that panchayats and gatherings were taking place in various villages to mobilise people in favour of renewing the agitation. “In nearly 15 villages in my neighbourhood, tractors are going around making announcements, asking people to join forces at protest sites.” He said that the movement was gaining strength since people realised that attempts were being made to crush the agitation and the safety of farmers was under threat. “People from different villages are coming out in large numbers and proceeding towards Ghazipur and other protest sites. I will also return to the Shahjahanpur border. Many people from my village will be heading out to join protests by tomorrow (Saturday),” said Ram. Prempal Singh, a farmer from Daultabad, said that while it temporarily seemed that the movement had suffered a setback after what transpired on Republic Day, the tide was once again turning in favour of farmers. “The farmers from Haryana were not involved in the ruckus that happened on Republic Day. It was a conspiracy by mischievous people who wanted to divide the movement. When Tikait refused to surrender, people realised that they had no reason to fear. They can see that attempts are being made to discredit the protests and are mobilising in support,” said Singh. Deepak Sehrawat, a resident of Dhankot village, said that while people from the Jat community were in support of the farmers’ agitation, the support had increased since Thursday night. “Various WhatsApp groups are buzzing with updates pertaining to the farmers’ agitation and particularly what transpired at Ghazipur. Jats, especially, are more vocal about their support and will mobilise after Tikait’s appeal,” said Sehrawat. He said that the events that unfolded at Ghazipur had given momentum to the protests. Protestors who were earlier camping at various sites said that they were unsure about the protests following the violence that erupted on Republic Day but were motivated by Tikait’s speech. His tears became a spark for the revival of the protests, they said.Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said that farmers of his Khap had vacated the sites on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Sangwari Chowk in Rewari and Masani village near Dharuhera on Thursday morning and had returned to their base camp at Shahjahanpur. “Later we went to our respective villages after calling off the protest but we received calls from BKU leaders requesting for our support and asked us to hold panchayat in this regard in our villages on Friday and to motivate villagers to join the protest again,” he said. There are 50 villages in Rewari belt dominated by Jats who have decided to support Tikait and to scale up the protests at all possible sites. Ramkishan Mahlawat, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Bawal, said that more than 500 villagers from Bawal had joined the protest on Friday evening at Shahjahanpur and more than 500 others — who had gone to Jind in Haryana, where villagers had blocked the Jind-Chandigarh route near Khandela village — were also returning to the base camp. “Our aim is to increase the strength at the Haryana–Rajasthan border and to block the National Highway-48 to create pressure on the government as they are trying to vacate the sites with the help of villagers. However, we will not move an inch from here now,” he said. More than 50 protestors will head towards Rajghat, where they will sit on hunger strike for a day. They have written to Delhi police commissioner seeking permission but haven’t received any reply. Kisan Mahapanchayat leader Rampal Jat, who had announced on Thursday that his organisation would vacate the Shahjahanpur protest site in wake of the Republic Day violence, returned to the site a day after. Jat, along with other prominent leaders of the area, reached Bawal on Friday evening and had decided to support Tikait at Ghazipur on Saturday. “We will follow instructions passed by BKU leader and will guide our farmers accordingly,” he said. Meanwhile, the Rewari Police said that it had increased the police deployment at the Rajasthan-Haryana border again including eight companies of paramilitary forces. Rajesh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Bawal, said, “We had reduced deployment of forces on Thursday but with the return of farmers on the site, we have again deployed teams all day and night. Villagers from Rajasthan have already joined the protest site on Friday.” He added that farmers from different districts of Haryana were also joining in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmer-leader-tikait-s-emotional-appeal-leads-to-fresh-mobilisation-in-haryana-101611945558680.html
30-01-2021||Gurugram||Citizens’ group ask for immediate steps to help locals living near Bandhwari landfill||Members of Citizens for Clean Air — a civil society group — wrote to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Thursday, drawing attention to allegations of groundwater contamination in Bandhwari and nearby villages, about 20 kilometres outside the city. They have requested that some “immediate steps” must be taken in the light of the public health concerns faced by villagers living in the vicinity of the Bandhwari landfill, which is alleged to have polluted the area’s underlying aquifer. “We have to consider the fact that these people were living in an otherwise clean area enjoying the serenity of a village. Their natural habitat got spoiled beyond recovery to accommodate the dirt of the city dwellers — the dumping of mixed solid municipal waste at the landfill site for the past several years. And their environment including their drinking water sources have been destroyed. Already there are reports of higher incidence of cancer and other ailments in these areas,” states the civil society group’s representation to the CPCB.Until these issues are solved, it has been recommended that nearby villages be provided with “adequate supply of piped water of potable standard, as early as possible.” CFCA’s representation also requests that “reports on the groundwater contamination in the area around the Bandhwari Village may be made public and the villagers should be made aware of its deleterious effects on people, domestic animals and their agricultural products so that they could adopt whatever methods possible to reduce these adverse effects.” Shiv Das Meena, chairperson, CPCB — to whom the letter is addressed — could not be reached for comment despite multiple attempts. The letter has also been copied to S Narayan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board(HSPCB), who did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/citizens-group-ask-for-immediate-steps-to-help-locals-living-near-bandhwari-landfill-101611945558093.html
30-01-2021||Gurugram||MCG to sign agreements with NGOs and RWAs conducting plantation drives||To prevent poorly implemented plantation drives, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to sign binding agreements with NGOs and residents’ welfare associations(RWAs), which procure saplings from its four nurseries in the city. Officials in the MCG’s horticulture department said that a formal memorandum of understanding (MoU), which will be made mandatory during the upcoming monsoon season, will ensure the survival of saplings by holding third parties responsible for the same for a period of three years. Devendra Bhadana, executive engineer (horticulture), MCG, said, “Every year, several hundred NGOs and RWAs approach us to give them saplings for monsoon plantation. Over the years, these drives have seen little success. People plant saplings and then forget about it. We have decided that, going forward, groups which take saplings from us in bulk will have to sign an MoU first. This will make them responsible for maintaining the saplings for three years.” Bhadana also added that any group found to be violating these terms of agreement may be debarred from procuring saplings in subsequent years. Officials also said that formalising these transactions would help in surveying plantation work during post-monsoon months. “Right now, this is quite hard because there is no proper record of who has got how many saplings, or where they are planted. We distribute saplings widely because the aim is to plant as much as possible, but we cannot afford any more wastage. We have to become stricter,” said another executive engineer in the MCG’s horticulture department, seeking anonymity. These persisting issues were also identified in a recent audit of plantation drives conducted by the district administration’s Gurujal society, which is responsible for implementing the Centre’s Jal Shakti Abhiyan in Gurugram. A key component of the scheme, in addition to increasing groundwater security, is afforestation. Gurujal’s audit notes that there were multiple loopholes in the MCG’s plantation drives last year, in which a total of 60,800 saplings were planted across the city.These loopholes include “multiple registrations from single RWA”, “non-availability of a proper record of plant distribution” and “no limitation on plant distribution to single entity,” among others, as per Gurujal’s audit report. “Due to these issues, we have only been able to conduct post-plantation surveys for about 17,000 saplings, which were planted by RWAs, where the plants were also geo-tagged. Among these, we found that nearly 87 percent of the saplings survived,” said a spokesperson for Gurujal. Shubhi Kesarwani, programme manager, could not be reached for comment as she is presently overseas. For the remaining 44,000 odd saplings which were distributed to RWAs and NGOs last year, MCG officials said they are yet to conduct a survey to ascertain the survival rate. “We may not be able to carry it out because of lack of data and records. During the next season though, all saplings will be geo-tagged. The Gurujal team will be monitoring the entire process as well,” said Bhadana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-sign-agreements-with-ngos-and-rwas-conducting-plantation-drives-101611945498598.html
30-01-2021||Gurugram||Forest department demolishes 14 illegal structures on Aravalli land||The forest department on Friday carried out a demolition drive in Manesar village against 14 illegal constructions built on Aravalli land. This was done after directions from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in December, ordering that all such establishments built on forest land should be razed by January 31. Department officials said they will be submitting an action taken report before the court next week.Karam Bir Malik, forest range officer (Gurugram), who supervised Friday’s demolition drive, said, “Orders have been given by the court in two cases recently — one filed by plaintiff Sonia Ghosh and the other by Ram Avtar Yadav, the former sarpanch of the Manesar panchayat. In these cases, the NGT has been extremely clear that any illegal construction in Aravalli forests are to be removed. Since these 14 structures were found to be built on gair mumkin pahad land, which is legally a forest land, we had no choice but to carry out demolition.” Officials confirmed that all 14 structures demolished on Friday were razed in totality. “Not just the boundary wall, but the entire structures have been pulled down. Some of the owners were also present at the site, but there was no interference or any other law and order issue,” said Afzal Khan, forest range officer, Sohna, who was also present at Friday’s demolition drive. As per a recent forest department survey, there are at least 100 such farmhouses built illegally on Aravalli land in Gurugram, concentrated in areas like Gwal Pahari, Gairatpur Bas, Sohna and Manesar. Department officials, including district forest officer, Jai Kumar, confirmed that a slew of demolition drives are likely to take place in other parts of the district early next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/forest-department-demolishes-14-illegal-structures-on-aravalli-land-101611945498031.html
30-01-2021||Gurugram||Small vaccine sessions continue, only 372 get Covid jabs||Continuing with the small session sizes for vaccination, the district health department on Friday gave Covid vaccine jabs to 372 health care workers. Out of the 850 scheduled to get the shots for the day, only 43% tuned up for inoculation making it the lowest ever footfall since the vaccination drive started from January 16. On Friday, vaccination took place at 28 session sites, of which Covishield was administered at 24 sites and Covaxin at four sites. The district health department had decided to reduce the number of session sites after having covered almost 59% of the registered health care workers. Over 37,000 health care workers from public and private hospitals, nursing homes and clinics are registered on Co-WIN platform as vaccine beneficiaries. Of them, at least 21,791 had been given the Covid-19 vaccine shots by Friday. Throughout Friday, inoculation for Covaxin remained low, with only 17 health care workers getting the jab from the Bharat biotech manufactured vaccine, against a target of 100. For Covishield, out of 750 people at least 355 reached the vaccination sites.Officials said that on Saturday too, the session size will continue to remain small as teams have been deployed to hold pulse polio drive from January 31 to February 2.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Covid-19 vaccination drive will be on halt till the polio drive gets over. The strategy for Covid-19 vaccine post February 2 is yet to be prepared. It is likely that the session size for vaccination will remain small as the footfall has been declining. Out of 37,000 health care workers, we have already inoculated at least 21,791 workers, which is over 59% of the overall target.”According to Yadav, session sites can be expanded if the inoculation of the other front line workers — like staff from police department, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and revenue department — are included. According to senior officials in the state health department, the process of inoculation of front line workers is likely to commence from February. Dr Ashok Singla, chief medical officer, MCG, said, “A list of 7,000 employees, which includes sanitation workers and firemen, have been prepared for Covid-19 vaccination. The staff had no trouble is getting themselves registered for vaccination, but the actual response will only be seen once their vaccination starts.” Likewise, the revenue department has prepared a list of 400 employees, while the police force estimates that almost 14,000 of its personnel, including other staff members, will be covered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/small-vaccine-sessions-continue-only-372-get-covid-jabs-101611945497502.html

30-01-2021||Gurugram||Ragpicker held for the murder of an auto-rickshaw driver||The police on Thursday night arrested a 33-year-old man from Sector 104 for allegedly murdering an auto-rickshaw driver on January 21 by smashing his head and hiding his body in a tank. The police said the suspect, Suhag Hussain alias Raheem, who hails from Goalpara in Assam, lives in a slum in Dhamwapur in Sector 104 and works as a ragpicker. Last month, he allegedly had an argument with the auto-rickshaw driver, Sonu. He allegedly wanted to take revenge on him and invited Sonu for drinks and dinner near a liquor shop in Sector 33. He then allegedly killed him with sticks and stones and threw the body in a tank in a vacant plot. The police said the murder came to light when passersby reported a foul smell coming from the vacant plot. The locals went to the tank and discovered the body. One of the passersby called the police control room (PCR). A murder case was registered at Sadar police station against unidentified person. The police identified the body and informed his family members on January 23, said officials. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they called in forensic experts, dog squad, and crime team to visit the spot and collect samples. “Samples were taken, pictures were clicked and family members were called in. We scanned all his call details and questioned his friends and family members, following which, we identified the suspect and arrested him based on his call detail records and location,” he said. Sangwan said the deceased lived with his mother in Sector 33. He used to ferry passengers in his auto-rickshaw between Huda City Centre Metro station and Badshahpur. His younger brother Satish (25), who also drives an auto-rickshaw between Subhash Chowk and the same Metro station, had complained to the police after his brother did not return home on the night of the alleged murder, said the police. The family alleged that he had no personal enmity with anyone and had never had any dispute with anyone except for Hussain. “We had no clue that Hussain could be behind the murder as, when he lived in our neighbourhood, he had most of his meals with us at our house. He was my brother’s best friend but after an altercation, he vacated his room and shifted to another area,” said Satish Kumar, the brother of the deceased. The suspect was sent to judicial custody on Friday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ragpicker-held-for-the-murder-of-an-auto-rickshaw-driver-101611945439887.html

Even though capping has been removed, strict adherence to Covid-19 protocol will be maintained,” said Parida.As per the new guidelines, the administration will take all necessary measures to promote Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and ensure wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing. The administration will demarcate containment zones, if required, at micro level, taking into consideration the guidelines prescribed by the ministry of health and family welfare.Badnore appealed to the citizens to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. He also directed the administration to move the Centre to introduce a scheme for providing ₹50 lakh compensation in the event of the death of any employee engaged in Covid duty. Presently, the grant is available only for health employees, and not frontline workers from other departments.Colleges to reopen on February 11During the review meeting, Badnore also announced that colleges will open for physical classes from February 11.Earlier, physical classes had started in November last year for final-year students only. Officials said that details will be announced soon. However, it’s confirmed that online teaching, which has been going on since the lockdown was imposed, will continue. Meanwhile, classroom teaching will resume for Classes 6 to 8 in schools from February 1. However, many private schools are likely to start the classes later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-lifts-curbs-on-social-gatherings-101611945438139.html
30-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administrator for regularising constructions outside lal dora||In response to large scale violations outside the lal dora in villages, the Chandigarh administration is mulling to regularise such illegal construction.In a high-powered meeting, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed senior officials to work on regularisation of such construction. The lal dora (red line) separates village habitation from adjacent agricultural land.A senior UT official privy to the development said, “The administrator stated that since there is a lot of construction outside the lal dora area, the administration should formulate a scheme to regularise these.” UT home secretary Arun Gupta has been asked to prepare a note on the regularisation of such constructions.A detailed discussion on this subject will be held during the meeting of the administrator’s advisory council or its sub-committees. The contentious issue has elicited strong views from supporters and detractors of the plan.Political parties and village residents have been consistently asking for the extension of lal dora and regularisation of constructions outside it. Architects and city’s heritage conservationists are demanding that these illegal constructions should be removed to protect the city’s character.The UT urban planning department too has consistently flagged the large-scale illegal construction and colonisation in villages of Chandigarh. It has repeatedly written to MC commissioner, deputy commissioner-cum-estate officer and land acquisition officer (LAO) to take immediate action to stop illegal construction.In one such letter, highlighting the problem, the urban planning department stated, “Illegal constructions are mushrooming against the notified Chandigarh Master Plan – 2031, which had strongly recommended for planned development of the peri-urban areas of Chandigarh.”The department has also warned of “serious consequences” to allowing such unplanned construction, stating that these will change the character of the planned city.“Most city villages and semi-urban areas, which include Kishangarh-Manimajra, Hallomajra, Maloya, areas around Bapu Dham near Sukhna Choe, Khuda Ali Sher, Kaimbwala, etc have unauthorised constructions, which have taken the form of colonies in recent months with land mafia becoming active,” said a senior UT official, adding, “While earlier, the violators used to just renting out spaces in illegal constructions, recently, sale of smaller plots has also come to light.” Unauthorised construction picked up pace after the city’s villages were transferred to the municipal corporation, said the official.Significantly, the constructions are also in violation of the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952, which is applicable to areas outside a village’s inhabited area.Regularisation scheme for CHBThe administrator directed Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) to examine the demand of residents for one-time regularisation of additional construction on the pattern of Delhi Development Authority. Residents have been long demanding regularisation of construction beyond the original and stipulated CHB regulations. The CHB has also come under criticism for issuing notices against such construction. Recently, local BJP leaders had staged protests outside the CHB office after notices on illegal constructions were issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-administrator-for-regularising-constructions-outside-lal-dora-101611945378031.html
30-01-2021||Kolkata||Bengal IPS officer who arrested BJP workers for 'goli maaro' slogan quits||Humayun Kabir, superintendent of police of Chandannagar in Hooghly district, on Friday resigned from service citing personal reasons, said officials at the state secretariat.Kabir was supposed to retire in April when the assembly polls will be held in Bengal. He recently made headlines by ordering the arrest of three BJP workers who allegedly raised the controversial “Goli maaro” (shoot them) slogan at a rally on January 20. The slogan was heard at a roadshow led by BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari who left the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in December.The ruling party faced criticism because no action was taken against its workers who raised the same slogan in Kolkata a day before the BJP rally at Chandannagar.Last year in January, Union minister Anurag Thakur and his followers raised the slogan during the Shaheen Bagh blockade in south Delhi. It triggered a controversy. The slogan says traitors in the country should be shot.Kabir is only the first Indian Police Service (IPS) officer to resign in Bengal in recent years. He was promoted to the rank of inspector general in December.Since Kabir’s wife Anindita Kabir joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in November last year, his resignation immediately triggered speculations that he may join politics. The officer, however, ruled it out.Also read: Tikri simmers after ‘locals’ demand farmers’ eviction“I resigned because I cannot find time for other work. I am associated with many social welfare organisations. I have no plans to join politics. What my wife did is her decision. All individuals have choices,” Kabir told the local media at Chandannagar.Kabir’s association with several NGOs is well known. The saffron camp targeted him several times in the past. A Rightist organization criticised him in December last year for saying at a non-government programme that he will stand by Muslims during hours of peril.Kabir will be working till January 31. The government on Friday put Gaurav Sharma, joint commissioner of Kolkata Police, in charge of Chandannagar police district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-ips-officer-who-arrested-bjp-workers-for-goli-maaro-slogan-quits-101611944534012.html
30-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC relies on maternal instinct of a woman to convict her daughter’s rapist||Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on January 25 has held that a mother has divine powers to understand her children, confirmed the conviction for rape of a child in conflict with the law. The court held that as the victim who was only four and a half years old at the time of the offence, was unable to explain what the child in conflict with the law, had done to her, the incriminating statement of the mother was sufficient to believe that her daughter was raped. As the convict had been in detention for more than three years, the bench commuted the punishment for the offence of rape from ten years of rigorous imprisonment to five years. Since the convict was a few months shy of turning 21 years of age at the time of passing of the judgement, the court directed that he be sent to a special home for children in conflict with the law and be provided reformative services including educational and skilled development services till he attains the age of 21. A bench of justice Vibha Kankanwadi while hearing an appeal against the conviction of a 20-year-old man by a special court in Jalna for offences punishable under various sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and Indian Penal Code (IPC) for raping a four-and-a-half-year-old in 2017, was informed by advocate RV Gore that the man was 17-years-old and a child in conflict with the law at the time of the offence but was convicted as an adult, hence the appeal was filed seeking reduction of his sentence to be in line with that of a minor. The special court had sentenced the child in conflict with the law to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and to pay fine of ₹10,000 and in case of default undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years for the offence punishable under Section 376(2)(i) read with Section 511 of the Indian Penal Code. Further, he has been sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a term of 10 years and to pay fine of ₹10,000/-, in default of payment of fine, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years for the offence punishable under section 6 read with section 18 of the Pocso Act. The offence had occurred on August 11, 2017, when the child in conflict with the law had induced the minor and her sister with chocolates and taken them to his house which was adjacent to the house of the minors. In his house, he ravished one of the minors. The mother of the two minors was alerted by the cries of the younger daughter and when she knocked on the door of the child in conflict with the law, he opened the door and ran away. The mother then brought the two daughters back home and found the sticky substance on the private part and thighs of the elder daughter. While the daughter was unable to explain exactly what the child in conflict with the law had done to her, she realized that an attempt was made by the accused to rape her daughter. The mother and father of the two minors then complained with the police and the child in conflict with the law came to be arrested and tried and convicted based on the statement of the mother. Gore sought a reduction in the sentence based on the fact that there was no penetrative sexual assault and as the victim merely told her mother that something happened and started crying in pain cannot be the ground for the sentence meted out by the special court.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that the deposition of the minor may have been influenced by the court environment and hence while recording her evidence she may not have given proper answers. The court also held that what the girl could convey to her mother immediately after the incident could not have been conveyed to somebody else and hence the statement of the mother would have a bearing before the special court.“The relationship of a mother and a daughter would always be of confidence and the mother would be having her skill to extract about the things which have happened with her child. It will not be an exaggeration, if it can be observed that the mother has that divine power to understand the feelings like happiness or sorrows of the child and many times, she understands it without being conveyed in words. She understands the mood of the child from his or her appearance and/ or actions also. She can understand the agony that the child undergoes and she would be the first person to offer security to the child. The child also after getting that security would open up and would convey what he or she wanted or went through,” observed the court.While setting aside the conviction under section 6 of Pocso Act, the court said that as the child in conflict with the law had been in detention for three years and as it was a case of attempt to rape it was commuting the conviction under IPC to five years. Further, the court held that as the man was not 21-years-old he should be kept in the Yerwada special home till he attained the age of 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-relies-on-maternal-instinct-of-a-woman-to-convict-her-daughter-s-rapist-101611945258612.html

Today’s protests by so-called locals was a conspiracy by the central government to defame our movement,” Singh said.Kushvinder Singh Mann, another farmer who has come from Bhatinda said locals have no problem with the agitation. “Those who protested against our movement today are connected to the ruling party at the centre. They want to disrupt our movement. We have never caused any inconvenience to any local resident here. We will ensure that no one faces a problem because of us,” Mann said.Sudesh Goyat, a farmer and a member of the Kisan Morcha at Tikri Border, said, “Mahapanchayats (meetings) were organised on Thursday in many Haryana villages where it was decided to carry on the agitation.

30-01-2021||Pune||Shirole proposes recreational centres on tekdis around city||Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole has proposed a small recreation centre on tekdis surrounding the city on the lines of the Van Vihar, created by the forest department in Pachgaon, Parvati. “There are many small hills around Pune city and it is necessary to save these hills to preserve the environment there and thereby to preserve the environment of the city,” said Shirole, MLA and corporator for ward 14 (Deccan Gymkhana – Model Colony). “We have many morning walkers who are regulars to the tekdi and some of them also take care of the trees and animals in the hills. Thus, to help support them, preserve and maintain hills, we have proposed a garden on the lines of Pachgaon, Parvati created by the forest department of the state government. It is necessary to implement a forest project on the hills from Chaturshringi to Symbiosis College,” he said. According to Shirole, minister of state for forests Dattatraya Bharne has approved the project in principle during the recent district planning and development council (DPDC) meeting and said that funds would be sanctioned for it soon. He has also forwarded a letter to the forest department and taken in suggestions from residents and regular tekdi walkers. “We went to meet Shirole to discuss the project. It seems good on paper and we have mentioned that there should be no construction or structure of any kind. Although, it is in nascent stage, we will wait to see what the state minister proposes,” said Madhukar Natu, a tekdi lover who has been planting trees on the Hanuman tekdi for 15 years. The proposed ideas are the enhancement of existing infrastructure, repairs to existing values, PVC tanks, adding infrastructure like an alternate source of water for watering plants, beautification, jogging tracks, stairs at strategic locations to increase accessibility for senior citizens, resting areas around bigger trees, map of the tekdi, regular rounds by forest guards and financial provision for sustaining and maintenance of the forest gardens. According to Shirole, “The Central and state governments have undertaken various initiatives and campaigns to promote the environment. In addition, the hills and the surrounding forests should be given a boost. Strong funds should be provided for this. This project will create a beautiful area among the hills in Pune.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shirole-proposes-recreational-centres-on-tekdis-around-city-101611936497061.html

Hazare announced that he was not going ahead with the proposed strike on Saturday, after meeting former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union Minister of State for Agriculture, Kailash Choudhary, at his native place, Ralegan Siddhi, where both assured the crusader that a committe will look into his demands. Both, Fadnavis and Choudhary, held a marathon discussion with Hazare and assured him that a high power committee will decide on the demands the crusader has put forward. “Today, the agriculture minister handed over a letter about the committee, which will take a call on 15 demands that I have put forward. In the light of the letter, I have decided to put on hold my proposed strike. I am confident, once the government takes a call on these demands, it will positively impact the lives of farmers,” said Hazare, during the press conference. Earlier in the day, Choudhary handed him a letter assuring him of the formation of a committee, and the likely members on it. “After discussing it with Anna, we requested the Centre to announce a high-power committee. As a result of this, the Union Minister of State for Agriculture, Kailash Choudhary, handed Anna a letter and announced that a committee under the chairmanship of Union Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar with other members from NITI Aayog and names recommended by Anna, will be formed,” said Fadnavis.

We are confident that Hazare’s recommendations will help farmers in the future,” said Choudhary. The committee, according to Choudhary, will take a decision on every demand from Hazare. “I am glad that Hazare has agreed to put on hold his agitation,” Choudhary said.

30-01-2021||Pune||Post record Covid cases, no major announcements for health sector in Pune||Though the city was in the grip of Covid-19 for almost a year, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) draft budget for the financial year 2021-22 does not mention any major reforms in the health department. It is the first budget presented by the current commissioner Vikram Kumar who took charge when the city reported record cases of the virus infection. The commissioner did mention about the health policy which would fill in the gaps in the current health budget which is being drafted. After announcing the budget, Vikram Kumar, PMC commissioner said, “A health policy is being prepared to find the gaps in the health system and improve it. Also, through the medical college, a tertiary care centre would also be started. The college will help 100 residents graduate as doctors each year, besides experts pursuing MD (Doctor of Medicine) and MS (Master of Surgery). We will eventually start a nursing college too. So, it will be wrong to say that there is no focus on health. The policy is expected to be prepared by February end.”The budget set aside ₹574.03 crore for the health department of which 223.95 crore is capital provision and revenue provision. Dr Ashish Bharati, PMC health chief said, “The budget allocated for health was around ₹350 crore last year which has been upgraded to ₹570 crore. The health policy is now being drafted and we will decide how to go ahead with this. Due to Covid-19, most of our hospitals were upgraded with ventilators and ICU beds without any planning as per the situation. We spend close to ₹100 crore only on Covid and related infrastructure in 2020-21.” On Friday, although no major announcements were made, the commissioner reiterated that the PMC’s first medical college Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical College would start admitting students in the coming academic year. He said in his budget speech that the first batch would include 100 students. The budget also mentioned that most of the ongoing financial year, 2020-21, was spent in contact tracing, isolation and treatment of Covid patients and preventing the spread of the infection. The budget also mentions the preparations of beds and ventilators for the treatment of patients in case there is a surge in the numbers due to a second wave. The commissioner also focused on the health policy which would play a larger role to reform the health infrastructure of the city. However, since its inception, there has been only one meeting along with the stakeholders in the past two months. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee and who would also be the consultant for the policy, said, “The draft has been prepared and hopefully by next month we will have it ready. Before that we will have a meeting with the civic body and put forward the draft to ensure that all their needs are met. This is just the preliminary draft and so it would not be wise to disclose any information, but the draft is for a longer run and it covers the financial and the HR needs of the health infrastructure right from primary, secondary to tertiary care too. The stakeholders would also be included like private hospitals, NGOs and other professional organisations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/post-record-covid-cases-no-major-announcements-for-pmc-health-sector-101611933676861.html
30-01-2021||Pune||Pune commissioner bats for PPP in civic projects||Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar underscores the need for public-private partnership in development projects in the city. He has proposed major projects like roads, gardens, electric buses, affordable housing, toilet cleaning on public-private partnership (PPP) model in the draft budget for the year 2021-22. “We need to go for more PPP models along with CSR (corporate social responsibility) for various projects in the city. It is clear that no one comes forwards for charity, but look for benefits. We need to take care that while introducing any project on this model, it should benefit citizens and the civic body,” Kumar said. The civic chief proposed to develop a garden at Kharadi on PPP model, and announced the redevelopment of Saras Baug without disturbing heritage structures. The commissioner said, “PMC standing committee had already given nod to develop roads on the PPP model. In the next financial year, PMC would develop some roads on PPP model by issuing the credit note. Due to fund constraint, the civic body is unable to develop all roads at one go. With private developers’ assistance, PMC would develop infrastructure in a timely manner. PMC had allocated ₹200 crore for road development on PPP model in the next financial year.” The commissioner in his budget speech said that PMC is planning to procure electric buses for Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) and is looking at the PPP option also. Special purpose vehicle for river beautification Like Ahmedabad city, PMC has planned to carry out river beautification in the city for 44 km stretch of Mula-Mutha. With PMC general body already given nod for the project, the commissioner said that the river rejuvenation and river beautification projects would get executed at the same time. While PMC has formed special purpose vehicle (SPV) for Smart city, Metro and river beautification, it has appointed a trust for medical college. Commissioner said that all these mechanisms would help for speedy decision and fast execution of projects. The commissioner has proposed 11 percentage hike in property tax, besides planning new scheme for regular taxpayers. Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have opposed the tax hike. Commissioner said, “For last six years, there has been no hike in property tax. We would table the facts and request the standing committee members to approve the tax hike.” Metro likely to be operational by August 2021 The civic chief in his draft budget speech said that the Metro’s commercial operations may start by August 2021.

30-01-2021||Pune||Pune commissioner presents ₹7,650 crore draft budget for 2021-22||Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Friday presented ₹7,650 crore draft budget for the year 2021-22.Though the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) could collect only ₹3,285 crore revenue till January 15 this year, the civic chief has presented an optimistic budget and inflated draft budget from ₹6,229 crore of 2020-21 to ₹7,650 crore for 2021-22.Speaking to the media after presenting the budget, the commissioner said, “The newly merged 23 villages are seeing major developments and will generate record revenue from building permission and property tax department. PMC would get ₹2,356 crore from property tax, ₹1,985 crore as Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation from the state government and ₹1,000 crore from building permission office. Considering all these income sources, it would be wrong to claim that the budget is inflated.”The civic chief said that though development works were hit in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, this year will see a lot of progress in the sector. “PMC would execute river rejuvenation and beautification projects. A total of 44 km river front stretch would be developed and the civic body would soon form a special purpose vehicle to execute the plan,” he said.The municipal commissioner presented the draft budget to Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol and PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne. The standing committee would study the administration’s budget and present the final budget for the year 2021-22.Blaming the civic chief for releasing an inflated budget, civic activist Vivek Velankar said, “The municipal commissioner has neglected the ground reality while preparing the budget. PMC hardly received ₹3,000 crore revenue till now despite its nod to execute the amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters. The final budget amount will further inflate as elected members would also add some components.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-commissioner-presents-rs-7-650-crore-draft-budget-for-202122-101611925156420.html
30-01-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena, Congress fixing began even before assembly polls, alleges BJP leader||Former state minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar has stirred controversy by saying that Shiv Sena and Congress indulged in a 'fixing' for Latur rural constituency during 2019 Assembly polls.Talking to mediapersons in his hometown Latur, Nilangekar said the deal was 'cheating' with the electorate and local people who would not forgive the betrayal. He also alleged that the two parties were working on tacit deals even before the assbly polls which became clear when Shiv Sena ditched BJP and formed government with Congress and NCP later.Also Read: Maharashtra home minister warns of action over post against BJP MP Raksha KhadseThe disclosure by Nilangekar has also put the BJP leadership in state in an embarassing position as it also means BJP took help of local Congress leaders to win an assembly seat.In his interaction with media, Nilangekar alleged that the fixing was done to help Congress' Dhiraj Deshmukh to win from Latur rural constituency in exchange of help by local Congress leaders to ensure victory of BJP candidate Abhimanyu Pawar in Ausa, a traditional Congress seat in the same district.Dhiraj Deshmukh is youngest son of former chief minister late Vilasrao Deshmukh and brother of state medical education minister Amit Deshmukh. Pawar was personal assistant of then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.In 2019 elections, BJP left the Latur rural seat to Shiv Sena as part of the seat sharing pact between the two parties (BJP and Sena contested in an alliance). Shiv Sena fielded a weak candidate making it easier for Dhiraj to win the seat, according to Nilangekar.“We had scored well in the 2014 elections by polling 93000 votes and it was a favorable seat for BJP. Despite it, it was given to Sena as part 'fixing' for a Mumbai seat. Dhiraj Deshmukh won against NOTA option which saw 28000 votes and Sena candidate was thrown to third position,” he said.According to his aides, the adjustment was done for the neighboring Ausa constituency which was held by Congress’s Basavraj Patil for years till then. The leaders say that Congress's local leadership tacitly helped BJP candidate (Pawar) to win Ausa, assumed to be a Congress stronghold.During the 2019 elections there were reports that local Shiv Sena leaders and workers too were upset over their candidate Sachin Deshmukh.The workers had put up posts on social media saying their candidate had gone missing. Sena workers had also stormed the local party office protesting against the candidature. NOTA winning more votes than Sena candidate was believably the anger expressed through the voting machine.BJP sought to play down the allegations.“I think whatever Nilangekar has said has been misquoted by the media. I am sure he is a loyal party leader and would not cross the framework of party discipline. No party leader will resort to any irresponsible statement,” said leader of opposition Pravin Darekar.BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil chose to keep mum on the issue. "I have not heard the statement as yet. I will speak about it after taking information about it," he said.Nilangekar said that to help Congress’s Dhiraj Deshmukh to win, Shiv Sena was hellbent on contesting Latur rural seat though it was with the BJP.Congress leader Amit Deshmukh said Nilangekar should seek clarification from the state BJP leadership on what happened."Shiv Sena and BJP fought the elections in alliance and the candidates were finalised by them. His allegations are to seek attention of the people. He should clarify which BJP leader was involved in the fixing,"Deshmukh sais.Shiv Sena's former MP and leader from Marathwada Chandrakant Khaire said, "The allegations are baseless as Sena fought the election with full fervor. The allegations are out of the old rivalry between Deshmukhs and Nilangekars. As part of the alliance candidate, Sena supported Nilangekar in Nilanga despite our differences with him."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjpleader-accuses-party-shiv-sena-of-seat-fixing-with-congress-in-2019-101611920416919.html
30-01-2021||World||German health minister says country already ordering Covid-19 vaccines for 2022||Germany is ordering vaccines for 2022 in case regular or booster doses are needed to keep the population immune against variants of Covid-19, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Saturday, amid growing frustration in Europe at the slow pace of vaccination.Speaking at an online town hall of healthcare workers, Spahn defended the progress made on procuring and administering vaccines, saying 2.3 million of Germany's 83 million people had already received a dose.European governments have faced criticism over supply and production bottlenecks as vaccine makers AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna have all announced cuts to delivery volumes just as they were expected to ramp up production.Germany - Europe's largest economy - has been crippled by a second lockdown introduced in November, and many in the general public are looking enviously at the faster pace of vaccination in Britain, Israel and the United States."We are now actually ordering further vaccines for 2022, to have at least some on hand," Spahn said. "Nobody knows if we'll need a booster... With production capacities now being extended, we'll order vaccines as a precaution. If we don't need them, good, but if we do then they'll be available."Some of Germany's powerful regional premiers joined the chorus of criticism of the federal government on Saturday, ahead of Monday's meeting of a new vaccination task force that will bring national and regional players around the same table with pharma companies and European Union representatives.Bavarian premier Markus Soeder proposed new rules allowing the state to have more say in directing vaccine supplies to those who need them most."We need an emergency vaccine economy in which the state sets clear rules," he told Die Welt newspaper, calling for authorities to consider authorising Chinese and Russian vaccines for use in Europe.Authorities reported 13,321 new infections in Germany on Saturday and 794 deaths, though the number of cases per 100,000 people over seven days fell by three to 91. The government says the number must be below 50 to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-health-minister-says-country-already-ordering-covid-19-vaccines-for-2022-101612030126591.html

Virus mutations that likely offer some resistance to vaccine and antibody treatments are now prevalent in South Africa and Brazil.The World Bank committed $12 billion to African countries to support vaccination programs, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said. Novartis AG will be able to deliver “substantial amounts” of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s vaccine, its chief executive officer told Schweiz am Wochenende.Key Developments:Read | World Bank commits $12 billion for vaccinations in AfricaItaly cases slowItaly registered a decline in new virus cases on Saturday to 12,715 from 13,574 the previous day as the country prepares to ease virus restrictions from Monday for some regions, including the Rome and Milan areas.

More than 8.37 million people have received their first vaccination.Pakistan to begin receiving vaccinePakistan will receive as much as 17 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine under the Covax arrangement by the end of second quarter this year, the nation’s planning minister Asad Umar said. The South Asian nation got a letter from Covax indicating that the initial delivery of about 6 million doses would start this month, he said in a Twitter message. The nation, with a population of 220 million, plans to start vaccinating its frontline health workers first.NY cases steadyNew York state added 12,804 cases, in line with the recent trend of new infections well below the record of almost 20,000 on Jan. 14.

The country’s national health service has a capacity of about 1,200 intensive-care beds.German minister expresses optimismOne year after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Germany’s health minister is cautiously optimism about the future course of the crisis. “There will not be a second anniversary in this form,” Jens Spahn told newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung in an interview. “Over the course of the year, we will get the pandemic largely under control - through the vaccinations and through the possibility of adapting the vaccine to mutations.”US cases continue to slowThe US added 162,390 cases on Friday, as new infections continue a downward trend, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. This week’s average number of cases is 15% less than the previous one.Deaths were roughly steady, with 3,582 new fatalities registered. That brings this week’s average slightly above last week’s.

Earlier this week, the government said it had signed a deal with Russia for 2 million doses of the Russian vaccine.Astra-EU struggle opens fresh rift in bid to end pandemicA European dispute over supply of Covid-19 vaccines is threatening to unleash a wider political and economic conflict that could stymie global collaboration needed to end the pandemic.After accusing U.K. vaccine maker AstraZeneca of favoring deliveries to its home country, the EU announced a drastic plan to control exports of Covid shots. The retaliatory move may encourage more governments to use economic might -- or other means -- to protect their interests. The bloc is under pressure to speed up an immunization campaign that’s trailing those in Britain and the U.S.Moscow lures vaccine takers with ice creamIf the offer of immunity against Covid-19 isn’t enough to lure shoppers to get a vaccination at a Moscow shopping mall on Red Square, the organizers have sweetened the deal with free ice cream.Even so, there were few takers on a recent snowy afternoon for a city-sponsored Sputnik V injection and anyone looking to receive the free Russian shot could get it without a wait. While shortages, confusion and long lines hinder vaccination roll-outs in many countries, the Russian capital is a rare place faced with oversupply.Japan discovers new type of UK virus strainThree new types of the U.K. coronavirus strain, previously not detected in Japan, were discovered in patients at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, according to a research group studying Covid-19 cases at the hospital.None of the three patients infected with mutations of the U.K. strain had traveled abroad, meaning there is a high possibility that the variants are spreading in Japan, the group said in a statement on Friday. The patients were hospitalized during the period of November through late-December, with two of the three experiencing severe symptoms.Chicago talks with teachers’ union falterChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said no deal has been reached with the teachers’ union over resuming in-person learning even as kindergarten through eighth grade students are scheduled to return to classrooms on Monday.The school district expects teachers to return on Monday when those students have the option to return, Lightfoot said. Preschool and cluster students are also expected to come back.AMLO Says ‘Critical Stage’ of Covid-19 Infection has Passed (11:10 a.m. HK)“I’m appearing here so there are no rumors or misunderstandings,” Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, known as AMLO, said in a video posted online late Friday. “I’m well.”In the video, AMLO walked through the national palace and said he would have to continue resting. He said he’s been following the distribution of vaccines and conditions at hospitals in Mexico, confirming other official remarks that he’s continued to govern while stricken with the virus.J&J’s McClellan says may be enough vaccines for all US adults by June: CNBCThere could be enough vaccinations for the entire U.S. adult population by the summer, Johnson & Johnson board member Mark McClellan said in an interview on CNBC.The US plans to buy 200 million doses from Moderna and Pfizer and the Department of Health and Human Services is boosting its supply to states to at least 10 million does per week, according to CNBC.McClellan said the US should boost the number of shots it administers each day to closer to 3 million.Mexico reports 16,374 New Covid-19 Cases, 1,434 more deathsMexico’s total coronavirus cases rose to 1,841,893, while deaths increased to 156,579, according to data released by the Health Ministry Friday night.The country has administered 662,217 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with 31,397 people receiving a second dose, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said. 13 states are at the highest risk level due to the virus.Separately, Mexico will receive 870,000 AstraZeneca doses from India in February, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in an online video.Virus mutations undercut optimism even as more vaccines emergeEmerging virus variants are forcing drugmakers to develop booster shots for a disease that could remain active for years.Vaccines made by Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. are already in use. Meanwhile, studies show those from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc. pack a punch against early forms of the virus, potentially paving the way for quick authorizations in the US for J&J’s vaccine and in the U.K. for Novavax’s shot.Now the bad news: Mutations that likely confer partial resistance to vaccines and antibody treatments are now prevalent in both South Africa and Brazil, and threatening to spread worldwide. The J&J shot was found in a late-stage trial to be 72% effective in the US, but that fell to 57% in studies done in South Africa. Novavax’s shot, 89% effective in the UK, was only 49% effective in South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-trend-downward-deaths-roughly-steady-virus-update-101612026403300.html
30-01-2021||World||Pakistan opposition to oppose amendment by Imran Khan govt on Senate polls||Pakistan's Opposition parties have decided to oppose the constitutional amendment being introduced by Imran Khan to hold Senate polls through open ballot.Citing sources, Geo News reported that the leaders of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N), Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (JUI-F) discussed the matter after the government announced to introduce a bill in this regard."The Opposition has decided to not let the amendment pass through the parliament and a strategy would be finalised on Monday before the National Assembly session," sources said.According to Geo News report, adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan on Thursday had said that a bill comprising three amendments to the Constitution of Pakistan would be presented in Parliament next week ahead of the upcoming Senate elections.Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan had announced his decision to hold early Senate elections as currently, the Senate is decisively controlled by the constituent parties of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).The federal government invoked the idea of early elections in order to change the power structure in the Senate.However, quashing his decision, the Election Commission of Pakistan said that the Senate elections cannot be held in February, as proposed by Imran Khan, as half of its members will be retiring on March 11.The News International reported the ECP as saying in its five clarifications, "Half of the Senate members will retire on March 11, 2021 after completing their six-year term. According to the Constitution, elections cannot be held 30 days in advance on seats that are vacant after the expiry of the term of the members of the Senate, the ECP said, quoting Article 224(3) of the Constitution. This means elections on vacant Senate seats cannot be held before February 10, 2021. The last four to five Senate elections have been held in the first week of March. This time too, the ECP will announce the date for the Senate elections at a suitable time, according to the law and Constitution, through an election programme. Conducting the Senate elections is the constitutional and legal responsibility of the Election Commission of Pakistan under articles 218 (3) and 224 (3) of the Constitution and Section 107 of the Election Act, 2017."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-to-oppose-amendment-by-imran-khan-govt-on-senate-polls-101612027651048.html
30-01-2021||World||Daniel Pearl case: US presses Pakistan for ‘accountability’||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday pressed his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi to ensure “accountability” for Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been convicted over the killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl.The United Nations has also called for the convicted terrorist to be held accountable.Omar Sheikh is set to be released after Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Thursday upheld his acquittal by a lower court in a verdict that sparked outrage in the United States. A three-judge court, which ruled 2-1 to clear the way for Omar Sheikh’s release, has said it will explain its order at a later date.Blinken and Qureshi spoke for the first time on Friday after the Biden administration took office. They “discussed how to ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Omar Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl”, the state department said in a readout of their call. “The secretary (of state) reinforced US concern about the Pakistani Supreme Court ruling and potential release of these prisoners,” it added.Blinken reinforced this message in a post on Twitter.At the United Nations in New York, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary general, had a similar message for Pakistan. “I don’t have a comment on the specific case. What is important is that there be accountability for those crimes committed,” he told reporters in response to a question about Omar Sheikh’s acquittal.Daniel Pearl, who was South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped and murdered in Karachi in 2002. A video of his beheading was posted online.Omar Sheikh, who is British-born, was arrested and convicted for Pearl’s kidnapping and murder, and was eventually sentenced to death, which was commuted by the Sindh high court in April 2020 to seven years.He had already been in prison for 18 years by that time. His release was delayed as the Sindh state government and Pearl’s family appealed to the Supreme Court.White House press secretary Jen Psaki had earlier expressed “outrage” at the Pakistan Supreme Court’s order on Thursday, and Blinken had separately said the acquittal was an “affront to terrorism victims everywhere”. They had both reaffirmed US preparedness to prosecute Omar Sheikh in America, renewing an offer first made by the Trump administration in December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-case-us-presses-pakistan-for-accountability-101612027581741.html
30-01-2021||World||Iran rejects new participants, negotiations on nuclear deal||Iran's foreign ministry on Saturday rejected any new negotiations or changes to the participants in Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, after French President Emmanuel Macron said any new talks should include Saudi Arabia."The nuclear accord is a multilateral international agreement ratified by UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which is non-negotiable and parties to it are clear and unchangeable," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh was quoted by state media as saying.Iran began breaching the deal's limits on uranium enrichment activity after Washington withdrew from the pact in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump and reimposed economic sanctions on Tehran.President Joe Biden's new administration has said it will rejoin the deal but only after Tehran resumes full compliance with its terms.Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates have said that Gulf Arab states should be involved this time in any talks, which they say should also address Iran's ballistic missile programme and its support for proxies around the Middle East.In his comments on Friday, cited by Al Arabiya television, Macron stressed the need to avoid what he called the mistake of excluding other countries in the region when the 2015 deal was negotiated.Saudi Arabia, which is locked in several proxy wars in the region with Tehran including in Yemen, supported Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran.Macron said any new talks on the nuclear deal with Iran would be very "strict" and that a very short time remained to prevent Tehran from having a nuclear weapon.Khatibzadeh said Macron should "show self-restraint"."If French officials are worried about their huge arms sales to Persian Gulf Arab states, they better reconsider their policies," Khatibzadeh said. "French arms, along with other Western weapons, not only cause the massacre of thousands of Yemenis, but are also the main cause of regional instability."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-rejects-new-participants-negotiations-on-nuclear-deal-101612024600284.html
30-01-2021||World||Journalists sought for personal help by the Covid-19 curious||Calling a hospital to see if a bed was available for a Covid-19 patient isn't part of Houston television news anchor Chauncy Glover's job description. Neither is guiding a viewer online to find a place to be vaccinated.He's done both, and isn't alone. Listeners and readers across the country are reaching out directly to journalists for help during the coronavirus pandemic, and many are responding.“We are now doing more than we bargained for,” Glover said. “We have to be smarter on these topics. We have to know more. For so many people, it may be life or death.”It began for Glover last spring, when he came down with Covid-19 and told his story to KTRK-TV viewers. By phone, email and text, he was peppered with questions after getting back to work: What did it feel like? Should I be worried if I have this symptom? What did you do during quarantine to keep from going crazy?One viewer described symptoms that made Glover suggest he go to the hospital, and the news anchor followed up with calls to find space for him.During the past month, inquiries about how to get vaccinated have become most common. Southern California Public Radio, which has an aggressive community outreach program, had 275 questions about that in a two-day period last week, said Ashley Alvarado, director of community engagement.Listeners have also asked Alvarado's team about unemployment benefits, about whether or not they should cancel a family wedding or if it was illegal to hold a graveside service for a relative who died.A former journalist, Alvarado frequently tips reporters to potential stories based on what her department hears. Similarly, questions that science and medical reporter Lisa Krieger gets are fodder for features and consumer tips published in the Mercury News of San Jose, California, and partner newspapers in the Bay Area News Group.Read | Fresh data show toll South African coronavirus variant takes on vaccine efficacyCC Davidson-Hiers, a reporter for the Tallahassee Democrat in Florida, has lost track of how many requests she's gotten, many from elderly readers who can't navigate online vaccination sign-ups.It's an abrupt turnaround from last year, when her inbox was filled with vitriol from people who called her an alarmist or worthless human being trying to scare people, just because she was writing about Covid-19.Now, she emails links and suggestions to readers who contact her. When she gets calls, she will stay on the line and walk people through the process when they're struggling with the internet.“I absolutely love doing it,” Davidson-Hiers said. “I have to keep an eye on how sustainable it is. It's something we're all facing — the pressure of the pandemic and the stress of it all.”Alvarado has staggered the work hours of people answering calls and similarly guards the mental health of colleagues who hear stories of trauma over and over again.Several of the people Krieger speaks to are simply grateful to hear another human being, instead of speaking to machines and getting calls dropped, or directed to an alienating online experience.Krieger has spent nights and weekends answering messages. She speaks to church groups and her newspaper has set up online seminars. She realizes that her first responsibility is to report and write stories, but said management has supported her efforts to help readers.“This is payback time for us,” she said. “These are readers who are very loyal and they need us. The least we can do is return their calls and emails.”Glover has spent considerable time trying to convince people in Houston's Black community that the vaccines are safe. He's met with hardened skepticism, including people who disparage “Trump's vaccine.” He and colleague Mayra Moreno host televised town hall meetings aimed particularly at Black and Latino residents.Alvarado similarly tries to break down cultural barriers, and sends out a regular text message of coronavirus news to listeners who don't have Internet access.“For me, it's rewarding,” Glover said. “You work so hard to become that voice that people turn to and they trust what you're saying. To me, that's the ultimate goal of a journalist — to be trusted.”Davidson-Hiers generally guides people to help themselves. But on two occasions — once for a person who had no internet and another for someone at a loss for how to use it — she has set up vaccination appointments for readers.In retrospect, she was queasy for ethical reasons. Journalists are trained to observe and report, not to get involved in their stories.There's nothing wrong with doing your best to help people with information, said Kathleen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin. But it's wise to avoid situations where you learn someone's medical records, or make a specific medical appointment or recommendation, she said.What if something goes wrong?“I make sure I stay within my boundaries," Glover said. “I don't think there's anything wrong with helping people navigate a website. I'm not picking people up and taking them to doctors' appointments or driving them to the hospital.”Despite the extra work involved, San Jose's Krieger and many of her colleagues are happy to find another way of connecting their news organizations to the communities they serve.“Over recent years we've been told that journalism is dying and is becoming obsolete," she said. “It's gratifying to be a comfort to readers and provide them with information they literally can't get anywhere else. It's so rewarding and it's why we're in this business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-sought-for-personal-help-by-the-covid-19-curious-101612023983270.html
30-01-2021||World||Black Lives Matter: All you need to know about Nobel Peace Prize nominee||Black Lives Matter, the anti-racism movement that was rejuvenated after the killing of an unarmed Black man by a white US police officer, has been nominated for Nobel Peace Prize. Black Lives Matter announced the news from its Twitter handle, saying people are waking up to their global call for racial justice and an end to white supremacy. “We hold the largest social movement in global history. Today, we have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize,” it tweeted.Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc was founded in 2013 following the acquittal of 17-year-old African-American high school student Trayvon Martin’s murderer. George Zimmerman, a Hispanic American, fatally shot the teenager during an altercation but was acquitted by a court after claiming self-defence, triggering widespread outrage since Martin was unarmed.Last year, George Floyd’s death sparked global outrage after the video footage showed a white police officer pressing his knee against the victim’s neck. Black Lives Matter became a rallying cry which prompted political leaders, top business executives, and other public figures to condemn the police brutality and call for an end to systemic racism. US President Joe Biden, who was then a presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had said that Floyd deserved better, calling for a thorough investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook penned an open letter in which pledged to “do more” to fight racial discrimination and injustice and told the Black community that their “lives matter”. The top executive said that George Floyd’s death is shocking and tragic proof that we must aim far higher than a “normal” future, adding a new future should be built that lives up to the highest ideals of equality and justice.Read | Black, British, forgotten: UK arts retell lost talesBlack Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has also supported the impeachment of former president Donald Trump following the Capitol riots, urging US Senate to convict him. Patrisse Cullors, co-founder and executive director of the foundation, said that Republicans in Congress have “tolerated, and even enabled, his violent and divisive rhetoric for far too long”. “We call on the next administration to further hold Trump and former members of his administration accountable, and take bold action to end white supremacy in the United States,” Cullors had said in a statement.Notably, the foundation on Friday won Sweden's Olof Palme human rights prize for 2020 for promoting "peaceful civil disobedience against police brutality and racial violence" around the world. The organisers said that Black Lives Matter had its great global breakthrough in the summer of 2020 in connection with a number of cases of extreme brutality. It added that around twenty million people have taken part in the Black Lives Matter protests in the US alone.“That the all powerful raised voices of African Americans resonate so strongly also internationally, shows that this in essence is about global threats to human dignity and fundamental human rights: BLACK LIVES MATTER!” they stated.The foundation has its presence in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. According to the Black Lives Matter website, the movement’s mission is to “eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-all-you-need-to-know-about-nobel-peace-prize-nominee-101612022149706.html
30-01-2021||World||Black Lives Matter proposed for Nobel Peace Prize||Black Lives Matter, a movement which became a rallying cry after the killing by US police of an unarmed black man, has been proposed for the Nobel Peace Prize, a Norwegian MP said Saturday.Founded in the United States in 2013, the movement received an impetus in May after George Floyd died. A white policeman had knelt on Floyd's neck for eight minutes ignoring Floyd's pleas that he couldn't breathe.The incident fuelled protests in the United States that sped across the world."This movement has become one of the strongest global movements for working with racial injustice," Petter Eide, a socialist lawmaker who proposed BLM for the Peace Prize, told AFP."They have also been spread to many many countries, building up... awareness on the importance of fighting racial injustice," he said.Tens of thousands of people, including MPs and ministers from all countries, former Nobel laureates and distinguished academics, can propose candidates for the various Nobel prizes.The deadline ends on Sunday.Several other names have been mooted for the Peace Prize including controversial Wikileaks founder and whistleblower Julian Assange, former US president Donald Trump, media rights group RSF and a trio of Belarusian opposition leaders led by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.The Nobel prizes will be announced at the start of October. This year's prize went to the World Food Programme, the UN food agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-proposed-for-nobel-peace-prize-101612017694438.html
30-01-2021||World||Elon Musk plans to use Texas natural gas for his Starships||Elon Musk became the richest man in the world thanks to enthusiasm for Tesla Inc.’s sleek electric cars -- and the company’s stratospheric stock price. But while Musk is perhaps the most well known clean energy CEO, SpaceX, his other company, is likely to rely on drilling for natural gas to power Starship, the new spacecraft and rocket designed to carry humans to the moon, Mars and beyond.Musk’s SpaceX aims to use a site in South Texas to launch rockets to carry people and cargo to the moon and Mars. To do that, the company intends to drill gas wells to make its own fuel and electricity, according a Federal Aviation Administration document seen by Bloomberg.Musk has long derided the oil industry, touting renewable energy and electric vehicles as the keys to averting a climate catastrophe. But the FAA document and SpaceX’s comments to Texas regulators show how, at least in the short term, some of his goals will depend on plans for fossil-fuel extraction that are already drawing criticism from environmental groups.While Musk has said he ultimately aims to extract carbon from the atmosphere to produce fuel, a cost-effective method of doing so hasn’t been developed yet. The billionaire is donating $100 million toward a prize for the “best carbon capture technology.”The SpaceX site in Texas will be supplied by at least five nearby gas wells, along with two gas-fired power plants, according to the FAA document. Purified gas from the wells will be pumped into refrigeration equipment that turns it into liquid methane, the document shows. The methane can be combined with liquid oxygen and other compounds to make rocket fuel.SpaceX didn’t respond to requests for comment. But in a hearing last week with the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas in the state, the company’s lawyers said gas from the wells would be used for “rocket facility operations.”The document seen by Bloomberg appears to be an unfinished draft environmental review, an FAA spokesperson said. A public comment period that ended last week will be used to complete the official draft assessment. Once complete, the draft will be posted to the agency’s website for another round of public comments.The company is also seeking permission from the FAA to add a gas treatment plant and equipment that will turn the methane into its liquid form, and it plans to expand a nearby solar farm and build a desalination plant for water, agency records show.SpaceX originally built the coastal site for its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, which are used to deploy satellites, but never used it for that purpose. The company is now seeking permission to use it as launch site for spacecraft that will carry people and cargo to the moon and mars, FAA records show.Read | Randeep Hothi: The Indian American who sued Elon MuskVertically IntegratedOne potential motivation for SpaceX’s plans to produce gas: vertical integration. Musk is a longtime fan of the strategy, which he’s used to keep control of his companies’ supply chains. By drilling for gas, SpaceX would avoid paying a third party to produce it and pipe it to the launch site.Depending on the liquid-oxygen-to-liquid methane fuel ratios, a single launch would require tens of millions of cubic feet of gas.Even without taking into account the need for gas to fuel SpaceX’s power plants at the Texas site, a minimum of 10 launches a year would require roughly half a billion cubic feet. That would cost roughly $1.37 million, based on current benchmark gas futures that trade in New York.To secure that gas, SpaceX launched a subsidiary named Lone Star Mineral Development in June. The company wasted no time in buying up mineral rights in the area, as well an 806-acre lease originally drilled by Houston-based oil company Sanchez Energy, which rebranded itself as Mesquite Energy after emerging from bankruptcy last year.It’s not clear how much gas Lone Star will be able to extract from the site, however. Cameron County, where the launch site is located, isn’t a prolific source of the fuel. Sanchez’s lease, put into production in 2011, yielded roughly 536 million cubic feet of gas during that first year, Railroad Commission data show. But after that, production continued to sag until the well taken out of service in March 2014.Geology isn’t the only hurdle for SpaceX’s gas-production plans. The company faces legal challenges for a parcel of land that makes up a small corner of the drilling lease. Closely held producer Dallas Petroleum Group LLC says it’s been paying property taxes on two wells there and is asking the Railroad Commission to resolve a dispute over control of the wells with Lone Star. It had previously sued Sanchez over access to the wells, and amended the suit on Friday to add SpaceX and Lone Star as defendants.Lone Star also bought two offshore rigs from drilling contractor Valaris Plc last year. They’ll likely be used as landing pads for SpaceX’s reusable rockets, FAA records show.Read | First private space crew paying $55M each to fly to station on a SpaceX rocketEnvironmental OppositionA coalition of a dozen environmental groups is already raising alarm over SpaceX’s expansion plans. The rocket launch site has gone far beyond the scope of its original permit, and the company’s plans threaten an environmentally sensitive wildlife corridor along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the coalition.At the launch site last year, “there were at least three explosions, some of which resulted in more fires that burned smaller areas” of public lands, EJ Williams, vice president at the American Bird Conservancy, said in an email. “These explosions directly impacted designated critical habitat used by federally listed and other declining species.”More traffic on the highway leading to the launch site has dramatically increased the number of animals killed by vehicles, and road closures for rocket launches have prevented biologists from studying threatened migratory bird species that nest nearby, according to David Newstead, a director of bird conservation projects for the Corpus Christi-based Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program.The FAA originally permitted SpaceX for 12 launches a year and 180 hours of road closures, but Newstead said his group documented more than 1,100 hours of highway closures last year.Because of changes to SpaceX’s plans for the Texas site, environmental groups want the FAA to use a more stringent and transparent process for reviewing the company’s proposals. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requires companies seeking to build new gas pipelines or export terminals to file regular public updates, whereas the FAA doesn’t mandate the same level of disclosure, said Patrick Anderson, chair of the Sierra Club’s Lower Rio Grande Valley chapter.Though SpaceX is seeking permission to produce gas in the near term, the Texas launch site ultimately could further Musk’s zero-carbon ambitions. Gas drilling could potentially be part of gaining longer-term experience with in-situ resource utilization, or ISRU, the practice of generating products with local materials. Although there are no fossil fuels on Mars, those who land there might need to drill for water or minerals.Musk could also use drilling to gain experience in developing carbon dioxide storage wells. SpaceX will likely have to use carbon capture on Mars to make fuels for the trip back home, which makes it crucial to get the technology right.Historically, liquid hydrogen was the fuel of choice for early outer space missions, while a rocket loaded with kerosene and liquid oxygen sent Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins to the Moon.But over the last few years, privately-held space exploration companies such as SpaceX and Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin have adopted and continue to invest in technology allowing them to use liquid methane as a fuel source, said Jim Bridenstine, a former NASA administrator under the Trump administration and now a full-time senior adviser with the Oklahoma City-based aerospace and defense private equity firm Acorn Growth Cos.When mixed with liquid oxygen, liquid methane improves fuel efficiency and gives rockets more thrust to escape Earth’s gravity, Bridenstine said. He views SpaceX drilling for natural gas in Texas as the latest example of Musk applying vertical integration.“Elon Musk believes in vertical integration but he vertically integrates with a purpose, one that reduces risks to improve quality control over technologically sophisticated components, drives down costs and improves access to space,” Bridenstine said. “We’ve seen that over and over again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-plans-to-use-texas-natural-gas-for-his-starships-101612016442939.html
30-01-2021||World||Biden faces calls to secure release of US man in Afghanistan||As the Biden administration considers whether it should pull remaining US troops out of Afghanistan in the coming months, some fear for the fate of an American who could be left behind: an abducted contractor believed held by a Taliban-linked militant group.On the one-year anniversary of Mark Frerichs’ abduction, family members and other supporters are urging the Biden administration not to withdraw additional troops without the Navy veteran being released from captivity. Frerichs was abducted one year ago Sunday while working in the country on engineering projects. US officials believe he is in the custody of the Haqqani network, though the Taliban have not publicly acknowledged holding him.“We are confident that he's still alive and well,” his sister, Charlene Cakora, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “We don't have any thinking that he's dead or that he's injured.”For US diplomats, Frerichs' captivity is a piece of a much larger geopolitical puzzle that aims to balance bringing troops home, after a two-decade conflict, with ensuring regional peace and stability. Biden administration officials have made clear that they are reviewing a February 2020 peace deal between the United States and the Taliban, concerned by whether the Taliban are meeting its commitment to reduce violence in Afghanistan.Read | Biden warns of growing cost of delay on economic aid planThe Trump administration, which had made the release of hostages and detainees a priority, ended without having brought home Frerichs, who is from Lombard, Illinois. He is one of several Americans the Biden administration is inheriting responsibility for, including journalist Austin Tice, who went missing in Syria in 2012, as well as US Marine Trevor Reed and Michigan corporate executive Paul Whelan, both of whom are imprisoned in Russia.It is unclear to what extent, if at all, Frerichs' fate will be complicated by the declining American military presence in Afghanistan committed to by the Trump administration. Days before President Joe Biden took office, the Trump administration announced that it had met its goal of reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan to about 2,500, part of a broader plan to remove all forces by May.The Biden administration must determine how to handle that commitment.New Secretary of State Antony Blinken held his first call Thursday with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and told him the administration was reviewing the peace deal. A State Department description of the conversation did not mention Frerichs. Separately, the Pentagon said the Taliban’s refusal to meet commitments to reduce violence in Afghanistan is raising questions about whether all US troops will be able to leave by May.Frerichs' supporters are concerned that a drawdown of military personnel from Afghanistan leaves the US without the leverage it needs to demand his release.“Further troop withdrawals that are not conditioned upon the release of American hostages will likely make it harder to subsequently secure their release,” the two Democratic senators from Illinois, Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin, wrote Biden in a letter provided to the AP.In an interview, Duckworth said she wrote Biden and Blinken to stress “that this needs to be a priority, that we need to bring him home.” She said Lloyd Austin, the new defense secretary, had given assurances that any negotiations about military presence would include discussion about detainees “as opposed to us just unilaterally pulling out of there.”Representatives of the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, which advocates for hostages, told new national security adviser Jake Sullivan in a conversation during the presidential transition period about concerns that Frerichs and Paul Overby, an American writer who disappeared in Afghanistan in 2014, weren't adequately prioritized during discussions with the Taliban, according to the organization's executive director, Margaux Ewen.The State Department is offering $5 million for information leading to Frerichs' return.“American citizen Mark Frerichs has spent a year in captivity. We will not stop working until we secure his safe return home,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price.Frerichs remains in Afghanistan despite a year of steady diplomatic negotiations, including peace talks in November with then-Secretary of State Pompeo and Taliban and Afghan negotiators. The US and Taliban signed a peace deal last February, but much to the family's frustration, Frerichs' return was not made a predicate for the agreement even though he had been abducted weeks earlier.“I don’t want any troops to start packing up and heading out until Mark gets home safely, because I don't think we really have a leg to stand on once they're all out of there,” Cakora said. “You don’t leave Americans behind, and I just really want to make sure that he’s home safe.”Blinken told reporters Wednesday that the Biden administration wanted to take a detailed look at that deal, saying. “We need to understand exactly what is in the agreement” before deciding how to proceed. He said the administration had asked Trump’s special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, to remain on the job for continuity’s sake.In his call with Ghani the following day, according to the State Department, Blinken expressed “robust diplomatic support” for the peace process but said the US was reviewing the peace deal to assess whether the Taliban were living up to their commitment to “cut ties with terrorist groups.”There were other internal government discussions in the Trump administration.The Taliban had asked for the release of a combatant imprisoned on drug charges in the US as part a broader effort to resolve issues with Afghanistan. The request prompted dialogue between the State Department and the Justice Department about whether such a release could happen, though it ultimately did not, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the private discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity.It is unclear whether those conversations will pick up in the new administration.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-faces-calls-to-secure-release-of-us-man-in-afghanistan-101612016104768.html

The authorities performed 41,435 tests in the last one day. It showed that the positivity rate was 5.25%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-send-special-plane-to-china-to-receive-first-tranche-of-covid-19-vaccine-101612016052635.html
30-01-2021||World||China gene firm providing worldwide Covid-19 tests worked with Chinese military||BGI Group, the world's largest genomics company, has worked with China's military on research that ranges from mass testing for respiratory pathogens to brain science, a Reuters review of research, patent filings and other documents has found.The review, of more than 40 publicly available documents and research papers in Chinese and English, shows BGI’s links to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) include research with China’s top military supercomputing experts. The extent of those links has not previously been reported.BGI has sold millions of Covid-19 test kits outside China since the outbreak of the new coronavirus pandemic, including to Europe, Australia and the United States. Shares of BGI Genomics Co, the company’s subsidiary listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, have doubled in price over the past 12 months, giving it a market value of about $9 billion.But top US security officials have warned American labs against using Chinese tests because of concern China was seeking to gather foreign genetic data for its own research. BGI has denied that.The documents reviewed by Reuters neither contradict nor support that US suspicion. Still, the material shows that the links between the Chinese military and BGI run deeper than previously understood, illustrating how China has moved to integrate private technology companies into military-related research under President Xi Jinping.Read | WHO team visits Wuhan hospital that treated early Covid-19 patientsThe US government has recently been warned by an expert panel that adversary countries and non-state actors might find and target genetic weaknesses in the US population and a competitor such as China could use genetics to augment the strength of its own military personnel.BGI has worked on PLA projects seeking to make members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority less susceptible to altitude sickness, Reuters found, genetic research that would benefit soldiers in some border areas.Elsa Kania, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank, who has provided testimony to U.S. Congressional committees, told Reuters that China’s military has pushed research on brain science, gene editing and the creation of artificial genomes that could have an application in future bioweapons. She added that such weapons are not currently technically feasible.BGI’s pattern of collaboration with the Chinese military was a “reasonable concern to raise” for US officials, said Kania.In response to Reuters’ questions, BGI said it adheres to international standards and Chinese laws related to open science, data sharing and genomic research. It said its collaboration with military researchers was for academic purposes only.“BGI strongly rejects any accusations about links with the PLA, particularly in relation to our Covid-19 test kits,” it said in a statement.China’s defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment.'Enhance' soldier strengthChinese technology companies have come under increasing scrutiny by the United States and were subject to mounting restrictions under the administration of Donald Trump. In November, the Department of Commerce proposed a rule to add gene editing software to the US export control list, saying it could be used to create biological weapons. Officials in the new administration of President Joe Biden have signalled a continued tough approach to what they see as a rising threat from Beijing.A technology industry panel on artificial intelligence, appointed by the US government and chaired by former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt, raised the alarm in October about China’s financial support for its biotechnology sector, its advantages in collecting biological data, and the PLA’s interest in potential military applications.The panel, which will deliver its final report in March, warned about adversaries using artificial intelligence to identify genetic weaknesses in a population and engineering pathogens to exploit them, and genetic research designed to enhance soldiers’ mental or physical strength.The panel recommended that the US government “take a more aggressive public posture regarding BGI,” citing national security risks posed by the company’s links to the Chinese government and its trove of genomic data.The US Department of State did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Reuters’ findings.In response to Reuters’ questions, China’s foreign ministry said the U.S. government had “wantonly misinterpreted and smeared China’s military-civil fusion policy,” and was imposing unreasonable sanctions that would hamper research.“China’s military-civil fusion policy is aimed at effectively mobilizing military and civilian resources, coordinating socio-economic growth and national defense development, and benefiting the public with scientific and technological progress. This policy is above board and beyond reproach,” the ministry said in a statement to Reuters.It added that this was “customary international practice” and said the US government had effectively pursued military-civil fusion for more than 100 years.Read | Chinese national charged with conspiring to export US power technology‘Key projects’BGI Group, based in Shenzhen, has grown quickly by selling genetic sequencing services to universities and health systems around the world and amassing a large DNA databank. It created China’s first cloned pig in 2010.One science paper authored by BGI founders Yang Huanming and Wang Jian along with the PLA’s Key Laboratory of High Altitude Medicine and the Third Military Medical University focused on experiments with the brains of monkeys suffering altitude sickness.The study, published in January 2020, stated that it was funded as one of the “key projects of military science and technology” by the PLA. A decade ago, the military university’s research sought to identify genes related to altitude sickness so the PLA could screen for susceptible soldiers. The latest research focused on how drugs interacting with genes could potentially protect a person from brain injury.An earlier 2017 study designed by BGI’s Wang and published in conjunction with a PLA research centre in Xinjiang looked at the effect of rapid mountain ascent on the bodies of “young, healthy men.”China has the world’s longest highland border, which includes its border with India, where fighting broke out between the two countries' troops in 2020. A 2018 paper by the same PLA laboratory stated that “high altitude disease is the main reason for reduced combat effectiveness and health damage to soldiers at high altitudes and influences the results of war.”Reuters was unable to contact Yang and Wang. BGI said its research collaboration with the PLA lab and the Third Military Medical University, where Yang has been a professor for almost two decades, was “for academic purposes only.”Sequencing CovidBGI jointly holds a dozen patents for tests that screen for genomes linked to disease with the military university, the PLA’s Academy of Military Medical Science, which is the top medical research institute of the PLA, and PLA hospitals.One patent was granted in 2015 to BGI and the Academy of Military Medical Science for a low-cost test kit to detect respiratory pathogens, including SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and coronaviruses.BGI’s current chief infectious disease scientist, Chen Weijun, is listed as an inventor on the patent documents. Chen was among the first scientists to sequence Covid-19, taking samples from a military hospital in Wuhan, according to sequence data later shared internationally.Chen is listed as affiliated with the Academy of Military Medical Science in three science papers reviewed by Reuters.In response to Reuters’ questions, BGI said in a statement that Chen has not been affiliated with the PLA’s Academy of Military Medical Science since 2012. Chen did not respond to a request for comment.BGI’s Covid-19 test kit did not use the method jointly patented with the PLA, the company said in the statement.Four BGI researchers have also been jointly affiliated with another military institution, the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT), according to publicly available science and conference papers reviewed by Reuters. Hunan-based NUDT is under the direct leadership of China’s Central Military Commission, the top-level body that steers the Chinese military and is headed by Xi.The NUDT is on a U.S. blacklist as a threat to national security because its Tianhe-2 supercomputer - one of the world’s most powerful - is used to simulate nuclear explosions, according to a Department of Commerce listing. That listing restricts U.S. companies from supplying NUDT with technology.One researcher, Peng Shaoliang, was instrumental in developing software to speed up BGI’s sequencing of human genomes using supercomputing developed by NUDT.Peng has won military awards for his work. He is a member of an expert group advising the Central Military Commission’s Science and Technology Commission, set up in 2016 when Xi began promoting a strategy to integrate China’s civilian and military research.Patent applications in 2020 show Peng is also a member of the PLA’s Institute of Military Medicine. Liao Xiangke, the head of the NUDT’s supercomputer programme and a major general in the PLA, has published seven scientific papers either co-authored with BGI researchers or crediting them for providing data and source code.BGI said in a statement to Reuters that Peng and Liao “were two collaborators of BGI for the project at the time for the purpose of academic exchange only. Since the project ended BGI has no more affiliation with them.”Peng and Liao did not respond to requests for comment.BGI said it uses Tianhe-2 on a commercial basis, as well as other supercomputing platforms, to speed up research. The papers it wrote with the NUDT were for academic purposes only, it said, and were open for public reference, while the programmes themselves have ended.Tianhe-2 has also been used to solve pharmaceutical, cryptology, engineering and climate problems that have no military application, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-gene-firm-providing-worldwide-covid-19-tests-worked-with-chinese-military-101612013071228.html
30-01-2021||World||Fresh data show toll South African coronavirus variant takes on vaccine efficacy||Clinical trial data on two Covid-19 vaccines show that a coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa is lessening their ability to protect against the illness, underscoring the need to vaccinate vast numbers of people as quickly as possible, scientists said.The vaccines from Novavax Inc and Johnson & Johnson were welcomed as important future weapons in curbing deaths and hospitalizations in a pandemic that has infected more than 101 million people and claimed over 2 million lives worldwide.But they were significantly less effective at preventing Covid-19 in trial participants in South Africa, where the potent new variant is widespread, compared with countries in which this mutation is still rare, according to preliminary data released by the companies."Clearly, the mutants have a diminishing effect on the efficacy of the vaccines," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in a briefing. "We can see that we are going to be challenged."Novavax reported midstage trial results on Thursday that showed its vaccine was 50% effective overall at preventing Covid-19 among people in South Africa.That compared with late-stage results from the United Kingdom, in which the vaccine was up to 89.3% effective at preventing Covid-19.On Friday, J&J said a single shot of its coronavirus vaccine was 66% effective overall in a massive trial across three continents.But there were wide differences by region. In the United States, where the South African variant was first reported this week, efficacy reached 72%, compared with just 57% in South Africa, where the new variant, known as B 1.351, made up 95% of the Covid-19 cases reported in the trial.Another highly transmissible variant first discovered in the UK and now in more than half of US states has been less able to evade vaccine efficacy than its South African counterpart.The new findings, however, raise questions about how highly-effective vaccines from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech, and Moderna Inc will fare against new variants. The two vaccines showed an efficacy of around 95% in trials conducted primarily in the United States before the new virus versions were identified in other countries."It's a different pandemic now," said Dr. Dan Barouch, a researcher at Harvard University Medical School's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who helped develop the J&J vaccine.Barouch said there are now a wide variety of new variants circulating, including in Brazil, South Africa and even the United States, that are substantially resistant to vaccine-induced antibodies.Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said there was "a high possibility" that emerging variants may eventually render the company's vaccine ineffective."This is not the case yet ... but I think it's a very high likelihood that one day that will happen," Bourla said at the World Economic Forum. The drugmaker is considering whether its vaccine needs to be altered to defend against the South African variant.'Stop Hospitals From Going Into Crisis'Experts said that all four vaccines still have great value in their ability to reduce severe Covid-19."The end game is to stop death, to stop hospitals from going into crisis - and all of these vaccines, even including against the South African variant, seem to do that substantially," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health SecurityFor example, J&J's vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa.J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels said he suspects a type of immune system reaction called a T-cell response is playing a protective role and may be helping to prevent severe disease."We knew that to a certain extent, but it's also better and very confirming that we can see that now in the clinic," Stoffels said in an interview.Nevertheless, Fauci said the decreased efficacy rates underscore the need to follow variants closely, and to accelerate vaccination efforts before new, and even more dangerous, mutations arise."The best way to prevent further evolution of a virus is to prevent it from replicating," Fauci said, "and you do that by vaccinating people as quickly as you possibly can."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fresh-data-show-toll-south-african-coronavirus-variant-takes-on-vaccine-efficacy-101612012594816.html
30-01-2021||World||Biden warns of growing cost of delay on economic aid plan||President Joe Biden is warning of a steep and growing “cost of inaction” on his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan as the White House searched for “creative” ways to win public support for a package that is getting a cold shoulder from Senate Republicans.In the age of the coronavirus, it’s not as simple as jumping on a plane to travel the country and try to gin up a groundswell. And at a time of deep polarization, Biden may struggle to convince Republican voters of the urgency when Congress already has approved $4 trillion in aid, including $900 billion last month.Biden signaled on Friday for the first time that he's willing to move ahead without Republicans.“I support passing Covid relief with support from Republicans if we can get it," he told reporters. "But the Covid relief has to pass. No ifs, ands or buts.”His message so far has been that a fresh $1.9 trillion in aid would be a bargain compared to the potential damage to the world's largest economy if it doesn't pass. An aggressive push for vaccinations and generous aid to individuals would help put parents back to work and let children return to school and improve their lifetime earnings, Biden said at a Friday meeting with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in the Oval Office.“We have learned from past crises that the risk is not doing too much,” he said. “The risk is not doing enough.”Read | Biden just linked climate and security, next comes military moneyOnly a week into his presidency, Biden is confronting the challenge of selling his first major piece of legislation to a country he has pledged to unite. Private calls with Republican lawmakers have yet to produce any progress on reaching a deal, while Senate Democrats are now preparing to pass the measure strictly on partisan lines as soon as next week.Some Biden allies have expressed frustration that the administration has not more clearly defined what the massive legislation would actually accomplish. The new president instead has largely focused his first nine days in office on signing executive orders rolling back his predecessor’s policies.In particular, Biden, for whom the widespread distribution of coronavirus vaccines will be a defining test, has not explained what the increased money for testing and vaccination would achieve -- including how much quicker the White House believes it would help bring about an end to the pandemic.Biden's outreach to senators has largely brought criticism that the plan should be more targeted and that the country can afford to wait to see the effects of the stimulus dollars that were approved in December.Republican lawmakers see a need for speeding vaccinations, but one Senate aide said their offices are not being bombarded with calls for an additional aid package. Constituents are more focused on the looming impeachment trial, said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.This has left the Biden team trying to expand its outreach beyond Capitol Hill.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden recognizes the importance of speaking directly to the American people about his plan for vaccinations and supporting the economy, but the pandemic has limited his ability to safely travel to drum up support. The administration is relying on TV interviews by White House officials and allies with local media and national shows like “The View,” as well as calls with governors, local officials and progressive and civic groups.“We’re taking a number of creative steps, a little outside of the box,” Psaki said. “Certainly, his preference would be to get on a plane and fly around the country.”Part of the challenge is that Biden must convince the public how different components of his proposal would work together. His plan allots $400 billion to spearhead a national vaccination program and the reopening of schools. It also includes $1,400 in direct payments to individuals, which critics say should be more targeted. And it includes a raise in the minimum wage to $15 and aid for state and local governments, a nonstarter for most Republicans.Read | Three key issues in Pacific theatre to shape Joe Biden's China policyMany Republicans are under more political pressure from donors and activists back home to rein in spending than to approve more. Some Republicans particularly object to what are still seen by many as bailouts for cash-strapped state and local governments.Some do support a deal, just not what Biden is offering. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a member of a bipartisan group of legislators contacted by the administration, said he supports funds for vaccine distribution and even potentially extra jobless benefits, but he wants a full accounting of what funding remains from previous aid packages.“Unemployment insurance, they think it’s an emergency, well we have unemployment insurance in place until mid March. Where’s the emergency?” Portman said. “Am I against extending it, no I’m not. I think we should, based on some economic factors. But it just doesn’t make sense.”Recent economic reports show the economy is still under severe strain, yet there is also the potential for the strongest growth in more than two decades once the coronavirus is contained.The Commerce Department said Thursday the US economy shrank 3.5% last year, and on Friday it reported that consumer spending — the main driver of growth — had slumped 0.2% in December. But the consumer spending report also suggested that the expanded unemployment benefits from the $900 billion aid package passed that same month had managed to boost incomes.Gregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics, said, "The Covid relief bill of December essentially addressed the past, the dwindling aid at the end of 2020.” Now the administration must sell the public on what lies ahead.He said, “The American Rescue Plan — it’s a plan geared toward the future, bridging the gap between January and September, when people will be able to spend more freely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-warns-of-growing-cost-of-delay-on-economic-aid-plan-101612012474578.html

30-01-2021||World||Strengthening of US-South Korea ties cause concerns in China||The strengthening of ties between the United States and South Korea under President Joe Biden-led administration is raising concerns in China.According to a report by South China Morning Post, in an early sign of a stronger alliance under President Joe Biden's administration, South Korea Defence Minister Suh Wook has announced that the annual spring military exercises with the US would be resumed this year.The drills usually held in March every year by the US and South Korea were either suspended or downsized since 2018 as part of then-President Donald Trump's "effort to maintain a truce he had struck with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un". Meanwhile, in 2020, the drills could not be held due to COVID-19 pandemic.Soon after resuming office, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin in a telephonic conversation with his South Korean counterpart Suh Wook assured Seoul of the US' "ironclad" commitment to defend its long-term ally through joint defence work.Similarly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated "the enduring strength and importance of the alliance between the US and South Korea" to South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha.Blinken further said strong ties between the US and South Korea is necessary as the latter is "the linchpin of peace, security and prosperity for a free and open Indo-Pacific region and across the world".While the ties between the US and South Korea strengthens, China has become more worried as it sees the ties as a "part of a regional coalition to curb its own growing political and military influence".On January 26, in an attempt to woo South Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping called up President Moon Jae-in to show his support to inter-Korea dialogue and talks between the US and North Korea."Although South Korea is economically dependent on China, national security is far more important than economics," SCMP quoted Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based scholar of international relations as saying."South Korea will be closer to the US in the Biden administration because its goal is to maintain peace in East Asia under the US' leadership," Shen added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strengthening-of-us-south-korea-ties-cause-concerns-in-china-101612010628379.html

The new directives aim to attract talents that contribute to our development journey,” he said.The UAE cabinet, local emiri or rulers’ courts and executive councils of the seven emirates will nominate those eligible for citizenship under clear criteria set for each category. The law will allow those provided UAE passports to “keep their existing citizenship”, he added.The changes to the law on nationality and passports, in effect, will allow expatriates to become dual citizens. The UAE has become one of the few countries in West Asia to grant citizenship to expatriates, who form a large chunk of the population in the region.The UAE alone is home to 3.42 million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. Experts also believe the recent normalisation of ties between Israel and the UAE could open up new opportunities for trilateral cooperation with India, which has close relations with both countries.The categories that can qualify to acquire UAE nationality include investors, doctors, specialists, inventors, scientists, talents, intellectuals, artists and their families (spouse and children), according to an official statement.Citizenship will be granted through nominations from the courts of rulers and crown princes, executive councils of the seven emirates, and the cabinet, based on nominations by federal entities.The UAE cabinet introduced the changes in line with an order from President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan with the aim of attracting and retaining individuals with specialised skills.The amendments laid down conditions to be met by each category. For instance, investors must own a property in the UAE.Doctors and specialists must be specialised in a unique scientific discipline or scientific principles that are highly required in the UAE, and have acknowledged scientific contributions, studies and research of scientific value and practical experience of not less than 10 years, in addition to membership of a reputable organisation in the field of specialisation.Scientists must be active researchers at a university, research centre or in the private sector, with practical experience of not less than 10 years.

30-01-2021||World||Daniel Pearl murder: Where does the case now stand amid US pressure||Pakistan’s Supreme Court has reportedly fixed February 1 for the hearing on the Sindh government's petition against the acquittal of all accused involved in the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl. According to Pakistani daily The Express Tribune, the three-judge bench led by Justice Umar Ata Bandial will take up the plea seeking a stay on Sindh high court’s December 24 decision in which the court had declared the detention of the accused illegal.On Thursday, the top court dismissed the appeals against the acquittal and ordered the release of all the accused, which was denounced by Pearl’s family as “a complete travesty of justice.” In a phone call with Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has reinforced the concern about the ruling and potential release of the prisoners. He called on Qureshi to ensure accountability for British-born convicted al Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl. According to the Pakistan Foreign Office, Qureshi “underscored that it was important and in the mutual interest that justice is served through legal means.”In January 2002, Pearl, who headed the South Asia bureau of The Wall Street Journal, was abducted in Karachi while working on a story about terror groups linked to al Qaeda. About a month later, a graphic video of Pearl’s beheading was sent to the US consulate in Karachi, sparking global outrage. Sheikh and three of his aides were arrested and, later, convicted by an anti-terrorism court in Pearl’s kidnapping and murder case.Sheikh was sentenced to death and his aides were sentenced to life in prison. In April 2020, Sindh high court overturned the murder conviction and found Sheikh only guilty of kidnapping the WSJ journalist, commuting Sheikh’s death sentence to seven years of imprisonment and acquitting the three others - Fahad Nasim Ahmed, Syed Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil.The Pakistan Peoples Party-led provincial government of Sindh then challenged the ruling in the Supreme Court and refused to release the four accused. The government kept them in detention under the Maintenance of Public Order for three months and extended it further under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.The provincial government has challenged the December 24 decision, claiming that the release order did not contain detailed reasons. Sindh advocate general Suleman Talibuddin told the court during a hearing on last Monday that one of the observations in the court’s order suggested that the accused persons are not “enemy aliens” within the meaning of Article 10 (9) of the Constitution. “Meaning of this term is hitherto judicially unexplained," Talibuddin said.The court has now fixed the date for the hearing on the Sindh government's plea amid pressure from the United States as well as the United Nations. The bench will examine the legal term "enemy aliens" that needs to be explained in the context of the Daniel Pearl murder case. The Sindh government had claimed that the accused fall in the category of "enemy aliens" and told the apex court that they had placed material as proof on record as justification but the High Court rejected it."Now the Sindh government has requested the bench to pronounce authoritative judgment on the law and facts," read the order-sheet issued by the Justice Bandial bench.(with inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-murder-where-does-the-case-now-stand-amid-us-pressure-101612000526046.html
30-01-2021||World||EU in ‘damage control’ as bloc turns to vaccine export curbs||The European Union’s drastic plan to restrict exports of Covid-19 shots is more of a political ploy as prospects of successfully suing AstraZeneca Plc for reining in supplies of its vaccine appear slim, lawyers and trade experts said.The bloc’s executive arm announced on Friday that vaccine makers including AstraZeneca must obtain prior authorization before sending shots manufactured in the bloc to other countries. The escalation follows a very public dispute with the company triggered by production delays at a Belgian plant.“It’s pure damage control,” says Philip Haellmigk, an attorney in Munich who specializes in trade and customs controls. “This is a reaction to the failure of the EU to order enough vaccines in time” and is now about using “the tool of export control licenses to keep the vaccines in the EU,” he said.The move -- on the same day the EU’s drug regulator cleared the Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford for all adults -- comes as pressure mounts on top EU officials for lagging far behind the U.K. and U.S. in the race to inoculate citizens. The EU had administered just 2.5 doses per 100 people in the bloc, compared with 8.3 in the U.S. and 11.9 in the U.K., according to Bloomberg data.EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis on Friday defended the restrictions, which will run until the end of March and allow EU states to block exports if a set of pre-defined criteria haven’t been met.“The protections and safety of our citizens is a priority and the challenges we now face left us with no choice but to act,” Dombrovskis told reporters in Brussels.The EU further fanned political tensions with the UK Friday by also seeking to limit exports to Northern Ireland before retreating hours later after a backlash over the move. Introducing restrictions between the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU, and Northern Ireland would contravene one of the key principles of the Brexit deal, which sought to avoid border controls after decades of violence over the status of Northern Ireland.The EU’s initial move prompted a rare show of unity from traditional political enemies in Northern Ireland, who uniformly decried the initial decision. Even with the Northern Ireland issue resolved, the bloc’s actions remain hugely controversial and have been criticized by the World Health Organisation, businesses and governments.Export curbs are not a new tool in the European Commission’s arsenal and are typically applied to goods deemed sensitive, including weapons. But they are likely to inflame relations with the UK.It “sets a dangerous precedent,” said Scott Rosenstein, health care adviser at the Eurasia group. “There has always been the expectation that when the supply exceeds the demand that countries who are manufacturing the vaccine will work to make sure that their domestic supply is spoken for. That’s what we’re seeing here.”Three Million DosesMessages left with the AstraZeneca press office were not immediately returned. Pascal Soriot, the company’s chief executive officer, has said that once it got EU approval it would ship at least 3 million doses immediately, with a target of 17 million by February.While the controversial step raises questions about legality, World Trade Organization rules regarding export restrictions have exemptions in the event of critical shortages of essential products or the need to protect human life and health.Far less clear are the chances of EU success in a simmering contractual dispute with AstraZeneca -- even with home advantage in Belgian courts.“What could they claim? Not so much at the moment, if you ask me,” said Christophe Ronse, a healthcare and IP lawyer for Altius in Brussels. “There is not so much they can do, unless they have some smoking gun. It’s an issue of political pressure.”Earlier on Friday, AstraZeneca succumbed to pressure from the commission to disclose its contract with the EU.‘Best Reasonable Efforts’But rather than providing proof that the drugmaker was in breach of the agreement, lawyers said the fine print including the phrase “best reasonable efforts” may give the drugmaker wiggle room to argue it didn’t violate contractual terms.While the contract refers to a “binding allocation” of initial Europe doses, that clause may be undermined by the best reasonable efforts expectation, said Christopher Newdick, a professor of health law at the University of Reading.“What does the word ‘binding’ mean in a general context of best endeavors?” said Newdick. “As so often happens, a problem has arisen which is not squarely addressed and so lawyers need to interpret these clauses in the context of the contract as a whole.”If the EU believed it had such a strong claim, it would have gone to court in Belgium to make an order in its favor, said Steven Barrett at Radcliffe Chambers in London.“By not going down that route, it has chosen a political solution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-in-damage-control-as-bloc-turns-to-vaccine-export-curbs-101612000724089.html
30-01-2021||World||Capitol Police tighten Congress security in era of rising threats||The House's chief law enforcement officer is tightening security for traveling lawmakers as Congress reassesses safety in an era when threats against members were surging even before Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol.Capitol Police officers will be stationed at Washington-area airports and the city's Union Station train depot on busy travel days, the acting House sergeant at arms said in a memo obtained Friday. Timothy P Blodgett said he's set up an online portal so lawmakers can notify the agency about travel plans, and he urged them to coordinate trips with local police and airport officials and report suspicious activity to authorities.Capitol Police “will not be available for personal escorts,” said the email, sent late Thursday. “However, they will be in place to monitor as members move through the airport.” The steps underscored political divisions that grew increasingly acrid, even potentially dangerous, during Trump's invective-filled four years as president.In addition to personal verbal attacks against perceived foes, Trump stirred up supporters with relentless streams of bogus conspiracies like his false charge that Democrats stole November's election from him.The animosity lawmakers face has spread among themselves, with numerous Democrats saying they are wary of GOP colleagues who've said they carry guns in Washington. Republicans have bristled at new screening devices installed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that lawmakers are required to pass through when entering the House chamber, where carrying firearms is not allowed.“The enemy is within the House of Representatives,” Pelosi told reporters this week in a chilling characterization of Congress' internal tensions. She cited "members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress.” In the latest instance of Capitol Hill's spiraling personal hostility, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., tweeted Friday that she was moving her office away from that of fellow freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., “for my team's safety.”Bush wrote that a maskless Greene and her staff “berated me in a hallway,” and wrote later that past Greene tweets have made her feel unsafe.Greene responded with a tweet of her own saying Bush was lying and that “She berated me,” posting video of the exchange. Greene, who has a history of incendiary social media posts, also described Bush, who is Black, as the leader of a “terrorist mob” of Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Greene has drawn fire for past social media posts reported by various news organizations in which she's suggested support for killing Democratic politicians, unfounded QAnon theories and racist views.In an interview on MSNBC, Bush said she shouted “put on a mask” and Greene's team responded by saying “stop inciting violence with Black Lives Matter.” “What does Black Lives Matter have to do with this? Put on a mask and save lives,” Bush said in the interview.Bush is now one of Congress' most progressive members. She has sponsored a measure that could lead to expulsion for lawmakers who — like Greene — backed Trump's unjustified effort to reverse his November election defeat.Congress' 535 members travel frequently between their homes and the capital, and many have said they feel vulnerable in their districts and when they travel. Videos have shown people insulting lawmakers at airports, including Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has criticized Trump.The January 6 Capitol riot “reminds us of the grim reality that members of Congress are high-profile public officials, and therefore face ongoing security threats from the same domestic terror groups that attacked the Capitol,” 32 House members, nearly all Democrats, wrote to congressional leaders this week.Five people died in the attack, including a Capitol Police officer, and the House impeached Trump on a charge of inciting insurrection.The House lawmakers' letter said while 902 threats against members of Congress were investigated in 2016, the number surged to 4,894 cases in 2018 and was tracking upward, according to Capitol Police testimony in 2019.Limited local police resources and social media strewn with personal information and their real-time locations make lawmakers more vulnerable when they are home, their letter said.The House members asked for tightened security procedures. Pelosi told reporters that some steps have already been taken and that she'll likely seek money to bolster safety.Members have been told they can use their office expenses to buy bullet-proof vests, which several have said they are wearing. Blodgett's letter said they can use those accounts for security for themselves and their offices, and said a Federal Election Commission opinion lets them use campaign funds for home security systems.The acting chief of the Capitol Police, Yogananda D. Pittman, said this week that “vast improvements” are needed to protect the Capitol and adjacent office buildings, including permanent fencing.Since January 6, the Capitol has been surrounded by a tall barrier and the grounds are patrolled by National Guard troops. Many lawmakers have long resisted giving the nation's symbol of democracy the look of a besieged compound, and leaders were noncommittal about permanent fencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-tighten-congress-security-in-era-of-rising-threats-101611999978473.html
30-01-2021||World||UN urges countries to repatriate 27,000 children from Syria||The UN counterterrorism chief is urging countries to repatriate the 27,000 children stranded in a massive camp in northeastern Syria, many of them sons and daughters of Islamic State extremists who once controlled large swathes of Iraq and Syria.Vladimir Voronkov told an informal meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday that “the horrific situation of the children in Al Hol (camp) is one of the most pressing issues in the world today.”The 27,000 children “remain stranded, abandoned to their fate,” vulnerable to be preyed on by Islamic State enforcers, “and at risk of radicalization within the camp,” he said.Al Hol, the largest camp for refugees and displaced Syrians in the country, is currently home to almost 62,000 residents, according to UN humanitarian officials. More than 80% are women and children, many who fled there after Islamic State militants lost their last Syrian stronghold in 2019. There are a number of other camps in the northeast as well.Voronkov said there are children from 60 countries in the camps who are the responsibility of their member states, not of Syria or the groups that control the camps. Kurdish fighters are guarding Al-Hol and other camps as well as thousands of Islamic State fighters and boys in prisons.He said a number of countries -- including Russia and Kazakhstan that convened the virtual meeting -- “have collectively repatriated nearly 1,000 children and their family members.”Voronkov said the experiences of the returnees are being compiled “and what we see thus far is that fears of security risks have been unfounded.”The executive director of the UN Counterterrorism Center stressed that children “must be treated primarily as victims” and youngsters under the age of 14 should not be detained or prosecuted.History has shown that children are resilient and can recover from violent experiences if they are supported in reintegrating into communities, Voronkov said.“Every effort should be made to ensure children are not kept in institutions but allowed to reintegrate with family members within their communities,” he said.Virginia Gamba, the U.N special representative for children and armed conflict, told the Security Council that children catalogued as being associated with armed groups including the Islamic State and al-Qaida “are the children who have been left adrift by conflict, like flotsam in the sea.”She echoed Voronkov’s call that they be treated “primarily as victims, not as security threats, and that detention be used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible period.”The mental health, safety and overall development of foreign children held for a long time “in dramatic conditions” in camps in northeast Syria and Iraq “are at stake,” Gamba said.“They’re exposed to further trauma and stigmatization and are at risk because of their proximity to members of designated terrorist groups,” she said.Children have a right to a nationality and identity and must not remain stateless, Gamba stressed.Gamba said the repatriation of foreign children should be prioritized “with the best interest of the child,” and they must be assisted in reintegrating and getting an education, health care and jobs.“They must be given their childhood back in a safe environment where they can build a future away from violence,” Gamba said. “They deserve a chance at life, like any other child.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-urges-countries-to-repatriate-27-000-children-from-syria-101611998639590.html

30-01-2021||World||Antony Blinken dials Pak FM Qureshi, seeks accountability in Daniel Pearl's murder case||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken over phone with Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and discussed the accountability of convicted terrorists responsible for the brutal murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl, according to the State Department.Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the links between the country's powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said on Friday that Blinken reinforced America’s concern over Pakistan Supreme Court’s ruling acquitting Pearl’s killers."Blinken and Qureshi discussed how to ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl,” Price said in a readout of the call.In addition, Blinken and Qureshi discussed the importance of continued US-Pakistan cooperation on the Afghan peace process, support for regional stability, and the potential to expand our trade and commercial ties, Price said.The Pakistan Foreign Office said in a statement that the two leaders discussed “recent developments in the Daniel Pearl case” and Qureshi “underscored that it was important and in the mutual interest that justice is served through legal means.”Qureshi congratulated Secretary Blinken on assuming his office, underscoring Pakistan’s commitment to forging a comprehensive partnership with the United States based on the convergence of interests on a whole range of issues, it said.Qureshi told Blinken that peace in Afghanistan through a negotiated political settlement was one of the fundamental convergences between the two countries.He said it was essential to have a reduction in violence leading to the ceasefire and to work towards securing an inclusive political solution in Afghanistan.Qureshi said Pakistan had facilitated the Afghan peace process and remained committed to working with the United States as a partner for peace, the Foreign Office said.Qureshi and Blinken also agreed to remain engaged and work together on advancing the two countries’ bilateral agenda and promoting common interests in the region and beyond, it said.A day earlier, Blinken expressed concern over the Pakistan Supreme Court’s decision of acquitting those involved in the sensational kidnapping and murder of Pearl and said that the judgement is an affront to terrorism victims everywhere.In a strongly-worded statement, Blinken urged Pakistan to explore all legal options to ensure that the killers of Pearl are brought to justice.“The United States is deeply concerned by the Pakistani Supreme Court’s decision to acquit those involved in Daniel Pearl’s kidnapping and murder and any proposed action to release them,” he said.Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed appeals against the acquittal of British-born al-Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh in the kidnapping and murder case of Pearl and ordered his release, a judgement denounced by the American journalist's family as 'a complete travesty of justice.'Sheikh and his three aides - Fahad Naseem, Sheikh Adil and Salman Saqib - were convicted and sentenced in the abduction and murder case of Pearl in Karachi in 2002.Blinken said: “Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh was indicted in the United States in 2002 for hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking, resulting in the murder of Pearl, the South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal, as well as the 1994 kidnapping of another United States citizen in India”.The court’s decision is an affront to terrorism victims everywhere, including in Pakistan, he said.“We expect the Pakistani government to expeditiously review its legal options to ensure justice is served. We take note of the Attorney General’s statement that he intends to seek review and recall of the decision. We are also prepared to prosecute Sheikh in the United States for his horrific crimes against an American citizen,” Blinken said.The United States is committed to securing justice for Pearl’s family and holding terrorists accountable, he said.Pearl's murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.A three-judge bench of Pakistan Supreme Court led by Justice Mushir Alam on Thursday dismissed the Sindh government's appeal against the Sindh High Court's (SHC) decision to overturn the conviction of Sheikh in the Pearl murder case. The beheading of the American journalist in 2002 had grabbed international headlines.The court ordered that three others, who had been sentenced to life in prison for their part in Pearl's kidnapping and death, also be freed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-dials-pak-fm-qureshi-seeks-accountability-in-daniel-pearl-s-murder-case-101611990173907.html
30-01-2021||World||As Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson weighs future, Donald Trump ties take a toll||After President Donald Trump lost his reelection bid, most Senate Republicans, his Justice Department and the courts dismissed or disputed his baseless claims about a “stolen election." Not Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.The GOP senator used his chairmanship of the Senate Homeland Security Committee to highlight Trump's allegations, claiming millions of Americans “have real, legitimate suspicions that this election was stolen” and worrying about “so many irregularities here.”That sort of fealty to Trump has endeared Johnson to the far-right base in his state, but it could prove costly if he decides to seek a third term in 2022. As Johnson weighs whether to run again, his embrace of Trump's anti-democratic campaign to overturn the election results already has angered some mainstream Republican allies, and is poised to motivate Democrats who have ridden opposition to Trump to new strength in the state.Observers note that Johnson, who rose out of the tea party movement more than a decade ago, has often behaved like a senator from a solidly red state. But November's election demonstrated that Wisconsin, which Democrat Joe Biden won by fewer than 21,000 votes, is anything but. The fight for his seat will be among the most competitive races next year.“I think if the election were a week from now he would be in a world of hurt,” said Fond du Lac County Republican Party Chair Rohn Bishop. Bishop criticized fellow Republicans like Johnson who parroted claims of illegal election activity, even as he remains a Johnson backer. But he notes that Johnson is at risk of losing moderate voters critical to winning."It may hurt him with the suburban voters. ... The election wasn’t stolen, and it’s hard to convince people they should vote for you when you try to throw away their legally cast ballots.”Johnson has long been aligned with Trump's hard-line policies and politics. He led the push to investigate Biden's son Hunter and rarely broke with the White House. Still, some Republicans were surprised to see the senator lend credence to Trump's post-election schemes, which included an attempt to throw out the ballots of 238,000 voters in the majority-Democratic areas of Milwaukee and Madison.Johnson's hearing on Dec. 16 to look into unfounded election fraud complaints largely perpetuated Trump’s baseless claims. And on Jan. 6, just before the U.S. Capitol was stormed, Johnson objected to counting the Electoral College votes from Arizona.The editor of the conservative website Right Wisconsin published a scathing column hours before the riot, saying that Johnson was on a “reckless path” by questioning the integrity of the election and that he should retire and would lose if he ran again.After the riot, Johnson did not vote to object. Still, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wisconsin’s largest newspaper, called for Johnson to resign for “stoking an insurrection.”Johnson responded with a column in the newspaper calling the editorial “unhinged and uninformed.” The Journal Sentinel took the rare step of annotating his response, providing 19 footnotes with additional context, fact checking and corrections.The Wisconsin State Journal, the state's second largest newspaper, has also called for Johnson's resignation, and the anti-Trump Republicans behind the The Lincoln Project have targeted Johnson for defeat, citing his support for election conspiracy theories and comparing him with disgraced former Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Joe McCarthy.Johnson remains popular with the GOP grassroots, a key factor as he mulls whether to run again, said GOP strategist Brian Reisinger, who worked on Johnson’s 2016 campaign. He noted that Johnson has been able to overcome naysayers who didn’t give him much of a chance of winning, first against then-incumbent U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold in 2010 and again in a 2016 rematch.“There’s a lot of people who look at Ron Johnson, and they see the political durability that he’s had over the years despite being a dead man walking twice before,” Reisinger said.Johnson in 2016 pledged not to seek a third term, but backed off three years later, saying he wanted to see how the 2020 election turned out. He has also said he's considering running for governor in 2022.Johnson, 65, has said in recent weeks that he has not yet made a decision.“My bias has always been (to serve) two terms and go home,” Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last month before Democrats won a pair of Georgia runoff elections to take majority control of the Senate. “That continues to be my preference, but at the same time, the Senate is kind of a firewall against total control by Democrats, which would be, I think, a very bad thing for this country.”Johnson and his spokesperson Ben Voelkel declined to comment on his plans.Republicans already have three Senate vacancies to defend. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio have said they will not run again in 2022. GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who turns 89 in 2022, is also on the ballot, and two-term Missouri Republican Roy Blunt has not said whether he’ll seek a third.If Johnson retires, it likely would be a free-for-all on both sides.A number of Republicans are eyeing a run for either Senate or governor, depending on what Johnson does. Potential Republican Senate candidates include U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, former U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy and Kevin Nicholson, who lost a 2018 Republican Senate primary.The list of Democratic hopefuls includes Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, the state’s first Black lieutenant governor, state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and state Sen. Chris Larson of Milwaukee.Alex Lasry, the senior vice president to the Milwaukee Bucks who helped spearhead the successful effort to get the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee before the coronavirus sent the event nearly entirely online, is also considering a run. Lasry is the son of billionaire hedge fund manager and Democratic bundler Marc Lasry and could potentially self-finance his run.Another potential candidate is Steven Olikara, founder and chief executive of the nonprofit Millennial Action Project. Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson has already declared his candidacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-wisconsin-senator-ron-johnson-weighs-future-donald-trump-ties-take-a-toll-101611990985551.html

30-01-2021||World||Scientists develop new tool that may help reduce spread of Covid-19||Scientists have engineered a new tool which exposes aerosolised virus particles to microwaves in a controlled manner, an advance that may lead to the development of novel methods to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, studies have found that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spreads via aerosols that can be generated and spread through breathing, coughing, sneezing, or talking by infected individuals.While previous studies have explored the use of electromagnetic energy to deactivate viruses in bulk fluids, the researchers, including those from the Air Force Research Laboratory in the US, said less work has been done to understand the role of microwaves in inactivating viral pathogens in aerosols.In the current research, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, the scientists developed experimental tools capable of presenting electromagnetic waves to an aerosol mixture containing viruses.Also read| Can a fake commute help you reclaim your day?They said the apparatus offers the ability to vary power, energy, and frequency of the electromagnetic exposure.With further research, the scientists hope to better characterise the threshold levels of microwave energy needed to inactivate aerosolised viral particles and reduce their ability to spread infection.They believe the new experimental design can provide the means to identify a wide variety of virus inactivation mechanisms.According to the researchers, the systems are designed to prevent the release of microwaves into the work environment since at high levels the radiation could potentially interfere with diagnostic equipment and other electronics.They plan to expose coronavirus surrogate -- bovine coronavirus -- to microwaves at frequencies ranging from 2.8 gigahertz to 7.5 gigahertz (GHz).In comparison, commercial microwave ovens operate at around 2.45 GHz.Explaining, the need for the surrogate virus, Brad Hoff, a co-author of the study from the Air Force Research Laboratory, said the bovine coronavirus is "similar in size and configuration to human coronavirus, but is safe to humans.""If shown to be effective, the use of microwaves may enable the potential for rapid decontamination not currently addressed by ultraviolet light or chemical cleaning for highly cluttered areas, while potentially operating at levels safely compatible with human occupancy," Hoff added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-develop-new-tool-that-may-help-reduce-spread-of-covid19-101611986852861.html

The City of Davis had however voted to go ahead with the installation. Since then OFMI had launched a campaign to remove the Gandhi statue.Indian-Americans have expressed deep anguish and shock at the incident.“An atmosphere of hatred was being created by many anti-India and hinduphobic radical organisations like OFMI and other Khalistani separatists for many years now,” said Guarang Desai of Friends of India Society International (FISI).“They have not only run hate campaigns against Indian icons but have been at the forefront of attempts to push hinduphobia and erase India from California school textbooks,” Desai said.In 2016, the OFMI was part of a campaign to remove the mentions of 'India' from the sixth and seventh grade California school textbooks and replace them with ‘South Asia’. After massive protests from parents and students, the California Department of Education had dropped the controversial changes.Appalled at the desecration, the Hindu American Foundation (HAF) has demanded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigate the incident as a hate crime.“We condemn this cowardly desecration and call upon the Department of Homeland Security and FBI to investigate this hate crime, as it was likely done with the intention of intimidating the Indian American community,” said HAF California Advocacy Director Easan Katir, a former member of the Davis Business and Finance Commission.“We urge local police to apprehend the perpetrators and call upon the city council to resurrect the statue as a statement that such destructive acts are not in harmony with our community standards,” Katir said.“Make no mistake” HAF said in a tweet “this is not about legacy of Gandhi as a person, but about intimating India and Indian Americans.”.The vandalism was praised on Twitter by a pro-Khalistan group in California, who shared photos of the destroyed statue, and others who stated “Today is a good day.”This is not the first time a statue of Gandhi has been desecrated. In December 2020, Khalistani-supporters had desecrated a Mahatma Gandhi statue in Washington, DC in front of the Indian Embassy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mahatma-gandhi-statue-vandalised-in-us-101611984557291.html
30-01-2021||World||WHO team visits Wuhan hospital that treated early Covid-19 patients||Members of a World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic visited another Wuhan hospital that had treated early Covid-19 patients on their second full day of work on Saturday.Jinyantan Hospital was one of the city’s first to deal with patients in early 2020 suffering from a then-unknown virus and is a key part of the epidemiological history of the disease.The team’s first face-to-face meetings with Chinese scientists took place on Friday, before the experts who specialize in animal health, virology, food safety, and epidemiology visited another early site of the outbreak, the Hubei Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital.The Geneva-based WHO said late Thursday on Twitter that its team plans to visit hospitals, markets like the Huanan Seafood Market that was linked to many of the first cases, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and laboratories at facilities including the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.“All hypotheses are on the table as the team follows the science in their work to understand the origins of the Covid-19 virus,” WHO tweeted. It said the team had already requested “detailed underlying data” and planned to speak with early responders and some of the first patients.The mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the virus’s origins. Pinning down an outbreak’s animal reservoir is typically an exhaustive endeavour that takes years of research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis, and epidemiological studies.One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan. The Chinese government has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.A possible focus for investigators is the Wuhan Institute of Virology. One of China’s top virus research labs, it built an archive of genetic information about bat coronaviruses after the 2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-visits-wuhan-hospital-that-treated-first-covid-19-patients-101611983511693.html
30-01-2021||World||There should be accountability for crimes like Daniel Pearl's murder, says UN||Expressing concern over the acquittal of those involved in the brutal murder of Daniel Pearl in 2002, a senior UN official representing Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said it is important that there is accountability for such crimes.Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, had visited Pakistan to report on Islamist militant networks in the country and on the links between the country's powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda following the September 11, 2001 terror strikes. He was kidnapped in Karachi, the capital of Sindh, and beheaded days later.Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed appeals against the acquittal of British-born al-Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Sheikh in the kidnapping and murder case of Pearl and ordered his release, a judgement denounced by the American journalist's family as "a complete travesty of justice."Also Read| US State Secy speaks with Pak counterpart, discusses Daniel Pearl murder caseThe apex court cleared Sheikh and his three Pakistani accomplices in the case of all the charges, ordering that Sheikh and others be immediately freed from jail.Responding to a question on Sheikh’s acquittal, Spokesman for the UN chief Stephane Dujarric said on Friday: "What is important that there be accountability for those crimes committed”.Pearl's murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.In April 2020, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh to seven years imprisonment. The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case - almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.The Sindh government and family of Pearl filed petitions in the apex court, challenging the high court verdict.The US has been mounting pressure on Pakistan, demanding justice for Pearl.Last month, the US said it was ready to take custody of Sheikh, asserting that Washington will not allow him to evade justice.Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson said the US was deeply concerned by the ruling affirming the acquittal of individuals convicted by a Pakistani trial court.Also Read| US must take a call on terror-haven Pakistan"The release of those involved would be an affront to Daniel Pearl’s family, to other terrorism victims around the world, and to the cause of justice,” Wilkinson said.In a tweet, Congressman Brad Sherman said: “The killers of Daniel Pearl go free. And Dr. Afridi, who helped the US get Osama Bin Laden, rots in jail.”"We are deeply disappointed that Pakistan’s Supreme Court has acquitted and ordered the release of Ahmad Saeed Omar Sheikh, despite overwhelming evidence of Sheikh’s involvement in the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl, which led directly to his murder," said Steven Butler, Committee to Protect Journalist’s Asia programme coordinator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-should-be-accountability-for-crimes-like-daniel-pearl-s-murder-says-un-101611983946432.html
30-01-2021||World||US airstrike in Iraq kills top Islamic State leader, says report||The US-led military coalition killed the top Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader in Iraq at Kirkuk on Wednesday in an airstrike, reported The Hill.Jabbar Salman Ali Farhan al-Issawi, 43, known as Abu Yasser, was killed in a joint mission of US and Iraqi forces, informed the coalition on Friday.He was believed to have coordinated ISIS's operations in Iraq and relayed guidance to the group's fighters across the country reported The Hill.The airstrike was conducted to check the resurging terror campaign after a double-suicide bombing in Baghdad this month.His "death is another significant blow to Daesh (ISIS) resurgence efforts in Iraq," said coalition spokesman Wayne Marotto, referring to the group by its Arabic acronym.Earlier, ISIS had claimed responsibility for the double-suicide bombing that killed 32 people in Baghdad last week, the deadliest strike to hit the Iraqi capital in four years."The Coalition will continue to remove key leaders from the battlefield and degrade the terrorist organization. Terrorists-you will never live in peace- you will be pursued to the ends of the earth," said Col Wayne Marotto, Spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR)."We promised and fulfilled. I gave my word to pursue Daesh terrorists; we gave them a thundering response. Our heroic armed forces have eliminated Daesh commander Abu Yaser Al-Issawi as part of an intelligence-led operation," added Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi.ISIS or Daesh, a self-appointed Caliphate as defenders of Muslims everywhere, once controlled about a third of Iraqi territory at its height and had declared the city of Mosul to be the capital of its "Caliphate", reported The Hill.The terror group's self-declared Caliphate was defeated by a US-led coalition at Baghuz in March 2019. However, it remains a potent force in the region.Coalition forces are still fighting against ISIS soldiers in Iraq, though the whereabouts of the group's top leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, are still unknown. Al-Qurayshi was named ISIS's caliph following the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a US-led raid in Baghuz in Syria in 2019, reported The Hill.The US still has about 2,500 troops left on three Iraqi military bases, though questions regarding how strong of a force is needed to keep ISIS at bay has complicated plans for a full withdrawal, reported The Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-airstrike-in-iraq-kills-top-islamic-state-leader-says-report-101611983663150.html
30-01-2021||World||US first lady Jill Biden to help reunite migrant kids with parents||US first lady Jill Biden will participate in efforts by her husband's administration to reunite families split apart by former president Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies, the White House said Friday.In line with his campaign promises, President Joe Biden plans to announce on Tuesday "his launch of a task force on reunifying families and children. Something that he is personally committed to, his wife Dr Biden is personally committed to and invested in," said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.The task force will be under the command of Alejandro Mayorkas, who is due to be confirmed by the Senate as head of the Department for Homeland Security on Monday, she added.Jill Biden, 69, has a doctorate in education and plans to keep teaching at a university close to Washington while her husband serves as president.In December, she visited a migrant camp in Mexico, close to the border with Texas. "We are a welcoming nation, but that's not the message that we're sending at the border," she said at the time.Her tone was in marked contrast with her predecessor Melania Trump, who in 2018 visited children who had been locked up by her husband's policy of "zero tolerance" at the border and who wore a jacket with the logo, "I really don't care, do u?"Trump's government separated hundreds of migrant families, with very young children being taken away from their parents, some of whom were then deported.The plight of the children, taken from their parents and locked in detention centers, provoked such an outcry, even from some in the ranks of Trump's own Republican party, that he was forced to backpedal. A judge later ordered that the families be reunited.Authorities identified more than 2,700 children who needed to be reunited with their parents.But the parents of 611 children have yet to be located, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).Most of the parents who were deported remain stuck in their country of origin, the ACLU has said, calling on the US government to allow them to legally return to the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-lady-jill-biden-to-help-reunite-migrant-kids-with-parents-101611979771586.html

Mexico was expecting about 1.5 million doses from Pfizer, he noted.Mexico is trying to secure as much vaccine supply as possible amid delivery delays and a surge in cases. Mexico's death toll from COVID-19 was 156,579 on Friday.Lopez Obrador, speaking publicly for the first time since revealing on Sunday he had COVID-19, said Mexico would also receive 870,000 doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine in February.Additionally, Lopez Obrador said 1.8 million vaccine doses would arrive next month through a U.N.-backed mechanism, an apparent reference to the global COVAX facility.Mexico has secured enough vaccines to cover 20% of its 126 million people through COVAX, led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization to promote equitable access.Six million doses of the CanSino Biologics vaccine, which is due to share its clinical trial results soon, should arrive in Mexico in February, Lopez Obrador said.It would also be "no problem" for Mexico to have 12 million doses of the Chinese vaccine in March, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-to-import-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-from-india-says-president-101611977490040.html
30-01-2021||World||As asylum camp swells at US-Mexico border, Biden aide calls for 'patience'||The Biden administration is urging migrants waiting in Mexico under restrictions imposed by former U.S. President Donald Trump to be patient, even as the population of a makeshift camp in northeastern Mexico begins to swell with hopeful asylum seekers.On Friday, a senior aide to U.S. President Joe Biden said the administration is working on a system to process the asylum seekers who are waiting in Mexico under a Trump-era program known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP)."We're reviewing now how we can process the migrants who are already in this program," the aide, Roberta Jacobson, said on a call with reporters. "How to prioritize the people who were enrolled not only months but years ago, and above all, people who are the most vulnerable."Jacobson said all of those waiting in Mexico under the program will have an opportunity to present claims.The protocols, in place since 2019, pushed more than 65,000 asylum seekers back across the border to wait for their U.S. court hearings, although far fewer are believed to still be in Mexico.The Biden administration stopped adding people to MPP last week, but has not outlined how it will process the claims of those already enrolled.Advocates have documented the dangers they face while waiting, including rape and murder.Jacobson said the administration would process people "in a much more rapid manner than in the past."She asked asylum seekers not to rush to the U.S. border, however, as it would not speed up the process."Please, wait," she said.The population of a makeshift camp in the Mexican border city of Matamoros, across the river from Brownsville, Texas, has been slowly swelling, migrants and aid workers say, despite attempts by Mexican authorities to control it."It's been growing because people think that if you're in the camp, you'll be able to enter (the United States) first," said Honduran asylum seeker Oscar Borjas, who estimated up to 800 people, including women and children, live in the camp.He and other residents welcomed Jacobson's comments."Everything is changing for the better," said Dairon Elisondo, an asylum seeker and doctor from Cuba, who provides medical care to fellow migrants.But asylum seekers also urged the U.S. administration to act soon."If they don't do something soon, people are going to start trying to cross (illegally). People are desperate," said Yuri Gonzalez, from Cuba, who is waiting in Ciudad Juarez.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-asylum-camp-swells-at-us-mexico-border-biden-aide-calls-for-patience-101611977184442.html

30-01-2021||World||WHO team visits Wuhan hospital that had early coronavirus patients||A World Health Organization team visited a hospital on Friday where China says the first COVID-19 patients were treated more than a year ago as part of the experts' long-awaited fact-finding mission on the origins of the coronavirus.The WHO team members and Chinese officials earlier had their first in-person meetings at a hotel ahead of field visits in and around the central city of Wuhan in the coming days.“First face to face meeting with our colleagues. Correction: facemask to facemask given the medical restrictions," Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans tweeted in the morning.She said they were discussing their program of visits and Chinese team leader “prof. Wannian" was joking about some technical glitches, an apparent reference to top Chinese epidemiologist Liang Wannian, who has been a leader of China’s response team.“Nice to see our colleagues after lengthy Zoom meetings,” Koopman tweeted. The visiting researchers held video meetings during 14 days of quarantine after their arrival in China. They came out of quarantine on Thursday.Members of the team left the hotel by car, and a short time later entered the gates of the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine. According to China's official account of its response to the initial outbreak, Dr. Zhang Jixian first reported cases of what was then known as “pneumonia of unknown origin" at the hospital on Dec. 27, 2019.WHO said earlier on Twitter that the team requested “detailed underlying data” and planned to speak with early responders and some of the first COVID-19 patients. It also planned to visit markets such as the Huanan Seafood Market linked to many of the first cases, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and laboratories at facilities such as the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.The team's mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.“All hypotheses are on the table as the team follows the science in their work to understand the origins of the COVID19 virus,” WHO tweeted.Confirmation of the origins of the virus is likely to take years. Pinning down an outbreak’s animal source typically requires exhaustive research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan. The Chinese government has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.A possible focus for investigators is the virology institute in the city. One of China’s top virus research labs, it built an archive of genetic information about bat coronaviruses after the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.The first clusters of COVID-19 were detected in Wuhan in late 2019. China has since reported more than 89,000 cases and 4,600 deaths, with new cases largely concentrated in its frigid northeast, where local lockdowns and travel restrictions were being imposed to contain the outbreaks.New cases of local transmission continue to fall, with just 36 announced on Friday, as far fewer Chinese than usual appear willing to travel for Lunar New Year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-visits-wuhan-hospital-that-had-early-coronavirus-patients-101611970880565.html
30-01-2021||World||Canadian Judge rejects Huawei CFO's bid to loosen bail restrictions||A Canadian judge has rejected Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's bid to loosen her bail conditions, state broadcaster CBC reported on Friday.The Huawei executive, who is under house arrest in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings, has sought the right to move around the area unescorted. The 48-year old, who is fitted with an ankle bracelet, is currently free to travel in the region if accompanied by security guards.British Columbia Supreme Court Justice William Ehrcke said the conditions imposed on Meng after her arrest in 2018 are necessary to ensure she remains in Canada throughout the legal proceedings, the report said.Meng's lawyers argued that she has been cooperative during her two years of detention and noted that the guards pose a threat of transmitting COVID-19 to Meng. However, Ehrcke ruled that the Huawei executive's few ties to Canada and access to significant resources makes her a flight risk, according to the report.Meng is wanted by the US authorities for her alleged role in violating sanctions against Iran. The US Justice Department alleges that Meng committed financial transgressions by misleading multinational financial conglomerate, HSBC, into approving more than USD 100 million in transactions that contravened US sanctions on Iran from 2010 to 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-judge-rejects-huawei-cfo-s-bid-to-loosen-bail-restrictions-101611970513779.html
30-01-2021||World||Appeals court allows US to expel children alone at border||A federal appeals court on Friday ruled that the US government could resume expelling immigrant children who cross the southern border unaccompanied by a parent.The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's stay of a lower court ruling allows President Joe Biden's administration to resume expulsions begun by former President Donald Trump under a public health policy citing the COVID-19 pandemic.The appeals court issued a stay that had been requested by the Trump administration in November shortly after a federal judge barred the practice.All three judges on the panel that issued Friday's order were nominated by Trump, who enacted newly restrictive measures on immigration throughout his presidency. The judges are Gregory Katsas, Neomi Rao and Justin Walker.Trump's Republican administration instituted expulsions early in the pandemic, saying it had to restrict border crossings to prevent the spread of the virus, though public health officials later said they were told to issue an order allowing the expulsions by former Vice President Mike Pence.Border agents conducted more than 180,000 expulsions in just the last three months of 2020.Immigration agencies have continued expelling most border crossers — adults as well as parents and children together — in Biden's first days.The Democrat has signaled he will roll back other Trump administration policies restricting immigration, but his advisers have also said they are concerned about allowing all migrants to cross the border immediately.It's unclear whether Biden will implement expulsions of unaccompanied children now.At least 8,800 children were known to have been expelled prior to the federal court order.They included children as young as 9 who were denied the chance to request asylum or other protections under US law.Many children, including some babies with their parents, were detained in hotels in border states before being placed on deportation flights before another judge barred that practice.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately comment, nor did the U.S. Department of Justice.American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt called the appeals court's ruling a “temporary setback.”"We will continue to litigate this case on behalf of these vulnerable unaccompanied children, who are in need of protection and legally entitled to apply for asylum,” Gelernt said in a statement.“But we hope the Biden administration will not make ongoing litigation necessary by rescinding this illegal policy created by the Trump administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/appeals-court-allows-us-to-expel-children-alone-at-border-101611969436381.html
30-01-2021||World||Fauci sees Covid-19 vaccination for kids by late spring or the summer||The government's top infectious disease expert said Friday he hopes to see some kids starting to get vaccinated for COVID-19 in the next few months. It's a needed step to securing widespread immunity to the virus.Vaccines are not yet approved for children, but testing already is underway for those as young as 12.If those trials are successful, Dr. Anthony Fauci said they would be followed by another round of testing down to those 9 years old.“Hopefully by the time we get to the late spring and early summer we will have children being able to be vaccinated,” Fauci said at a White House coronavirus briefing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageFauci was looking ahead to a time vaccines will be plentiful. Even older adults are having difficulty getting shots at the moment. As of Thursday, only about 1.3% of Americans had been fully vaccinated with the required two doses of the currently available vaccines.Children represent about one-fourth of the population, and for the U.S. to reach “herd immunity," or widespread resistance, about 70% to 85% of the population must be vaccinated.“Children tend to not become as severely ill as adults but they can still become ill and some have tragically died,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency room physician, who supports Fauci's goal. “Children can also be vectors of transmission, and getting children vaccinated is important as we strive for herd immunity.”The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has emergency approval for use in people 16 and older. Moderna's vaccine is for those 18 and older.Pfizer's clinical trial for children 12 to 15 is fully enrolled, and the drugmaker could seek emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for children 12 and up sometime in the first half of this year. Moderna’s trial for ages 12-17 is still recruiting.Since the initial tests to validate the safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines involved tens of thousands of people, the age-related testing on children can be done using smaller groups.“You don’t want to have to ... go through an efficacy trial, where you’re involving tens of thousands of children," Fauci explained. “What you can do, is in a much smaller trial, measured in hundreds to a couple of thousands ... what we call safety and ... immunogenicity.” That's a term for whether the vaccine successfully triggers an immune system response.After a frustratingly slow start, the U.S. is now administering about 1 million shots a day to adults, although that pace is still seen as insufficient. President Joe Biden has talked about 1.5 million shots a day, if it can be done. His administration has set a goal of 100 million shots in its first 100 days.Two more vaccines from American companies are nearing the stage where the FDA can evaluate them for approval. One from Johnson & Johnson requires only a single shot.Biden has also set a goal of reopening most schools by the summer, and directed government agencies to work with communities to advance it.His American Rescue Plan legislation in Congress calls for $50 billion to finance a major expansion of testing, which is seen as necessary for the safe reopening of schools and businesses. That's because robust testing can detect early outbreaks before they spread through a community and trigger shutdowns. Testing in the U.S. had a chaotic start, and experts say in many parts of the country it's still subpar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-sees-covid-19-vaccination-for-kids-by-late-spring-or-the-summer-101611967209226.html
30-01-2021||World||Chinese national charged with conspiring to export US power technology||A Chinese national faces federal charges that he plotted over a three year period to evade US laws and export power amplifier technology to China, the US Department of Justice said on Friday."An indictment was unsealed this week charging Cheng Bo, also known as Joe Cheng, a 45-year-old national of the People's Republic of China, with participating in a criminal conspiracy from 2012-2015 to violate US export laws by shipping US power amplifiers to China," the Justice Department release said.Cheng's former employer, Avnet Asia Pte., a Singapore-based company and global distributor of electronic components and software, agreed to pay the US government a financial penalty of USD 1,508,000 to settle a criminal liability for the conduct of its former employees, including Cheng, the release said."As part of a Non-Prosecution Agreement, Avnet Asia admitted responsibility for Cheng's ...conspiracy to ship export-controlled US goods with potential military applications to China and also for the criminal conduct of another former employee who, from 2007-2009, illegally caused US goods to be shipped to China and Iran," further said."Avnet's employees repeatedly falsified documentation in order to send export-controlled goods with potential military applications to China," said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the National Security Division. "What China cannot develop itself, it acquires illegally through others. This is yet another example of a proxy acting to further China's malign interests."Alan E. Kohler, Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division said, "The People's Republic of China is relentless in its pursuit of U.S. technology, much of which can be used for military purposes.""The FBI is just as relentless in identifying and stopping those who violate export controls while doing business with China. Let us be clear, this is not business as usual. It is illegal and individuals and companies will pay a price for such violations."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-national-charged-with-conspiring-to-export-us-power-technology-101611966966722.html

Blinken spoke today with Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Qureshi discussed how to ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement.During the phone call, Secretary Blinken reinforced US concern about the Pakistani Supreme Court ruling and potential release of these prisoners."In addition, the Secretary and the Foreign Minister discussed the importance of continued US-Pakistan cooperation on the Afghan peace process, support for regional stability, and the potential to expand our trade and commercial ties," Ned Price added.This statement comes a day after Pakistan's Supreme Court ordered the release of the Omar Sheikh convicted in 2002 of orchestrating the abduction and killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.Interestingly, the State Department readout on the talks between Blinken and Qureshi differed with that of the release put out by the Pakistan Foreign Office (PFO).

30-01-2021||India||'BJP, AIADMK will contest together in Tamil Nadu': Nadda||BJP national president JP Nadda formally announced on Saturday night that the alliance with the ruling AIADMK will continue for the assembly elections slated for April-May. The announcement came during his rally in Tamil Nadu’s Madurai district. "The BJP has decided in the coming times it will contest with the AIADMK and other like-minded parties in the elections," said Nadda, clad in traditional Tamil attire.The AIADMK had been the first to make the move by announcing that their alliance formed ahead of the 2019 parliamentary elections will continue as early as November when Union home minister Amit Shah was in Chennai to inaugurate infrastructure projects.The party had also announced chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami as its candidate for the top post. Since then, there was uneasiness between the two partners as the BJP did not reciprocate initially. As tension mounted, the state leaders maintained that as a national party, it was the norm for their leadership in Delhi to make the announcements. It was expected to be made by Nadda who is on his second visit to the state this month. Earlier, on Pongal day, he addressed the 51st anniversary of Thuglak magazine currently being edited by S Gurumurthy.Also read: Agitation continues to gain momentum, as more farmers head towards DelhiParty president JP Nadda who arrived in the temple town late Friday night visited the famous Meenakshi Amman temple accompanied by his wife on Saturday morning. He also conducted a series of meetings with the state party’s core committee, social media volunteers and newly joined members before addressing the public on Saturday evening. The BJP’s poll plank has been to consolidate Hindu votes by attacking the opposition’s MK Stalin-led DMK. The BJP carried out a ‘vetrivel yatra’ (victorious spear march) which has subsequently become its electioneering slogan which they say is to protect Hindu interests in the state.Nadda highlighted central schemes that have benefited the state and reiterated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a supporter of Tamil language having quoted Tamil poet-saint Thiruvalluvar on several national and international platforms. “When he was, elected not only was the future of India safe but the destiny of Tamil Nadu also changed in its development,” said Nadda. He added that the state received justice comparing funds allotted to it during the UPA regime and the current Modi government. Last week, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked PM Modi-led BJP, stating that Tamil Nadu was in danger as they disrespected the southern state, its language and culture.Meanwhile, AIADMK top leadership was also in Madurai on Saturday as Palaniswami and his deputy O Paneerselvam inaugurated a temple with life-size bronze statues of their late stalwarts - MG Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa. The temple is located in a sprawling 12-acre plot in Thirumangalam and was constructed for ₹50-lakh. The bronze statues weigh 400-kilograms each. Speaking after the unveiling, Palaniswami revered the late leaders and rallied the crowd to work towards winning the upcoming assembly elections slated for April-May. Even while the BJP swept the parliamentary polls across India in 2014 and 2019, it was trounced in Tamil Nadu. The DMK won 38/39 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 drubbing the AIADMK-BJP combine.The AIADMK is aiming for a consecutive third term after winning back-to-back polls under Jayalalithaa’s leadership before she passed away while in office in December 2016. With Jayalalithaa's close aide and expelled leader VK Sasikala set to return to Chennai, Palaniswami-led AIADMK has been firm that she won't be taken back into the party and is appropriating the MGR-Jayalalithaa legacy in a series of actions. Besides campaigning on their legacy, the AIADMK is hopeful based on their performance in tackling Covid-19, its welfare schemes and reservation measures.Other allies of the AIADMK-led NDA alliance, such as the PMK and the DMDK, have also been posturing. The PMK has demanded that the AIADMK carves a 20 per cent reservation for their community and vote bank - the Vanniyars - under the existing Most Backward Caste quota. The DMDK has asked the AIADMK to allot them 41 seats as they did in 2011 and have also welcomed Sasikala into politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-and-aiadmk-will-contest-together-in-tamil-nadu-nadda-101612030456278.html

30-01-2021||India||Shah welcomes TMC rebels in Delhi; Bengal politics enters 'chartered plane era'||Less than 24 hours after cancelling his two-day trip to Bengal because of the IED blast outside the Israeli embassy in Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday evening welcomed former Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister Rajib Banerjee and a group of rebels into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at his Delhi residence.Those who joined the BJP alongside Banerjee are Vaishali Dalmiya, MLA from Bally in Howrah who was expelled by the TMC recently; Prabir Ghosal, MLA from Uttarpara in Hooghly district; Rathin Chakraborty, former mayor of Howrah town; Partha Sarathi Chatterjee, former MLA from Ranaghat in Nadia district and actor Rudranil Ghosh, who recently started speaking against the TMC. Banerjee, who was Bengal’s forest minister, resigned from the Domjur assembly seat in Howrah on Friday.Instead of offering them the BJP flag, Shah welcomed the TMC leaders with the party’s saffron scarves.Tweeting his photograph with the TMC leaders, Shah wrote, "Former TMC leaders Mr. Rajib Banerjee, Ms. Baishali Dalmiya, Mr. Prabir Ghoshal, Mr. Rathin Chakraborti and Mr. Rudranil Ghosh joined BJP today in New Delhi. I am sure their induction will further strengthen BJP’s fight for Sonar Bangla."Amar Sonar Bangla, or my golden Bengal, was a song Rabindranath Tagore composed in 1905 during the partition of the Bengal province by Lord Curzon.Also read: BJP, AIADMK will continue alliance for Tamil Nadu assembly elections, says NaddaWhile the exodus was expected, the high point of the day was the chartered flight that Shah arranged to ferry the rebel TMC leaders to the capital and send them back at night so that they can attend the rally that he was supposed to physically address in Howrah on Sunday afternoon. It was announced that Shah will virtually address the rally.Never before in Bengal was a chartered plane hired by a party to carry defectors, political observers said. The incident left its mark, with Banerjee and his co-passengers repeating before the media how they felt “extremely honoured” by Shah’s gesture. The small plane took off from Kolkata airport at 4.10 pm. The flight became a topic of discussion on social media in Bengal, with images of the rebels posing in front of the plane getting shared by the thousands with comments.Only Ghosh, the actor, missed the special ride but he managed to reach Delhi on a commercial flight.“It is a day of great honour for us. The home minister called us here as he had to postpone his trip. He took the initiative and sent a chartered plane. Bengal has suffered for years by fighting with the Centre. The state cannot have all-round development without the Centre’s help and participation. I told the home minister that Bengal should be offered a special package if we win the polls. He assured me that Bengal is his priority,” Banerjee said while leaving Shah’s home.The cover photo of Banerjee’s Facebook page was changed by 9 pm, with a message from the Bengal chief minister replaced by a shade of saffron and a new slogan, “with the people.”The BJP announced that since Shah cannot leave Delhi, Union minister Smriti Irani will address the rally in Howrah on Sunday where many people are supposed to join the BJP.Also read: Agitation continues to gain momentum, as more farmers head towards Delhi“Several district office-bearers of the TMC and some prominent actors will join us on Sunday. Wait and watch,” said Banerjee who is scheduled to deliver his first address as a BJP leader.“This is BJP. Since Amit Shah Ji could not visit Bengal and induct us he sent a chartered flight for us. I want to contest from Bally and work for the people,” said Dalmiya.A businesswoman and daughter of former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, she joined politics in 2016. So did Ghosal, a senior journalist. Ghosh, a known face on screen, used to be a CPI(M) supporter during the Left era and switched over to the TMC after Mamata Banerjee came to power.Political analyst and columnist Suvashis Maitra said the chartered plane marked the beginning of a new era in state politics.“Bengal was always known as a state where exorbitant expenditure in electoral politics never made news even when the trend of keeping defectors in exotic resorts before floor tests had become a regular feature in several states. The plane changed that,” said Maitra.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and national vice-president Mukul Roy accompanied the rebels to Delhi.Senior TMC leader and panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee said, “It is not a matter of honour if someone leaves the TMC for no definite ideology. Our party is huge. We do not stop anyone from leaving.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-welcomes-tmc-rebels-in-delhi-bengal-politics-enters-chartered-plane-era-101612028389802.html

On November 29, it mauled a 19-year-old girl Pasula Nirmala to death at the Mannewada hamlet of Penchikalpet block.“Yes, the same man-eater is back in the Asifabad forests again. Last time, it had escaped all the traps we had laid to capture it and went deep into the Maharashtra forests. After nearly two months, it has appeared again,” district forest officer S Santaram said.He said the department authorities have alerted the tribals in all the hamlets close to the forests and asked them not to venture into the forests for grazing cattle or to fetch forest produce.“We have laid traps once again and are working out other methods to capture it as per the guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). Since it has already tasted human flesh, it will definitely pose a danger to human habitations,” Santaram said.The forest officers have already been campaigning extensively in the tribal villages to create awareness among villagers on do’s and don’ts they need to follow to prevent incidents of wild animal attacks.“We have asked them to move in groups when they go inside the forests for harvesting of crops or other agriculture operations. One or two of them should keep a watch on the movement of animals and sound an alert by drum beating or blowing trumpets when they spot wild animals,” the official said.The forest officials suggested that the tribals constitute a village protection committee comprising local sarpanch and forest beat officer, which will monitor the movement of tigers and inform the higher officials immediately. All the tribals venturing into forests should inform the protection committee about their movement, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maneater-which-killed-2-tribals-in-telangana-s-kumaram-bheem-resurfaces-101612027462518.html

Reports said more and more farmers from various states of the country have now come to Delhi's borders to join the movement. By February 2, a record number of people will join the protests at the Delhi borders including Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, claimed various farmer leaders as per a PTI report."People from several areas area are heading towards Delhi borders to join the agitation. Our 'jatha' (group) of at least 700-800 tractors will leave for the Tikri border protest site on Sunday," Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said according to PTI. BKU (Rajewal) leader Balbir Singh Rajewal also said that people are reaching the protest sites in large numbers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. "Possibly by February 2, there will again a record gathering of people at the protest sites," claimed Rajewal while insisting that it would be completely peaceful.Also Read | ‘BJP leaders’: AAP on ‘locals’ who pelted stones on farmers at Singhu borderAs Singhu and Ghazipur borders turned into a fortress amid escalating tension, Rajewal urged people to not get provoked by any misinformation otherwise it would harm the ongoing movement.

Protesting farmers also burnt effigies of Union ministers at 400 places in 14 districts, including Sangrur and Mohali, to mark their disapproval of the farm legislation. To express solidarity with protesting farmers, panchayats of some villages in Bathinda, Ludhiana and Sangrur in Punjab even passed resolutions, asking villagers to send one person from each family to the protest sites, PTI reported citing farmer leaders.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi's borders for more than two months now against the new farm laws. They are demanding a repeal of the laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for the procurement of their crops. Agitating farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system, despite the Centre seeking to assure them in vain that the MSP system was here to stay and the new laws would only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.The government has held several rounds of talks with the farmers but so far it failed to bring any resolution to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agitation-continues-to-gain-momentum-as-more-farmers-head-towards-delhi-101612027411953.html

One the one hand, he is making pretense of supporting farmers, and on the other, humiliating them.He said the attacks in the name of farmers are all orchestrated by the BJP.On Tuesday, during the tractor rally, a group of farmers deviated from the assigned route, broke through barriers, clashed with security personnel in several parts of Delhi. They also vandalised property and even entered the Red Fort, where they hoisted their flags.Over 25 FIRs have been registered in connection with the January 26 violence. It has lodged an FIR under sections of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and sections of IPC dealing with sedition.Delhi Police on Friday served notices to 12 farmer leaders, including Buta Singh Burjgill, Darshan Pal Singh, Rakesh Tikait, Shamsher Pandher and Satnam Pannu, to join an investigation into the violence.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-preventing-water-tankers-from-reaching-protesting-farmers-satyendra-jain-101612027153787.html
30-01-2021||India||Israeli embassy in Delhi on high alert before bomb blast: Ambassador||The Israeli embassy in New Delhi was on high alert because of "threats" it had received, even before a small bomb went off outside the mission, its ambassador told AFP on Saturday.The envoy, Ron Malka, said he was not surprised by Friday's attack, which caused no injuries but blew the windows out of three cars.The road outside the embassy remained sealed off Saturday as forensic experts sought clues as to who was responsible for what Israeli officials in Jerusalem have said was terrorism.Indian police have so far only described it as "a mischievous attempt to create a sensation"."This could have ended differently in other circumstances, so we were fortunate," Malka said in a telephone interview."We are always prepared. Especially these last days, we raised the level of alert due to some threats," he added, without giving further details."We are not surprised."Indian media reports said investigators had found an envelope with a letter addressed to the Israeli ambassador in the street.The Indian Express newspaper reported that the letter described the low-intensity explosion as a "trailer" and made references to "Iranian martyrs" Qasem Soleimani and Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.Soleimani, considered Iran's most powerful military commander, was killed in a US drone strike in January 2020.Fakhrizadeh, one of the country's top nuclear scientists, was killed in November -- an assassination for which Iran blamed Israel.In 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Iran for a bomb attack on an Israeli diplomatic car in Delhi that injured at least three people.Asked whether there was an Iranian link this time, Malka said: "Those non-state actors that are striving for destablization in the region and the world don't like what is happening between Israel and India, that are striving for stability and peace."It might be a threat for them."The device exploded as India and Israel marked the 29th anniversary of their diplomatic relations, and Malka said the timing was part of the investigation.India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar spoke to his Israeli counterpart Gabi Ashkenazi after the incident."We take this very seriously," Jaishankar said. "No effort will be spared to find the culprits."The national security advisors of both countries have also held discussions.Since establishing relations, India and Israel have become close and India is now one of the biggest buyers of Israeli weapons and defence equipment.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Israel in 2017, and Netanyahu made a return visit a year later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israeli-embassy-in-delhi-on-high-alert-before-bomb-blast-ambassador-101612026727862.html
30-01-2021||India||A year after first Covid-19 case, Kerala continues to grapple with pandemic||A year after the country’s first Covid-19 case was detected in Thrissur on Jan 30 last Kerala is still grappling with pandemic situation with high active caseload and test positivity rate (TPR), health ministry statistics show. As fever still runs high it exposes tall claims of the state government and leaves many questions on its pandemic management.On Saturday, the state reported another high of 6,282 new Covid-19 cases with a positivity rate of 10.51 per cent while the active caseload stands at 71,469. According to the latest statistics, at least 48 per cent of the country’s new cases (13,082) are from the southern state. Among 10 worst-affected districts, seven are from Kerala. As the situation remained grim, the state government, which basked in old glory, turned defensive.“We take criticism positively. But some people are criticising us just for the sake of criticism. They now find fault with all our measures. But we can say the state’s mortality rate (below 0.5 per cent) is still the lowest in the country,” said state health minister KK Shailaja adding the government was doing everything possible to contain the spread of the virus.Despite chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s claim last week, that daily tests will be increased to one lakh, on Saturday 59,759 samples were tested and more than half were antigen tests.Also read: 5 rebel Trinamool leaders meet Amit Shah, join BJPEarlier, experts had warned the state to shed its obsession with low-accuracy and cheap antigen tests and opt for more RT-PCR tests. Messing up of data, fatigue among health workers and system and over-confidence after the arrival of vaccine aggravated the situation and the state will have to do enough homework to contain the spread, they said. The state also turned its back on its scientific community ignoring scholastic and clinical research during the outbreak “but it was interested more in running commentaries and PR exercise,” they said.“Controlling the pandemic is not a political exercise. The government should have roped in enough public health experts and epidemiologists. But they were given a short shrift,” said Dr S S Lal, a US-returned public health expert.“Kerala is by no means a success story but I won’t call it a failure too. Real epidemic started when people started arriving from other states and the middle-east. There were tell-tale signs to community spread but many ignored it. The rest of the story is a slow and steady spread,” said G Pramod Kumar, former senior advisor to the United National Development Programme.Let’s see how things unfolded in the state from day one. “I was speechless when I heard my daughter was positive. When she returned home from Wuhan (epicentre in China), where she was pursuing her medical studies, we were really relieved. But it was short-lived,” said the father of the 21-year-old girl who was the country's first Covid-19 patient.“My wife and I insisted we should meet her and enough prodding was required. First time we both wore heavy PPE kits in our life and met our daughter. When I recollect the meeting, it leaves enough shivers down my spine,” he said. Soon after this, the entire family were moved to an institutional quarantine centre.Two days later, two other China-returned students, who came along with her, tested positive. Both turned negative after two weeks but the first victim had to spend 28 days in the hospital to turn negative and another two weeks under mandatory observation.For almost two months, the state managed the contagion well and the pandemic was restricted to China-returnees. But in March, things took a dramatic turn after a family returned from Italy hid their travel history and interacted with many in Pathanamthitta. The state, for the first time, heard a new word “super spreader”. At least 22 of family members and neighbours were infected but all of them were nursed back to their life.Also read: Black Lives Matter - All you need to know about Nobel Peace Prize nomineeThe countrywide lockdown helped the state to manage things well and it put severe restrictions on even people coming from other states. Next two months (May-June) the state was on the verge of flattening the curve and many, including the international media, lauded its pandemic control measures.But things slowly shifted after the lockdown was lifted and its large population from the Gulf countries started returning to the state, still it managed its numbers well.After Onam festival in September last year, cases started swelling again. Many, including Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, blamed the state for lowering its guard that resulted in the second wave. The situation aggravated after local body elections in December, the wave continues.But chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan put up a brave face saying the state did whatever it can and there was no flaw on its part.“Ups and downs are nature of the pandemic. Even some of the developed countries are still struggling with the second and third phase of the pandemic. Look at the case of Scandinavian countries,” he said, adding that the situation will improve by next month. He said another lockdown was not feasible and the state will have to learn to live with the pandemic for some more time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-after-first-covid-19-case-kerala-continues-to-grapple-with-pandemic-101612025929673.html

Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-laws-will-break-the-backbone-of-agri-sector-arundhati-roy-101612024893499.html

30-01-2021||India||Parathas, pickle and buttermilk: Rakesh Tikait's tears draw food in form of love||Villagers brought water in clay pots and home-made food for Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday in a show of support for the ongoing stir against the new farm laws, even as local authorities sent tankers of drinking water and mobile toilets at the protest site.Tikait urged the government to restore internet services, which have been banned by the Centre at protest sites on Delhi's borders Saturday.A little boy from a Ghaziabad village reached the protest with a tiffin filled with homemade 'parathas' and pickle along with water. Some villagers from western Uttar Pradesh including places like Muzaffarnagar, Greater Noida, and Meerut also reached Ghazipur border with water and buttermilk in clay pots to feed the protestors.Water and power supply at the protest site was disrupted by the local administration two days ago following an ultimatum to protestors to vacate the spot by Thursday night, prompting Tikait to say he would drink water only when farmers bring it from their villages but continue the stir.Overwhelmed by emotion, tears welled up the eyes of Tikait, who had proclaimed he would rather commit suicide than end the protest for farmers."A conspiracy is being planned by the BJP to weaken the agitation of farmers," Tikait claimed, a day after a BKU member filed a complaint at Kashambi police station here against two BJP MLAs for allegedly orchestrating violence at the protest site.A senior police official confirmed to PTI that the complaint was made against Loni MLA Nand Kishor Gujjar and Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma but FIR has not been lodged.Tikait also urged the Centre to restore internet services at protest sites so that farmers could put forth their views and demands on social media.Besides sending water tankers, the Ghaziabad civic bodies have also re-stationed mobile toilets at the protest site on Saturday, as support for the farmers' protest swelled with more villagers pouring in at the Delhi- Meerut highway in Ghazipur on the border with Uttar Pradesh.   The Bharatiya Kisan Union-led protest against the Centre's new farm laws here looked like it was going slim on Thursday but more protestors have joined the stir, following a mahapanchayat of farmers on Saturday in Muzaffarnagar, while supporters also joined in from Haryana and Rajasthan districts."The movement was and is strong," BKU's Meerut Zone president Pawan Khatana told PTI.Khatana, who is at the demonstration site with BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, said there has been continuous support for the "peaceful protest" against the farmers' demand for removal of the new agri laws."This is not a political protest. Anybody who shares the ideology of the BKU and Rakesh Tikait are welcome here. But it is our appeal to those who do not wish to support the movement till the end that please do not come only to leave in between," he said.Asked about estimated crowd size at the site, the farmer leader from western Uttar Pradesh said, "Farmers are coming in to show solidarity and leaving. It is not a stagnant crowd."On Friday night, the BKU office-bearers had estimated a crowd of around 10,000 people at Ghazipur while the Ghaziabad police officials pegged it around 5,000 to 6,000.Heavy security deployment, including personnel of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), Rapid Action Force (RAF) in anti-riot gears and civil police, was made at the protest site.Meanwhile, the Delhi Traffic Police said to and fro movement on the National Highway 24 (Delhi-Meerut Expressway) has been closed.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parathas-pickle-and-buttermilk-rakesh-tikait-s-tears-draw-food-in-form-of-love-101612023935508.html

30-01-2021||India||ED arrests Joint MD of rice export firm KRBL in AgustaWestland scam||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested Anoop Kumar Gupta -- businessman and joint managing director of one of the largest rice exporting firms of the country – KRBL Ltd, known for its flagship brand India Gate basmati rice, in connection with its money laundering probe into the ₹3,727 crore AgustaWestland scam, people familiar with the development said on Saturday.Gupta was produced before the court of Special CBI Judge Arvind Kumar at Rouse Avenue Courts on Saturday.ED’s Special Public Prosecutor N K Matta, while seeking Gupta’s 14 days custody, informed the court that the accused has been giving evasive replies and hasn’t been cooperating with the agency. The court sent him to five days custody of the Enforcement Directorate.Matta further said that the accused is “required to be confronted with number of documents and persons to ascertain the money trail and determine the role of various accused persons in the commission of the offence of money laundering and to unearth how the kickbacks were routed and laundered.”The anti-money laundering agency said that approximately Euro 70 million proceeds of crime were laundered through two channels for payment of kickbacks to various political persons, bureaucrats, Air Force officials and others to influence the contract for supply of 12 VVIP helicopters in favour of Anglo-Italian firm – AgustaWestland.Explaining Gupta’s role, Matta informed the court – “It is submitted that M/s IDS Information Technology and Engineering Sarl, Tunisia have received proceeds of crime to the tune of Euro 24.37 million from AgustaWestland and out of this about Euro 12.4 million were further transferred to M/s Interstellar Technologies Ltd, Mauritius, and proceeds of crime were further transferred to various companies including M/s Rawasi Al Khaleej General Trading LLC Dubai, a company formed through KRBL’s Dubai arm - KRBL DMCC.”Gupta was one of the directors of KRBL DMCC and M/s Rawasi Al Khaleej General Trading (RAKGT) LLC Dubai was used to route proceeds of crime in the VVIP chopper scam, Matta said.“In 2009, the entire stake (49% shareholding) of KRBL DMCC held in RAKGT was transferred in the name of Anurag Poddar but in fact even after March 31, 2009, RAKGT is under control of KRBL Ltd through Gupta and parts of proceeds received in RAKGT were transferred to KRBL Ltd,” ED informed the court.The ED has received some documents on December 17, 2020 which shows that Gupta was controlling the financial transactions of the company.Gupta’s counsel Senior Advocate Vikas Pahwa said – “The arrest is malafide. According to ED’s own case, the entire stake of KRBL held in RAKGT was sold to one Anurag Poddar in 2009 and the alleged bribe has come after that. So, how can he be held liable for something he is not part of? He has no link to the money. Also, Mr Gupta has always provided all the documents whenever asked for, he has completely cooperated every time that he has been called by ED. Then why take him in custody?”An email sent to KRBL remained unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-arrests-joint-md-of-rice-export-firm-krbl-in-agustawestland-scam-101612018266577.html

According to a person aware of the details, though LJP’s Chirag Paswan was invited for the meeting, he later stayed away citing ill-health.The NDA has lost two of its oldest allies, the Shiva Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-facts-to-counter-misgivings-on-farm-laws-pm-modi-101612018840111.html

30-01-2021||India||Rakesh Tikait is the cynosure of many eyes – not just farmers||His tears exercised an emotive pull even he may not have envisaged, helping turn the tide for a movement that seemed to have lost both sheen and momentum after the violence on Republic Day. It was but a moment in time and Rakesh Tikait was the man in it.He was once a Delhi Police constable, tried his hand at electoral politics and been a farmer leader for years. But Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Tikait has broken out of the confines of western Uttar Pradesh to find a space in the national spotlight as arguably the most powerful farm leader of the day.The two-month farmer movement against the Centre’s three farm laws was till now dominated by protesters from the fields of Punjab and Haryana who set up camp at the Singhu and Tikri border points into the city. Now, the focus has shifted to Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border where farmers are gathering in thousands to boost the fight that seemed to have been weakening only two days ago.A day after the Republic Day violence in Delhi, when a section of farmers taking part in the tractor parade broke through barriers, clashed with police and stormed the Red Fort for a few hours, the farmer game it seemed to be over. Morale plummeted and many farmers returned home. On Wednesday night, the atmosphere was tense at Ghazipur. The Ghaziabad administration issued an “ultimatum” to the protesters occupying a stretch of the Delhi-Meerut expressway to vacate as the January 26 clashes painted a not-so-peaceful picture of the peasant community.And then came the Tikait moment. As security presence at the site escalated and fears grew that the protesters would be forcibly evicted, an emotional Tikait broke down while talking to reporters.“The protest won’t be called off. Farmers are being met with injustice,” he said and even threatened to end his life for the cause.It soon emerged that the 51-year-old who was leading BKU supporters at the Ghazipur border since November 28, was no ordinary man at all. His call for continuing the protest against the government struck a deep emotional chord. Videos of his emotional outburst were circulated across multiple platforms.It led to his brother Naresh Tikait calling a ‘mahapanchayat’ at their home town in Muzaffarnagar on Friday where tens of thousands of farmers gathered to back the movement.The crowd at Ghazipur border that had reduced to 500 on Thursday night grew manifold over the next 12 hours, running into well over 5,000 in next 24 hours. The farmer movement was not just revived but further energised.Tikait, who has been part of a delegation talking with the Centre over the ongoing protest, is also one of the accused in the January 26 violence in Delhi that saw one farmer dying when his tractor overturned and hundreds of people, including police personnel, being injured.He has denied the allegations of conspiracy and demanded a judicial probe into the violence, blaming infiltrators in the tractors’ parade of the unrest. To be named as an accused by the Delhi Police is perhaps strange for Tikait, who served as a head constable in the force but quit in 1992-93 when he had to deal with a farmers’ agitation led by his father, the legendary Mahendra Singh Tikait.Born on June 4, 1969 in Sisauli village of Muzaffarnagar district in western Uttar Pradesh, Rakesh Tikait joined BKU after quitting the Delhi Police and gained prominence as a farm leader after the death of his father to cancer in May 2011.Mahendra Tikait, who was hailed as “messiah” of farmers, had inherited the ‘Chaudhary’ title of the regional Baliyan khap (a social and administrative system in parts of north India) at the age of eight from his father. Going by the tradition of the khap, the title passed on to his elder son and Rakesh Tikait’s elder brother Naresh.But Rakesh Tikait, a BA graduate from the Meerut University, was designated national spokesperson of the BKU. He has two younger brothers -- Surendra, who works as a manager in a sugar mill, and Narendra, engaged in agriculture.The father of three – two daughters and a son -- has been at loggerheads with various governments on a range of farmers’ issues, including loan waivers, minimum support price (MSP), power tariff and land acquisition in states such as UP, Haryana Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh.He also tried his hand at elections but lost both times.In 2007, he contested the UP Assembly polls from Khatauli constituency in Muzaffarnagar as an independent candidate. In 2014, he fought the Lok Sabha election from Amroha district on a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ticket.It’s an affluent family.Ahead of the 2014 polls, Tikait had declared assets worth ₹4.25 crore, including ₹10 lakh cash, and liabilities of ₹10.95 lakh with land worth over ₹3 crore forming the biggest chunk of his assets.He also declared three criminal cases against him in the election affidavit. These cases were lodged in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, and Anuppur in Madhya Pradesh.The vocal farmer leader had to spend nights behind the bars for defying public servant’s orders during several of the protests that he has led in the past decade.Having dug in his heels along with his supporters at the Ghazipur border amid a deadlock with the Centre over the new farm laws, Tikait on Saturday was once again teary eyed.But this time overwhelmed by emotion as villagers, including children, reached the protest site carrying water, homemade food and buttermilk, after he announced he would drink water only when farmers will bring it since the local administration had barred water tankers at the protest site.Rakesh Tikait is now the cynosure of many eyes – and it’s not just farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-is-the-cynosure-of-many-eyes-not-just-farmers-101612017260597.html

We were bringing out the crowd that had entered and hoisted the flag, after which we were suddenly attacked. They had sticks and swords with them. I received injuries on my head and legs," said Head Constable Ashok Kumar.Head Constable Sunita, posted at PS Model Town, was also injured during the attack that took place on January 26. "I was deployed at Mukarba Chowk. Deputy Commissioner of Police and Assistant Commissioner of Police were also there. They spoke to protesters asking them to go to approved route. But they turned aggressive, broke barricades, attacked us and vandalised vehicles," she told ANI.Even though the farmer unions have distanced themselves from the attacks and called it a conspiracy, the Delhi Police held them responsible for it.The police on Friday served notices to 12 farmer leaders to join the investigation into the violence during the tractor rally on Republic Day. Among those who were served the notices include Buta Singh Burjgill, Darshan Pal Singh, Rakesh Tikait, Shamsher Pandher and Satnam Pannu.On January 26, during the tractor march by farmers to protest against the three farm laws, protestors violated the agreement about the route to be taken and entered central Delhi after forcibly removing barricades.

The victim was allegedly hacked with sickles. He died on the spot.TMC’s Suti assembly area chairman Emani Biswas said, “Saddam was an active worker of our party. On Friday, we organised a rally at Kashimnagar demanding withdrawal of the farm laws. Saddam was returning home around 9 pm. The Congress workers blocked his path and started abusing the TMC. Saddam was attacked when he protested. We have requested the police to arrest the culprits.”The Congress dismissed the allegation.The party’s Suti-2 community block unit president Alfazuddin Biswas said, “It is a baseless allegation. The victim and the accused both belong to the TMC. The accused was a polling booth unit president of the TMC till a few days ago. I have heard that Saddam was killed during a dispute over the ownership of a mobile phone. Let the police probe the matter impartially and unearth the truth.”Superintendent of Police of Jangipur, Y Raghuvamshi, said, “We have lodged a murder case on the basis of a written complaint but the accused are on the run.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-accuses-congress-of-murdering-party-worker-in-bengal-village-101612013345840.html
30-01-2021||India||PM Modi should talk to farmers directly, says Congress' Ashok Gehlot||The Centre can still correct its "ill-measures" against the farmers, who have been protesting against the three central farm laws, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi must talk to them, senior Congress leader and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot suggested on Saturday."There is still a chance for the government to correct its ill measures. I believe the Prime Minister must take cognizance and talk to the farmers himself. The government should reverse the decision (regarding the farm laws)," Gehlot said, reported news agency ANI. Suggesting a rollback to PM Modi-led government, Gehlot said, "There is nothing wrong with changing decisions. It happens in a democracy. People will welcome it."Gehlot criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not carrying out a judicial inquiry into the incident of violence on Republic Day in the national capital. "We condemn the violence on Republic Day by some anti-social elements. Why did judicial inquiry not happen? There should be a fair probe into the incident."Gehlot also backed the farmers' movement and said that they were protesting peacefully for 65 days. Blaming the BJP for sparking clashes at Delhi's Singhu border, where alleged local residents protested against farmers occupying the space on Friday, Gehlot said, "The clashes happened on the behest of the BJP. They (BJP) are pushing villagers to clash with farmers. This is not good."Three days after the clashes that broke out on Republic Day in the national capital, opposition parties are training guns at the government and the ruling party at the Centre, accusing them of discrediting the farmers' movement. Earlier in the day, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claimed that the violence that took place during the tractor parade on January 26 was scripted by the BJP with the help of Delhi Police to "defame and discredit" the farmers' movement.Addressing a press conference, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj called BJP leaders the "greatest anti-nationals" and demanded that cases of sedition must be filed against them and probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). "Police and BJP together scripted the violence of January 26 and the days after. This script was prepared by the BJP with the help of Delhi Police to defame and discredit the farmers' movement," the AAP leader claimed.The BJP has not responded to the allegations so far.Protests had erupted in parts of Delhi and on its surrounding borders after the tractor rally called by the agitating farmers took a violent turn on India's 72nd Republic Day on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-should-talk-to-farmers-directly-says-congress-ashok-gehlot-101612009528590.html

Long separation from their respective families, due to families staying in their respective home towns further compounds the problem."Even if some personnel are keeping their families at stations where they are posted, invariably separation still occurs due to the nature of duties, which involve frequent movements, deployment among others," the statement in the MoU said.It adds that housing satisfaction in the force too is "not of the desired levels"."The disappearance of the joint family system and nuclear families becoming the norm has further reduced the availability of alternate support systems."Whereas, families of CRPF have similar lifestyle aspirations to those of civilians, the nature of unpredictable duties of CRPF and deployment are a stumbling block," it said.This breakdown in the family support system, the MoU said, has got manifested, to an extent, in the rising number of suicides and fratricides.Shukla, as per the spokesperson, assured the force that the IIM team will strive to furnish meaningful recommendations after thorough research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iim-lucknow-to-study-effect-of-stress-and-strain-on-crpf-jawans-find-solutions-for-work-life-balance-101612010087436.html

The complaint was lodged by Naaz Patel, an activist and the founder of an NGO called Avesta Foundation. She filed the complaint in December last year at the Mumbai police station.Patel claims that the current logo resembles an image of a naked human which is "offensive in nature for women." Patel also threatened the e-commerce company with appropriate action in case it fails to implement the suggested changes."A complainant (woman) had approached the cybercrime police station in the matter. We called a meeting with Myntra following the complaint, they (Myntra) came and agreed to change the logo. They have sent an email as well on the same," Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police with the cybercrime department, was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Avesta Foundation thanked Myntra for addressing the concerns "and respecting the sentiments of millions of women". It also thanked people for their support. "Congratulations to our founder. She did it what apparently seemed impossible. Thank you everyone for your support. We're overwhelmed by the response. Kudos to @myntra for addressing the concerns and respecting the sentiments of millions of women," the foundation tweeted.Meanwhile, many social media users agreed with the activist, some said that the complaint seems to be whimsical.The Flipkart-owned online shopping portal said that it will change the logo in the next one month, according to a PTI report. The new logo is yet to be unveiled by Myntra and as per reports, it has already started the process of replacing the old logo on all platforms including website and app.Myntra was founded in 2007 and was acquired by Flipkart in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/myntra-to-change-its-logo-here-is-why-101612013462113.html
30-01-2021||India||Future group's Biyani says Amazon creating confusion, playing dog in the manger||Future Group promoter Kishore Biyani has alleged that Amazon is "playing the dog in the manger" and trying to create a confusion about the group's ₹24,713-crore deal with Reliance Industries.Seeking to assuage concerns of employees amid the ongoing tussle with e-commerce giant Amazon, Biyani said the organisation is on firm legal footing and that has been vindicated by the regulatory approvals received for the deal from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), market regulator SEBI and the bourses. The development comes days after Amazon petitioned the Delhi High Court to block the Future Group from selling retail assets to Reliance Industries and sought detention of Biyani and family members.In a letter addressed to the Future Group employees, Biyani alleged that Amazon is running a concerted and coordinated media campaign and leaking misleading information.Biyani said the Future Group was the target of a new form of attack and that a "corporate battle" is being fought for supremacy over Indian customers 70 years after India became a republic and also alleged that immense resources are being deployed on influencing Indian society’s mindset and belief systems."...Amazon is playing the dog in the manger, going all out to create a ruckus...For reasons we never believed earlier but quite evident today, this battle is about ownership of the Indian customer at any cost," he said in his letter written on Friday. Meanwhile, Amazon did not respond to emailed query on the matter.Biyani said he has received numerous letters, phone calls and messages from employees expressing their support, anxiety and queries on the various legal steps being taken by Amazon.He justified the decision to sell retail, wholesale and some other businesses of Future Group to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's RIL, saying he was left with no other option but to enter in a “constructive deal” with Reliance Group in the wake of the financial crisis in the retail sector on account of the pandemic.Biyani said Amazon's policy of “vexatious litigation and harassment” was akin to Greek conquerer Alexander's ruthless ambition to scorch the earth.He further said that Amazon had relentlessly attacked Future Retail, the board of directors, lenders, promoters, and that those efforts had been unsparing of his close family members, including his father, uncle and children. "After all, they (Amazon) are inspired to name their product as Alexa... History tells us that Alexander conquered large parts of the world but failed in India. With you on our side and our relentless service to the Indian consumers, we will serve the best interests of our country and will continue to protect our fundamental right to survive, and to serve the Indian consumer," Biyani said.The Future Group founder noted that the deal between Future Coupons and Amazon in August 2019 was to build a coupons and gifting business, create an e-commerce distribution for brands and whenever FDI in retail is permitted, they could participate. "FDI is not permitted in multi-brand retail, and as is the global policy trend, the government would like home-grown retailers to scale up," he added.In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd (which owns 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd through convertible warrants), with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.Amazon had dragged the Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), arguing that Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.On October 25, 2020, an interim award was passed in favour of Amazon with a single-judge bench of V K Rajah barring Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.After this, the Future Group filed a plea with the Delhi High Court. On December 21, a single-member bench rejected the plea to restrain Amazon from writing to regulatory authorities about the SIAC arbitral order but gave a go-ahead to the regulators to decide over the deal.The court had also made several observations indicating that Amazon's attempt to control Future Retail through a conflation of agreements Amazon has with an unlisted unit of the Indian company will be violative of the FEMA FDI rules. Since then, Amazon has also filed a petition in the Delhi High Court seeking detention of Future Group founders, including CEO Kishore Biyani, and seizure of their assets as it sought to block the Future-Reliance deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/future-group-s-biyani-says-amazon-creating-confusion-playing-dog-in-the-manger-101612012437379.html
30-01-2021||India||Not surprised at 'evil attack' as we were on higher alert for few weeks: Israeli envoy||A day after a blast outside its Embassy here, Israel's ambassador to India Ron Malka said there are enough reasons to believe it was a terrorist attack but they are not surprised at the event as the alert level had been increased for past few weeks following intelligence inputs.In an interview with PTI, he also said the investigations will look into all possible angles, including whether there are any links to the 2012 attack on Israeli diplomats here while events around the world are also being examined to find any related operations or activities at any destination."These attacks by those seeking destablisation in the (West Asia) region cannot stop us or scare us. Our peace efforts will continue uninterrupted," he said when asked whether the attack was aimed at derailing Israel's peace efforts with various Arab countries.He said Israeli authorities and the embassy are providing all assistance and every information Indian authorities probing the attack.Also Read: 45,000 mobile phones were active around Israeli Embassy at time of blastA low-intensity improvised explosive device(IED) went off near the Israeli Embassy in the heart of Delhi on Friday evening but no one was injured.Some cars were damaged in the blast that occurred about 150 metres away from the Embassy in Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road in the very high-security Lutyens' bungalow zone.An envelope addressed to the Israeli Embassy and containing a note, purportedly linking the blast to Iran, was also found at the site of the blast.Initial investigations revealed that the IED was planted in a flower pot on the median near Jindal House on A P J Abdul Kalam road outside the Israeli embassy.Also Read: Blast near Israel Embassy: Police team finds most CCTVs 'non-functional' at siteThe blast took place when President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were present a few kilometres away at the Beating Retreat ceremony.Besides, it coincided with the day when India and Israel marked the completion of the 29th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic relations.Asked whether Israeli agencies will join the probe, Malka said a kind of cooperation and collaboration is taking place, but the probe is mostly being done by Indian authorities as it happened on Indian soil."But of course, whatever assistance we can provide, whatever we can share, we will do that," he said.On the envelope recovered from the site hinting at a possible Iranian link, Malka said, "You need to understand that the investigation is still in early stages, so it is not appropriate to talk about anything that might harm the investigation."He said it won't be fair for him to talk about any specific detail regarding the investigation or other inputs relating to the probe."But what I can tell you is that we are collecting all the information and putting all pieces of evidence together and building the puzzle. Eventually, I think we will understand it all and the picture will be clear and we will get to know who is behind this evil attack," the Israeli envoy said.On whether the embassy has provided its own CCTV footage to the probe team, Malka said, "We are collecting any evidence, any piece of information that can be useful. Whether there are eyewitnesses, CCTV as you mentioned, whatever we can gather, any piece of information, we are collecting everything that can shed more light on what happened. We are making all the efforts."Official police sources said investigators probing the blast have not come across "anything concrete" yet as most of the CCTV cameras near the site of the explosion were "non-functional" at the time of the incident.An investigation team of Delhi Police's Special Cell had earlier in the day visited the site to collect more evidence, sources said, adding that it managed to get access to footage from some of the CCTV cameras in the area.One CCTV footage showed a vehicle moving suspiciously near the embassy just before the explosion.Asked about reports about an entity called 'Jaish ul Hind' claiming responsibility and whether the attack was aimed at derailing Israel's peace efforts with various Arab countries in recent months, Malka said, "Our assumption as of now is that we have enough reasons to believe that this was a terrorist attack targetted at Israeli Embassy in New Delhi."He said all possible angles on who could be behind the attack are open."For example, you have to take into consideration that yesterday, exactly when this evil attack was conducted, we celebrated the 29th anniversary of the establishment of full diplomatic relations with India. It has been 29 fruitful and rewarding years of collaboration," he said.The Israeli envoy said the attack happened on the day when they were celebrating the rapidly growing relations with India."Is it a coincidence or is it not? Who knows that, but of course this is an option being probed. Also, we are examining events and incidents around the world at some destinations whether there was some kind of operations elsewhere also targetted at Israel. All of that is being looked into," he said.Malka said that there was "a high alert for a few weeks" and therefore they are not surprised.Diplomats and Israeli representatives around the world are targets of our enemies. So we always have our precautions and take necessary steps based on our own guidelines and the security procedures that we follow. This time we had increased the level of alert, so we were very much prepared and secure and protected," he added.On whether there could be any link to the 2012 attack on Israeli diplomats in Delhi, he said that line of investigation is also being examined to ascertain whether there is any pattern, any connection or any dots are there to be connected."Yes, I am sure this (angle) is also being investigated. But as I said this is still an early stage of investigation and therefore we need to be careful and we will keep all the options open until we know for sure that we can cancel any option or we can focus more on one of them. But it is still too early for that," he said.In February 2012, a motorcycle rider had attached an explosive device to the back door of the diplomat's car from behind. One embassy staff member, a local employee and two passers-by had got injured in that attack.At almost the same time, a bomb was also found beneath an Israeli diplomat's car in Georgia and was defused.Asked whether Israel will continue with its peace efforts with the Arab world despite such attacks, he said, "Surely, we will. The history shows that this kind of events not only fails to stop us, they strengthen us and we will be growing more rapidly.""We will continue thriving and forging new ties and advancing peace and stability in the region. So of course, all our achievements are for more stability, more collaboration, more friendships. We are not afraid of those who want destabilisation."We understand that our enemies want destabilisation but they are not going to stop us or scare us. We are going to continue, as we have done till now," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-surprised-at-evil-attack-as-we-were-on-higher-alert-for-few-weeks-israeli-envoy-101612010996405.html

SII's chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla has said his company is hopeful of launching Covovax by June this year.US biotech firm Novavax said on Thursday that NVX-CoV2373, its two-shot Covid-19 vaccine, showed an overall efficacy of 89.3% in a major Phase 3 clinical trial in Britain and was highly effective against a variant first identified there. However, other results have shown it offered significantly less protection against a highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus first identified in South Africa.Also read | Serum Institute applies for bridging trial approval for Novavax Covid vaccineNovavax said it began working on new vaccines against emerging strains in early January and expects to select ideal candidates in the coming days, then begin clinical testing in the second quarter of the year. "NVX-CoV2373 has the potential to play an important role in solving this global public health crisis. We look forward to continuing to work with our partners, collaborators, investigators and regulators around the world to make the vaccine available as quickly as possible," Stanley Erck, the company's president and CEO, has said.Here's what you need to know about the Novavax vaccine:1. The vaccine was one of six candidates backed by a US government project formerly known as Operation Warp Speed, which has provided the company $1.75 billion. It's also being tested in a trial in the US and Mexico, which has recruited 16,000 of 30,000 participants.2. The Novavax shot injects the same molecules directly into the body to evoke an immune response. The Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines deliver the genetic instructions to make a protein of the virus to human cells.3. The trial in the UK involved 15,000 people aged 18 to 84, including 27% who were over the age of 65. The first interim analysis was based on 62 cases, of which 56 cases of Covid-19 were observed in the placebo group versus six cases among people who received NVX-CoV2373.4. NVX-CoV2373 contains a full-length, prefusion spike protein made using Novavax's recombinant nanoparticle technology and the company's proprietary saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant. The purified protein is encoded by the genetic sequence of the Sars-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and is produced in insect cells.5. It can neither cause Covid-19 nor can it replicate, is stable at 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius (refrigerated) and is shipped in a ready-to-use liquid formulation that permits distribution using existing vaccine supply chain channels.Also read | In boost for India, Novavax finds vaccine 89% effective6. The company's preliminary analysis indicated the variant first identified in Britain, B.1.1.7, was detected in more than 50% of the confirmed cases.7. Efficacy by strain was calculated at 95.6% against the original Covid strain, and 85.6% against B.1.1.7. But the efficacy was much lower in a smaller, mid-stage trial conducted in South Africa.8. This study enrolled just over 4,400 patients from September to mid-January, during which time the B.1.351 variant, which contains critical mutations along with the virus' spike protein, was spreading rapidly through the country.9. In this trial the overall efficacy was 49.4% but the figure rose to 60% among the 94% of trial participants who were HIV-negative.10. Novavax has a deal with Pune-based SII for the manufacture of at least a billion doses of its vaccine for low- and middle-income countries and India.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-seeks-trial-nod-for-novavax-covid-19-shot-efficacy-advantage-availability-101612010826218.html

The criminals intercepted him and fired indiscriminately from close range. Singh received a bullet injury on his leg while Hasan was injured on his waist. Both were admitted to a private nursing home. “The cause of this murderous attack is yet to be ascertained,” said SDPO Santosh Kumar.The police have taken a few people into custody in connection with the firing, which allegedly was due to past enmity. “Police teams have been deployed in sensitive areas to avoid any untoward incident,” added Kumar. The RJD was quick to call the incident as the ‘return of maha jungle raj in the state’.“Is there any public order in the state?” questioned former RJD MLA Chandrasekhar Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-worker-associate-shot-at-in-bihar-s-saharsa-101612007801795.html

30-01-2021||India||Govt to introduce bill for banning cryptocurrencies. Here's what you need to know||The Union government is reportedly going to table a bill in the Budget Session of Parliament banning all private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in India and which will also deal with the creation of a legislative framework for an official digital currency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is also exploring the option of issuing a digital version of the rupee, which could serve as the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a booklet on payment systems has said.Here's what you need to know about cryptocurrencies and the government's move to regulate it:What are cryptocurrencies?Cryptocurrencies are also known as convertible virtual currency, which can be exchanged for fiat currencies. However, not all virtual currency can be exchanged for conventional money and so not all virtual currency is convertible. Cryptocurrencies are not backed or regulated by central banks, like conventional currencies are. Anybody on the internet can mine or create and trade in them. In the United States dealing in cryptocurrencies invites taxation however, this is not the scenario everywhere else in the world. Unlike regular currency, cryptos have no physical entity and only exist online.Bitcoin is the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, it has a convertible value, which has been witnessing record highs the past few months. It came into existence following the 2009 housing market crash. All bitcoin transactions are maintained in an open-source ledger that anyone can get access to. Bitcoins are convertible into US dollars.Bitcoin saw a flurry of activity recently and a mild endorsement by Elon Musk has attracted the attention of Indian investors. WazirX, BuyUCoin, CoinSwitch Kuber are some of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the country.Why is the government bringing a bill to ban cryptocurrencies?The Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which is scheduled to be tabled at the upcoming Union Budget session, aims “to create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency” and “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India” a Lok Sabha bulletin released on Friday said. Adding that “It allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses,".In the January 25 booklet, RBI had said that the government is wary of cryptocurrency and the risk that comes with their operation, but the option of digitizing the current fiat currency is being explored. “In India, the regulators and governments have been sceptical about these currencies and are apprehensive about the associated risks. Nevertheless, RBI is exploring the possibility as to whether there is a need for a digital version of fiat currency and, in case there is, how to operationalize it," said RBI.Cryptocurrencies are decentralised payment systems, ie they are not backed or regulated by any central banks like conventional fiat currencies are. This creates a point of worry and contention for central banks like RBI. RBI joins the chorus of the European Central Bank, which too has issued similar warnings and cautions against cryptocurrencies.RBI had previously attempted to ban cryptocurrencies in 2018, but the order was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2020. Another similar bill proposing a 10-year imprisonment for any individual found to be dealing with cryptocurrencies was drafted in 2019.What is Central Bank Digital Currency?Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) like the one RBI aims to create are just fiat or conventional currencies in their digital form. The “technology” that the new bill seeks to protect is the blockchain technology that backs the operation of cryptocurrencies. CBDC is designed to act as a digital version of a country’s fiat currency and is backed by a suitable amount of monetary reserves like gold or foreign currency reserves. Central banks are supporting the creation of CBDC to compete with cryptocurrencies. CBCDs essentially are a digital currency that has the regulation and backing of the government and the accessibility of a digital currency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-introduce-bill-for-banning-cryptocurrencies-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-101612007129123.html
30-01-2021||India||SC Collegium withdraws approval for appointment of judge behind recent controversial POCSO rulings||The Supreme Court Collegium is understood to have withdrawn its approval to a proposal for the appointment of an additional judge of the Bombay High Court, Justice P V Ganediwala, as a permanent judge of the court following her two controversial verdicts in sexual assault cases.The decision was taken after the judge faced flak for her interpretation of sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, a source said.Justice Pushpa Ganediwala recently acquitted a man accused of groping a 12-year-old girl's breast because he did not make skin-to-skin contact and days earlier, ruled that holding the hands of a five-year-old girl and unzipping the trousers do not amount to "sexual assault" under the POCSO Act.On January 27, the Supreme Court stayed the Bombay High Court order acquitting the man after Attorney General K K Venugopal said the order would set a dangerous precedent.The collegium headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, at a meeting held on January 20, had okayed the proposal for making Justice Ganediwala a permanent judge.In two other judgments this month, Justice Ganediwala acquitted two men accused of raping minor girls after noting that the testimonies of the victims did not inspire confidence to fix criminal liability on the accused."No doubt the testimony of the prosecutrix (victim) is sufficient for conviction of the accused. However, the same ought to inspire confidence of this court. It ought to be of sterling quality," she said in one of the judgments.Justice Pushpa Virendra Ganediwala was born on March 3, 1969 at Paratwada in Maharashtra's Amravati district.She was a panel advocate for various banks and insurance companies and was also an honorary lecturer in various colleges of Amravati and gave lectures to the MBA and LLM students of the Amravati University.She was directly appointed as a district judge in 2007 and was elevated as an additional judge of the Bombay High Court on February 13, 2019.Besides the CJI, justices N V Ramana and R F Nariman are part of the three-member collegium, which takes decisions with regard to high court judges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-collegium-withdraws-approval-for-appointment-of-judge-behind-recent-controversial-pocso-rulings-101612001468262.html

Many of them held hands but many others chose to simply stand with a safe distance from each other in view of the physical distancing norms in force because of Covid-19.The RJD leader bristled when asked about Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's remark suggesting that the opposition seemed to have taken a leaf out of his book.Also read| Centre stands by offer made to farmers: PM Modi at all party meetWhen approached by journalists with questions about the "manav shrinkhla", Kumar had replied with a broad grin "we had organised human chains in 2017 in support of prohibition and against dowry and child marriage the following year. Last year, a human chain held to spread awareness about climate change in addition to the issues we had previously raised broke all records"."It is nice that others are also drawing inspiration. Everybody has the right to hold such programmes," he had said with a smirk.Yadav responded with distaste "it is a petty remark. Is he the first person to have ever held a human chain? He should instead make his stand clear on the new farm laws".RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha, who stood nearby, said, "The human chains sponsored by the chief minister depended upon the bureaucracy for its success. Officials concerned were given targets of turnouts to achieve. What is happening here today is spontaneous."Notably, the RJD had taken part in the 2017 human chain while it shared power with Kumar. Its jailed supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was then out on bail, had famously stood at Gandhi Maidan to demonstrate his support for liquor ban.Also read| Internet suspended till Jan 31 at border areas in Delhi amid farmers' protestJha, who is a member of the Rajya Sabha, also described the Centre's talks with agitating farmers as "a monologue, instead of a dialogue, a reason why Delhi's borders at Singhu and Ghazipur have been on fire".Prominent among those who took part in the human chain at the state capital were CPI(ML) secretary general Dipankar Bhattacharya and Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma.The human chain was also formed in districts. In Nawada, local Congress MLA Neetu Singh was among those who participated in the demonstration. In Begusarai, Congress, RJD and Left workers stood in front of the district headquarters and other places.No untoward incident was reported from anywhere so far though the officials said the human chain was held without permission.Leaders of the ruling NDA in the state came out with statements claiming that the human chain was a "flop".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grand-alliance-in-bihar-forms-human-chains-against-new-farm-laws-101612003959058.html

30-01-2021||India||Odisha asks districts to speed up Covid 19 vaccination drive as numbers slide||The Odisha government has asked all district collectors and municipal commissioners to ensure 100% Covid vaccination of all healthcare workers by February 10 deadline, even as the rate of vaccination in the state dropped to the lowest ever figure of 71% on Friday.On Friday, Odisha could vaccinate 11,142 healthcare workers out of the targeted 15,701, achieving 71% of its daily goal, while the state government continued to claim that it was No1 in achieving vaccination targets among all states. Lakshadweep, with more than 80% of its vaccination target achieved, was the all-India topper."Clear message should be given that those who do not turn up for vaccination when called on the designated date will forgo the opportunity to get a free vaccine from the government. The 1st dose of vaccination for all healthcare workers will close on 10th February. In this matter, it is of great concern that in some districts, the percentage coverage of health workers vaccinated in the past week is poor," state health secretary PK Mohapatra wrote in a letter.The state government plans to start giving the second dose of vaccine to healthcare workers from February 15, exactly 28 days after the first jab.Till Friday, 60.53% of the total 350,726 healthcare workers in Odisha were vaccinated. The drive went poorly in 9 districts, including Khurda and Cuttack. The coverage in Deogarh was lowest at 42%, followed by Khurda- 61% & Jajpur- 62%.Last week, the state exceeded its daily target for a couple of days till some sort of complacency set in. Despite the glitches in the Co-Win app, officials overcame the problems by sending Google sheets to districts for uploading the vaccination statistics, which was then uploaded on the Co-Win app at Bhubaneswar, where the internet connectivity is a lot better. The state government also sent SMS to individual beneficiaries and conducted vaccination every day, except Sunday.Even in big hospitals, such as AIIMS Bhubaneswar, the vaccination coverage has been very low. Only 1,426 healthcare workers, merely 35% of the target, had got the jab there. While more than 79% of the targeted security staff and 67% of the targeted IT staff had been vaccinated, only 57% faculty members had received the shot, with several senior faculty members yet to take the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-asks-districts-to-speed-up-covid-19-vaccination-drive-as-numbers-slide-101612004024982.html

The two performed traditional rituals and pujas.The temple has been built on a 12-acre plot in Thirumangalam and has cost ₹50-lakh. The bronze statues weigh 400-kg each.Speaking after the unveiling, Palaniswami asked the workers to work towards winning the assembly elections slated for April-May.“Among the leaders in India, it is the two of them who lived for the people and not for themselves,” Palaniswami said. “Even after their deaths, they continue to live in the hearts of people like Gods. Their schemes to uplift the poor and marginalised can never be forgotten. They didn’t have children, those gathered here are their children. And our only goal is to continue their (MGR-Jayalalithaa) governance.”The party hopes to get a third term after winning back-to-back polls under Jayalalithaa’s leadership. She passed away in office in December 2016. MGR in 1972 formed the ADMK (later AIADMK). He was the chief minister until his death in 1987.The unveiling comes as Jayalalithaa's aide and expelled leader V K Sasikala is set to return to Chennai following her release from prison after serving a term in a disproportionate assets case.The Palaniswami-led AIADMK has said she will not be re-inducted into the party.Earlier this week, the government also inaugurated an 80-crore memorial for Jayalalithaa at her burial place on the Marina beach in Chennai. A day later, they opened her residence Veda Nilayam in Chennai as a memorial and later unveiled a nine-foot statue of Jayalalithaa at the city's Lady Willingdon College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cm-unveils-temple-for-aiadmk-leaders-jayalalithaa-mgr-101612001209234.html

Gandhi was referring to the FIR filed by Gurugram Police against seven people, including Congress leader Shashi Tharoor and journalist Rajdeep Sardesai, for allegedly “misreporting” and “spreading disharmony” during the clashes between the police and the protesting farmers on Republic Day. The FIR was filed on the basis of a complaint by a resident of Jharasa district in Haryana who accused the Tharoor, Sardesai and five other journalists of spreading "false and misleading information.""The practice by the BJP government to threaten journalists and public representatives through FIRs is dangerous. Respect for democracy is not the will of the government but its responsibility. The atmosphere of fear is like poison for democracy," Gandhi tweeted. "The BJP government has destroyed the dignity of democracy by lodging the FIR to intimidate senior journalists and public representatives," she said in another tweet.Police have filed the case under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 124A (sedition), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The complaint was registered at the Cyber police station of Gurugram. Earlier, Noida Police had also registered an FIR on the same set of people and on similar allegations.Tens of thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana are protesting against the new farm laws at several Delhi borders. The protests derailed on January 26 when farmers who were carrying out tractor rallies barged inside the Red Fort and hoisted their own flag at its ramparts. During the rally, agitating farmers also broke barricades and vandalised public property as they clashed with the police. One farmer was killed and nearly 400 police personnel were injured during the violence.They are agitating against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmosphere-of-fear-is-like-poison-for-democracy-priyanka-gandhi-on-fir-against-7-including-tharoor-journalists-101612003179849.html
30-01-2021||India||From 1 to 1,69,824: Where India stands on Covid-19 map a year after||On this day a year ago, India detected its first case of Covid-19, when a 20-year-old student from Thrissur, Kerala returned home from Wuhan. A year later, India has 1,69,824 active Covid-19 cases, which is a much better situation than what was a few months ago. With a recovery rate of 96.96%, and two vaccines already rolled out, India is better prepared to take on Covid-19 today.Here are a few takeaways/milestones of India's one-year journey:Lockdown and unlockAfter the first case was detected on January 30, Indian went into a national lockdown on March 25, which also led to an unprecedented migrant crisis. Indian economy was also hit hard with economic operations coming to a halt. The finance ministry released several stimulus packages catering to all sections of people. Like several stages of lockdowns, there was a stagewise unlocking starting from June.Kerala still struggling with an increasing caseloadGround Zero Kerala has been one of the most worst-hit states. The state currently has 72,239 active cases, the highest in the country, and logged 6,268 new infections on Friday, pushing the total tally to 9,17,630. Kerala had managed to rein in the virus last year when much of the country was struggling with it. But with international traffic, festivals, the spread of the infection could not be contained much. The death toll as of today stands at 3,704, which the state government claims is significantly lower given its high infection rate.Dharavi ModelDharavi, Asia’s largest slum, where people are cooped into close living quarters with shared toilet facilities was a huge cause of worry for the Maharashtra government. Experts and government alike feared that Dharavi, where social distancing was next to impossible, would explode with Covid-19 cases, which happened but the tables were turned by rigorous testing, detection, isolation, and treatment. On Friday, Dharavi reported six new cases, after reporting zero new cases for two days straight. The continent's largest slum currently has a total of 3,917 cases, while the number of active cases stands at 16.2 wave, 2 vaccinesAmid unlocking, several Indian states, including Kerala, Delhi, reported a second wave of Covid-19. In September, India witnessed the worst situation as daily cases ranged between 75,000 and 90,000. The highest single-day spike was 96,551 fresh cases in 24 hours.In October, the situation bettered and in December, both Bharat Biotech and Pune's Serum Institute of India applied for emergency use of their vaccines.In the meantime, new strains of Coronavirus started cropping up in the UK, South Africa, and other parts of the world.In January, both the vaccine makers were given a go-ahead for emergency use and India started the largest vaccination drive on January 16 — before the first year anniversary of Covid-19 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-1-to-1-69-824-where-india-stands-on-covid-19-map-a-year-after-101612002520729.html

The state has so far taken action against 113 officials over graft charges and inefficiency.Deputy director of mines, Madan Mohan Biswal, who was arrested for his alleged involvement in the multi-crore mining scam in 2009, has been handed out compulsory retirement while mining officer Ramesh Chandra Mahalik was asked to retire over similar charges said the release.Joint labour commissioner Sarat Choudhary and divisional labour commissioner Namita Dash have been handed out compulsory retirement on grounds of gross inefficiency, it stated.Assistant conservator of forest, Laxman Pradhan, range officer Bharat Kumar Ghadei, Bolangir, Muribahal range officer Prashant Nayak and Rayagada district labour officer, Pradip Bhoi have been given compulsory retirement over corruption charges against them.In September 2019, the Naveen Patnaik government had issued a circular saying service records of state government employees, aged 50 years or more, will be reviewed and a premature retirement order will be handed out to those found lacking in integrity.Since then dozens of government employees have been handed out premature retirement. In December last year, the government recommended the name of Abhay Pathak, senior officer of the Indian Forest Service for compulsory retirement after disproportionate assets worth ₹9.35 crore, the highest ever in Odisha, was found in his possession.All the departments have been asked to get a committee to review performance and service record of group A, B, C and D employees every 3 months, to identify staff that needs to be retired prematurely.Employees, who complete 30 years of qualifying service or attain 50 or 55 years of age, would come under the purview of the drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-more-odisha-officials-given-compulsory-retirement-for-corruption-inefficiency-101612002046754.html

(But) strict surveillance (is) to be kept on persons who tested positive at the airport and kept in home quarantine,” said the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-mandatory-institutional-quarantine-for-fliers-from-uk-delhi-govt-101612000865900.html

The police had to resort to tear gas shelling to restore order, and a policeman was seriously injured after one of the farmers lunged at him with a sword. More than 40 people have been arrested, including the farmer who injured the police official, the Station House Officer (SHO) of a local police station.Opposition parties, including the AAP and the Congress, have also accused the BJP of being behind the violence during Tuesday’s “kisan tractor parade”. Actor Deep Sidhu, one of several protesters present at the historic Red Fort when a Sikh religious flag was hoisted there, has been accused of being a BJP “mole.” This came after pictures surfaced on social media of Sidhu with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP MP Sunny Deol, who is himself an actor.

The panchayat has decided to throw its weight behind the protest.After Ghaziabad administration asked the protesters at Ghazipur site to vacate the place, Naresh Tikait initially decided to yield to the pressure. On Thursday evening, he announced that the Ghazipur site will be vacated. His brother and union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, however, held the fort and said he will commit suicide but not vacate the protest site. His emotional video apparently mobilised a number of farmers who set out for the Ghazipur site.Though the difference of opinion between the two brothers came across as a discord, Nareh Tikait later said that his brother's tears will not go in vain.Uttar Pradesh Police, however, has said that there was additional security at the site on Thursday to keep an eye on outsiders entering the protest site to create disruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-head-to-delhi-naresh-tikait-may-join-brother-rakesh-tikait-in-protest-101611994981278.html

Speaking at the meeting, the PM said discussions in Parliament will be a way out of the current logjam, even as a clutch of opposition parties demanded more discussions on the new farm laws.Parliamentary affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi told media persons that the Prime Minister, at the meeting, said that whatever was discussed between the Agriculture minister and the farm leaders at the 11th meeting still stands good. “Agriculture minister Tomar had said that the government is open for discussions; he also said that I (Tomar) am a phone call away and I am ready for discussions and this still stands good,”Joshi said.Joshi also said the government is ready for discussions on a range of issues that the opposition wants. He said discussion will be taken up in the second half of the budget session.As per people aware of the meeting, the Prime Minister also noted that disruptions in Parliament affect the smaller parties the most. He said smaller parties must get more time to speak in Parliament and that they must prevail on the parties with more representatives to not disrupt the functioning.A second person privy to the meeting said most of the floor leaders agreed that Parliament must be allowed to function and the issues related to the farm agitation can be taken up during the discussions on the President’s address and during the discussion on the budget.BJD’s Pinaki Misra who was present for the meeting said, Odisha chief minister and BJD president, Naveen Patnaik, has specifically requested the Union government to have the women's reservation bill passed in this budget session.He said the BJD gave 7 out of 21 MP tickets to women in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the only political party to have done so.According to a person aware of the details, the YSR Congress and the TRS, too, backed Odisha CM’s demand for the passage of women's reservation bill in the forthcoming session. The bill was earlier passed in Rajya Sabha in 2010.On Friday, the Prime Minister had expressed hope that MPs from across political parties will contribute to make the budget session effective in meeting the aspirations of the people. The opposition parties, which boycotted the President‘s address on Friday, are likely to attack the government on a raft of issues, including the ongoing farmers’ agitation for repealing the contentious farm laws, escalation of tensions between India and China along the line of actual control and the government’s response to the corona pandemic and its impact on the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-stands-by-offer-made-to-farmers-pm-modi-at-all-party-meet-101611997421719.html
30-01-2021||India||Expanding children, parent, relative definition will leave no scope for ambiguity: Parliament panel||Expanding the definition of children, parent and relative in a draft bill will leave no scope for any legal ambiguity, a parliamentary standing committee report said.The bill aims to expand the definition of children to include son-in-law, daughter-in-law, biological or adoptive or step son and daughter, minors through legal guardian, parent to include father-in-law, mother-in-law and grandparents, whether or not a senior citizen and relatives to include minor through legal guardian.The standing committee evaluated the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2019."The committee deem it to be a significant measure as maintenance may now be claimed from all admissible relatives/legal heirs of parents and senior citizens. Further, the above change in the definition of 'children' has also been concomitantly reflected in the definition of 'parent' in the Amendment Bill," it said.They also noted that with the revised definition of 'relative' in the Bill, wherein minors have been included in the category of 'relative', senior citizens would now be able to claim maintenance from minors, too, through their legal guardians."The Committee further note that the definition of 'welfare' in the Amendment Bill has been expanded to include provision for food, clothing, housing, safety and security, medical attendance, healthcare, treatment, recreation and other amenities necessary for physical and mental well being of parents and senior citizens which has given welfare oriented impetus to it in actual sense," it said."Overall the Committee opine that the modified definitions in the Amendment Bill will impart a practical, holistic and broader orientation to the MWPSC Act, 2007, thus leaving no scope for any legal ambiguity," it said.The Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry told the committee that the expansion of the existing definition will enable parents/senior citizens to claim maintenance allowance from all admissible relatives.The bill also proposes removal of a ceiling of ₹10,000 as maximum maintenance amount to be awarded to parents/senior citizens which the government told the standing committee will ensure that it is fixed according to the needs of parent and senior citizens and capability of children or legal heirs to pay the maintenance allowance based on their earnings."This will help parent/senior citizens to lead a life of dignity which is commensurate with their normal standard of living," the ministry told the standing committee.The committee is happy that the government has finally acknowledged that maintenance includes more than a mere sum of money. The concept of maintenance has been rendered complete and holistic now, by the above amendment, the report said.Another noteworthy aspect of the amendment is that the tribunal may now take into consideration the standard of living and earning of the parent/senior citizens or of the children or relative, while determining the maintenance, it said.The committee also welcomed the substitution of another important subsection pertaining to the publicity of the maintenance order. It is convinced that the pasting of this order on the notice board of the tribunal and its availability on the website of the department concerned will encourage other harassed parents/senior citizens to seek legal redress of their grievances."Fearing social disgrace, it could also act as a deterrent for children and relatives to properly attend to the needs of the older persons in their respective families," it said.The draft bill also includes the appointment of nodal police officers for senior citizens at every police station and district-level special police unit with a helpline for senior citizens.The committee view it as a landmark change to ensure that senior citizens can easily approach the police in abuse/abandonment cases, provided this clause is implemented by all states promptly. They feel that the police should be the first point of contact for grievance redressal in such cases, much before the courts or tribunals come into picture, the report said.It suggested that provisions for training and sensitisation of the nodal officers and special police unit should also be made in the rules to be framed after the enactment of this bill.The said amendment bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in December 2019 and was referred to the standing committee on social justice and empowerment for examination and report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expanding-children-parent-relative-definition-will-leave-no-scope-for-ambiguity-parliament-panel-101611997024305.html

Anybody who shares the ideology of the BKU and Rakesh Tikait are welcome here. But it is our appeal to those who do not wish to support the movement till the end that please do not come only to leave in between," he said.Asked about estimated crowd size at the site, the farmer leader from western Uttar Pradesh said, "Farmers are coming in to show solidaRity and leaving. It is not a stagnant crowd."On Saturday night, the BKU office-bearers had estimated a crowd of around 10,000 people at Ghazipur while the Ghaziabad police officials pegged it around 5,000 to 6,000.Heavy security deployment, including personnel of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), Rapid Action Force (RAF) in anti-riot gears and civil police, was made at the protest site.Meanwhile, the Delhi Traffic Police said to and fro movement on the National Highway 24 (Delhi-Meerut Expressway) has been closed.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bku-digs-its-heels-in-at-ghazipur-border-more-supporters-pouring-in-101611996610054.html

It might be connected, there might be a pattern. We are investigating and this is one of the options," he said.A low-intensity explosion took place near the Israel Embassy on Friday. No injuries have been reported in the incident so far. Windscreens of several cars parked in the vicinity of the Embassy on Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road were found damaged.On February 13, 2012, an Israeli embassy car exploded when a magnetic bomb stuck to it went off in a high-security area in New Delhi, injuring a wife of an Israeli defence envoy to New Delhi.On the same day, a bomb was also planted under an Israeli diplomatic car in the Georgian capital Tbilisi but it failed to detonate.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then accused Iran of being behind both the incidents in 2012 - allegations denied by Tehran.Malka suspected that Friday's blast outside the Israeli Embassy could be a "terror attack"."As of now, our strong assumption is that it is a terror attack that targeted the Israeli Embassy. Fortunately, nobody was hurt," the envoy said.The explosion took place not far from Vijay Chowk, where several VVIPS including Indian President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were in attendance during the 'Beating Retreat' ceremony.Asserting that Israel has "full trust" in the Indian authorities, Malka said that there is a full collaboration between Indian and Israeli authorities.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has assured the Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi of "fullest protection" to their diplomats."EAM (S Jaishnakar) called our Minister of Foreign Affairs (Gabi Ashkenazi) and Foreign Secretory Harsh Vardhan Shringla called our DG in Ministry of Foreign Affairs. NSA Ajit Doval called our NSA Meir Ben-Shabbat. There is full collaboration. They gave their assurances and offered all support, protection or assistance that we need," he said.Investigators have recovered an envelope with text written on it related to Israel Embassy officials from the blast site, according to sources."The envelope has a text related to an Israel embassy official. It is a case for investigating officers to see whether or not it has any link with the case. But, it has been recovered from the blast site," a senior government official told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israeli-ambassador-says-blast-may-be-connected-to-2012-attack-on-diplomats-101611995684534.html

Internet services were suspended in several areas in Punjab and Haryana as well."If the administration is thinking that by suspending internet services they will be able to stop the movement, they are grossly mistaken. The more they want to muzzle farmers' voices, the larger the protest will go," Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said.गाजीपुर बॉर्डर पर इंटरनेट बंद कर दिया है सरकार ने , उन्हें लगता है कि इससे आंदोलन को वो कमजोर कर देंगे तो ये उनका वहम है । किसानों की आवाज़ को कुचलने के वो जितना प्रयास करेंगे ये आंदोलन उतना बड़ा होता जाएगा।On Friday, tempers rose at Singhu border, which is the main site of the farmers' protest since November, as clashes broke out between farmers and a group of people who came to oust the farmers. The two groups engaged in stone-pelting while Delhi Police had to fire multiple rounds of teas gas shells. During the clash, Delhi Police SHO Pradeep Paliwal was attacked.‘Restore internet or face more protests’: Farm union to governmentThe group of people claimed themselves to be locals, though AAP said they were BJP goons. Tikri border too witnessed unrest on Friday as a group of about 50 persons tried to get near the spot where farmers are protesting. But the situation was soon brought under control.After Friday's clash at Singhu, the Delhi Police said they have arrested 44 people, including the man who attacked the SHO with a sword.On Republic Day, the internet disruption affected many parts of Delhi and the services were only restored the next day. Protesters at the border points, however, complained that internet services were not fully restored to them after Republic Day.The Ghazipur protest site remained peaceful, though the crowd swelled there as several farmers joined the site after Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait's emotional appeal went viral. On Saturday morning, slow internet was reported from Ghazipur as well, before the MHA ordered temporary suspension.The tractor march taken out by farmers on Republic Day became a flashpoint in a so-far peaceful protest as a group of protesters entered the Capital, clashed with Police at ITO, marched to the Red Fort and put up Nishan Sahib on top it. The incident put farmers leaders under fire though they alleged BJP conspiracy to derail their "peaceful" movement.In the aftermath of the Republic Day incident, the Uttar Pradesh Police removed a group of protesters from Baghpat. A similar move was apprehended at the Ghazipur protest site as the Ghaziabad district administration asked the protesters to vacate the area. However, the protesters have not yielded and more protesters joined in the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internet-suspended-till-january-31-at-border-areas-amid-farmers-protest-101611995435268.html

It can link to any database and users can feed the information they need to analyse.“You can connect to that data source and prepare that dashboard which will present the information in a more coherent manner,” said an official. “It also has a social media handler [and] can do predictive analysis. The features available are similar to other business intelligence tools.”The official said the service could also be used to analyse tabular data. “We are enhancing its features further. It can even do a data word map to track what information appears most often.”The price for using the service will vary, starting at a basic cost of ₹21 lakh. Even the government will have to pay for it, the official said.The software will also be able to analyse the feedback provided to the government for various schemes.

Kalicharan Vipta has since been struggling to get it cancelled and secretary of the local gram panchayat punished for issuing it.“They told me that on papers, I died in 1958 … I am alive. They have declared me dead. I want justice,” said Vipta as he showed the certificate.Vipta, a resident of Budhaar village in Koriya district, can barely walk and hear but he has been visiting revenue offices of his tehsil to get the certificate cancelled.“This is the saddest thing, I witnessed at this age. I appeal the Chhattisgarh government to help me.”In his letter to the district Collector, Vipta said the certificate was issued without any investigation.Vipta’s grandson, Lakshman Yadav, said his grandfather had filed an application for division of family land about six months ago in the local tehsil office.Kalicharan's lawyer, Arvind Kushwaha, said he has submitted an application demanding that the person who issued the certificate should be summoned with all related documents.“The death certificate was issued by panchayat secretary. The certificate issued is fake, and we hope that the court will take appropriate action against the concerned officials,” said Kushwaha.Collector SN Rathore said action will be taken after an investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nephew-declares-man-dead-to-encroach-upon-his-land-101611994201472.html

He cited the negative impact on the economy because of the Covid-19 pandemic and added the states should be allowed additional borrowing in the next financial year too.In a letter, Gehlot said the economic activities have resumed after the end of the nationwide lockdown imposed in March to check the pandemic, but they are far from reaching the normal levels. He added as such the payment of GST compensation to the states up to June 2022 be extended by five years.Gehlot said Rajasthan availed additional borrowing to the tune of 2% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in the current financial year. He added a similar provision of 2% additional borrowing should be allowed in the next financial year as well to enable the state government to take care of the liabilities.Gehlot said the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy would cause continued stunted growth. He added, as a result, the expected growth in GSDP would not be achieved and also the revenue streams would not reach desired levels.The Centre, which on Monday released the 13th instalment of ₹6,000 crore to the states to meet GST compensation shortfall, allowed a special borrowing window in October 2020 to meet the estimated shortfall of ₹1.10 lakh crore in revenue due to the GST implementation in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-writes-to-modi-seek-gst-compensation-to-states-for-five-more-years-101611993956392.html

30-01-2021||India||29 years of India-Israel relations: Some key points||A minor explosion outside the Israeli embassy in Delhi on Friday sent a scare across the country’s security establishment. The blast, incidentally, took place on a day diplomatic ties between India and Israel completed 29 years. The two countries share very close ties and have agreements in several fields, including defence, science, technology etc.Here’s a look at some key points on India-Israel ties:1. Though India officially recognised Israel in 1950, the two countries established full diplomatic ties only on January 29, 1992. As of December 2020, India is among 164 United Nations (UN) member states to have diplomatic ties with Israel.2. India has its embassy in the second-largest Israeli city of Tel Aviv. Israel, meanwhile, has its embassy in India in Delhi. It also has consulates in Mumbai and Bengaluru.3. Jerusalem, which Israel considers as its capital, is also considered by Palestine as its capital city. This is why most countries have their embassies in Israel in the city of Tel Aviv. The United States recognised Jerusalem in December 2017, and shifted its embassy there in May 2018.4. In 1997, Ezer Weizman became the first President of Israel to visit India. In 2000, then home minister Lal Krishna Advani became the first Indian minister to visit Israel. The same year, Jaswant Singh became the first foreign minister of India to visit the country. Ariel Sharon became the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit India in 2003.5. The current Prime Ministers of the two countries, Narendra Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu, have visited the other’s country in recent years. While Modi visited Israel in July 2017, Netanyahu arrived in India next January; Modi broke protocol to personally receive him at the airport. Netanyahu, too, had personally received Modi in 2017.6. During his visit to Israel, Modi met Moshe Holtzberg, one of the youngest survivors of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. Now grown up, Moshe lost his parents in the attacks, and was rescued by his nanny, Sandra Samuel.7. Moshe, who turned 14 last November, came to Mumbai in 2018, accompanying Netanyahu on the trip. During Modi’s visit to Israel, the first by an Indian PM, the boy had expressed his wish to visit Mumbai.8. India is the largest buyer of military equipment from Israel, which, in turn, is the second-largest defence supplier to India, after Russia. India is also the tenth-largest trade partner of Israel, and the third-largest from Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-years-of-india-israel-relations-some-key-points-101611989248491.html
30-01-2021||India||Year after first Covid-19 case, Kerala continues to grapple with pandemic||A year after the country’s first Covid-19 case was detected in Thrissur on Jan 30 last year, Kerala continues to be in the throes of the pandemic, registering record highest active cases and test positivity rate (TPR). As on Friday, the state’s active case load is 72, 238 with a TPR of 10.66. Not just that, at least 44% of the country’s all new cases are from the southern state.Kerala’s first Covid-19 positive case, also the first in the country, was a 21-year- old female medical student, who tested positive four days after her return from disease epicentre of Wuhan in China. The girl’s father, a small-time businessman in Thrissur, told HT he was shattered at that moment.“My wife and I insisted on meeting her and enough prodding was required (for it to be allowed). For the first time in our lives, we both wore heavy PPE kits and met our daughter. When I recollect the meeting, it sends shivers down my spine,” he said.Soon after, the entire family was shifted to an institutional quarantine centre.Two days later, two other students, who had returned from China with the girl, also tested positive. Both turned negative after two weeks but the first patient had to spend 28 days in the hospital to turn negative and then another two weeks under mandatory observation.“I have talked about it enough. I don’t want to explain it all over again,” she refused to talk about the gruelling days.For almost two months after the outbreak, Kerala managed to restrict the spread of the disease. But in March, things took a dramatic turn after an Italy-returned family hid their travel history and interacted with many in Pathanamthitta.The state saw its first super spreader case which infected at least 22 others in the family and among the neighbours, including over 90-years old great grandparents. However, all of them were nursed back to life.During the countrywide lockdown between the end of March and the first week of May, the state managed things well. In the next two months (May-June), Kerala was on the verge of flattening the Covid curve and many, including the international media, lauded its pandemic control measures.But things took a turn for the worse when a large number of residents started returning to the state from the Gulf countries in special flights organised by the Central government.After the Onam festival in the first week of September, cases again started to swell in the state. Many, including Union health minister Harsh Vardan, blamed the state for lowering its guard resulting in the second wave of infection. Situation aggravated in November again and it has yet not been contained fully.“Kerala is by no means a success story, but I won’t call it a failure too. In the state, real epidemic started when people started arriving from other states and the middle-east. There were tell-tale signs of community spread taking place but many ignored it. The rest of the story is a slow and steady spread of the epidemic,” said G Pramod Kumar, a former senior advisor to the united national development programme.Experts like him blame the situation on the “over-confidence” of the state and its over-dependence on the rapid antigen tests, which they claim led to the rise in infections and the high positivity rate. They even allege that the state was not willing to admit that it was an epidemic hub and flaunted old records to try and paint a rosy picture.However, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan put up a brave face saying the state did whatever it could and there was no flaw in the government's planning or execution.“Ups and downs are the nature of the pandemic. Even some of the developed countries are still struggling with the second and the third phase of the pandemic. Look at the case of Scandinavian countries,” he said, adding that the situation will improve by next month.He added that clamping another lockdown was not feasible and the state will have to learn to live with the pandemic, at least for some more time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/year-after-first-covid-19-case-kerala-continues-to-grapple-with-pandemic-101611988686772.html

It is a case for investigating officers to see whether or not it has any link with the case. But, it has been recovered from the blast site," a senior government official told ANI.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar assured the Israeli Foreign Minister of "fullest protection" to their diplomats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-blast-could-be-a-terror-attack-israeli-ambassador-to-india-101611987748200.html

30-01-2021||India||India observes Martyrs' Day today: All you need to know||Martyrs' Day is observed every year on January 30 to mark the death anniversary of the father of the nation Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. In 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse at one of his prayer meets. Godse, a nationalist, killed Gandhi by shooting at him three times from a close range.Gandhi was conferred the title of 'Mahatma' posthumously around 1915. While some claim Rabindranath Tagore used this title for him, others say residents of Gurukul Kangri first called him by the name. The Sanskrit word Mahatma means a great soul.Here is all you need to know about Gandhi and Martyrs' Day:- Gandhi was a lawyer in South Africa before an incident of racism that he faced made him shift back to India and become a social activist and a politician. He is remembered for his contribution to India's struggle for freedom from the British and his policy of truth and non-violence. - He spearheaded the civil disobedience movement against the British. The Salt Satyagraha was a big part of the movement as part of which Gandhi led a large group of people from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, a coastal village in Gujarat, to produce salt from seawater. It was a protest against the salt tax imposed by the British government in India.- Hindu fundamentalists accused Gandhi of being the reason for India's partition. In Godse's statement following his death sentence on November 8, 1949, he said that he was unhappy about Gandhi’s support for the Muslim community and blamed him for the partition of India and formation of Pakistan. - “I do say that my shots were fired at the person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin and destruction to millions of Hindus,” Godse said. “I bear no ill will towards anyone individually, but I do say that I had no respect for the present government owing to their policy, which was unfairly favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could clearly see that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi,” he added.- Godse and co-conspirator Narayan Apte were hanged for the murder of the father of the nation on November 15, 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-observes-martyrs-day-today-all-you-need-to-know-101611981113988.html

TMC election strategist Prashant Kishor was present at the meeting which started at 4 pm and continued till 5.30 pm.“She asked party leaders to adopt a positive attitude and concentrate on core issues. She was not at all concerned about leaders joining the BJP,” a senior TMC leader, who attended the meeting, said on condition of anonymity."She took up issues specific to different zones of Bengal and discussed the findings in recent surveys, carried out by the government. She was very optimistic about the success of the Duware Sarkar (government at the doorstep) programme that started two months ago," he added.The meeting was held hours after former forest minister Rajib Banerjee resigned from the state assembly amid speculations that he would join the BJP. Must Watch: ‘Don't indulge in all this’: BSF snaps at TMC’s charge of threatening voters“We have been asked to start a full-fledged campaign from February 1,” Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said after the meeting.Asked about Rajib Banerjee, who was seen carrying a photograph of the chief minister while leaving the assembly house, Roy said, “This is all drama. He has said a lot of things over the past few days. Those who want to leave the party are free to go. The chief minister made it clear long ago. The so-called dissidents may be of interest to the media.

While it is too soon to say that there will be a problem with the Jats, we are cautious. The party is continuing to reach out to community leaders and Khap (clan) elders,” said one of the leaders, a senior party functionary.On Thursday night, facing an ultimatum from Uttar Pradesh police to vacate the area, and the prospect of no power and water (the local administration cut of supplies of both to the campsite) farmer leader Rakesh Tikait broke down while appealing to farmers from western UP to join the protest; this resulted in a huge mobilisation of farmers at the Ghazipur border that continued through Friday.On Friday, opposition parties such as the Congress, the Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Indian National Lok Dal extended support to the farmers who are demanding a repeal of the farm laws.While the BJP has so far managed to quell voices of dissent in Haryana, where it runs a coalition government with the Jannayak Janta Party that counts Jats as its primary vote base, party leaders said it does not want a repeat of the violence that erupted in 2016 following the agitation by Jats seeking the benefits reserved for OBC communities.“Despite the 2016 Jat agitation, the party managed to increase its vote share in Haryana, but recent events have the potential to cause problems,” said a second leader.Since the beginning of the farmers’ agitation, over half a dozen JJP MLAs, a few independent legislators, and BJP leaders from the region have expressed concern over the handling of the crisis. In Rajasthan, the the BJP’s ally, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party leader and Nagaur MP, Hanuman Beniwal, parted ways with the party over the farm agitation.“The events that unfolded last night are avoidable. It does not augur well for the party to have the farm agitation take the form of communal politics,” added the second leader.Former national general secretary of the BJP and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Jain said the agitation is politically motivated.But experts said that doesn’t solve the party’s problem.Political commentator Manisha Priyam said the coming together of Sikhs and Jats is a message that the politics of identity is not enough.“The BJP government will have to address economic insecurities. The farm crisis shows that there is a fear among the landed, dominant castes (such as the Jats) that their land will go,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wary-after-jats-answer-protest-call-in-up-haryana-101611959795627.html
30-01-2021||India||Govt making it an issue of bloated ego, says RLD president Ajit Singh||Former Union minister Ajit Singh, who is the president of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and a prominent leader among Jats and farmers in western Uttar Pradesh, spoke to Brajendra K Parashar on the farmers’ agitation against the three agriculture laws, and the situation that arose after the violent protests in New Delhi on January 26, and the UP Police’s attempts to make the farmers vacate the protest site in Ghazipur. Edited excerpts:How do you see the agitation by farm unions on Delhi’s borders against the three agriculture laws?The country’s farmers have risen against the Modi government. They are convinced that the intention behind the three agriculture laws is not to promote their interests but to benefit corporates, and rightly so. The agitation is not confined to just Delhi’s borders. Similar agitations are being organised in many other states including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.What is wrong with the three laws, and do you think there is no need for reforms in agriculture marketing?There is always scope for reforms in any sector. I can also understand that every government has the prerogative to make new laws or make suitable changes in the existing ones... But it is always advisable to do so after due discussions with stakeholders, especially when a legislation has the potential to affect life and livelihood of the masses. Was there any justification for bringing the ordinances to impose laws on farmers? The Modi government also scuttled the traditional legislative process by not sending the Bills to the Select Committee for discussions. The way the ordinances were promulgated and later converted into the laws with same hurry created doubts in the minds of farmers. The outcome is for everyone to see.What is the way out now?The government must immediately withdraw all the three hurriedly enacted laws, respecting the general sentiments of farmers, and initiate a fresh process to bring new laws, if needed at all, after due consultation with farmers... The government is unnecessarily making the three laws an issue of a bloated ego.Can you justify the violence by a group farmers and hoisting of another flag at the Red Fort in Delhi?Nobody can justify this act, and we all condemn it. But the question is why did the police allow the protesters to enter Red Fort... There are allegations that he was a BJP man. Otherwise, there was no arson, no loot or shoot-out during the agitation.FIRs have been lodged against several farmer leaders and authorities are also believed to have given them ultimatum to end the stir.The authorities are acting in a dictatorial manner. They should have probed the charges before registering cases under the draconian provisions. UP Police are now harassing farmers who took their tractors to the rally. Do they think all this will scare farmers? Farmers are determined to continue their agitation and our party is lending full support to their peaceful protests.What message would you like to give to farmers?My only message to farmers is remain united, stay on course, and run the agitation peacefully. Victory will be yours because you are on the right path.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-making-it-an-issue-of-bloated-ego-says-rld-president-ajit-singh-101611959049598.html
30-01-2021||India||One person from each house to reach Delhi: Haryana khap leaders||Major khap (clan) panchayats in Haryana on Friday decided to send at least one person from each family to farmer protests on Delhi’s borders and socially boycott leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) , khap leaders said. Haryana is governed by a BJP-JJP coalition.The move came even as the Haryana government suspended mobile Internet in Rewari, Ambala, Jind, Bhiwani, Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Hisar, Rohtak, and Sirsa till Saturday evening, one of the most extensive internet blackouts in the state. The move is aimed at restricting communication between farm groups and preventing mobilisation. But the damage had already been done.One of the state’s most influential khaps, Kandela, held meetings at Kandela village on Friday. Likewise, the Dadan and Barh khaps hold their meetings at Uchana and Julana in Jind respectively. The Phogat khap met in Dadri, the Sarv khap in Rohtak , and the Sarv Sheoran khap at Kharkari village in Bhiwani.Balwant Nambardar, head of the Phogat Khap, said, “We have socially boycotted Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh and former Dadri MLA Rajdeep Phogat, who is a chairman in the BJP-JJP government. We will not call these leaders in our social functions.Om Prakash Hooda, president of Hooda Khap, said his clan has unanimously decided to restrict the entry of ruling party leaders and government officials in villages under their control until the three farm laws are repealed.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other northern states have been protesting at Delhi’s borders demanding the rollback of the three contentious farm laws passed in September last year.The farmers say they fear corporate farming will affect their earnings. However, the government continues to claim that the new laws would increase incomes of farmers and introduce a level-playing field.The khaps also decide to send reinforcements to the state’s borders with Delhi where farmers have been camping since November. The Sarv Panchayat khap held a meeting and said thousands of farmers from Haryana would soon reach Delhi’s borders. “The (Phogat) khap has decided to send at least one person from each family to Delhi’s border,” Nambardar added.“Hundreds of our tractors will head towards Ghazipur border tomorrow (Saturday) from Sampla here after visiting the statue of farm leader Chhotu Ram. We will ensure supply of milk and other items daily,” Hooda of Hooda khap said. On Friday, protesters blocked the Chandigarh- Jind highway; other protestors reached toll plazas in Rohtak, Dadri, Bhiwani, Jind, Hisar and other parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-person-from-each-house-to-reach-delhi-haryana-khap-leaders-101611956451909.html

A base (Shakti) of Shivling has also been found during digging at the site.“We think the temple was built on Panchayatana model like the Brahmeshwara and Chitrakarini temples which are of the 10th century origin. Another side of the wall is being dug out and it will require 10 more days to completely bring out the structures,” said Arun Mallick, superintendent of ASI's Bhubaneswar circle.Mallick said many ancient structures around the vicinity of Lingaraj temple are believed to have been damaged during the demolition drive carried out by the Odisha government for renovation of the old town area under Ekamra Kshetra Project.“Bhubaneswar is said to be city of more than 1000 temples. We believe many structures have been demolished during the current demolition exercise. We tried to reason with them about not carrying out indiscriminate demolition. But the state government did not take note of our protests,” he said.Among the heritage structures demolished around the Lingaraj temple are the 11th century Ganesh temple called Budha Ganesh on the northern side of Lingaraj complex. It has been listed as a protected monument years ago and is one of the smallest Ganesh temples of Bhubaneswar.The oldest structure in Bhubaneswar is Baitala temple, that is believed to have been built during 8th century by the Bhaumakara kings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asi-unearths-10th-century-temple-during-excavation-in-bhubaneswar-101611949719133.html

She had stated that they were in love and under pressure from her parents she had urged him to elope from their respective homes. They got married and consummate their marriage. The man was facing trial for offences under Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code, 1806, Section 6 of the POCSO Act and Section 9 of the Prohibition of the Child Marriage Act, 2006.Child-rights activists have been advocating for the legislation to be altered so the focus doesn’t deviate from serious cases and it doesn't criminalise consensual sexuality or romantic teenage relationships. "A majority of the POCSO cases booked in Tamil Nadu are cases related to romantic relationship and elopement," says Vidya Reddy, founder of Tulir, an organisation working on prevention and healing of child sexual abuse in India. "It prevents focus from the real POCSO cases." Activists says that several cases that are filed are of children between 16-18 years of age.Also read: Tikri simmers after ‘locals’ demand farmers’ evictionThe Madras High Court in its order also called for legislative changes observing that “an adolescent boy who is sent to prison in a case of this nature will be persecuted throughout his life... The legislature has to keep pace with the changing societal needs and bring about necessary changes in law and more particularly in a stringent law such as the POCSO Act.”While the court made legal references to orders in similar cases and of Supreme Court’s observations on quashing non-compoundable offences, it also drew on neurobiological studies, biosocial approach, behavioural sciences and first love.But the court maintained that this would apply differently in each case, adding that the “Court is not turning a blind eye to cases where the victim or survivor may, under the effect of trauma that they have undergone, tend to reconcile, blaming themselves or convincing themselves that the element of consent was in fact present. Nor is this Court scientifically justifying the genuineness or predicament of the accused in every case where it appears that the accused and victim child have been in a romantic relationship. That will depend on the facts and circumstances of each and every case.”Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch in 2018 wrote to the Ministry of Women and Child Development that POCSO which was framed to protect children shouldn't punish them. "It's been hard to come to a consensus on this legalisation," said M Andrew Sesuraj, convenor of the organisation."While in principle it is good to revisit the age of consent and protect boys from being punished for sexual acts that aren't criminal, our fear is that the changes shouldn't be misused once again in serious cases of rape and victims compromising. We haven't yet found a way to do this," Sesuraj stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pocso-wasn-t-for-adolescents-teenagers-in-romantic-relationships-madras-hc-101611945974059.html
30-01-2021||India||Tikait’s appeal triggers show of strength in Muzaffarnagar||Tens of thousands of farmers poured into the Government Inter College (GIC) grounds in western Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar town on Friday, a show of strength after government crackdown on protests against three agriculture laws forced farm leader Rakesh Tikait to issue an emotional appeal for support.Farmers said they left their villages in the middle of the night after calls for mobilisation given from temples, mosques and panchayats. Viral videos of Tikait breaking down late in the face of police ultimatum on Thursday and vowing to not vacate Ghazipur protest site, on the eastern fringe of Delhi, cemented their conviction.“The ongoing movement is a battle for the honour of farmers and, if it ends, it will damage our very existence,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Naresh Tikait after the seven-hour meeting, calling on farmers to strengthen the movement at Delhi’s borders.Naresh Tikait said that defeating Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Ajit Singh in the 2019 Lok Sabha election by supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was a mistake. “We will not commit this mistake again...,” he added, with Singh’s son Jayant Chaudhary next to him.Jayant lashed out at central and state governments. Holding a pot of water from the Ganga, Jayant asked the crowd to swear that anyone who didn’t support the farmers stir would be socially boycotted. He then dropped a fistful of salt in the pot, a local oath-taking tradition, to seal the promise. “It is a matter of life and death for farmers, but do not worry. All have to stay together, united in this -- this is Chaudhary sahab’s (Ajit Singh’s) message,” he said.The mobilisation began late night on Thursday. The Ghaziabad administration had given him an ultimatum to vacate the site, as part of a wider crackdown on the two-month-old protests in the aftermath of violence in Delhi on Republic Day.“Tears of the son of Chaudhary Mahendra Singh Tikait and my younger brother Rakesh Tikait will not go waste,” Naresh Tikait tweeted soon after, referring to their father, a legendary farm leader who held Delhi hostage in 1988 over demands such as free power and water for cultivators.By morning, farmers from Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Saharanpur, Meerut, Baghpat, Bijnor and other districts of western UP had taken tractors, cars, scooters and trucks to come to the GIC grounds, which can hold up to 100,000 people.When the mahapanchayat began, the venue was packed with people, many of whom were defiant in front of the heavy police presence. “Thousands of people arrived for the mahapanchayat and it was self-driven,” said Anuj Baliyan, a resident of Soram village. “I have not seen such a self-driven and motivated crowed in my life. Roads of Muzaffarnagar were jammed with tractors and the entire ground was packed with people,” he added.Emotions ran high at the meeting as people recalled Rakesh Tikait’s vow to not touch water until the farm laws were rescinded by the government.Vice president of BKU (Bhanu) Chaudhary Diwakar Singh said he defied his leader Bhànu Pratap’s decision to withdraw from the movement. “Rakesh Tikait’s tears have turned it into a complete farmers’ movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tikaits-appeal-triggers-show-of-strength-in-muzaffarnagar-101611945317515.html
30-01-2021||India||Cop to farm leader: Tracing Tikait’s journey||Rakesh Tikait, to whom the Delhi Police issued a notice asking him to explain why legal action should not be taken against him for breaching the agreement with police regarding the tractor rally on January 26, is himself a former Delhi Police constable.And the ongoing farmers’ protest, specifically a tearful speech he delivered when all seemed lost, could well mark his ascension as his father’s son. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson is a prominent name in the farmers’ movement and belongs to the well-known Tikait family of Sisauli village in Muzaffarnagar district of western Uttar Pradesh.His father Mahendra Singh Tikait, one of the tallest farmer leaders of the country and president of the BKU is still remembered as the man who brought Delhi to a halt for 7 days in October 1988 at the boat club. Over 5 lakh farmers joined the movement.Tikait, who, along with his supporters, has been camping on the Ghazipur border between Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, was asked to vacate the site on Thursday. The administration shut off power and water at the farmer encampment. Then came Tikait’s speech, and tractors from Haryana started rolling towards Ghazipur. Farmers in Uttar Pradesh organised a Mahapanchayat on Friday to discuss the issue and expressed their support for Tikait.His elder brother Naresh Tikait is the current BKU chief.Born in Sisauli village on June 4, 1969, Tikait went to DAV School of Sisauli and thereafter joined Kisan Inter College in Lalukheri of Muzaffarnagar district.He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree from Meerut University.He briefly served the Delhi police as a constable and resigned during the 1993 farmers’ protest spearheaded by his father.The then government pressured him to convince his father to end the movement, but he refused to give in and opted to resign and join the protest.Tikait was elected national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union in 1997.He contested the assembly elections from the Khatauli constituency of Muzaffarnagar in 2007 and lost.He then joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal ( RLD) of Ajit Singh in March 2014 and contested the Lok Sabha election from Amroha constituency against the advice of farmer leaders of the area. He received only 9,539 votes (0.62 percent) of the total votes polled and lost again.He belongs to the Baliyan khap (clan). In keeping with the khap’s tradition, his elder brother Naresh Tikait was appointed head of the khap and chief of BKU after the death of their father Mahendra Singh Tikait on May 15, 2011.The title “Tikait” was given to the head of Baliyan khap by King Harshvardhan, the Jat ruler of Thanesar in the 7th century and the tradition is still in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-to-farm-leader-tracing-tikait-s-journey-101611945318063.html
30-01-2021||India||Mutation worry grows for vaccines||A particular mutation of the Sars-Cov-2 virus is established to lower the efficacy for vaccines, the results announced by Novavax on Thursday and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) on Friday showed, reinforcing concerns that the inoculations may need to be updated to fight these new variants.The results also appear to reinforce the notion that vaccines that elicit higher immunogenicity – measured as antibody titers -- could be leading to higher efficacy. These insights are crucial as countries strike deals and prioritise different vaccines, particularly as they race to stay ahead of the coronavirus’s evolution.The mutation particularly worrying experts is known as E484 and occurs in the spike protein, the component of the virus used to enter target cells. It has been found in two widely spreading variants – the B.1.351 in South Africa and P.1 in Brazil.Novavax, which said its dose was 96% effective in preventing disease with the older variant, said the efficacy dropped to 60% in a small trial in South Africa where B.1.351 accounted for most infections. In the case of the J&J-Janssen dose too, the efficacy rate was 57% (for the SA strain) compared to 72% in the US, where infections were with the older variant.“Novavax initiated development of new constructs against the emerging strains in early January and expects to select ideal candidates for a booster and/or combination bivalent vaccine for the new strains in the coming days. The company plans to initiate clinical testing of these new vaccines in the second quarter of this year,” the company said in a statement, confirming that it had started work on updating the dose.On January 25, Moderna became the first to begin work to account for the new mutation, after reporting that it had seen a drop in immunogenicity in lab tests when the South African variant was used.“We now know that there is some loss in vaccine efficacy, down to around the 50%-60% level,” said John P Moore, leading virologist and professor at Cornell University’s Weill Cornell Medicine over email.“But that’s not zero, and a year ago we would have settled for a 50%-60 % effective vaccine,” he added.“The low efficacy of the Novavax vaccine candidate against the B.1.351 is concerning. However, the data is also reassuring in many ways. First, the vaccine itself worked very well against the ’old’ Sars-CoV-2 variants and the B.1.1.7 (UK) variant… And, vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 seemed markedly reduced, but still present. This was against symptomatic disease in general. It is very likely, that the efficacy against severe disease is much higher,” said Florian Krammer, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, in a series of tweets on Friday.The results by J&J and Novavax also showed that vaccines that led to significantly higher volumes of antibody when compared to people who recovered appear to be showing higher efficacy rates. For instance, the three vaccines that reported manifolds more antibody titre levels – Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax (see box) – had efficacy rates in the mid 90s.In comparison, the single-dose J&J-Janssen vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – both of which showed antibody levels comparable to a natural infection – had lower efficacy rates. Experts have said that while higher efficacy rates are better, those with lower ones will still be able to protect from severe disease or death.Speaking in the context of J&J’s lower apparent efficacy, Moore said: “Look, a year ago, we are all hoping for efficacy in the 60-70% range. The mRNA and now Novavax data have spoiled us, as we now ‘expect’ 90-95%… Lesser efficacy will still be useful.”But, he added, “there are going to be complications — what will the public want/expect/use? Will there be controversies there? And infected vaccine recipients may be a problem area for generating resistant variants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sarscov2-virus-mutation-worry-grows-for-vaccines-101611945257489.html
30-01-2021||India||In boost for India, Novavax finds vaccine 89% effective||Two more developers of coronavirus vaccines announced on Friday that their doses were effective in preventing Covid-19, adding to the world’s arsenal to fight the pandemic with at least one of them – Novavax – likely to be widely available in India by the summer if all goes to plan.Novavax said its two-shot vaccine showed an overall efficacy rate of 89%, with a high of 96% against the dominant global variant of the virus. The efficacy dipped to 86% in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in the UK, and further to 60% in the case of the B.1.351 variant spreading in South Africa.The other company to announce efficacy results was Johnson & Johnson (J&J) which said its vaccine – developed in partnership with Janssen -- showed an aggregate efficacy rate of 66% when given as a single dose. It too reported a drop in efficacy rate – to 57% -- when dealing with the South African variant.Novavax has a deal with Pune’s Serum Institute of India (SII) for the manufacture of at least a billion doses of its vaccine for low- and middle-income countries and India. Hours after the efficacy results were announced, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told Reuters that his company has applied for permission to conduct a trial in India.“We have already applied to the drug controller’s office for the bridging trial, a few days ago… So they should also give that approval soon now,” the news agency quoted him as saying. SII, which produces the largest volumes of vaccines every year, is also making a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which it has supplied in millions to India, where it is the most widely used dose.Poonawalla told Reuters earlier this month that his company would manufacture “upwards of 40-50 million doses per month” of the Novavax vaccine from around April, which raises hopes that India could have access to large quantities of a third vaccine by the summer.In addition to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is marketed as Covishield in India by SII, the country is using Covaxin developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. This vaccine has not yet reached the trial endpoint to determine efficacy rate.On a conference call, Novavax representatives noted that this was interim data and that they expect it will be two to three months before they are ready to apply for authorisation with regulators. The UK trial, which enrolled 16,000 people aged 18 to 84, is expected to be used to apply for use in Britain, the European Union and other countries. The bridging trial in India will likely help SII bolster its application, similar to the approach it took with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.“With today’s results from our UK Phase 3 and South Africa Phase 2b clinical trials, we have now reported data on our Covid-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials involving over 20,000 participants… NVX-CoV2373 is the first vaccine to demonstrate not only high clinical efficacy against Covid but also significant clinical efficacy against both the rapidly emerging UK and South Africa variants,” said Stanley C Erck, president and chief executive officer, Novavax, according to a company statement.Experts said though the efficacy shown by J&J-Janssen’s single dose vaccine is lower, it is still good news. “Look, a year ago, we are all hoping for efficacy in the 60-70% range. The mRNA and now Novavax data have spoiled us, as we now “expect” 90-95%… Lesser efficacy will still be useful, but there are going to be complications — what will the public want/expect/use? Will there be controversies there? And infected vaccine recipients may be a problem area for generating resistant variants,” said John Moore leading virologist and professor at Cornell University’s Weill Cornell Medicine in an e-mail .A single-shot dose will be easier in terms of mass inoculations and help prevent severe disease and death. J&J is also testing a two-dose vaccine. “I think the two dose version will do better... It will be interesting to see whether they go to FDA for approval of one dose or want for the two dose data,” added Moore.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-boost-for-india-novavax-finds-vaccine-89-effective-101611945197463.html

30-01-2021||Today's||Communicating correct knowledge of leprosy is key to early detection and treatment||Mahatma Gandhi, India’s “Father of the Nation,” dreamed of realising a world free of leprosy and the stigma and discrimination it causes. In 2005, India achieved something considered impossible at the time: It attained the World Health Organization’s (WHO) target for eliminating leprosy as a public health problem. This achievement garnered praise around the world as an “Indian miracle”. Now, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Government of India has set an ambitious goal of zero leprosy and zero discrimination by 2030 and is actively pursuing it. I have travelled the world as the WHO’s Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination and seen the measures being taken by different countries, but no country is more committed to resolving the issue of leprosy than India. Once again, I would like to pay tribute to its efforts. According to the most recent global update from WHO, India reported an annual total of 114,451 new cases in 2019, the highest of any country and accounting for 56% of the global total. Leprosy is a curable disease. The drugs that cure leprosy are available free. Once a patient starts a course of treatment he or she is no longer infectious. Early symptoms are often painless, however, and this may cause people to delay seeking treatment, and this can later lead to disability. Early detection and prompt treatment are thus important both to prevent disability as well as to stop transmitting the disease to others. In recent years, the Indian government has been stepping up its work against leprosy. In particular, the annual number of new patients with visible disabilities (grade-2 disabilities) at the time of diagnosis has almost halved compared to 2015. This can be said to be a result of the government’s efforts to promote early detection. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) play a major role in early detection. ASHA take great pride in their work of visiting houses, checking on people’s health, looking for signs of leprosy, and connecting people with health centers if infection is suspected. Last year, in cooperation with the ministry of health & family welfare and WHO, The Nippon Foundation and the Sasakawa Health Foundation produced a flipchart to assist ASHA in their work The flipchart helps ASHA to communicate correct knowledge of leprosy to households in an easy-to-understand manner and explain the importance of early treatment. Distribution of the flipchart has already been completed in Gujarat, Orissa and Chhattisgarh, and there are plans to distribute it in West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand by 2022.Last year, I attended an event to present flipcharts to ASHA in Gujarat. I was impressed by their reaction: They said the flipchart will help them carry out their work more effectively and were keen to make use of it. The ministry of health has produced a video that shows in an easy-to-understand way how to use the flipchart. I hope that the video will be shared with all 800,000 ASHA across India and that the flipchart will contribute to the early detection of leprosy. January 30 is a special and important day for the people of India. To realise the “Leprosy-free India” that Mahatma Gandhi dreamed of, I hope that it will a day for everyone to deepen their understanding of leprosy.

30-01-2021||Today's||US must take a call on terror-haven Pakistan||Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh will not be the first terrorist to walk free in Pakistan. But his acquittal, on Thursday, by the Supreme Court on charges of kidnapping and beheading American journalist Daniel Pearl was curiously timed, just days after President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office. White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, expressed “outrage”, and secretary of state Antony Blinken said the acquittal was an “affront to terrorism victims everywhere”. Both of them, and the department of justice before them, offered to take over the case and prosecute Sheikh in the United States (US). This was first proposed by the administration led by President Donald Trump, a Republican, in December when a lower court had overturned Sheikh’s conviction.There is bipartisan support, therefore, for extraditing Sheikh to the US, and the time may have come for the Biden administration to make the call. An acquittal of this kind by the highest court in the land could have been explained away perhaps as the cost, no matter how odious, of having an independent judiciary, in any other country. In Pakistan, Sheikh’s acquittal is yet another evidence of the country’s tight embrace of terrorism. The US knows that well, on a bipartisan basis. The Trump White House had “strongly condemned” the release of Hafiz Saeed, the Lashkar-e-Taiba founder and mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, in 2017, and threatened “repercussions” if he was not rearrested immediately. He wasn’t. Islamabad had chosen, instead, to forfeit nearly $2 billion in security aid as ordered by Trump in a punitive action next month.But in a brazen display of how counterterrorism works in Pakistan, Saeed was thrown behind bars on the eve of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s July 2019 visit to Washington DC for a summit meeting with Trump. But then, seemingly struck by remorse, Pakistan begged the United Nations Security Council several weeks later to unfreeze Saeed’s bank account so he could withdraw, wait for it, his government pension. Clearly, Pakistan cannot deal with terrorism, just as America’s neighbours Colombia and Mexico couldn’t do so, when they had struggled to stop the supply of narcotics into the US, overwhelmed by drug cartels that had taken over their governments and judiciary. The fearless drug lords came to fear eventually when the most potent tool was deployed by the US against them, with the acquiescence of their governments — extradition to the US, to be tried and sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in high-security prisons.Pablo Escobar, the Medellin cartel kingpin, who was killed by police eventually, had resisted extradition to the US through a nationwide campaign of terror and destruction. Joaquin Guzman, the Mexican drug lord better known as El Chapo, who had escaped from prison twice, couldn’t fight extradition eventually and is now serving a life sentence at a super-maximum-security prison in Colorado. Pakistan has continued to coddle terrorists. The new US administration will have to make tough choices.yashwant.raj@hindustantimes.com The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/us-must-take-a-call-on-terror-haven-pakistan-101611932609209.html
30-01-2021||Today's||As LAC becomes the new LoC, India’s challenge deepens||The New Year has got off to a bumpy start as far as the already tense and uneasy India-China relationship is concerned. Even as troops from both sides are in proximate and prickly contact in the Ladakh region since the middle of 2020, January 2021 has been punctuated by a series of developments that pose a complex set of challenges to the two Asian giants.The ninth round of talks between the military commanders from both sides, held on January 24, has remained inconclusive. But the silver lining is that even if there was no breakthrough, there has been no breakdown as regards the dialogue process. This is even more relevant given that there were reports of skirmishes in the Sikkim region on January 20. Earlier in the month, media reports referred to the Chinese having constructed a new village a few kilometres across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) over the last year, thereby altering the demographic patterns in transgression of protocols agreed to in 2005.To aggravate the territoriality issue further, China asserted, on January 21, that its construction of a village near LAC in the eastern sector was “beyond reproach” because Beijing had “never recognised” Arunachal Pradesh. In summary, the contested territoriality issue is now no longer confined to Ladakh in the western sector, but has moved eastwards with areas in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh being brought into simmer mode.Reviewing the troubled bilateral relationship in a holistic manner, one could argue that India’s approach since Galwan seeks to convey a message of political resolve — that the Narendra Modi government will not be the first to blink — with a visible signal that restraint is still at play. The fact that the Indian military could wrest a minor but significant tactical advantage in the Ladakh region after being initially “surprised” has given Delhi that additional leverage, which has enhanced its resolve to stay firm and seek a return to the pre-Galwan status quo position. Two signals from Delhi merit scrutiny. The Republic Day gallantry awards included a Mahavir Chakra (the second-highest award) to Colonel Santosh Babu, the commanding officer of the Bihar regiment who, along with 20 other soldiers, was killed by People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops in the Galwan scuffle. The citation for Babu notes that “his column faced stiff resistance from the adversary who attacked using lethal and sharp weapons along with heavy stone pelting from adjoining heights” and avoids any reference to China or PLA by name. In other places, the choice of word is ”enemy”. One can conjecture that this is a case of Delhi signalling an olive branch in an elliptical manner.Lest the Modi government be accused of appeasement in not naming the adversary/enemy, external affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar’s remarks, on January 28, at a thinktank event, are instructive. Reviewing the entire trajectory of the India-China ties from Delhi’s perspective, EAM reiterated what he has said in the past — namely that Galwan has profoundly disturbed the relationship and that in relation to LAC “any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo is completely unacceptable”. He added, “Significantly, to date, we have yet to receive a credible explanation for the change in China’s stance or reasons for massing of troops in the border areas.”China, which chose to tie a “knot” in a relationship that was relatively stable since 1993, has to decide on how it wants to frame the relationship with India — but for now, the tactical scenario is bleak. With LAC now becoming troubled in both west and east, from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh (the tri-junction with Bhutan having already been aggravated), the focus for the Indian military in monitoring PLA and deterring where required will be the higher priority. In short, LAC will acquire the sheen of the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan. And this will dilute the reserve strength and assets that India has maintained till now, when the annual operational tasking prioritised the western neighbour.The severe constraints imposed by the pandemic will be unveiled soon, when the Union Budget is presented. Delhi’s challenge will be to provide adequate funds for the deployment of troops along LAC for an extended period. Long-term planning must go beyond urgent procurement of some inventory items and focus on enhancing India’s neglected trans-border military capabilities in an astute manner. Apart from air and naval power, India needs to invest in the new domain of new technologies that extend from cyberwarfare to artificial intelligence and spectrum domination in a selective manner. This plea has been made often but in vain.Jaishankar’s speech is an important diplomatic punctuation in placing markers and identifying the preferred template for the bilateral relationship as being predicated on “the three mutuals —mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests”. The resonance with the Nehruvian era (Panchsheel) is palpable. And the abiding lesson is that diplomacy and political resolve, however refined, acquire appropriate efficacy only when backed by credible composite national capability, both economic and military. The Covid-19-scarred budget will play a role in framing India’s long-term China policy.Commodore (retired) C Uday Bhaskar is the director of Society for Policy Studies The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/as-lac-becomes-the-new-loc-india-s-challenge-deepens-101611931699672.html
30-01-2021||Today's||Budget 2021 mantra: Spend and empower states||There is one, and only one, metric on which the forthcoming Union Budget should be assessed — the roadmap it offers for reversing the widening structural inequality in the economy, sharply visible in the direction that India’s post-lockdown economic recovery is taking. By all indicators, economic activity in the formal economy is nearing pre-pandemic levels, the sensex is booming, and the National Statistics Office (NSO) advance estimate of a 7.7% contraction is, ironically, an optimistic prognosis compared to a few months ago. However, the dynamics of recovery are sobering. Large listed companies have experienced a 50% (year-on-year) growth in profits, fuelled by cost restructuring and pent-up demand of households in the top income deciles. Small listed firms, informal firms and the bulk of India’s workers, however, are yet to recover from the Covid-19 shock. In fact, large firms have profited partly, as economist Pranjul Bhandari has pointed out, at the cost of small firms whose ability to respond to lockdown-imposed logistical and supply constraints was limited, thus resulting in a shift in spending toward large firms. And as Bhandari points out, smaller firms have experienced higher cuts in staff costs. The consequences of this large firm, profit-led recovery on the labour market is visible and worrying.According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data, in December 2020, India had 14.7 million fewer jobs than in 2019-20. This headline number masks structural shifts in employment patterns. First, employment is increasingly informal. Analysis of CMIE data by Amit Basole and co-authors from the Azim Premji University highlight that 40% of salaried workers and 42% daily wage workers moved into self-employment in August 2020, a pattern that persisted into December 2020. Most of India cannot afford the luxury of unemployment. This mostly informal, subsistence level shift to self-employment is a direct result of a lack of employment opportunities. Second, employment recovery is marked by gender differences, with female employment taking a serious hit. Seventy-three per cent of men who lost employment in April found employment and stayed employed till December 2020, while only 23% of women stayed employed till December. Third, as evidenced by several surveys including CMIE, wages have fallen significantly below pre-lockdown levels. More starkly, Basole and his co-authors estimate that the bottom 10% of India’s households lost 30 percentage points more of their income than the top 10% in the first six months of the pandemic. The writing is on the wall. The economic devastation caused by the lockdown has been disproportionately and inequitably borne by the poor and vulnerable. The government’s stubborn refusal to loosen its purse strings and provide support (rather than expand, government expenditure contracted, picking up only in November 2020), and instead rely on monetary policy levers, has meant that structural inequalities have only widened. As finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveils her budget, she confronts an economy scarred by increased informality in the labour market, a shrunken micro, small and medium enterprises sector, and economic activity moving to large firms who are incentivised to generate profits rather than employment. Current patterns suggest that growth in FY 22 risks being labour-displacing rather than labour-absorbing. Reversing this trend is both a moral imperative and good economic sense — after all, if purchasing power remains low for the bulk of the economy, demand will collapse.The only direction for the budget to move in, therefore, is to prioritise employment generation and social security for the vulnerable through increased spending. Significantly expanding the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme budget; making the public distribution system demand-driven; and allocating funds for expanded urban social security (leaving states to decide whether this should take the form of cash, employment or insurance) are urgent and necessary expenditures. In addition, the budget should ensure that curtailed expenditure in FY 21 for key welfare schemes — nutrition, education, housing — are fulfilled. There is little room in a budget to address the many structural failures that have led us to the current employment crisis but signalling a long- term policy vision will be a welcome step.Several interlocutors have called for increased infrastructure expenditure as a critical instrument both for reviving private investment and providing employment. But should the infrastructure push be fuelled by the Centre or states? States have been at the frontlines of the Covid-19 battle, with their revenue streams battered by the pandemic and the Centre’s insistence on increased market borrowing rather than fiscal support to meet their expenditure needs. In response, as a recent CRISIL ratings report has highlighted, states are likely to significantly cut capital expenditure or resort to off-budget borrowings. There is, thus, a strong case for empowering states with requisite fiscal support to lead the infrastructure push. This would mean honouring tax devolution commitments made to states, something that the Centre has failed to do throughout the 14th Finance Commission period, and providing states with supplementary Covid-19 grants particularly if, as is widely speculated, the 15th Finance Commission reduces tax devolution to states. Finally, a budget being presented against the backdrop of Covid-19 will necessarily have to make provisions for India’s broken health system. Increased allocations are indeed welcome and necessary, but the Centre will be well-placed to remember that health is a state subject. To the extent that the budget is a policy document, it should lay out a broad direction and outcomes backed with finacial outlays, leaving states to chart their own course.Spend and empower states — this should be the mantra for India’s post-Covid-19 budget.Yamini Aiyar is president and chief executive of the Centre for Policy Research The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/budget-2021-mantra-spend-and-empower-states-101611931582598.html
