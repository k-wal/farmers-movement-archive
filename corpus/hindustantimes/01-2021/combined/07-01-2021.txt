How can these two extremes be aligned? The ongoing turmoil in the oil markets due to the pandemic and under-utilised supply presents a long-term opportunity for India to secure its energy future. Simply, India can take small stakes in the listed oil and gas companies of democracies such as the United States (US), Canada and Australia, via a specially created sovereign wealth fund (SWF). India is currently the world’s third- largest consumer of oil with growing demand and limited domestic supplies. Import in 2019-20 was 1.6 billion barrels and will increase as its economy expands. Some analysts believe that the big thrust on electric vehicles (EVs) will spell the end of the oil age. But will it? Electric cars still account for less than 2% of all cars sold worldwide and there are no alternatives for heavy trucks — the biggest oil consumers in India. EVs depend on the reliability of supply chains for key minerals — rare earths, lithium and cobalt — the majority of which are from, or controlled by, China. For a range of reasons, the obituary for oil looks premature. India’s oil demand is set to rise in the foreseeable future.Luckily, the energy market is currently in India’s favour. This is due to increased oil production in the US and Canada over the past decade, which has brought down the price of oil. The US has added 8.5 million barrels/day to its oil production from 2008-18, accounting for over 70% of the increase in global oil production over this period. Canada added 2 million barrels/day to its oil production in the same period. This increased supply and the short-term demand disruption caused by Covid-19 means that oil prices will remain weak for some time.This also means that upstream oil and gas investments can be made on the cheap today. Such investments can protect India from future increases in oil prices as financial returns from them will increase in line with oil prices. This approach is in contrast with India’s traditional one, where India’s State-owned oil companies invested in oil and gas fields. Most investments were made in economies such as Russia, Mozambique and Venezuela — and many have run into political or economic instability.An investment in developed economies, especially the US or Canada, carries fewer risks. Historically, the cost of assets in stable western countries was a deterrent, but with the low oil prices of the past few years, especially in 2020, many of these investments now look attractive. To do so, India must set up a sovereign wealth fund to invest in listed oil and gas companies — in contrast with the country’s public sector acquiring assets, or companies. First, oil and money are both fungible. The higher dividend payout from energy investments will offset the impact of higher prices. Second, large-scale acquisitions by foreign State-owned companies are not favoured either in the US or Canada, more so in the current environment of predatory investments by Chinese companies. However, sovereign wealth fund’s from across the world routinely invest in western financial markets as they are seen purely as financial investors, not acquirers. Third, there is the risk of accidents and, therefore, unlimited exposure. For instance, BP discovered in 2010 after the Gulf of Mexico disaster that there is no upper limit to penalties for environmental damage. An Indian public sector company with an operational stake may be liable in case of an unfortunate event. A sovereign wealth fund with a minority stake will not be liable.Norway is an example of prudent management of the windfall from high oil prices of the past, with which it set up a rainy day fund — now one of the most powerful and successful in the world. India is witnessing a similar windfall, in reverse, due to low oil prices — and needs to plan for the time when prices will be higher. That time is now.Amit Bhandari is fellow for energy and environment studies programme, Gateway House The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-secure-india-s-energy-future-create-a-sovereign-wealth-fund-and-invest/story-yba92QduQ7G94T6Sje8pJM.html
07-01-2021||News||Devising a vaccine strategy for India||India has now approved the vaccines developed by Astra-Zeneca and Bharat Biotech. Several more will likely be available later in 2021. Deploying these vaccines effectively will be crucial. India and other developing countries have to keep their specific circumstances in mind while formulating vaccine strategies.India will not need to vaccinate 1.35 billion people, but just beyond the point where the reproductive rate is under control even without suppression. If India had, for example, 60% of people already infected and we knew who they were, we would have to vaccinate at most 40% or ~560 million persons. This requires approximately 1.1 billion doses, given that most vaccines need a booster dose. Actual targets will be higher if India cannot identify who already has natural immunity. The choice of vaccines will be constrained by cost, cold-chain availability and so on. There are five key issues that vaccine strategies must consider. The first is allocation. Most nations will vaccinate healthcare workers first. They treat those who are infected with Covid-19 and vaccinate the remaining population. After that, it seems logical to prioritise the elderly, who have a higher infection fatality rate. However, premature death costs a young person more years of life than an old person. The balancing of risk and harm may have convinced Indonesia to buck the global consensus and vaccinate working age persons first. It is worth considering in India. Even if the elderly are prioritised, that will not exhaust the vaccine supply: 80% of India’s population is below 50. Allocation among the working age population should consider two factors. First, the additional protective benefit from vaccination is much lower if one has immunity from a prior infection. Thus, areas with a large susceptible population and a higher reproductive rate obtain greater benefits from vaccination. Indeed, with severely limited doses of vaccine available, it may be prudent to screen people for Covid-19 antibodies and prioritise vaccination of those without antibodies. There may also be greater benefits to fully vaccinating one area fully than to giving a small number of doses to multiple areas. Adequate vaccination in an area will permit relaxation of suppression in that area; spreading vaccination across areas may not result in release of any of those areas. Areas that are closest to herd immunity even without suppression require the least number of doses to return to normal economic activity and have higher returns from vaccination. Areas that suffered the greatest economically will have the greatest benefit from relaxing suppression after vaccination. These twin considerations should guide prioritisation. The second issue is distribution. Moving vaccines from companies to warehouses will be relatively easy but moving it from warehouses to distributors to end-users will be tricky, given the difficulties with cold chains and storage facilities. Digitally monitoring storage and transportation facilities will be critical. Second, 600 million or so vaccine recipients need to be identified, and then re-identified three-four weeks later for a second dose. As Nandan Nilekani has suggested, we may need to build a bespoke, vaccine-agnostic digital platform to enable this. Third, administering 30-40 million immunisations a year is a different kettle of fish from vaccinating 600 million people in a year. Sourcing the trained human resources necessary to deliver intramuscular shots, without diverting from existing priorities, will not be easy. Perhaps medical students, phlebotomists, paramedics and pharmacists can be rapidly and reliably trained to administer vaccines. The third issue is financing. The choice here is whether to finance vaccinations publicly or privately. In the United States, United Kingdom and Europe, vaccines are likely to be entirely free and administered publicly. However, India will need a hybrid strategy, where the majority of the population is vaccinated for free publicly, while allowing private markets for approved vaccines. Cost alone will necessitate this. The cheapest vaccine India is considering — Covaxin — will cost over $1.1 billion at $1 per dose. Other vaccines will cost from three times as much (Astra) to 30 times as much (Moderna). Given the tight fiscal situation, the government will be well-advised to have as much private sector involvement as possible.The fourth issue is communication. It’s vitally important for the government to have a well thought out communications strategy to fortify public confidence and reduce vaccine reticence in the population. A good strategy will avoid mixed and contradictory messaging, be simple to comprehend, be science-led, involve regular communication, utilise respected community leaders to widen reach, and clamp down on the spread of misinformation. And the final issue is certification. Resumption of normalcy will require standardisation on certification of immunity, whether by vaccination or prior infection. Every country will need an internal set of protocols regarding proof of vaccination, but also standards that are interoperable with norms elsewhere. In other words, proof of vaccination in India or Tanzania must be acceptable to a Singapore Airlines or Qantas. This will also require multilateral bodies to play an active role in creating frameworks, around which digital platforms can be created. India is embarking on a monumental mission, not just in terms of vaccinating its own population, but also vaccinating a large part of the world thanks to its position as the world’s leading vaccine producer. Addressing these five issues will augment the effort to efficiently get vaccines to hundreds of millions in the shortest period of time.Reuben Abraham is CEO, IDFC Institute in Mumbai, and Dr Anup Malani is professor , University of Chicago Medical SchoolThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/devising-a-vaccine-strategy-for-india/story-u12s0fA8oFOmfMxXo3St1H.html
07-01-2021||News||January 6: A black day for US democracy||January 6 will be remembered as a black and bleak day in the annals of the history of the United States (US), when the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy allowed its legislative heart — the US Capitol — to be stormed by supporters of President Donald Trump. Encouraged by a sitting president who has lost the election for a second term, the protesters saw this as a last-ditch, desperate attempt to overturn the Joe Biden victory. This tragic turn of events in what should have been an orderly transfer of governance in a democracy has resulted in four deaths and, alas, the US stands diminished in its own esteem and that of its well-wishers.The fact that this mass protest was announced days in advance and that the much-touted security system of the US capital and the over-protected legislature allowed this violence to unspool (with possibly tacit support from within) points to many omissions of institutional ineptitude and worse, socio-political turpitude. Led by Trump and his extreme right, largely white support base, a section of US society was rejecting both the rule of law and the principles enshrined in the US constitution with impunity.The white supremacist disregard for the sanctity of law has been on the increase during the Trump presidency and the contrast with how Washington dealt with peaceful protests by African-Americans in recent months is illustrative of the deep racial fissures that still fester in US society. While the Wednesday storming of Capitol Hill was devoid of large-scale violence and had some comical visuals, a worst-case scenario would have been that of heavily-armed extremists taking control of the US Congress and the military having to step in. The fact that preliminary reports refer to vehicles with arms, ammunition, pipe-bombs and Molotov cocktails being found in the vicinity adds to the anxiety of what could have happened on Wednesday.However, to the credit of the US political ecosystem and its inherent resilience, the commitment to both constitutional principles and rule of law was reiterated by the US Congress within hours of the deplorable attack. Led by Vice-President Mike Pence in the Senate and Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the House of Representatives, the shaken and outraged legislators, in the main, condemned the violence and distanced themselves from a president who had brought disgrace to the high office he held. The Biden victory as declared by the electoral college was upheld and it is expected that the White House will have a new occupant on January 20 and that US democracy will be back on track.But this will be a wounded country whose democratic credentials and internal socio-political cohesion will be seen to be tainted and in need of urgent repair. Biden’s priority, hence, will be one of domestic healing and restoring US credibility in the international arena. The challenge to the rhythms of normative democracy symbolised by January 6 will also shrink Washington’s ability to provide substantive and persuasive leadership to the complex global challenges that the world was facing in 2020. These include the 3C spectrum – the climate crisis, China, and Covid-19.A nettlesome Trump legacy issue that will test the Biden team will be the China conundrum, which has a distinctive salience for many nations, including India. While there will be no dearth of critics using January 6 to take potshots at the US and its penchant to “export’” democracy and lead the democratic cluster against Beijing, the American ability to self-correct after a setback is commendable.Trump’s consistent attempts to reject and denigrate the outcome of the US electoral system has no precedent and his term in office will be analysed for years. But the interregnum till January 20 is fraught with some dangerous security-related exigencies. As per US law, the president is at the apex of the nuclear command authority and is “the finger on the button”. The codes are contained in a briefcase referred to as the “football” and this is carried by an aide who is always in close proximity to the president.In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol Hill attack, Trump was missing and close aides revealed that POTUS had “lost it” and appeared deranged. For the US, and the world at large, this is cause for deep concern and one can only hope that the professionals in the system will firewall any impending recklessness by Trump. This low probability exigency, which would have an apocalyptic consequence, is sharply attenuated in relation to Iran and merits mention.The US has no doubt dodged a bullet on January 6, but the complex pattern of events leading to it point to the inherent fragility of the democratic compulsion and the need to nurture it in a positive and normative manner.

07-01-2021||News||Ensure access to justice in a post-Covid world||The Covid-19 pandemic forced the Indian judiciary to adopt digital processes at an unprecedented speed and scale. With a lockdown being imposed on March 25 and the enforcement of physical distancing, courts across India started using video-conferencing to hear cases, accompanied by facilities for e-filing and e-payment, wherever possible. Although there has been media coverage of online hearings in the Supreme Court and a few high courts, the experiences of district court lawyers remain at the margins of public awareness. Given that the district courts are the first port of call for litigants, it is critical to understand the circumstances under which lawyers in these courts worked during this period.DAKSH undertook a rapid review of the experiences of 124 lawyers in nine districts across Delhi (Shahdara and Central Delhi), Madhya Pradesh (Bhopal, Barwani, Morena, and Sidhi) and Karnataka (Bengaluru Urban, Dakshina Kannada, and Kalaburagi) of accessing courts during the pandemic between July 1, 2020 and September 20, 2020. Since this is India’s first large-scale implementation of online hearings, e-filing and e-payment, the findings will help shape the way forward for virtual courts.Any move towards the online functioning of courts must account for the digital divide in India. While mobile phones are used widely, access to the internet and advanced digital equipment remains limited to some urban users. Lawyers in semi-urban and rural districts found online hearings challenging because of internet connectivity issues and unfamiliarity with this mode of working. In MP, a majority of the respondents opted to attend online hearings from designated booths on the court premises because of poor connectivity and the lack of smartphones and/or computers in their homes and offices. Although having booths within the court premises addressed the technological barrier, it raised a fresh set of challenges in the context of the pandemic because it became difficult for court staff to enforce physical distancing.Another drawback of implementing online hearings was that the public did not have access to these hearings in all nine districts. This is a significant departure from the open justice principle followed by Indian courts. In physical hearings, judicial proceedings are conducted and decisions pronounced in “open court”, the evidence is communicated publicly to those present in the court, and there are no impediments to fair and accurate reporting of judicial proceedings.Online hearings should try to replicate this openness as far as possible, by allowing for litigants and the general public to watch the hearings. Opacity reduces the confidence of citizens that even in an online hearing their case will be heard on merits, while giving a fair hearing to all parties, leading to enforceable remedies, utilising procedures that are conspicuously fair and perceived to be so.Across the three states, the production of undertrial prisoners remotely was not considered mandatory and seemed to depend on the judge hearing the case. The production of an accused person before a magistrate is an important fair-trial requirement because it allows the magistrate to enquire whether the accused has legal representation, to determine the age of the accused, enquire about their health, and make a reasoned decision on the need for further confinement. This should not be dispensed with for the sake of expediency.Along with connectivity, the choice of digital platforms also affected experiences of online hearings. None of the platforms used for webinars and meetings is customised for court hearings. So, hearings on these platforms take place in the same manner as a virtual meeting and do not emulate the experience of a physical court. To illustrate this point in the context of criminal trials, defendants may feel comfortable telling a judge before whom they are physically present about custodial violence, but cannot do so on video conference from prison because the prison staff are present in the same room. Therefore, the architecture of the platform must allow the defendant to speak to a judge without the prison staff being present. Additionally, there must be a provision for undertrial prisoners to confer in private with the lawyers virtually.The experience of several respondents with e-filing has not been agreeable and they have reverted to physical filing as soon as it was permitted. In several places, e-filing had to be followed by the physical filing of the same documents, making the process of e-filing redundant. Respondents also found e-filing inconvenient because of the restrictions on file sizes and formats, and technical issues with the websites. They stressed on the need for support in the form of training videos and helplines for lawyers to help them navigate online hearings.The shutdown of courts across India provided an opportunity to adapt to digital modes of working. The large strides made in this regard need to be evaluated and improved upon. It is important to not lose this momentum and institutionalise a hybrid model of working along with systems such as e-filing, e-payment while safeguarding due process and ensuring access to justice to people on both sides of the digital divide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/ensure-access-to-justice-in-a-post-covid-world/story-o4OLC4wEa40hSLCJFww0HJ.html
07-01-2021||News||India’s retrospective taxation blunder is still extracting heavy costs||A retroactive law is truly a monstrosity. Law has to do with the governance of human conduct by rules. To speak of governing...today by rules that will be enacted tomorrow is to talk in blank prose”. This quote by Lon L Fuller, an American legal philosopher, aptly summarises India’s retroactive tax misadventure.In 2012, India amended the Income Tax Act retroactively to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision favouring Vodafone in a tax battle with the government. The 2012 amendment spooked foreign investors. It amended Section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act, retroactively making it applicable to “indirect transfers”, ie. to the transfer by a non-resident of a share in a company incorporated abroad, if the share derived, directly or indirectly, its value substantially from assets located in India. One such “indirect transfer” was the 2006 internal corporate restructuring carried out by Cairn Energy. Armed with the 2012 amendment, the Indian government in 2015 imposed on Cairn a draft tax assessment of ₹10,247 crores for the corporate restructuring that took place in 2006.Consequently, Cairn sued India before an investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) tribunal alleging that imposition of taxes retroactively violates the India-United Kingdom bilateral investment treaty (BIT). The ISDS tribunal, in late December, ruled in favour of Cairn, holding India guilty of violating the fair and equitable treatment (FET) obligation of the India-UK BIT. The tribunal dismissed India’s argument that the 2012 amendment clarified the intent of Parliament regarding “indirect transfers” and that it was not retroactive.The tribunal held that the 2012 amendment substantively changed the scope or operation of Section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act. The tribunal also ruled that whether the 2012 amendment was constitutional or not has no bearing on India violating its treaty obligations because India’s liability has to be ascertained under international law. This is important because it ruptures the myth perpetuated by the defenders of the retroactive amendment that a law passed by Parliament that has not been declared unconstitutional does not violate India’s BIT obligations. The sovereign right to tax should be exercised in a manner consistent with international law.The tribunal reasoned that India’s decision to retroactively apply the law, without a specific justification, created a new tax burden on a transaction that was not taxable at the time it was carried out, ie. in 2006. India robbed Cairn of its ability to plan its activities keeping in mind the legal consequences of its conduct. It disproportionately undermined the principle of legal certainty, which is one of the core elements of the FET standard specifically and of the rule of law generally. Hence, the tribunal ordered India to return over $1.2 billion to Cairn Energy Plc. This is the second instance of an ISDS tribunal admonishing India’s 2012 retroactive amendment of the Income Tax Act. A few months ago, another ISDS tribunal in Vodafone International Holdings v India found India guilty of breaching the India-Netherlands BIT for imposing taxes on Vodafone retroactively.The 2012 amendment was a momentous error committed by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, on assuming office in 2014, had a great opportunity to correct this blunder by amending the law and making it prospective in application. This was expected because the Bharatiya Janata Party’s manifesto, cited by the Cairn tribunal, correctly criticised the UPA government for unleashing tax terrorism and uncertainty that deleteriously impacted the investment climate. However, the NDA government, instead of amending the law, relentlessly pursued the tax claims against Vodafone and Cairn Energy.India has already challenged the Vodafone award. Presumably, it will do the same with the Cairn Energy award. In endeavouring to extract revenue through retroactive taxation that damages investor sentiment in the long run, India is being penny-wise and pound-foolish. The government should remember that promoting rule of law and safeguarding legal certainty are important drivers of foreign investment inflows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-s-retrospective-taxation-blunder-is-still-extracting-heavy-costs/story-gg6EfPCj02UKZQdflcKhzK.html
07-01-2021||City||Students to be served mid-day meals at Ludhiana schools||The state education department has directed the government and aided schools in the district to serve mid-day meals to the students of classes 5 to 8 after the schools reopened on Thursday.Directions were issued to deliver food grains to students who are attending classes online and to transfer the cooking costs to their bank accounts, as it was being done earlier when the schools were shut owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.The higher authorities issued directions to the schools at 9 am on Thursday, and majority of the schools decided to make the required arrangements from Friday. The move by the higher authorities has left the school heads in a tizzy as to prepare the meals, they will have to make arrangements to purchase vegetables, pulses, salt, and oil commodities. A school head of a government primary school, requesting anonymity, said, “Around 210 students are studying in Class 5 in our school out of which 20 of them have submitted a written consent from parents and rest are not going to come to school to attend physical classes. It will be a task to make arrangements. If anybody gets infected from the virus, then who is to be held responsible?” As per government orders, the students will be attending classes in school for five hours therefore, the department decided that meals should be provided to them.As per instructions, the mid-day meal kitchen has to be sanitized, and utensils to be washed thoroughly so that food is prepared hygienically. Instructions have also been issued to maintain social distancing while serving meals to the students.The school authorities have been asked to make it mandatory for the students to wash their hands before taking meals for at least 40 seconds. It should also be ensured that the cook-cum-helpers are not Covid-19 positive.Prabhcharan Singh, general manager of the state mid-day meal cell, SAS Nagar, said, “Students have to attend school from 10 am to 3 pm and it will be difficult for them to stay in school without food for five hours. So, we decided to ask school heads to make arrangements and start serving meals to students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-to-be-served-mid-day-meals-at-ludhiana-schools/story-27RtyfTDqv2xTB6uaxazeK.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||Light rain and thunder likely in Mumbai; AQI remains very poor||The city’s air quality deteriorated further on Thursday as the air quality index (AQI) — a pollutant measuring indicator — measured 313, the worst so far this year. Mumbai is also likely to receive light rain with thunderstorms and Thane may see thunderstorms with lightning on Friday, according to a forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). An overall AQI of 313 (very poor) was measured on Thursday, which was worse than Wednesday’s 309, as temperatures remained low. The AQI, calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), is the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Navi Mumbai reported the worst air of the 10 stations, with AQI of 329, which was closely followed by Borivli with AQI of 326. “As winter conditions persist, low dispersion of pollutant particles in the air is seen. This is why the air quality is in the very poor category. It is likely to remain poor over the next two days,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR. While the city remained dry, some neighbouring areas such as Thane and Badlapur saw thunderstorms and mild showers. Maximum temperatures remained low for the second consecutive day. The Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded a maximum temperature of 30.7 degree Celsius, 2.5 degrees below normal. At Colaba, the maximum temperature was 28 degree Celsius, a drop of 0.5 degrees from normal. The minimum temperature at Colaba was 21 degrees Celsius, and at Santacruz, it was 20 degree Celsius, 0.1 degree below normal. IMD has predicted light rain, thundershowers in Mumbai for the next two days. Thane district is likely to see thunderstorms and lightning owing to a trough along the coast of Maharashtra and Karnataka. “Under the influence of a trough in low-level easterlies from Karnataka coast to Maharashtra coast in lower tropospheric levels; isolated to scattered rainfall with moderate thunderstorm and lightning at isolated places are very likely over Maharashtra in the next two days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general of western region, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/light-rain-and-thunder-likely-in-mumbai-aqi-remains-very-poor/story-6DeyAESgiESizYngQRTCkO.html

Addressing mediapersons here today, leaders of the Punjab Kisan Union Kanwaljit Singh and Amandeep Singh alleged that tents at the camp had been dismantled by the police in a bid to stop a campaign by some youths in the district to educate people about the three farm laws passed by the government.They said when they informed the senior superintendent of police about the matter he said no such orders had been issued, after which the tents were set up again.The Kisan Union leaders said the government should clarify at whose behest the police were working to stop the farmers’ campaign. When questioned about a few persons in Mohali district claiming to be farmer leaders and saying the camp could not be run without their permission, Kanwaljit Singh and Amandeep Singh denied authorising anyone to act on their behalf.Such people were working to divide the farmers over the agricultural legislations, which would be counterproductive, they warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tents-dismantled-by-local-police-in-mohali-allege-farmers/story-wqW3uIsqS0vbrXhn4naqiL.html

07-01-2021||Noida||After three days of breather, Noida air slips to ‘poor’ category||Noida: After having “moderate” air quality three days, Noida on Thursday entered the “poor” category due to change in weather conditions in the past 24 hours. While Ghaziabad and Greater Noida are already under “poor”, pollution monitoring agencies expect the region to either remain under this category or slip further into the “very poor” category, with poor ventilation conditions. Noida had been seeing ‘moderate’ air quality since January 4 due to the rains that washed away the pollutants. “The wind direction has changed and so the speed has dropped, and so did the temperature. On Thursday, the wind speed was around eight kmph and the humidity was also high. Given such weather conditions, the wind speed should have been at least 15 kmph to stop the air quality from worsening. For two days the ventilation conditions will be almost the same as on Thursday. However, wind speeds will pick up to almost 25 kmph from January 9,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on a scale of 0 to 500, on Thursday was 236 or “poor” against 200 or “moderate” a day earlier. Greater Noida’s AQI was 288 against 239 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 294 against 234 a day earlier, both “poor”. The major pollutant PM2.5 levels also worsened to more than twice the standards. The PM2.5 levels in Noida worsened to 121.75 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3) against 102.02µg/m3 a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 129.51µg/m3 on Thursday against 110.97µg/m3 a day earlier. The PM2.5 level for Ghaziabad was 137.08µg/m3 against 106.86 a day earlier. The safe standard for PM2.5 is 60µg/m3. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI will remain within the “poor” category with moderate ventilation conditions. “Ventilation condition is moderate and AQI is expected to stay in the “poor” category for tomorrow (Friday). The AQI is likely to marginally improve on January 9 and 10. No sudden deterioration of AQI is expected in the next few days,” said the SAFAR statement on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-three-days-of-breather-noida-air-slips-to-poor-category/story-LA775E9aS4BgncyO0PPbIO.html
07-01-2021||Chandigarh||Attendance thin as classes 5-8 resume in Mohali govt schools||About 30% to 45% attendance was reported on Thursday as classes 5 to 8 in government schools resumed for the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak in March last year. “Duties were assigned and directions were issued to all school principles to ensure social distancing and to check that children wear masks while attending school. Attendance is purely on parents’ consent,” said Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. As it was the first day the overall turnout was a bit low but in many primary and middle schools it reached 100%, he added.

Since the NGT directions were not fully complied with, we moved for contempt proceedings,” said Raghav. “We are of the view that once order has been passed by this tribunal which has attained finality, the same ought to be executed by the district magistrate, Ghaziabad and pond should be restored. We have been dealing with the matter for three years. The issue is of individual encroachments which can be also dealt with by the civil court, having local jurisdiction in terms of section 25(2) of the NGT Act, 2010 (sic.),” the tribunal observed while disposing off the petition on January 5. The NGT while observing further that not much progress has been made for last more than three years, said, “Accordingly, we direct that a copy of order of this tribunal dated September 20, 2016 be forwarded to the District Judge, Ghaziabad for being entrusted to the concerned civil court so that the said civil court may proceed further with the execution proceedings in accordance with law (sic.).” District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to the NGT order sent to him for his response. MS Tanwar, the municipal-commissioner, said that the corporation will comply with the directions given by the NGT. “There have been encroachments at the Arthala Lake and we had also drawn up a plan but we face resistance from locals, especially women, whenever we carry out enforcement,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/arthala-lake-encroachment-ngt-asks-ghaziabad-court-to-start-execution-proceedings/story-T4bUAQsI9MEGjMCyWYc5tL.html

Officials said that a surveillance team will also be deployed at Dhanauri wetland to keep an eye out for any unusual activity as, for now, restricting access to the Dhanauri wetland is beyond their jurisdiction.“We have closed access to the two watchtowers and the wooden bridge that connects land with the towers, in wake of the possibility of bird flu as cases have already been reported in Rajasthan and other states. Certain areas at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary have been temporarily shut due to their proximity with water bodies and water birds. However, the road between gate number one and two of Okhla Bird Sanctuary, which is over three kilometre long, will stay open,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer (DFO) of the district. The Okhla Bird Sanctuary spreads over 400 hectares and recorded 21,061 water-birds of 115 species in the annual census conducted by the forest department in February 2020 for the birding year of 2019-20. Srivastava added that access to Surajpur wetland will be barred till further orders.“The Surajur wetland is anyway a reserve forest, which means access to visitors was always subject to the department’s choice. We had kept it open so far for visitors, but in wake of the threat of bird flu, we have decided to restrict entry for some time. At Dhanauri, we will deploy a surveillance team to check for any symptoms of flu. Since the region is yet to be declared a reserve area, we don’t have power to restrict entry to it,” added the DFO.The Surajpur wetland recently saw a census on January 2 counting a total of 3,107 birds of 40 species, against 2,092 birds from a total of 39 species in January 2020.Task force formedWith migratory birds flocking to the city’s wetlands as the annual birding season peaks, and a number of poultry farms operating in the region, the administration has formed a district-level task force and a rapid response team to keep an eye out for any plausible case of bird flu.So far, no case of avian flu has been reported in the district or in Uttar Pradesh, but cases have come up in Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. According to experts, symptoms such as salivation from beak and eyes, uncoordinated wings, diarrhea and paralysis in birds suggest bird flu. The forest department on Friday urged people to report such cases if they come across any.Officials said the teams, comprising officials from the divisional forest department and the district veterinary department, have been constituted to check any unusual death of wild or farm birds to check for bird flu and take preventive measures. “The district-level task force has been formed to trace and report any sign of bird flu in the city. So far there has been no case of bird flu in the city, but the task force has been formed as a preventive measure. It is better to be safe than sorry,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate.“The three-member rapid-response team has been constituted with two members from the forest department and one from the veterinary department. The team will conduct inspections in two phases – first will cover all water bodies and second phase will include poultry farms. So far, we have not seen any unusual deaths among migratory or resident birds,” said Srivastava. The forester added that there could be some deaths among crows and pigeons in the city which is usual in this season, but they will still collect the carcasses to be sure.“In the winter season, there are always cases of a few deaths among birds like crow and pigeon due to lack of protein. What we are looking for are unusual deaths, but we will also keep an eye on usual deaths just to be sure. We also urge people to report at our helpline 91-9412492985,” Srivastava added. The forest department’s warning also cautions people from touching any dead bird and to wash their gear and shoes after returning from birding sites.No need to panic, say vets Meanwhile, the chief veterinary officer (CVO) urged the people not to panic.“Our teams are vigilant and staff of all 20 government veterinary hospitals across the district is on high alert. The teams will keep an eye on poultry farms as well. We urge people not to panic as the city has not seen any case or bird flu yet but if it happens, we are ready to deal with it,” said Dr Virendra Kumar Srivastava, CVO, GB Nagar. Meanwhile, the experts including the frontline staff who had dealt with the crisis earlier state that strong vigilance is the only way out to avoid the flu from spreading. “The epicenter of the flu has not been found but we are all vigilant, which is the best measure. Any carcass of dead bird must be inspected and disposed under certain protocols, which includes wrapping it in polybags and then either deep burying or incinerating it. So far, we have not seen any case at the Sambhar Lake,” said Dr Arvind Mathur, an expert and veterinary officer, Sambhar Lake, Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/okhla-bird-sanctuary-surajpur-wetland-partially-off-limits-task-force-to-keep-eye-out-for-bird-flu/story-AmGqsDqCgxqWmBu8naIOgJ.html

On any other day, he would serve around two to four bodies and accept any money that people felt like giving him for his services that would be generally around ₹100 to ₹300.Since the roof of a shelter collapsed on sunday and killed 24 people though, he has had few visitors. “It is for the first time that I saw bodies being taken away from the cremation ground,” he said, recounting the January 3 incident. At the time, Pandit was in Delhi and his son was performing the rites inside the shelter. Just moments before the collapse, his son had gone out of the room.“He escaped with minor injuries. It seems people are afraid now. The day after the incident, seven persons who had died in it were cremated here. Since then, there has been only one other cremation,” said Pandit. “One more family had arrived but then changed their mind and went elsewhere.”Muradnagar town has several cremation grounds like the ones at Jalapur, Rawli Road and the one at Ordinance Factory and also at Dedha village. The Ukhlarsi cremation ground was commissioned in 1992. “This is the biggest of all. About 15 days ago, the contractor had removed the wooden poles from below the roof of the shelter. On the day of the incident, his labourers were applying white plaster on the walls when the roof collapsed in the rain. Nowadays, we have visitors who come to visit the incident site and also to know more about the incident,” said Pandit. The shelter has been sealed for now and samples of the debris were taken to be tested to ascertain the quality of material used. “Bodies can still be cremated at the cremation ground. More cremation platforms and the shelter will be constructed once the investigation is complete. Hopefully, things will be streamlined with time,” said Aditya Prajapati, sub divisional magistrate (SDM - Modinagar). CompensationMost of the families of the victims stay in Muradnagar and also received cheques for ₹10 lakh each from the government as compensation for their loss on Wednesday. “Some victim families are from outside districts and they will be given soon,” said the SDM. Initially, the UP government had offered ₹2 lakh. But on Monday the families placed the bodies over the Delhi Meerut Road and blocked the erstwhile national highway for about seven hours demanding justice. UP cabinet minister Suresh Khanna then announced ₹10 lakh to each family. On Thursday, leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) met the families and visited the incident site. “At least ₹50 lakh should be paid to each family. We want transparent investigation and guilty should be punished. We are here to help victims get justice and not to indulge in politics,” said Ashu Malik, SP leader and former MLC. The UP government on Wednesday also directed that the incident will be probed by special investigation team (SIT) of the Economic Offences Wing. “A lot of SITs had been formed for different incidents in UP but without results. We want a CBI inquiry and those involved in corruption should be booked for murder. The victim families have not been given any time frame for government jobs,” said AAP leader Sanjay Singh. “There is no timeframe given for the government job but it will be expedited as a process has to be followed for it,” SDM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/people-avoid-ukhlarsi-cremation-ground-after-incident-politicians-meet-victim-families/story-koKYozWwLBCSleur73RajI.html
07-01-2021||Noida||Muradnagar roof collapse: ‘Single window’ for clarity in payments; three firms of contractor blacklisted||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation will soon have an online system to track payment to contractors in civic work.The move is expected to ensure much-needed transparency in the working of the corporation. The move comes after Ajay Tyagi, the contractor arrested soon after the Muradnagar shelter roof collapse incident that claimed 24 lives on January 3, allegedly confessed to police that he had bribed corporation officials for the work. On Thursday, the corporation also blacklisted Tyagi’s firms -- Ajay Tyagi Constructions, Mahi Construction and Builders and Krishna Associates. The action follows an inquiry by corporation’s engineers.“Work pending with them will now be allotted to the other contenders who had participated previously in respective tenders. If they decline taking up the projects, we will issue another fresh tenders for the remaining work,” said M S Tanwar, municipal commissioner. Tyagi’s association with officials and politicians have come into focus since his arrest. Photos of him celebrating birthdays and playing cricket with officers and public representatives were splashed on social media. Apart from Tyagi, the police also arrested his alleged accomplice Sanjay Garg, Nagar Palika executive officer Niharika Singh, junior engineer CP Singh and supervisor Ashish Kumar.Tyagi allegedly confessed to police that he had paid ₹16 lakh in bribes. Civic agency officials said sometimes certain officials may hold back payment files on account of vague reasons and contractors often had to bribe them to release payments. “This often leads to other mal practices, such as poor quality materials,” said an official.“We cannot comment on it as it is the subject of a police investigation. From our end, we will try to reduce human interference in project allocation and payments through an online single window system that will track payments and also highlight where the payment files are held up. We will be able to implement it in next three months,” Tanwar said.The corporation officials, while blacklisting Tyagi’s three firms, said that the firm Ajay Tyagi Construction was assigned 13 works amounting to about ₹4.92 crore, while Mahi Constructions and Builders was awarded 14 works at a cost of ₹5.21 crore, besides which Krishna Enterprises was awarded six works at a cost of ₹0.64 croreA special investigation team under the economic offences wing will be investigating the case. “There are works taken up by the contractor with the authority,” said Krishna Karunesh, vice-chairperson of the Gaziabad Development Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/muradnagar-roof-collapse-single-window-for-clarity-in-payments-three-firms-of-contractor-blacklisted/story-hDZGQh68PHvqUQQoFQxGzK.html

Officials said that the last auction was held in 2019 and given the slowdown caused by Covid-19 pandemic, the reserved rates are likely to be revised in order to make it viable for the contractors. The areas are auctioned for a year. HSVP officials said parking contractors have been badly hit due to the pandemic with the number of office-goers and those going to food and entertainment hot spots like sector 29 reducing considerably. In fact, a large number of contractors, who had successfully bid for parking contracts earlier had asked for a refund or extension of contract period, said officials, adding that the refund option was being considered. A majority of the parking areas that would be auctioned are located in sectors 29, 32, 38, 39, and 44. These are mostly in commercial sectors and officials said that with business gradually returning to normalcy after the lockdown, there has been an increase in the number of people visiting offices, restaurants and other establishments. “The commuters are returning and the number of visitors is on the rise. It is the right time to put these parking sites on auction. We will be revaluating the reserved price of these sites to ensure that these remain viable as a business. Covid-19 has caused a slowdown in all aspects of business,” said Vivek Kalia, estate officer, I, HSVP. Kalia said that there are 13 parking sites for e-auction in sector 29, four in sector 32, three in sector 44 A and few of these are scattered in sectors along Golf Course road. “The reserved prices will be determined on the basis of past trend and locations of these sites. The rates would be rationalised due to the prevailing business conditions. We want the HSVP assets to generate maximum revenue for us and also ensure income can be generated for contractors, who also create jobs,” he said. HSVP officials also said that open bids would be conducted through the e-auction to ensure free and transparent bidding of these sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/visitors-returning-to-commercial-centres-hsvp-to-auction-parking-areas/story-kCZrzMUDFQ1er0UP2lnbBO.html

According to officials, the flats have been lying vacant as no EWS category applicants turned up to apply for these. “Since these apartments are vacant, the authority has decided to rent them out to private companies who can accommodate their employees. The aim of this move is revenue generation,” said Praveen Mishra, additional chief executive officer of the Noida authority. There are 1,280 apartments – 496 two-room apartments while the rest are one-room apartments –located in Sector 122, in this category.For the two-room apartments, the rent charged will be Rs6,000 for ground floor, Rs5,500 for first floor, Rs5,200 for second floor and Rs5,000 for third floor. Rent for a one-room unit is Rs 3,500 per month, said officials. All units have one or two rooms, a bathroom and a kitchen.The authority had built these apartments in 2016 for EWS category persons living in JJ clusters of sectors 2, 3, 5 and 10; the objective was to shift slum dwellers into apartments and vacate prime land. However, the residents refused to shift into apartments, saying they were happy living in plotted shanties which were closed to where they work, said officials. Private companies eligible to apply will be those which pay employees provident funds, said officials. Interested firms can apply on the authority’s website – noidaauthorityonline.in – latest by 6pm on January 21, 2021, said officials.The authority will take three months’ rent in advance before offering the apartments to the company, added officials. City residents, meanwhile, welcomed the move, saying these apartments have been lying unused for the past four years. “The authority should have come up with such a scheme earlier as the structure is in bad condition now. If it is done now then it will help them maintain the building, constructed with public money,” said NP Singh president of Gautam Budh Nagar district development residents’ welfare association (DDRWA), an umbrella body of RWAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-offers-vacant-ews-apartments-to-private-firms-on-rent/story-BxoS2DYvr184Sh2WyNx74H.html

They drove on the inner expressway lanes of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) for about one hour to reach the EPE’s Dasna interchange (about 23 km) while the regular commuter traffic was confined to the highway lanes of DME. The farmers had earlier planned that from the Dasna interchange they would move to EPE up to Palwal. However, they cut short the travel and went up to the Sirsa toll near Dankaur in Gautam Budh Nagar and returned to the UP Gate by 5.30pm. “The distance was curtailed as farmers from Palwal had also arrived in their tractors. So, we met near the Sirsa toll. Thereafter, they returned to their side and we returned to the UP Gate. It was not a ‘shakti pradarshan’ (show of strength) before the talks scheduled with the government on Friday. It was more to consolidate our collective fight and to meet other groups who are protesting at different sites,” said Gaurav Tikait, national president of youth wing of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). About 150 tractors which started from the UP Gate were joined by about 250 tractors (from villages in Ghaziabad, Hapur and other nearby districts) which were waiting at Dasna, while over 100 more also arrived from areas like Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat.The farmers were upbeat as they also deployed vehicles with music systems playing motivational songs while the volunteers also managed the flow of tractors at EPE. At DME, the tractors marched in a straight line but they occupied the entire one-side carriageway when they reached EPE.“In between, at every interchange more tractors joined our procession. All the drivers were given strict instructions to carry out the march in a peaceful manner and we did not obstruct any traffic. It is up to the officials if they had blocked the traffic on EPE. From the Sirsa toll, we returned to the UP Gate by 5.30pm. Our cavalcade comprised about 800-1,000 tractors. We have more programmes lined up this month, but a final decision will be taken up after talks with the government on Friday,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of BKU. The farmers have been protesting since November 28 at the UP Gate, demanding repeal of the Centre’s three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. The government has not accepted these demands during seven rounds of talks so far but proposed amendments to the new laws. The tractor march was organised as a “dress rehearsal” ahead of the “Dilli Chalo” call given for January 26, the farmers said. Meanwhile, farmers camped at the Chilla border (Noida-Delhi link road) also carried out a small tractor rally from the Mahamaya flyover to the border in support of the larger one being carried out at EPE. Seventeen tractors with nearly as many four wheelers of farmers affiliated with the BKU-Bhanu took part in the rally. “The idea of today’s rally was to show support to the larger one and to continue our protest against the new laws,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, BKU-Bhanu. Singh said that at least 20 of their tractors were also a part of the rally at EPE, and claimed that several of their supporters were stopped at Jewar from coming to the rally.GB Nagar police claimed that the rally did not disrupt traffic in the city. “The rally went on in two lanes and the regular traffic followed it. No diversions were made except for the existing one via the DND for Noida to Delhi traffic,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.The NHAI officials said that the distance from the Dasna interchange to the Sirsa toll is about 35 kilometres. They also said that the tractors are not allowed on EPE as per the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH). “The regular commuter traffic faced disruptions at DME when tractors drove to Dasna from the UP Gate in the morning and also when they returned to the UP Gate. Further, we had to stop traffic on the entire EPE stretch till the time it was occupied by tractors. We had written to the district authorities on Wednesday about this, but our EPE traffic was still disrupted,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. EPE has an estimated traffic flow of about 50,000 passenger car units (PCU) per day while the UP Gate (NH-9) has a PCU of about 80,000 vehicles. “We have asked the farmers’ leaders to abide by the rules and regulations, and to ensure that no inconvenience is caused to public. We have prepared a traffic plan and diversion will be taken up wherever necessary during the time farmers go and come back,” Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey told reporters on Thursday morning. However, Pandey was not reachable for comments on Thursday evening. Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), did not take calls either. In Gautam Budh Nagar, the rally ended in Dankaur area (Sirsa toll) from where tractors and other vehicles returned to the UP Gate border, said officials of the GB Nagar police. “The farmers returned in the afternoon and there were no law and order issues. Traffic on EPE was stopped and diverted, but was resumed around 3.30pm,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida. Senior officials of the GB Nagar police had inspected the route on Wednesday and issued advisories for road blockage and diversions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nhai-shuts-eastern-peripheral-expressway-as-farmers-take-out-tractor-march/story-szf1lawmWhQ7hZBWYqAIdO.html
07-01-2021||Gurugram||Cops stop Nuh farmers from reaching Palwal for tractor rally||Farmers from Nuh were allegedly prevented from joining the tractor rally at Palwal by the Nuh police on Thursday. Civil society members and social activists from Gurugram also couldn’t join the farmers’ rally and instead, marched with their tractors within the city.Ramzan Chaudhary, head of Jai Kisan Andolan’s Nuh unit, said that tractors from various blocks in Nuh were supposed to head towards Palwal as part of the farmers’ rally on Thursday. However, the police allegedly prevented farmers from proceeding ahead due to which many of them couldn’t participate in the rally. Chaudhary said that he was placed under house arrest by the police and taken into preventive custody later.“Our plan was to join the march with members from different blocks. Only two to three people could step out whereas the rest were placed under house arrest. I was the first one to be picked up at 8am. They did not allow us to gather. Those who managed to come out with their tractors were detained by the police and not allowed to move till 3pm,” said Chaudhary. He said that while the participation in the march was curtailed heavily due to the police, some people were able to join the farmers’ agitation at Palwal towards the evening.Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. The call for Thursday’s march was given by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha— the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders.Farmer leaders said that the rally was a rehearsal for the Republic Day parade that they plan to take out on January 26 to protest against the three agriculture laws.Rashid Ahmed, an advocate, was detained by the Nuh police, along with several others at Punhana, said that the police had given no reason except that they had official directions. “We were taken into custody in the morning and made to sit at the police station. We were released only post afternoon,” said Ahmed, who said around 100-150 farmers were planning to join the march in the morning but were stopped by the police.“We told the police that we simply wanted to join the farmers’ march and were not doing anything unlawful. They said they had directions from their seniors,” said Ahmed, who joined the farmers’ rally at Palwal in the evening.RS Rathee, head of Gurgaon Citizen Council, said that residents protesting against the three laws were supposed to proceed towards Delhi with tractors but the police didn’t allow them to cross the border. “We were going to Delhi with our tractors but the police did not allow us to cross the Sirhaul toll. So, we decided to cover various parts of the city on our tractors. With 15 tractors from Jharsa and Daulatabad villages, we marched through Sohna Road, Sector 5, Sector 14 and old Gurugram,” said Rathee.Inspector Rajesh Kumar, station house officer, KMP Expressway, said that no significant movement of farmers was recorded near Pachgaon. “The traffic situation was not affected,” said Kumar. Deputy superintendent of police, Nuh, Punhana Vivek Chaudhary, said that the police had not detained anyone but only prevented them from moving ahead. “These allegations are baseless. We did not detain anyone. We simply didn’t allow them to cross and they were asked to go back,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-stop-nuh-farmers-from-reaching-palwal-for-tractor-rally/story-qNTah0CEUhfKXY6WsayWCI.html
07-01-2021||Gurugram||DTCP to initiate action against illegal constructions identified last year||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) is planning to initiate action against property owners who were served a notice in 2020 for construction violations, especially those flouting the building plans and carrying out illegal constructions in their houses after obtaining occupancy certificates.DTCP officials said that field officers of all zones have already started compiling a list of all such notices and orders issued last year, and shall be submitting reports after spot inspections of such houses and spots. Based on this list, the department will be carrying out at least 10 sealing and demolition drives to take action against violators, officials said. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that the show cause notices issued to property owners are being compiled area-wise by the field officials concerned. “The director, town and country planning, has issued directions that show cause notices issued to the owners should be taken to conclusion. Action would be taken against around 10 violators every month by way of sealing or demolitions if required,” he said. DTCP officials said that directions have also been issued to the assistant town planners and junior engineers concerned to conduct site visits within the next 15 days. “Action would be initiated against violators starting next month,” said Bhath. Besides this, the department has also directed officials to visit commercial areas and markets developed in private licensed colonies from January 15 to check encroachments and other violations. “There have been repeated complaints by shopowners and visitors to markets in private colonies regarding encroachments of common areas and excess coverage by owners. We will take action against these,” said Bhath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-to-initiate-action-against-illegal-constructions-identified-last-year/story-qbsxqZmwGRmyFIY0Ld69iO.html
07-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram puts in place teams, plans to tackle bird flu||The Gurugram animal husbandry department on Thursday said it was on high alert to check for and respond to suspected cases of avian influenza virus (AIV) that has already killed thousands of birds in many states. It has received an action plan for every district from its headquarters. According to the plan, 28 rapid response teams have been formed in Gurugram for clinical surveillance at poultry farms and bird markets that is likely to start on Friday. Each team will have three members-- a veterinary officer, a para-veterinarian and a livestock handler. Flock inspections to check for dead or sick poultry will be carried out in backyard hatcheries, industrial farms, live bird markets and wet markets in the district. A retraining workshop for veterinary officers has been organised earlier in the day, to train those who have not previously dealt with flu outbreaks. Sub-divisional officers (SDOs) and district lab staff also attended a state-level webinar on Thursday afternoon where protocols for diagnosing AIV were discussed. An SDO assigned to the animal husbandry department, who attended the meeting, said, “We were told to ensure that our local lab has the equipment and experienced staff needed to test for other diseases which affect poultry and share symptoms with bird flu, such as Newcastle disease or Marek’s disease. Without being able to do this differential diagnosis, it will be hard to say for sure whether we are dealing with AIV or something else.” While clinical inspections are going to be ramped up in coming days, there are presently no plans to conduct viral or serosurveillance for AIV, though this is mandated in the action plan received by the district (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times). “No suspicious deaths are being reported from poultry farms, and the state government has not yet notified an outbreak, so we don’t want to jump the gun. If we get orders, we will immediately dispatch a sample of 39 dead or sick birds for confirmatory testing,” said a veterinary officer, on condition of anonymity. Taking stockIn addition, the district animal husbandry department is also taking stock of various tools typically needed to contain bird flu outbreaks, including gunny sacks, fogging machines, disinfectants and medical implements. “We are well stocked and in touch with vendors. We have enough enough PPE, which we stocked up on immediately after the Covid lockdown. We are low on Oseltamivir, a prophylactic medicine taken by front line responders, but procuring more supplies is not an issue,” said the veterinary officer cited above. The wildlife department on Thursday also said they are scanning for bird carcasses around wetlands and parks. “I spoke with the animal husbandry department today and it has been decided to send any and all bird carcasses we find hereon for testing, be it a crow, pigeon, egret or some rarer migratory species. We have not found any such specimen today. There is no truth to rumours that an unusual number of crows or pigeons are dying in Tau Devi Lal biodiversity park,” said Rajesh Chahal, district wildlife inspector. Dr Punita Gahlot, deputy director of Gurugram’s animal husbandry department confirmed that an action plan had been received from the state government. “There has not been any order yet to halt the movement and sale of poultry,” she said. Poultry meatWhen asked if consuming poultry was safe, Gahlot drew attention to the FAQs section of AIV action plan, which states, “In areas experiencing outbreaks, poultry can be safely consumed provided these items are properly cooked... The avian influenza virus is sensitive to heat. Normal temperatures used for cooking (70 degrees Celsius in all parts of the food) will kill the virus. Consumers need to be sure that all parts of the poultry are fully cooked (no “pink” parts) and that eggs, too, are properly cooked (no “runny” yolks).”Gurugram currently has an estimated poultry population of 1,48,532, among the lowest in Haryana. Karnal has the highest, with an estimated poultry population of 94,69,646 (and a surveillance sample of 113 birds). The outbreak of avian influenza was confirmed in four states — Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala on Thursday. Karnataka, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have since sent bird samples for testing. In Haryana, the cause of recent deaths of lakhs of poultry chicken in Panchkula district has yet to be determined, according to state level officials who declined to speak on record. Lab reports from the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL) in Jalandhar are yet to come, they said. Dr Sukhdev Rathee, state deputy director of animal husbandry department, could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-puts-in-place-teams-plans-to-tackle-bird-flu/story-SbIyVVelhj4kTlwBfb1WvL.html
07-01-2021||Gurugram||Trio wanted for car thefts, assault held in Sector 29||The police arrested three men allegedly involved in more than 24 criminal cases, including those of carjacking, assault, house thefts and illegal possession of firearms in Gururgam and Rajasthan. The accused have been identified as Dinesh Kumar and Iqbal alias Lalla, both from Gurugram, and Ankit alias Kalia, of Uttar Pradesh. They were arrested on Wednesday night from Sector 29 while they were planning to rob a driver of his car in a parking area, said police. The police said they have several cases of carjacking registered against them in and around Delhi. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Dinesh was declared a proclaimed offender and a reward of Rs 5,000 was declared on his arrest. “They had formed a gang three years ago and used to target new cars from different areas. Most of the cars were robbed from parking lots in Sector 29 and Sohna Road,” he said. Sangwan said the crime investigation unit of DLF-4 on Wednesday night received a tip-off, following which a team was formed and a raid was conducted. “We have recovered two countrymade pistols and four live cartridges from their possession. They were earlier also booked for possession of illegal arms and had assaulted a few people in Shivaji Nagar area,” he said. The police said that on January 10 of 2020, they had assaulted a family and had stolen valuables from their house in Gandhi Nagar. They had a personal enmity with one of their friends who was out on bail in a burglary case and had visited his house to meet him, but the family did not allow them to enter following which they allegedly assaulted the family and killed the person’s sister with iron rods, said police. There are more members in the gang and police said they are questioning suspects to get their names.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/trio-wanted-for-car-thefts-assault-held-in-sector-29/story-gEj75AaOTjWAMCvwfZNnRN.html
07-01-2021||Gurugram||IT, ITes firms largest occupiers of office space in 2020||Information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services companies emerged as the biggest occupiers of office real estate in the National Capital Region (NCR) in 2020, with a majority of the companies leasing space in Noida and select areas of Gurugram, such as Golf Course Extension Road, Sohna Road and Udyog Vihar, according to a report by Knight Frank India.The report said that in 2020, Gurugram witnessed leasing of 1.15 million square feet, as companies shifted locations within the city to sustain operations amid the losses due to Covid-19.The NCR, as a whole, recorded gross office leasing of 2.6 million sq ft in the second half of 2020, 24% higher than the first half of 2020. The period witnessed 104 deals with an average deal size of 24,765 sq ft.Locations such as Udyog Vihar, Golf Course Extension Road and Sohna Road have witnessed good traction for office space requirements in the past few months, the report released on Wednesday said.It also observed that the government-imposed lockdown to combat the spread of the pandemic led to temporary economic inactivity in the second quarter of 2020, as a result of which there was a sharp fall in leasing activities in NCR. However, with the gradual return to normalcy, gross leasing revived to 41% of 2019’s quarterly average in the third quarter and eventually rose to 79% in the fourth quarter, as compared to the same period in 2019. Gurugram and Noida continued to dominate the overall leasing in NCR with 45% and 43% shares, respectively, the report said.It also said that co-working operators took up spaces selectively across NCR in the second half of 2020. From a 3% share in the first half of 2020’s total leasing, it increased to 12% in the second half of 2020. Co-working operators established office footprints in Delhi, in locations such as Okhla and Defence Colony. In Gurugram, such spaces came up in Udyog Vihar, Qutub Plaza and Sector 45.The report further said that banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector constituted 13% of the total leasing in the second half of 2020. Apart from Delhi’s Central Business District (CBD) and Secondary Business District locations, such as Nehru Place, Aerocity and Jasola, occupiers also preferred Noida and Golf Course Extension Road in Gurugram.In comparison, Noida recorded gross office leasing of 0.10 million sq m, with new office spaces and competitive rents driving occupier demand in Noida. In fact, on an annual basis, office space consumption in Noida remained largely on a par with 2019 levels.Pankaj Singh, a real estate consultant based in the city, said that the pandemic affected commercial real estate business in 2020, but the situation is likely to improve. “Deals have started to take place and employers are likely to start hiring again and with vaccination likely to begin, we can see people returning to offices in the second quarter of 2021. However, the dynamics of office real estate will change and companies are likely to get better deals,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/it-ites-firms-largest-occupiers-of-office-space-in-2020/story-anybkx1mFt4IrSZ20Et03J.html
07-01-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 vaccination dry run goes smoothly in Gurugram||To gear up for the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out, a dry run was held across six session sites in Gurugram on Thursday. From verification of the beneficiary to mock vaccination and feeding realtime data on the Co-WIN platform, the demonstration, according to the health officials, was held successfully.Health workers, deployed as vaccinators and vaccination officers, however, said that despite a successful run, crowd management and realtime data management would be crucial when the vaccination starts, as 100 beneficiaries will have to be covered in a day.Thursday’s dry run included 25 participants — comprising health workers, lab technicians or pharmacists — at each site. It covered both urban and rural areas to assess the management before the vaccination starts in the next few days.At five of the six sites — Daulatabad, Chauma, Tigra, Wazirabad and Basai Enclave — the demonstration was arranged at government primary schools. In Bhangrola, which is located almost 20 kilometres from urban Gurugram, the drive was held at a primary health centre.A queue of about five to 10 participants was seen outside the vaccination booths at Bhangrola and Wazirabad. Based on the designated time slots, participants arrived at the site and were allowed to enter the vaccination room, one at a time, after the verification at the registration desk and Co-WIN platform.Neelam Rai, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife-cum-vaccinator at Bhangrola, who has an experience of almost 20 years in immunisation, said, “As part of the demonstration, we have kept a tetanus vial. But as informed during our training session, for the Covid-19 vaccine, the beneficiary will get a 0.5 ml dose through intramuscular injection. It is no different from the vaccine jab for other diseases.”A major challenge that officials will face when vaccination starts is realtime data management. Unlike routine immunisation, only registered beneficiaries will be vaccinated for Covid-19, which would require constant data update on the dedicated portal.“In the normal immunisation drives, there is no challenge of doing everything online simultaneously. Data is fed into the system later, while for Covid-19 vaccine, everything is online. Any delay or technical glitch can delay the entire process, especially when the beneficiary count will increase,” said Neelam, a vaccinator and an ANM at the Wazirabad site.During Thursday’s dry run, the health team, however, did not face any technical glitch, according to senior health officials. Representatives from the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Roderico Ofrin, the regional emergencies director of World Health Organisation and his team, while inspecting the session sites, observed the functioning of Co-WIN.“Throughout the dry run, from 11am to 1pm, there were no technical glitches. Even WHO asked us to feed the realtime data of a beneficiary having adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI). The preliminary case investigation report has to be approved and fed on Co-WIN for the state to have its access. It was done at the spot today without any difficulty,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.In preparing the model session sites, AEFI rooms were also set up. However, the observation rooms, where beneficiaries will have to wait for 30 minutes after vaccination, had a seating capacity for only six people at the sites. Singh said that seating will be increased on the day of vaccination.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that crowd management at the entrance and in the waiting areas will be crucial.“There is a schedule every beneficiary will receive which is for crowd management from entry to exit at the vaccination site. All the operational guidelines are being followed in the dry run. It is a whole lot of work. Considering the preparedness, they are ready for the vaccination day,” said Ofrin, while inspecting the dry run at the Bhangrola site.Although all beneficiaries are supposed to receive text messages upon receiving a shot, not all health workers received messages during Thursday’s dry run. Officials said that the medical officers concerned received the messages during the dry run, but it will be transmitted to beneficiaries during the vaccination process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-vaccination-dry-run-goes-smoothly-in-gurugram/story-S3or1BSHO9z1GYWxNTKGGK.html
07-01-2021||City||Vigil up at Gharana wetland in Jammu after bird flu cases in Himachal’s Pong Dam||The Gharana Wetland along the international border in RS Pura sector of Jammu district that attracts migratory birds in large numbers, has been put under round-the-clock monitoring in the aftermath of the outbreak of avian influenza at Pong Dam in Himachal’s Kangra district.The ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Disease has confirmed the H5N1 virus as the cause of the fatalities among the migratory birds in Pong Dam. Jammu’s wildlife warden Anil Atri said, “Thousands of migratory birds from various countries flock to Gharana Wetland and following the birds’ deaths in Kangra, the teams of animal husbandry department collected 25 droppings samples that have been sent to Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Jalandhar for testing.”“The reports are awaited but as such there are no symptoms of avian flu in the migratory birds at Gharana so far. There is no sluggishness among birds and we are monitoring them 24x7 via ocular surveillance,” he said. He said that the number of migratory birds at the wetland could be 2,000 to 2,500. “While field staff has been issued instructions to constantly monitor them and isolate those found to be sluggish or having symptoms of avian flu, people in the surrounding villages have also been asked not to touch any dead bird and immediately inform us,” he said. Atri said that an alert has been sounded. BIRDS FOUND DEAD IN RAJOURI Meanwhile, five to eight birds were found dead in the Panj Peer area of Rajouri on Wednesday. Rajouri district commissioner Nazir Sheikh said, “The department concerned has been directed to look into it. Their samples have been collected and are being tested.” Meanwhile, over 150 crows were found dead on Dhar Road near Kendriya Vidyalaya in the Udhampur district on Thursday morning creating panic among people. However, a senior official said that prima facie the birds appeared to have died of intense cold. “We have sent their samples for testing outside J&K and the exact cause will be known once we get their reports,” he said. Gharana Wetland Conservation Reserve in the R S Pura sector near the International Border was notified in 1981 and is home to more than 170 species of birds like bar-headed geese, gadwalls, common teals, purple swamp hens, Indian moorhens, black-winged stilts, cormorants, egrets, and greenshanks. During the winter, the wetland is visited by thousands of birds from Central Asia and some of the migratory bird species visiting this wetland are endangered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vigil-up-at-gharana-wetland-in-jammu-after-bird-flu-cases-in-himachal-s-pong-dam/story-UiRnwwErMFaSrpI47aQd7K.html
07-01-2021||Chandigarh||HP to develop remote India-China border areas after youth exodus||Concerned about reports of young people migrating from the remote regions along the 260-km India-China border in Himachal Pradesh, the state government has decided to develop more facilities for tribal residents in 76 villages.Though the situation along the border stretching 140km along tribal Kinnaur district and 80km along Lahaul and Spiti district is peaceful now, large scale infrastructure expansion in China, especially new roads close to the sensitive Kaurik sector in Kinnaur, has left government officials worried.The Centre allocated Rs 17 crore this fiscal for development in such regions under the Border Area Development Programme (BADP) in Himachal, cutting down funding because of the economic implications of Covid-19. Last year Rs 27.4 crore had been allocated under BADP.More jobs, production oriented activitiesBADP is aimed at creating more jobs and production oriented activities and schemes which provide critical inputs to the social sectors.  Additional funds will also be given by the government for the development of 76 villages within zero km from the border, says Onkar Sharma, principal secretary, tribal development. The HP government had demanded more money and proposed to the Centre that a road be built between Brua in Kinnaur to Harshil in Uttarakhand via the 17,000 feet high Lam Khaga pass for better connectivity between the two states.``We are trying to give impetus to developmental activities along the border areas, there are many projects in the pipeline, project works are periodically reviewed,” says Sharma.“In the last three years there has been reduction in funds for development of the region. There’s a need to create more employment avenues to stop the exodus of youth from the region,” says Jagat Singh Negi, four time legislator and a senior Congress leader from Kinnaur. A police team sent by the HP government to report back on the migrations after India’s standoff with China in Ladakh last year, cited lack of facilities and economic activities as the main reasons for the exodus.HP chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who also holds the home portfolio, too, expressed concern over “depopulation’ of youth due to lack of economic activities. The 198 villages in the three border blocks of 12,634 km, of Kalpa and Pooh in Kinnaur district and Spiti in Lahaul and Spiti district, do not have roads, electricity and communication systems or education and medical facilities.Indo-China trade limits optionsThe government talks about tourism development but the border areas still lack basic infrastructure “ says Negi, suggesting that young people be provided land. “ Horticulture is more beneficial than tourism,” he adds.The centuries -old traditional trade between India and China and India too has been plagued with problems with youngsters not interested in taking it up. Bilateral trade through the Shipki La pass connecting Kinnaur district to the Tibetan Autonomous Region in China the reopened in 1993 after remaining closed since 1962 since the Indo-China war. Traders in the border areas have repeatedly approached the HP Himachal government for a revision of the list of tradable items as the items allowed are not lucrative. “There is a need to add more facilities at trading points,” says Sharat Chander Negi, who retired as general manager from the Industries department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hp-to-develop-remote-india-china-border-areas-after-youth-exodus/story-cOfabIiTeDbSFbwXpByiMM.html

07-01-2021||City||Villagers of Himachal’s Chakmoh gram panchayat boycott PRI elections||In a rare development, hundreds of inhabitants of Chakmoh gram panchayat of the Badsar revenue subdivision of the district have decided not to take part in the PRI elections to be held later this month.They have taken this step in view of the anti-people stance of the successive state governments towards them especially for not constructing a hospital campus in the area. The villagers had donated 15 kanals of land to then chief minister Shanta Kumar in 1980 and a rural ayurvedic dispensary was opened there. At that time Kumar had assured them that the construction work for the hospital would start soon but nothing has been done so far.However, even after getting the land free of cost from the villagers, no one came forward to take up the work of the construction of a 100-bed hospital here.Angry villagers on Thursday held a meeting at Chakmoh and showed their anger to the government and decided not to take part in the electioneering process this time as a result all the people who had filed their nomination papers for various posts withdrew from the contest and made the electoral battle empty.It’s worth mentioning here that the Chakmoh area is dominated by the Brahmin community and its residents are the baridars (partners) in the historical and ancient temple of Baba Balak Nath located at Deotsidh. Moreover, the priests of the temple are also from the Chakmoh village and their annoyance is going to invite wrath to the leaders and activists of all the parties especially the BJP and the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/villagers-of-himachal-s-chakmoh-gram-panchayat-boycott-pri-elections/story-okBtYjpkp3hi1e8BMALorN.html

He said the teams working in the lake have been provided with necessary medicines and PPE kits.Meanwhile, Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati said that as of now more than 3,500 migratory and local birds have died in the wetland area.Nearly 90% of birds are bar-headed geese while species like common teal, common pochards, and grey-legged geese have also died.“About 60-70 crows were found dead. No death of poultry birds has been reported. As a precautionary measure, samples of 119 poultry birds have been sent for testing, and reports are awaited,” said Prajapati. The jal shakti department has sent water samples for testing. Prajapati said he held a meeting with the sub-divisional magistrates of Indora, Fatehpur, Jawali and Dehra and necessary directions have been issued.The administration urged people to cooperate with the authorities. “However, if they don’t comply with the orders we would be left with no option but to penalise them,” he said.The animal husbandry department has also formed over a dozen rapid response teams to deal with the disposal of dead birds.Forest minister Rakesh Pathania said an alert has been sounded in the wildlife sanctuaries and water bodies where migratory birds are mostly found in winter.BIRD FLU SCARE IN BILASPUR, SOLANMeanwhile, the death of over 50 crows at Jamthal village in Bilaspur district triggered fears of an outbreak in the Gobind Sagar Lake area.

07-01-2021||Delhi||Man beaten to death on suspicion of theft, crematorium priest is prime suspect||A 23-year-old man was beaten to death, allegedly by a priest at a crematorium in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur, after he was suspected of stealing from the priest’s home in the early hours of Wednesday, the police said. The police were waiting for the autopsy report before registering an FIR, but they eventually filed a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on Thursday evening, before the report came. Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), said that investigation into the death is ongoing and the priest, Gaurav Mishra, was yet to be arrested. The victim, Sunil, worked as a helper of a mini truck and was a substance user, said the DCP. Sunil’s alleged attempt to steal from Mishra’s residence located on the crematorium premises was brought to the police’s notice around 6.30am on Wednesday. By the time the police reached the crematorium, the suspect had already fled. But around noon, the police received a phone call from Sunil’s brother that he had been killed. According to the DCP, it so happened that Sunil’s colleague was looking for him when he spotted his body in a forested area adjacent to the crematorium. There were bruises on Sunil’s body and face. The DCP said prima facie it emerged that Mishra had beaten up Sunil on catching him trying to steal from his home.“We also have a couple of eyewitnesses to support that allegation, but we are continuing the investigation. We have registered a case at the Mehrauli police station,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-beaten-to-death-on-suspicion-of-theft-crematorium-priest-is-prime-suspect/story-GJM5yJHLMO1NQ6aC2IuukK.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||Never signed disclosure statement included in charge sheet, says Khalid; court seeks police reply||The Delhi Police, in its supplementary charge sheet filed in connection to the riots in the Khajuri Khas area in February last year, have relied upon an alleged disclosure statement of Umar Khalid, in which the former JNU Student Union leader had purportedly admitted his role in organising the north-east Delhi riots.However, Khalid on Thursday told a city court that he did not make any such admission before the investigators and had refused to sign the said disclosure statement. Khalid also cited the copy of the charge sheet, in which below his disclosure statement, it is written, “refused to sign”.“I have just got the charge sheet, which shows that below my disclosure statement, it is written “refused to sign”. Despite this, the charge sheet was leaked to the media. This isn’t the first time. It causes my deep anguish every time it happens,” Khalid told the court.In his application, Khalid urged the court to ensure leakage of such “unconfirmed and uncorroborated disclosure statements” must be stopped in the interest of a free and fair trial. Metropolitan Magistrate Dinesh Kumar called for a reply from the police and posted the matter for further hearing to January 14. The court also extended Khalid’s judicial custody. In a supplementary charge sheet filed against Khalid on December 26, the city police’s crime branch has claimed that during his police remand, Khalid disclosed about his meeting with former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and United Against Hate member Khalid Saifi on January 8, 2020, at Shaheen Bagh, where they conspired to organise the riots in north-east Delhi.The police have also alleged that during the investigation, a public witness, Roshan Pathak, was examined regarding the financial transactions made by Hussain in January 2020 to allegedly fund the anti Citizenship Amendment Act protests and later the riots. Pathak, who was working as an accountant in one of Hussain’s companies, had told the police that he had allegedly taken cash from two persons (Amit Gupta and Manoj Thakur) and given that money to Hussain.“It has transpired that Hussain had transferred this money from his company account to the accounts of other companies...and had used Pathak to bring the money back to him. This cash was then used by Hussain to organise the riots,” the charge sheet has alleged.The police have also claimed that facts regarding the cheating and forgery committed by Hussain have emerged -- he had allegedly induced his partner Nitesh Gupta to transfer money to his shell company accounts and had provided fake bills of manpower supply to Gupta while in fact no such service was ever provided by Hussain to Gupta.“These fake bills were seized by the enforcement directorate... Photocopies of some fake bills were provided by Nitesh Gupta during the investigation of the present case... Hence, section 420/467 IPC have been added in the present case against accused Mohd. Tahir Hussain,” the charge sheet read.The police have also alleged that Khalid was an active participant in the criminal conspiracy to instigate communal riots in various parts of Delhi.The police, quoting Hussain’s driver Rahul Kasana’s witness statement, alleged that Khalid met with Saifi and Hussain in Shaheen Bagh and hatched the conspiracy for the riots. The charge sheet further claimed that during interrogation in police custody, Saifi had allegedly disclosed about his role in the conspiracy along with that of Hussain and Khalid.Earlier the police had filed a charge sheet against Saifi, Hussain and others charging them of unlawful assembly, rioting, arson, destruction of property and criminal conspiracy, among other sections, on which the court had taken cognisance on October 12. Khalid was arrested on October 1 in this case. Communal riots had broken out in the north-east Delhi in February last year claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/never-signed-disclosure-statement-included-in-charge-sheet-says-khalid-court-seeks-police-reply/story-eRWxNA6bSD41zIWby66I0N.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||Former lab technician held for duping people by posing as high-ranking official, doctor||A 44-year-old man, reeling from a failed pathology lab business, posed at different times as assistant professor at AIIMS, Delhi, an advisor in Niti Aayog and a paediatrician to cheat people and seek favours at government facilities, the Delhi Police said on Thursday after arresting him. Identified as Devender Kumar Mishra, the arrested suspect had allegedly been using a host of fake identifies for nearly a decade until a tip-off from an army officer landed him in the Delhi Police’s net on Tuesday. Shibesh Singh, additional commissioner of police (crime branch), said Mishra would sometimes pose as a joint secretary with the health ministry and other times as an assistant professor at AIIMS. He would also allegedly pose as an advisor to the Niti Aayog and as a paediatrician with a hospital in Madhya Pradesh, the state to which he belongs. “Once he posed as a senior bureaucrat to recommend an arms licence for a man in Uttar Pradesh, in lieu of money. On another occasion, he opened a clinic in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh,” said the additional CP. Bhism Singh, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch), said at the clinic, Mishra put up a board saying he had degrees in paediatrics from AIIMS and joined hands with a nurse to provide medical services. “There were occasions when Mishra would pose as a joint secretary to stay at army messes and receive facilities meant for high-ranking officials,” said the DCP. Mishra would allegedly claim to be a visiting faculty to different medical colleges. “He used all these impersonations to promise people help with transfers and jumping the queues at hospitals for surgeries and other treatments. He would dupe people of money in this manner,” said the DCP. The multiple hats that Mishra donned was what finally did him in, the police said. “On December 28, we received an email from an army officer who found it suspicious that a man could hold so many different positions, ranging from an assistant professor to a joint secretary and a doctor to Niti Aayog advisor,” said DCP Singh. On Tuesday, the police arrested him from Panchkuian Road in Central Delhi. The police said the man is a trained lab technician. “He ran a lab in Rewa in Madhya Pradesh two decades ago. In Delhi, he opened a blood collection centre in east Delhi in 2008, but it soon wrapped up and he began perpetrating this fraud,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/former-lab-technician-held-for-duping-people-by-posing-as-high-ranking-official-doctor/story-Ead1STAAsIedFvPz0Qq9rM.html

The district magistrate had on Wednesday also held a meeting with senior administration, veterinary, forest and health officials to review the avian influenza situation.  Suhas said he has directed departments concerned to gear up to deal with any situation and follow the guidelines and alerts being issued by the Centre and the state government. “There is no case (of bird flu) here yet and these measures are being put in place as a precaution,” he told reporters. He said the administration has formed rapid response teams (RRTs) teams involving officials from veterinary, animal husbandry and forest departments which are trained to monitor the situation and take necessary action.  “The RRTs will also inspect sites like wetlands or poultry farms from time to time. Poultry farm owners have already been sensitised and they have taken precautions, therefore, there is no problem as of now,” he said. Since the avian influenza is a viral disease, the DM said, the Health Department has also been instructed to ensure adequate anti-viral drugs and bed availability in hospitals “People have been asked to only pay heed to advice from veterinary-related experts and not fall for social media rumours or create panic,” Suhas added. Routine samples from poultry farms have been sent for test and there is no positive report of bird flu as yet, he said, noting that there are two major and some other smaller poultry farms in the district. Bird flu outbreak has been reported from 12 epicentres in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, and advisories have been issued to contain further spread of the infection in poultry ducks, crows and migratory birds, the Centre said on Wednesday. The current bird flu outbreak has been reported barely a few months after India was declared free from the disease on September 30 last year. India had notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/don-t-fall-for-social-media-rumours-no-bird-flu-case-yet-noida-dm/story-ouoEX5Tc5M86vmigr9IXeI.html

They were later granted bail by the Supreme Court.On Thursday, as the case came up before Alibaug sessions court, Goswami and other two accused -- Firoze Sheikh and Nitish Sarda -- did not appear. Their lawyers sought exemption for the day, which the court granted.Special public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat took a strong exception, saying the accused should have been present for the purpose of identification as this was the first hearing after the court took cognizance of the chargesheet.He also sought issuance of a warrant against Goswami and the other two. While keeping Gharat’s plea pending, the court noted that as restrictions (on movement and travel) on account of coronavirus are in place till January 31, no coercive action can be taken in such matters.The court posted the case for hearing on February 6. On that date, the accused will have to appear before the court, Gharat told PTI.“In normal circumstances, if an accused fails to respond to summons issued by a court and fails to appear before it on the given date, the court can issue a warrant.“If on the next date too the accused does not appear then a non-bailable warrant is issued,” the prosecutor said.It is the court’s discretion, he said. The trio are facing a case under IPC sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 109 (punishment for abetment).The charge sheet claims that Naik killed his mother, a partner in his business, and hanged himself at their Alibaug house in May 2018 as he was under stress due to non-payment of dues by the firms of the three accused.Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV, alleged that the police reopened a case which had been closed in 2019 as the Maharashtra government wanted to harass him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/arnab-goswami-fails-to-appear-before-court-in-suicide-abetment-case/story-uFuMeGeTfq122FsOXnn6fK.html

07-01-2021||Kolkata||Left parties, Bengal Congress discuss seat-sharing ahead of polls||West Bengal Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) conducted a meeting on Thursday to discuss seat-sharing ahead of the 2021 Assembly Elections in the state.Biman Bose, chairman of the Left Front along with Congress’ Abdul Mannan along with other Left leaders held a meeting after central leadership of both parties permitted the state units to discuss seat-sharing arrangements.“Seat sharing was discussed, but there has been no conclusion to that discussion as yet. Further talks will take place,” Bose was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Both CPI(M) and Congress have attacked Trinamool Congress over the state’s law and order situation and on December 31 demanded that the Mamata Banerjee-led government prove its majority in the assembly.CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said that he does not believe that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has the support of an adequate number of legislators. “Many ruling party MLAs have told me in private that the government is apparently scared to call an assembly session. They also claimed that governance was getting affected due to the prevailing confusion,” Chakraborty was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury earlier this week said he does not want to take the TMC along with other Left parties in its objective to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He cited a strong anti-incumbency sentiment prevailing against Mamata Banerjee government as a reason behind his decision. He also pointed out that TMC was a former ally of the BJP.“The anti-incumbency sentiment against the TMC government runs so deep and so large that any unity of all the anti-BJP forces will only help the BJP more. It will be counter productive. People have great anger against the TMC. Aligning with Trinamool will therefore only turn people against us and help the BJP,” Yechury was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Congress leaders have also intensified their attacks on Mamata Banerjee-led government amid TMC suffering from a series of defections. Abdul Mannan after hearing reports of discontent in TMC’s ranks had challenged chief minister Mamata Banerjee to prove her majority in the assembly. “If your claim is true, please appear for a floor test in assembly,” the Congress leader said.Trinamool Congress is likely to face a close contest in the legislative assembly elections which are scheduled to take place later this year. BJP leaders have travelled to Bengal multiple times with union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda leading the charge. BJP president Nadda will once again visit the state on Saturday to review the state BJP unit’s preparations for the elections. The state has also seen incidents of violence during rallies and skirmishes between party cadres which has raised concerns among ordinary citizens and lawmakers alike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/left-parties-bengal-congress-discuss-seat-sharing-ahead-of-polls/story-PuHa3omchUtNb9jEevNFKM.html

The top court was acting on a petition by former SAD councillors Sukhdev Singh Patwari and Bachan Singh, who had contended that the delimitation of wards was not done as per rules and many wards were divided and merged arbitrarily by the municipal corporation (MC).The SC division bench of Chief Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde, justice AS Bopanna and justice V Ramasubramanian, while hearing the petition challenging the dismissal orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court, told the Punjab local bodies department to file its reply. The delimitation report was submitted to the Punjab government on October 29 last year, following which the government notified MC elections to be held for 50 wards in February 2020. The five-year term of the MC House had ended on April 26, 2020.The report invited resentment from the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiromani Akali Dal councillors, who claimed the delimitation had been done to oust them from MC. The report was prepared by a committee comprising only Congress councillors, they alleged, who had recommended 70% of the SAD-BJP wards and only 10% of Congress wards for delimitation. Therefore, most of the wards held by SAD and BJP councillors had been displaced. Among the 50 wards, there are 42 general category seats, of which 22 are for women and 20 for men, besides five for scheduled castes (including two for women) and two for backward classes (men).Mohali got a municipal council in 1984, which was upgraded to a corporation through a notification in January 2011. However, the elections were held after four years in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-puts-punjab-on-notice-over-delimitation-of-mohali-wards/story-0n7hQjdYoBbXo3vkMkOBMN.html
07-01-2021||City||Punekars push for all public gardens to be opened... PMC considering proposal||PUNE Residents in Pune are demanding all gardens under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in the city be reopened. The PMC commissioner had granted permission to reopen 81 of a total of 203 gardens in the city, from November 1, 2020. PMC has not taken any decision to reopen the remaining gardens. Many citizens and corporators are questioning this passive approach. “Many residents have approached me regarding the reopening of all the gardens. It will ease the load of existing opened gardens. I am writing a letter to the commissioner to open all the gardens. Everything else is opened. Why should it be a problem to open the gardens?” said Aditya Malve, corporator from Shivajinagar and a member of the Tree Authority.PMC has reopened 81 gardens with health and age criteria for the visitors and restrictions of activities in garden premises. Also, the gardens are open for fewer hours than before. Most gardens used to open from 6 am -11 am and 4pm-8pm. These hours were reduced to 6am - 8am and 5pm - 7pm. Citizens are raising this issue on social media platforms. Amit Paranjape questioned such time restrictions on Twitter. “Restaurants, malls, etc. are open for a while now. Why are gardens still running limited hours?” he tweeted. “There is no problem in reopening all the gardens. People have been demanding that. I feel that the old timings of gardens (6-11 am, 4-8.30 pm) were appropriate. They should be in place,” said Dipali Dhumal, corporator from the Warje area.Only personal exercises such as running and walking are permitted in the garden premises. Yoga groups and laughter clubs are still prohibited according to the order. “On one hand the administration emphasises immunity boost and on the other hand prohibits the activities which boost immunity. They should open all the gardens and put safety protocols in place. Many senior citizens are facing psychological problems because of this. They don’t have other places to socialise. Exercise and fitness should be promoted,” said Makrand Tillu, trustee Navchaitanya Hasyayog Pariwar (a laughter club in the city)PMC officials said that they have been considering this demand seriously and trying to open more gardens in the city. “We have considered this public demand to reopen more gardens. Pune municipal commissioner has taken a meeting with all the departments today. This issue was raised in that meeting and he has demanded a report on how many more gardens can be opened. We are preparing this report. More gardens could be opened by next week,” said Kunal Khemnar Additional Municipal Commissioner“There is no problem in opening the gardens I feel. If all the safety precautions are followed then there should not be any problem in opening the gardens,” said Jayashree Deshpande, a resident of Sinhgad road. “Gardens are essential for the city’s residents. I think all the gardens should be opened with safety measures,” said Anand Saraf, a resident of Sadashiv peth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punekars-push-for-all-public-gardens-to-be-opened-pmc-considering-proposal/story-OV8JxC5S3N75m8rwPlfrBP.html

Getting back to the old routine, shopkeepers are pleased to see sales returning to normal slowly but steadily, bustling bylanes packed with shoppers.“After being shut for a few months, we reopened in May. The months of June and July saw the shift to video appointments for local customers, previously only available for NRI clients. Business started picking up from August onwards as the wedding season was set to begin from October, and it takes approximately two to two-and-a-half months to put together a bridal outfit. So, we received a good number of queries and in-store appointments since then,” says Mohit Dalmia, designer, Aditya & Mohit, a unit of Dalmia Fashions who eventually stopped taking video appointments due to the low conversion rate. The store has also reduced the appointments from 30 a day to 18-20, to adhere to safety norms. Considering the current situation, do brides still believe, “Main shaadi karungi toh sirf Kareena wala designer lehenga pehan ke karungi...” or has the limited guest list also forced shoppers to cut down on expensive bridal wear? “From three functions, couples and families are opting for one celebration, that too with restricted members, toh log thoda sochte hai ₹50,000 and ₹1 lakh ka lehenga lene ke liye,” says Rajan Bansal, owner, Kala Shree Regalia, who adds the season was buzzing till Diwali. He hopes it will pick up after Lohri. Echoing the sentiment, Sanjay Vij, owner, Om Prakash Jawahar Lal says, “Shopping budgets have reduced as money has become a constraint for many. But luckily, sales have slowly started returning to normal. November and December were the peak, and with weddings lined up after January 13, this month and February look good as we have a lot of deliveries scheduled.” Vij further adds, “We often design a lehenga within 40 days, but in the lockdown it took three to three-and-a-half months for one piece as karkhanas were shut and there was a shortage of karigars.”During lockdown not only the retail stores being shut for more than six months duration but also the manufacturing setups being suspended for even longer. Ankit Keyal, founder, Asiana Couture, believes that one must realise as entrepreneurs, every hurdle towards the path of success is a window of opportunity that must be availed at the correct time. He says, “In this case, virtual appointments for brides opened up new avenues for us to grow digitally and help our brand reach new heights of customer service and experience.

Arrangements for the trials were reviewed on Thursday by Rajiv Kumar Gupta, additional deputy commissioner (development) at a meeting with the vaccination task force at the district administrative complex. Giving details, Sharma said the dry run will be conducted at three sites: the District Hospital and Indus hospital here and at the Community Health Centre in Banur. The rationale behind the selection of sites was that an urban and a rural government health facility and a private hospital would help authorities make a fair assessment of the vaccination rollout in different set-ups. The Dry run is aimed at testing the laid out mechanisms for the vaccination rollout in the district to check for gaps or bottlenecks, if any. The entire vaccination drill will be conducted barring the administration of vaccine, Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-vaccination-dry-run-in-mohali-from-jan-8/story-mtQiIBRARm8A6XYpYMxGHN.html

Based on the symptoms, if you are advised to seek home isolation then prepare a separate room with possibly separate bathroom facilities to ensure that your family members are not infected.Step 2:If you opt for home isolation, the hospital would be responsible to inform the local authorities. If you live in a society or apartment complex, do inform the nearby ward office or inform the PMC ward office. Each ward office has been provided with a war room for sanitisation of the premises.Step 3:Once the patient’s contact details are provided to the administration, PMC’s contact tracing team would call the person and family members will also be tested. PMC has prescribed home isolation for a minimum period of 17 days, even for asymptomatic patients.Step 4:For those who have returned to the city from the UK or the Middle East before December 22, they must produce a negative RT-PCR report and submit it to the PMC and stay in home isolation. If positive then report to the civic body and get admitted at Naidu hospital.Step 5:For any passengers who came to the city from the Middle East from now onward will be directly taken to a hotel and tested for Covid-19. If the result is positive then the sample would be sent for genome sequencing to check if it is new (UK) strain. Contact PMC: 020-25506800/01/02/03.“Once we get the contact details of the patients we get in touch with them and conduct contact tracing. We do provide separate waste collection options for the patient’s family but this is not for any indifference but strictly for medical reasons. Family members of the patient and those living nearby the patient’s house must provide mental and moral support to the family.

In a letter to the prime minister, the city-based NEA, which has over 6,000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) as members, cited media reports that claim that the vaccine may cost anything between Rs 200 and Rs 1,000. In the letter, NEA President Vipin Malhan said the MSME sector employs lakhs of labourers who are aged below 50 years and earn around Rs 15,000 a month. “These labourers make an important contribution for the country, work on daily wages and work day and night to manage a living for themselves and their families,” Malhan said. He added that an amount of Rs 1,000 for the vaccine will be a big sum for them to bear. “It is requested to you that people working in registered companies in the MSME sector and those dependent on them should be given a priority in vaccination,” he urged the prime minister. They could be given the vaccination by the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) or any other institution free of cost, Malhan added. The Drugs Controller General of India has approved Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and Bharat Biotech’s indigenously developed Covaxin for restricted emergency use in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/prioritise-msme-labourers-give-them-vaccine-for-free-industry-body-urges-pm/story-1TmhHh78E3C25LIeGDw6fL.html
07-01-2021||Pune||Taste of life: We are what we eat, but where we eat matters too||In the first week of February, 1939, eminent Gandhian and social – reformer Acharya Dattatreya alias Kaka Kalelkar, addressed female students in a boarding school in Satara. “This school has Hindu, Muslim and Christian students studying together. But I have observed that students from different castes and religions do not sit together to eat their lunch and dinner. Why cannot they eat together? Who cooked the food, is something you should not be worried about as long as the cook maintained hygiene in the kitchen. All that matters is the taste. The food should be delicious, that’s all!” What to eat, with whom to eat, who cooks for whom… are factors usually shaped by religious beliefs and practices. The influence of caste and religion on our plate goes beyond the diversity of eating habits. Food is often used as a tool to assert religious and cultural hierarchy. People use religion to expand or limit the food they eat. No wonder, food is considered a metaphor for identity. This identity is sometimes thrust upon the person who is entrusted with the job of cooking food. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the residents of the peths in Pune strived hard to ward off any “external” influence and maintain the “purity” of the city. Pune was almost an island, with little connection whatsoever with the very “European” Poona Cantonment which was just a few kilometres away from the city. It was no surprise then that almost all of the non-vegetarian eateries were situated on the outskirts of the main city, that is, beyond Sadashiv peth to the west and beyond Guruwar peth to the east. Some of the very old non-vegetarian eateries like Aware Khanawal, near Lakdi bridge, still exist. When Sir Parshurambhau College (then known as New Poona College) was established in 1916, a few restaurants cropped up to serve the students. Two particular restaurants, established in 1938-39, demonstrated how religion affected the foodscape of Pune. ‘Lucky Restaurant’ was one of the iconic Irani Cafes in Pune. It was situated where the R-Deccan Mall stands today, opposite Café Goodluck. Its spacious walls were adorned by photographs of Bollywood stars who frequented the restaurant. It became popular with students of FTII and Fergusson College. The food was good and prices were pocket- friendly. Biryani, chicken and fish curry, omelet-pav were some of the dishes which were popular amongst its fans. There’s an interesting story associated with ‘Lucky’ which dates back to 1938. When plans were announced by AK Irani to open Lucky restaurant in front of SP College in 1938, all hell broke loose. Visiting an Irani restaurant meant social boycott from the conservative section of society. The orthodox population of Pune obviously did not want an Irani restaurant in the city. The restaurants were free to operate beyond Deccan Gymkhana or in the Cantonment area, but were not to be allowed in the peths, they said. Social and political leaders like SL Karandikar and SM Mate strongly voiced their opposition. In the former’s case, his antagonism might have stemmed from the misinformed belief that the owners of the restaurant were Muslim. Karandikar, an associate of VD Savarkar, owned ‘Trikal’, a newspaper known for its ultra-nationalist stance. He lodged a campaign against the restaurant (which was yet to open) in his newspaper. To counter this, a notice was published on November 1, 1938, in Jnanaprakash. “We are planning to open a restaurant on Tilak road in the new building built by Sardar Jagannath Maharaj. All the allegations levelled against us in ‘Trikal’ are false. “We are simple businessmen. We know how to run our business with utmost honesty and integrity. “Our ancestors came from Iran and our religion is Bahai. We speak Farsi. We are proud of our religion. Please understand that our businesses have served Hindus for many years”, it read. The notice was signed by AK Irani, HA Irani and AF Irani. This did little to assuage the situation. Pamphlets defaming the restaurant and appealing for a boycott were being distributed all over the city. A week later, the police raided a printing press located in Sadashiv peth, and confiscated several pamphlets. The propaganda continued till much after the restaurant opened to the public in January 1939. Now that it was established that the owners were Bahái, the opposition was centered around the tea and non-vegetarian dishes served there. In February 1939, AK Irani published another note in Jnanaprakash. He clarified that his restaurant did not serve meat at all. Only tea, some vegetarian dishes and eggs were on the menu. This did little to pacify the opponents. SM Mate strengthened his fight against ‘Lucky’. Finally, it shut its shop and relocated opposite Café Goodluck in June 1939. It already had a branch running there by then. All this while, ‘Lucky Restaurant’ had a neighbour - ‘Greens restaurant’, the first restaurant in Pune to serve “Punjabi” food. It was inaugurated by Dr VA Gadkari, MLA, on June 27, 1938, six months before ‘Lucky’ started functioning. Several dignitaries like (legendary cricketer) Prof DB Deodhar, Prof Shivnarayan, Rao Bahadur, Capt Kulkarni graced the occasion. According to the report published in Jnanaprakash, Dr Gadkari hoped that the restaurant would be a boon to the students, visitors and residents of Pune. The interesting part was that in this restaurant run by Sardar Darbarsingh, non-vegetarian dishes were served. It employed Kashmiri Pandit cooks who cooked vegetarian and non-vegetarian wazwan meals. Sardar Darbarsingh, during the inauguration, had said that the Punjabis were known for their strength which resulted from the good food they ate; and the residents of Pune could benefit from the Punjabi food served at ‘Greens’ restaurant. MG Sathe, one of the proprietors of Sathe Biscuit and Chocolate Co, lived near Tilak road during his teenage years. A few years ago, he recounted to me how he would spot famous actors like Raja Gosavi and Sharad Talwalkar at ‘Greens’ and how the basement of the restaurant helped several taste their first non-vegetarian meal without being noticed. Funnily enough, ‘Greens’, while serving meat, faced no opposition from the society, while ‘Lucky’, which served only eggs then, was not so lucky. ‘Greens’ faded into oblivion in the seventies of the last century. ‘Lucky’ shut its shop around 2004. Sometimes, who cooked the food matters the most!Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

He should resign from the post of MP,” said Bhardwaj.He further said despite getting the full amount of funding from the Kejriwal government and increasing the house tax and many other taxes as well, the BJP-ruled MCD claims that they do not have any money to pay the salaries of the employees.

He told police that his son’s friends, who were out on a stroll with him in the morning, witnessed the incident and informed his family. According to the police complaint, Shivam had been selected for the GD post in army and was readying for movement to Hyderabad. The incident took place at around 6.30 am at Gangasarai village under Barahiya police station of Lakhisarai district.Irate residents of Gangasarai blocked the Lakhisarai-Patna main road, disrupting traffic for three hours, demanding recovery of the abducted youth and stern action against the culprits. The residents claimed that the Bihar police was only interested in seizing liquor, while general policing had gone for a toss.Sub divisional police officer (SDPO) Ranjan Kumar reached the spot with other policemen and tried to pacify the mob.Soon pictures of Shivam, in a nuptial knot with a woman, went viral on social media. Police swung into action and rescued the youth from Sikandra police station area in the Jamui district. Lakhisarai SP Sunil Kumar said that Shivam was rescued by the police within four hours of his abduction, however, no arrest had been made till the filing of this report.The police were conducting raids at possible hideouts of the accused.Shivam was picked up and taken to a Lord Shiva temple situated at Simaria in Jamui, where he was wedded forcefully, said police.‘Pakadua Vivah’ or forced marriage is a regular occurrence in the region, say cops. Such cases were reported mainly from Munger, Nawada, Khagaria and Begusarai districts, where prospective bride grooms are kidnapped for marriage.Earlier on December 14, one Vikash Kumar was allegedly abducted from Banarsi Chowk under Rajapakar police station of Vaishali district.

07-01-2021||City||Doing my duty, I convey problems brought to my notice: Anandiben Patel, governor UP||Governor Anandiben Patel has been visiting districts and presiding over meetings of officers about implementation of various development projects. Unlike many of her predecessors, Patel does not hold any Janata Darbars, but still she is often called a proactive governor. Umesh Raghuvanshi spoke to her about her proactive role, the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh and other issues. Excerpts.Do you hold Janata Darbar?We don’t need to hold Janata Darbar. If anyone comes to Raj Bhavan with a problem, we convey the same to the minister of the respective department. There should be no direct intervention from Raj Bhavan.Are you working as a proactive governor?I am doing my duty as a governor. I don’t like the governor spending time within the four walls of Raj Bhavan. This is why I go on tours, meet farmers, teachers and others and visit schools. I convey the problems that are brought to my notice.What about the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh?There has been a considerable improvement in the situation on the law and order front and there is a need for further improvement. I understand many incidents of crime take place because of the complicity of some officers. There are officers who remain alert. If officers remain alert and are not hand in glove with the criminals, they can bring about a lot of change. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is very alert about such incidents. The houses/buildings (of mafia/criminals) constructed illegally have been demolished recently.You have worked as chief minister of Gujarat. How do you find Uttar Pradesh?There is a difference in work culture. A desired level of activeness on the part of officers is missing. The officers should be a bit more active. There should be expeditious disposal of files. The officers should feel that files don’t remain pending with them for more than two to three days. But this keeps on happening (that) they don’t decide issues in three days. I feel bureaucracy is a bit lax in UP vis-a-vis those working in Gujarat. UP’s officers need to expedite decision-making. What about implementing the e-office?UP is a big state. They are implementing e-governance. This should show results. Works may take time. But there will be results.Your take on ordinances to make laws like the one brought to check ‘love jihad’?Yes, the state legislature has not been able to meet due to Covid-19. Under such circumstances, the governor gives nod to ordinances in the public interest.What about your visits to Varanasi?I am associated with a project on anganwadis in Varanasi. This may be a model project. The anganwadis are being repaired and painted. Toys and tricycles are being given there. I am involved as have been asked to. Now, people are coming forward to contribute. In Lucknow, 26 engineering colleges have come forward. Each of them is going to help five anganwadis.What changes have you brought about in Raj Bhavan?I have done many new things in Raj Bhavan too. The women from families of Raj Bhavan employees are being given training in chikankari. We carried out a large plantation drive. We have set up two ‘chandan vatikas’. We have set up a lotus pond and a zoo. The children (are) visiting Raj Bhavan. We are saving 25 per cent on power bills. We also took out old crockery and sent them to Kasturba Gandhi Vidyalaya. We have cleared old files that have been unnecessarily stored for years.What challenges do you face in the education sector?Yes, we do have a lot of challenges in reforming the education sector. Often, small issues cause problems for students and their parents. I have tried to set the things right in this sector. People want jobs and recruitment process should not have any flaws as this adversely affects the image of universities. We have asked for recording of all the interviews. We can call recordings to know about the candidate’s performance and the marks given. The governments in the past did not pay any attention to the issue of recruitment. A large number of cases are pending in courts and the government cannot make appointments on them.Why?This government is paying for the misdeeds of previous government. How will academic work be carried out if we don’t get teachers?How about impact of Covid-19?Yes, academic classes did not take place due to Covid-19. Those from rural background are facing problems. A way forward is being worked out. Now work on starting the classes has begun. An improvement has been noticed in the number of students attending the classes there.What about political vice chancellors?I have stopped political appointments. There is no political interference in appointments now. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his ministers don’t interfere with appointments and this has been left to me. This is done with the help of a search committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/doing-my-duty-i-convey-problems-brought-to-my-notice-anandiben-patel-governor-up/story-a9r6SI8uPvxQc5eH14DjdP.html

Accordingly, the display of cut-off list for special admission round will be done and SMS will be sent to students. Until January 8 by 6pm, students need to confirm their admission to the allotted colleges. The admission confirmation, rejection or cancellation needs to be done by student login. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic situation, junior colleges should collect their admission fee only through digital payment modes, like payment gateway, bank transfer (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS/UPI), any e-wallets approved by the Govt. of India or Reserve Bank of India to contain the spread of coronavirus.” said Dattatray Jagtap, director of secondary and higher secondary education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/round-2-colleges-declare-cut-off-list-for-fyjc-admissions/story-rtIjx8nosbMq3bQTilOhEL.html

Kite shops at Raviwar peth are in full swing for business with the Sankranti festival fast approaching, most shops have put up the board which says “No Chinese Manja.” “At Raviwar peth in well-known shops you will not find the nylon Manja as it is banned but at small shops, sellers come from Ahmednagar, Aurangabad to sell the nylon Manja. You will not find them openly selling it,” said Sayyed Muzzafar, owner of Kazi Patang depot, Raviwar peth. In 2017, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned the production, storage, sale, and use of nylon or synthetic threads popularly known as “Chinese Manja” across India but excluded the cotton threads coated with glass popularly known as “Bareilly ka Manja.” “The cotton thread is loose so in order to tighten and sharpen it up, a glass material called “saras” is used. These strings are not banned,” added Muzzafar. The shop owners confirmed that before the ban, nylon Manja was openly available in the market. Arvind Salvi, bird rescue activist from Katraj snake park said, “Due to the nylon Manja, birds face severe injuries. Every year the civic body and police claim to take action on people who sell nylon Manja but it’s not to be seen and the sale of nylon Manja continues.” On a visit to Ravivar peth, HT reporter spotted buyers openly asking for the banned “nylon Manja.” “Every day five to 10 customers come to ask for nylon Manja, we have placed a board reading “nylon Manja not available” still, people ask for it and we don’t entertainment them much,” said Saadat Bagwan, who works at Bagwan Patang shop. Since the last three to four days, the rush of people buying kites has increased. “Kids love to fly kite so I am purchasing kites and strings like every year. There is no impact of Covid-19 on Makar Sankranti,” said Meena Rathi who runs a kite shop at Warje.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/despite-the-ban-nylon-manja-continues-to-exist-in-pune-markets/story-R4kpmRNER8YVLsw5LSGShJ.html

07-01-2021||Chandigarh||Schools reopen to thin attendance in Punjab amid Covid pandemic||Ten months since the Covid-19 outbreak, schools reopened to thin attendance in Punjab on Thursday amid confusion among school heads over the requirement of written consent from parents during the pandemic. Punjab school education minister Vijay Inder Singla announced on Wednesday afternoon that all government government, semi-government and private schools affiliated to the Punjab School Education Board would be reopened for students from Classes 5 to 12. The decision was taken around 2pm but the authorities issued another notification around 9pm, saying only those students who bring along the written consent of their parents will be allowed to attend class. A majority of schools had only sent messages to parents to send their wards, but when the children arrived on Thursday, they were asked to submit the written consent from their parents. Government school authorities said the thin attendance at most schools was also due to the parent-teacher meeting scheduled for Thursday during which few students turn up in any case. 10% ATTENDANCE IN LUDHIANA SCHOOLS Barely 10% students attended the physical classes in Ludhiana with the authorities saying many parents were hesitant to send their wards, fearing they may contract the coronavirus infection. At the Government Primary School, Model Gram, in Ludhiana only seven of the 45 students of Class 5 came to school on Thursday. The students were accommodated by maintaining social distancing in classrooms. Jyoti Arora, an elementary training teacher at the school, said, “Parents have been informed to send their children with written consent. We expect more students to attend classes from Monday.” The situation was similar in almost all schools of the district. STRENGTH TO IMPROVE IN DAYS TO COME Twenty of the 130 students of Class 5 at Government Primary School, Haibowal Kalan, attended classes on Thursday. School head Shivani Sood said, “We asked the parents to send their wards with the written consent but most of them are not willing yet. Today’s parent-teacher meeting was aimed at motivating them. We are hopeful they will give their consent in the days to come.” Ludhiana district education officer, elementary-cum-secondary, Rajinder Kaur said, “We got an overwhelming response from parents at the PTMs. The attendance in primary and middle schools will improve in the next few days. Parents are willing to send their children as only two months are left for the final exams.” PTMs IN BATHINDA, PATIALA SCHOOLSStudents of Classes 5-8 accompanied their parents to the parent-teacher meeting (PTM), scheduled in government schools on January 7 and 8, in Bathinda, Mansa and Patiala districts. The parents were briefed by the school staff about the government’s decision to resume classes and the need for submitting a consent letter amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The principal of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Model Town, Bathinda, Saveen Kiran, said students of Classes 9 to 12 are already attending school daily for three hours to take preparatory tests or meeting teachers to clear doubts. “Since the PTM for Classes 5 to 8 is already planned on Thursday and Friday, there won’t be teaching work for two days. The government clarification came late on Wednesday that attending classes is not compulsory, so we started contacting parents to give consent letters if they wished to send their wards to attend classes,” she said. The media in-charge of the education department in Mansa, Hardeep Sidhu, also confirmed that PTMs are being held for two days. “Schools are being readied to follow the standard operation procedure (SOP) of Covid-19,” he said. Another head of a government school said they are working on how to accommodate more students willing to attend class. “Schools can cater to only 50% strength, keeping in mind the SOP. Each class can be divided into two sections and students may be called on alternate days,” the principal said. Private institutions in Bathinda are yet to decide on resuming school for students of Classes 5-8. In Patiala, government schools opened for Classes 5 to 8 and on Thursday with 50% attendance. A teacher of a government school in a village said, “Parents came in large numbers and brought their children along. Students of Class 6 were excited to meet their new teachers and friends after having completed primary school. In Amritsar, schools reported poor attendance on the opening day. District education officer (secondary) Satinder Singh said the strength will increase from Monday.

07-01-2021||Mumbai||Saamana editorial praises Rahul Gandhi; calls him a ‘warrior’ for standing up against Centre||Days after attacking Rahul Gandhi over his leadership, Shiv Sena on Thursday heaped praise on the Congress leader and said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is afraid of him. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana called Gandhi a “warrior” who has stood up against the Centre.“Those in power in Delhi fear Rahul Gandhi. Otherwise, government campaigns to discredit the Gandhi family would not have been carried out. A dictator is afraid even if one man is against him, and if this lone warrior is honest, the fear increases hundredfold. Rahul Gandhi’s fear is that hundredfold,” the editorial in Saamana said.Sena MP and executive editor of Saamana Sanjay Raut had, two weeks ago, criticised Gandhi and his leadership and also expressed the need to galvanise United Progressive Alliance as a combative Opposition. He had also hinted that Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar could be the consensus candidate to head UPA.The editorial added that despite being targeted by the BJP, Gandhi stood against them. It said, “Despite propagating that Rahul Gandhi is a weak leader, he is still standing and attacking the government at any opportunity he gets... the Opposition will, at some point, rise from the ashes like the Phoenix. This is what the history of the country says.”The Sena took on the Centre for the alleged use of Central agencies such as Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax Department, Central Bureau of Investigation, etc against its political opponents. “There may be differences among political opponents, but the policy of strangling the Opposition and hanging their heads at Delhi’s Vijay Chowk is shocking... Agencies like Income Tax Department, ED etc. are extremely honest. There can be no doubt about their political allegiance. They will not go to anyone’s house and knock on the door unless the political boss gives a signal. So there is no point in blaming them [the agencies],” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/saamana-editorial-praises-rahul-gandhi-calls-him-a-warrior-for-standing-up-against-centre/story-ylv1CkAo4Fg445sVTThl7J.html

Its counsel, Dr Sujay Kantawala, pointed out that the on December 24, 2020, the customs commissioner had ordered absolute confiscation of part of the consignment, and the order was completely contrary to the earlier high court order.The high court accepted Dr Kantawala’s contention and observed that the view taken by respondent No.2 (customs commissioner) that the decision of the high court to the order releasing the goods was “prima facie not correct.”“When the high court had directed release of the goods forthwith, it is beyond comprehension as to how a lower appellate authority can nullify such direction by ordering absolute confiscation of such goods,” said the bench. “It is not only unacceptable but contemptuous as well.”The high court has now directed the customs authorities to comply with the earlier orders and sought a compliance report by January 27, 2021.In a separate proceeding, also initiated by Raj Grow Impex LLP, the bench on Wednesday issued notices to customs commissioner Manoj Kedia, deputy commissioner Ram Nath Purohit and assistant commissioner KK Sharma, asking them to show cause as to why a proceeding for contempt should not be initiated against them. They have been given time till January 21, 2021 to respond to the notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-raps-customs-authorities-for-acting-contrary-to-court-orders/story-STI2uHFNAy3WmV4e9O7TFL.html

Today, the Aranayak Agri Producers Company Limited (AAPCL) has 5,753 members including 122 producers’ groups (PGs) made up of women farmers.Even during the stringent lockdown following the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, these women entrepreneurs procured 2004 metric tonnes (MTs) of maize from 533 women farmers spread in five blocks of Purnia and Katihar districts.“We are running it with the cooperation and coordination among over 5,000 women shareholders in five blocks of Dhamdaha, Bhawanipur, Barahara Kothi and Banmankhi—all in Purnia and Kodha in Katihar,” says 45-year old Kiran Devi.During these years, Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society run programme ‘Jeevika’ helped these women by becoming their facilitators by providing training and managing funds. The venture turned a corner in 2015 -16, when it procured 1014 MT (metric tonne) of maize worth about Rs 1.50 crore from 299 PGs. Since then, it has been an upward curve.“During the pandemic, we held an online meeting with over 5,000 shareholders and decided to procure maize by following proper guidelines,” Kiran Devi said.The AAPCL has put a check on middlemen in the areas. “Our company has saved women farmers from falling into the hands of middlemen,” says Sabita Devi. “We give profit to farmers without middlemen and mandis,” she adds.“All these women are illiterate, but they are teaching the rural people the economics of well-being,” says Rajeev Ranjan, manager (communications) at Jeevika in Purnia.Also Read: Talk of new chief for Bihar Congress after appointment of party in-chargeKiran Devi said her company has started procuring bananas and fox nuts/ lotus seeds (makhana) from this year. She thanked Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for recognising their efforts.“Besides Nitish Kumar, I have been felicitated by the Prime Minister and the Union finance minister,” she says, giving all credit to women farmers.“There is proper auditing of our company. We also have a storage facility. We sell maize to glucose manufacturing companies and other companies directly and earn a good profit and dividends are distributed among the shareholders,” she adds proudly.Kiran Devi was busy preparing her presentation for Nitish Kumar, who is scheduled to visit them on Thursday.“I am both elated and nervous,” she says before dropping a hint of what lies behind her success, which has come without any formal education in farm or business management. “We are managers by default. If we can run a house without doing any course, we can run a company too,” she said with confidence in her eyes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-rural-women-entrepreneurs-remove-middlemen-change-lives/story-138TPddINa0V9GAlJPIlBN.html

Ten districts including Mumbai have a CFR of over 3%.The CFR dropped to 2.55% on January 6 compared to 2.64% on October 6. The positivity rate during this period dipped to 14.88 from 20.24%. The recovery rate improved to 94.79 from 80.48%.The national CFR has dropped to 1.45% from 1.55% three months ago. It has come down to 1.74% from 2.44% in Gujarat.Mumbai has the highest CFR in Maharashtra at 3.8% followed by Parbhani (3.7%), Sangli (3.5%), and Ratnagiri (3.4%), according to the state health department.“Unlike a few other states we do not hide cases...the Covid-19 cases are not put in other categories of deaths,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope while explaining the state’s higher CFR.Barring Mumbai, the districts with high CFR either have poor health infrastructure or low testing per million because of the poor contact tracing. “Mumbai is an exception to all these and the high CFR in Mumbai is mostly because of the critical cases referred to Mumbai hospital from surrounding cities and areas,” said an official.State surveillance officer Pradeep Awate said the state has been concentrating on the districts with high CFR. “The districts are monitored through weekly reports and projections. The district administrations are told to take corrective measures to bring the mortality down. By bringing the mortality in these districts down, the overall state CFR can be reduced. Our weekly CFR now has drastically come down and hovers at around 1.7% currently. The daily positivity rate has dropped to 6.5%. The CFR was 5.2 in August, which has dropped now to 2.5%... the overall CFR will drop below 2%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-ten-districts-in-maharashtra-have-more-than-3-case-fatality-rate/story-CTePKJh7qxDhnWnyQoLGKO.html

AICC refused to clear the panel of functionaries of BPCC during Jha’s tenure. However, five working presidents were appointed to assist the president in routine official matters,” said a senior leader.“The change in BPCC is imminent also because Jha has completed almost three years as its president, an ideal tenure for any leader. Extension is generally granted on this post if achievements are extraordinary,” said another senior leader.Also Read: Congress appoints senior observers for poll-bound statesSenior leaders of the party, most of whom are aspiring for the BPCC chief’s post, have already intensified lobbying with leaders in the AICC. “The change is almost on the cards. The process is believed to have been so confidential that none is able to get any hint,” said a party legislator, adding that BPCC campaign committee chief and Rajya Sabha member, Akhilesh Prasad Singh, is among the top contenders for the post of the state chief.Kadwa MLA Shakil Ahmad Khan, BPCC working president Samir Kumar Singh, MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, former MLA and state Mahila Congress chief Amita Bhushan, senior leader Kishore Kumar Jha and former BPCC vice president Pravin Kushwaha are also said to be in the race.

07-01-2021||Kolkata||IIT Kharagpur researchers develop air-borne mobile telecom tower for emergencies||A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) at Kharagpur in West Bengal has developed a drone fleet which can provide portable and air-borne 5G communication network. Researchers said that the UAVs could serve as air-borne mobile telecom towers during emergencies such as natural disasters when land-based communication networks are damaged by earthquake and floods. “The system includes an Android-based application fitted to a fleet of drones which are programmed to create emergency communication networks by extending cellular network coverage from the closest available mobile towers,” said Debarati Sen, a professor at GS School of Telecommunication at IIT Kharagpur, who led the team. The team has submitted a report to the union ministry of electronics and information technology which funded the project. Also Read: BJP national chief JP Nadda to visit poll-bound Bengal a month after convoy attackUAVs pose a major challenge as the battery life of the device is just about 45 minutes. This makes them it difficult to maintain consistency in the service. Scientists said that during an emergency situation, it is crucial to protect critical data within a micro span of time. “Through intelligent programming, we can deploy the 5G-connected drone fleet in a particular location as soon as the first emergency signal is flagged. Endangered data in the telecommunication backbone network could be retrieved within the first three minutes of the occurrence of a disaster. The drones will relay the data to the rescue server which is located thousands of miles away while restoring the network connection through the nearest mobile tower,” said Sen In the case of network disruptions, the drones can intelligently avoid them by changing their locations and bypassing the jam. In addition to data protection, the fleet could also be used to locate survivors and provide emergency aid while decreasing the time for first responders. Rescuers and officials travelling to an affected region devoid of any cellular network can be auto-connected to such drone services nearby as they search for the mobile network. “We have already studied the performance of the UAV network in situations of emergency response in disaster management and maintenance of the quality of service by deploying a fleet of four unmanned aerial vehicles. We have used network coverage data of various mobile service providers in the northeastern states to verify the functionality,” Sen said. The team is now trying to bring down the cost of such a UAV system through reprogramming to make the system affordable for various public bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/iit-kharagpur-researchers-develop-air-borne-mobile-telecom-tower-for-emergencies/story-SXQ5ObREBJxIDZmahqhBfI.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Tractor rally today likely to disrupt traffic on Delhi outskirts||Traffic is likely to be disrupted on the outskirts of Delhi on the 43rd day of farmers’ agitation as the protesters plan to carry out a tractor march on Thursday, converging on the eastern and western peripheral expressways that form a ring around the national Capital. This is likely to affect commuters on Kundli-Manesar-Palwal highway, Eastern Peripheral Expressway and the National Highway-9.The tractor march comes a day ahead of another round of talks with the government over farmers’ demand for repeal of the three farm laws passed by Centre in September. Last week, agitating farmers had announced that Thursday’s tractor march would be a ‘rehearsal’ of their march on Rajpath on January 26, Republic Day.Shalini Singh, joint commissioner of police (western range), said that since the march is not scheduled to enter Delhi, the police arrangement would remain as before but traffic on the outskirts is likely to be affected.Also read | Farmers make their protest waterproof at Singhu borderPolice in Gautam Buddh Nagar said they will enforce diversions on the Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal or Eastern Peripheral Expressway. “In view of this, vehicles will not be allowed to get on the eastern peripheral expressway from Beel Akbarpur and Sirsa cut towards Palwal from 12pm to 3pm. Similarly, vehicles won’t be allowed on the expressway from Sirsa cut and Beel Akbarpur towards Sonipat from 2pm to 5pm and will be diverted,” police said in a statement.National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials also said the tractor march will affect traffic on both eastern and western peripheral expressways. “Tractors are not allowed on eastern periphery expressway and there will be traffic disruption if they carry out a march. We will speak to the district officials about the issue,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.Meanwhile, Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh continue to remain closed at several points on Thursday due to the ongoing agitation. The Capital’s borders with Uttar Pradesh at Chilla and Ghazipur have remained closed for those coming from Noida and Ghaziabad while the opposite carriageway remains open.For those coming into Delhi from Uttar Pradesh, the traffic police advised them to take routes passing through Anand Vihar, DND, Loni DND and Apsara borders which have remained mostly unaffected.For borders between Delhi and Haryana, the routes passing through Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Piau Manyari, Saboli, and Mangesh continue to remain closed.Jhatikara border is open for light vehicles and pedestrians while only a single carriageway of the Jharoda border is open for traffic.The traffic police said that they have been diverting traffic from Mukarba and GTK Road. Motorists who need to travel between Delhi and Haryana can choose other border routes such as the Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-protest-tractor-rally-today-likely-to-disrupt-traffic-on-delhi-outskirts/story-cUCeZQf5xxkggPzII27nNN.html

07-01-2021||Patna||Covid-19 vaccination: Bihar prepares for state-wide dry run on January 8||All 38 districts of Bihar will have a dry run on January 8 for smooth roll-out of the coronavirus vaccination programme. It will be conducted at three types of sites in every district including medical college/ district hospital, private facility, urban/rural outreach centre under the overall leadership of district magistrates with close supervision by the state health officials. Earlier, a limited dry run in identified districts of the country was held on January 2 to assess the preparedness, including testing of the CoWIN IT system. Three session sites each in the district headquarters of Patna, Bettiah and Jamui were selected for the dry run then. Handling the CoWIN portal has so far been the biggest challenge for Bihar’s health personnel who are to be engaged in the vaccination drive. They feel the application is ‘heavily technologically driven’ and even a small error in handling the programme could hold up the drive. As per an internal assessment done by the state health department, many auxiliary nursing midwives (ANMs), engaged in the vaccination programme, are not technologically savvy and have not handled android devices like smartphones or tablets, which are likely to host the CoWIN application, which is integrated with the vaccination drive. Vaccinators are required to verify each beneficiary’s identity, approve the vaccination before completing the vaccination process using the CoWIN mobile app, which is updated on a real-time basis.A series of training sessions have been held in Bihar for vaccinators since December end. “We completed Wednesday, a two-day hands-on training programme for our district immunization officers and district monitoring and evaluation officers, who are the key resource persons in the IT process. They will now train the people under them. Prior to this training, we also had online sessions for our vaccinators,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director State Health Society and also the nodal officer for the vaccination programme in Bihar. “We do not expect any shortage of personnel for the Covid-19 vaccination programme. We have 14,000 vaccinators engaged in our routine immunization programme. Besides, we have also identified another 45,000 potential vaccinators, who are doctors, nurses, medicos, nursing students and paramedics in public and private health facilities,” he said. Also Read: Amid vaccine dry runs, states say connectivity biggest hurdleHe added that the January 8 exercise, to be conducted at three sites in all the 38 districts of the state, will help in better assessment of any shortcoming. He added that Bihar does not have any storage constraint with the capacity to store 51 lakh vials at the state level vaccine store in Patna and at regional vaccine stores. The average storage capacity of walk-in coolers is 15 lakh vials and the average capacity of walk-in freezers is 5 lakh vials. Vaccines are supplied to 10 regional vaccine stores in the state through refrigerated vans and cold boxes. For field-level vaccination, it has around 2,000 ice-lined refrigerators. Bihar has enrolled around 10 lakh beneficiaries for the first two phases of vaccination for healthcare and frontline workers from among the priority group of 1.5 crore to 2 crore people which also includes those above 50 years of age and people with co-morbidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/covid-19-vaccination-bihar-prepares-for-state-wide-dry-run-on-january-8/story-nW39Mk1hXOuHcJI3roau9I.html

07-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: An architecture in self-isolation||A word like ‘freedom’ acquires its true meaning only to those denied it. And so do words like “quarantine’ and ‘self-isolation’, gradually getting more real to us as we experience either or both of them to some degree, due to the coronavirus.Armed with new understandings, it is a revealing experience to enter places in the city, that one might have explored in the BC (Before Corona) era. Some of these landmarks reveal themselves to be the architectural equivalent of self-isolation. Such as the Hijron ka Khanqah, in south Delhi’s Mehrauli. The first word in the name refers to transgender people who live in closely-knit communities. The second word implies a retreat in Persian.Believed to be a Lodhi-era graveyard, the Hijron ka Khanqah lies like a secret in the heart of a congested bazaar. Its entrance, between store fronts, is barely perceptible to the eye. On entering, however, the world changes abruptly. Gone is the chaos of the bazaar. The airy courtyard opens out like a placid sea, with wavelets rippling along its surface. The waves are, in fact, the dozens of graves spread across the courtyard. On counting, they turn out to be exactly 50.This sunny afternoon the clear sky over the Khanqah is like a blue ceiling. The place is empty except for its caretaker. He informs that the Khanqah is especially sacred to transgender people, who tend to be its only visitors, apart from rare sightseers interested in Delhi’s forgotten monuments. The only daily intrusion to the Khanqah’s solitude is the sunlight that travels through the courtyard from morning to evening, turning the whole place into a kind of sundial with its play of shifting light and shadow.The pigeons, too, gather in large numbers. Some probably drop dead from the sky. Two birds are discovered lying lifeless.Pointing to the courtyard’s only grave privileged enough to have a roof of its own, the caretaker explains that it is the burial spot of the sister of a man known as Sheikh Baba. Pilgrims usually come in “tolis” (groups) on Thursday afternoons, and offer flowers at the revered grave, perched under the shade of a giant neem tree. “They sit here in the courtyard, offer prayers and sometimes cook food.”A partially broken staircase goes up to a terrace from which one can see the entire Khanqah in a single sweep of the eye. From here, the place loses its confidentiality, as you see the neighbourhood crammed all around it. This so-called retreat now appears very much part of the world, to the point of being absorbed by it and disappearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-an-architecture-in-self-isolation/story-7CO86SeDk0GEPLGEatrWkI.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||AAP attacks Punjab CM over minister’s ‘remarks’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday demanded that Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh resign for allegedly implementing the three controversial farm laws in the state despite the protesting against it. Addressing a press conference, AAP national spokesperson and its Punjab unit’s co-incharge Raghav Chadha alleged that Punjab minister of food and civil supplies Bharat Bhushan Ashu told the media that the state had opened its doors for farmers from neighbouring regions to sell their produce. “In a press conference, the Punjab minister clearly said the three farm laws have been implemented in the state. He also mentioned how all produce is being bought and sold as per the new laws. There cannot be a bigger fraud, a bigger betrayal than this,” Chadha said.However, in an interview to news agency ANI, Capt Singh labelled as “false” reports that Punjab has implemented the farm laws. “The minister’s statement had been mischievously twisted by one newspaper, which others picked up without verifying the facts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-attacks-punjab-cm-over-minister-s-remarks/story-E9Wx1oY3ehiytfPFvgyk3L.html
07-01-2021||City||Ludhiana dyeing industry bears the brunt of rise in raw material rates||After impacting different sectors, including the bicycle and auto parts’ makers among others, the rising prices of raw material amid the Covid-19 pandemic have also taken a toll on the dyeing industry, which has now been forced to increase the rates of dyeing fabrics. Citing 20% to 25% hike in prices of raw material, the Ludhiana dyeing industry has increased the rates of fabrics. The price of dyeing polyester fabric has been increased by ₹3/kg, while that of dyeing cotton fabric has been hiked by ₹5/kg. The industrialists have also pointed out that the prices might further increase after the two common effluent treatment plants (CETP) being set up to treat the waste of dyeing industry on Tajpur Road become operational.The decision was made during the meeting of local dyers’ body on Tuesday evening. The new rates will be applicable from January 15. President of Ludhiana Dyers’ Association, Ashok Makkar said, “The prices of raw material being used by the dyeing industry, including chemicals, has increased up to 25% since the pandemic hit the country. The supply of raw material is also low as it was mostly imported from China. There are around 300 dyeing units in Ludhiana and the industry was forced to increase the rates as it was becoming difficult for us to survive. Despite that, we have made a nominal hike in rates.”Hike to impact hosiery sectorThe hike in dyeing rates has added to the woes of the hosiery industry as well, which is already struggling due to the increase in the price of yarn.President of Knitwear Club, Darshan Dawar, said, “The rates of yarn have increased by more than 25% during the pandemic and now, the dyeing industry has also upped the price. The recent increase in rates will have a nominal effect, but the cost of end products will go up, which will push the customers away. The hosiery sector is going through a tough phase.”Gas supply soughtAfter the dyeing industry was accused of causing air pollution, it has asked the government to arrange natural gas or CNG for the units.A dyeing unit owner, Rahul Verma, said that gas is being supplied in Doraha and the government had also allotted a project to install a gas pipeline in Ludhiana city, which has not been commenced yet. In December, MLA Sanjay Talwar had accused the industry of polluting the air and also gave a list of 28 dyeing units, blaming them for air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-dyeing-industry-bears-the-brunt-of-rise-in-raw-material-rates/story-gIqk4lHDtfOxkWZj9bDbOK.html

The arhtiya, a resident of Laxmi Puri in Salem Tabri, had ended his life on December 24 and accused two of his colleagues of driving him to take the extreme step.Following his death, the two persons named in the note — Vikram and Kushal Kumar — were booked for abetting his suicide. The arhtiya’s wife said it has been more than 10 days since the incident, but none of the accused was arrested.She claimed that she, along with her minor son and daughter, was ‘forced’ to make multiple rounds of the police station. The victim’s brother-in-law alleged that the police were neither arresting the accused mentioned in the FIR nor naming other persons, who were “harassing” the arhtiya in the case. Meanwhile, Salem Tabri station house officer (SHO) Gopal Krishan said regular raids were being carried out to arrest the accused, who are currently absconding. Later in the day, police officials managed to pacify the agitating relatives of the arhtiya and assured that the accused will soon be arrested, following which the dharna was lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/salem-tabri-suicide-kin-protest-against-police-inaction/story-sGWytidR4mTigbQgPB3j3I.html

Interestingly, this cloud cover is predominantly witnessed during the kharif season, not rains. We are currently studying the pattern and looking into the reason behind this phenomenon.”“The formation of cloud cover for an extended period is putting an adverse effect on the growth and photosynthesis of the crop,” Dr Sidhu said on the final day of a three-day training programme on “Climate Change, Impact, Assessment and Mitigation in Agriculture” at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). The programme was jointly organised by PAU, Ludhiana, and Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), New Delhi.Over 1,251 participants from different agricultural universities across the country, ICAR institutes, forest department, irrigation department, NGOs and overseas (Germany and the USA) had registered for the training, out of which, 580 attended the programme.“Besides the reduction in sunshine, rainy days have also reduced and consistency of rain has dropped as well. Due to climate change, sharp and heavy rainfall is witnessed. The water received from such rain does not lead to recharging of water table,” Dr Sidhu pointed out.Dr Sidhu said 2020 had been a year of cyclones of severe degree. Five super cyclones, including Amphan which killed nearly 90 people in May, Nisarga in June, Gati in November and Burevi in December, had struck the coastal areas of the country, which further triggered climatic changes, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fluctuating-temperature-unusual-cloud-cover-a-concern-for-crop-growth-experts/story-ip2gV4O0yI1ODNZo5yh5wJ.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai cyber police 6 arrest for creating 123 fake sites to dupe citizens; 10.5K people defrauded of ₹10 crore||City cyber police have busted an online fraud racket and arrested its six members from Bihar and West Bengal, including a software engineer for duping people on the internet using fake websites. The gang would advertisements on social media sites to direct people to these fake websites and steal their money under the guise of processing fees. HT had first reported about the gang in its January 2 edition.Police said that the mastermind of the gang is a commerce graduate from Bihar who had been committing frauds for the last two years. “He is a millionaire and was in the process of buying a piece of land in West Bengal for ₹5 crore with the ill-gotten money. However, before he could buy the property, the police nabbed him,” said a cyber police officer, requesting anonymity. Milind Bharambhe, joint commissioner of police (crime), on Wednesday, said that the mastermind of the racket was operating the gang in a very systematic and professional manner.“He would regularly do a recce on the internet to know the latest trends and services that are being commonly used by people. The racket would create duplicate websites of service providers such as petrol pumps, LPG dealership agencies, private loans, shopping sites, etc. Among the fake websites that the gang had created include many government websites.The gang would then advertise the fake sites through messaging apps, popular social media sites and via phone calls. Customers were offered services at lucrative rates and asked to use the link to take them to the fake websites,” said Bharambhe.The fake websites are so accurately made that a layperson cannot differentiate between them and the original website. The gang members would take money from their victims under the guise of processing fees, and cheat them, the senior officer said.The six accused were arrested on various dates in the past week. Using technical investigative methods, police nabbed five of them from Bihar and West Bengal. One of the accused from Bihar managed to escape the police and fled to Maharashtra. He was arrested from Ratnagiri. The police have seized five mobile phones, a laptop and ₹1 lakh from the arrested accused.Interrogation of the accused revealed that the gang has been operational since July 2018, and it had so far created 123 websites. Of these websites, scanning the details of two websites revealed that 10,531 people have been cheated to the tune of over ₹10 crore. Scanning of the remaining 121 websites is underway, and the number of fraud victims and fraud amount is expected to increase by many folds in the coming days, crime branch chief said.“The gang would outsource the con jobs such as making phone calls to potential victims through call centres, websites designers, etc. We urge victims to come forward and lodge complaints. We cannot reveal the names of the arrested accused as more accused are wanted in the case,” said Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (cyber).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-cyber-police-6-arrest-for-creating-123-fake-sites-to-dupe-citizens-10-5k-people-defrauded-of-10-crore/story-nJ9S1Xb7tK8XxyLwmJCmHN.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||House panel discusses anti-romeo squad in UP||The parliamentary panel on home affairs on Wednesday grilled Uttar Pradesh officials over the approach to women’s safety in the state and efficacy of its anti-Romeo squad. People familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times that issued was raised by union minister and senior UP BJP leader Satya Pal Singh. Singh is a former IPS officer. “The MP wanted to know how UP was tackling situations related to women’s safety,” a person familiar with the matter said. “He asked the officials about the anti-Romeo squad and said that no FIRs had been registered by them.”According to the person, Singh added that most of the complaints at the local level were also not registered by the police. The anti-Romeo squad, a dedicated police wing set up to prevent harassment of women, was started in 2017, shortly after Yogi Adityanath took over as chief minister. The squad faced severe criticism from all corners for needlessly targeting couples. HT reached out Satya Pal Singh but he declined to comment on the matter.The panel, led by Congress leader Anand Sharma, met on Wednesday to hear the views of representatives of State Governments of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh on the subject Atrocities and Crimes against Women Children. Among other concerns flagged by the panel was Congress leader P Bhattacharya’s concern that the meetings weren’t be attended by senior officials from the state such as the chief secretary and director-general of police, people familiar with the matter said. The BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha raised the issue of atrocities against children in Rajasthan. “Sinha pointed out to Rajasthan officials that crimes against children had jumped 87% in Jaipur and 66% across Rajasthan in just one year,” the person mentioned above said. The person added that the Parliamentarian had also pushed for operation Nirbheek, which was launched by the Delhi Police in 2015 to promote the safety of school and college going girls, to go national. Under the operation, the Station House Officers (SHOs) had to appoint a Nirbheek Woman Police Officer (NWPO) who would regularly visit schools and colleges to explain different sexual crimes to women. BJP MP Bhupendra Yadav pointed out mistakes in the document presented before the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/house-panel-discusses-anti-romeo-squad-in-up/story-LpKRdajbAzZwnYRjsMhdFL.html
07-01-2021||City||Ludhiana MC begins work to install static waste compactors||Four years on, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) has finally commenced the civil work to install static waste compactors in the city. To deal with the uncovered garbage dump that emanates foul smell in nearby areas, the civic body will be installing compactors at 22 locations in the city under the Smart City mission. MLA (Ludhiana central) Surinder Dawar inaugurated the construction work at the site near Cheema chowk, where the first compactor is being set up. The MC officials said that the civil work has been commenced at the site and the machinery will be installed in the coming few months.Residents have been raising a hue and cry over the open dumping of garbage at the secondary dumping sites by garbage collectors. There are around 45 secondary dumping sites in the city from where the garbage is then shifted to the main dump site at Tajpur road.Initially, the civic body had set up a static compactor near Dugri Sidhwan Canal bridge in 2016, since then it was planning to install the compactors at different parts of the city. The Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) is also working to install compactors at eight different sites in the Ludhiana west constituency, of which two compactors in Rishi Nagar and Sarabha Nagar have been made operational.MLA Surinder Dawar said that static compactors are being set up at a cost of over Rs 13 crores. Of the total 22 sites, five sites fall under the Ludhiana central constituency.A senior MC official said that the civil work to set up compactors at other sites will begin in the coming weeks, however, It will take a few months to install the compactors.The project might be halted as the civic body had planned to hand over maintenance of the compactors to the A2Z company, which is currently managing the solid waste in the city. But the company had earlier served self-termination notice stating that it will not work in the city after February 4. The company has also sought a payment of Rs 47 crores for the investment done in form of refuse derived fuel (RDF) plant and static compactor installed near Dugri Sidhwan Canal bridge. Delay in payment is one of the main reasons cited by the company for termination of the contract. The MC has not yet taken a final decision over the future action plan.Despite attempts, municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-begins-work-to-install-static-waste-compactors/story-LtYxuwt9OdWAn0hS1GxF3L.html
07-01-2021||City||TMC sets up menstrual room in Thane community toilet||In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has set up a menstrual room within the women’s community toilet at Lokmanya Nagar. This decision was taken soon after a survey by Thane-based youth organisation Muse Foundation revealed that more than 67% of women do not have access to toilets in their houses in Thane’s slums. Manish Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “The survey revealed the heavy dependency of women in slums on the community toilet, and the problems they faced to manage menstruation due to lack of water, unsafe changing rooms and absence of proper sanitary disposal. The menstrual room that we have set up provides water supply via a jet spray and dustbin with foot pedal to lift the lid to avoid touching the soiled sanitary napkins. Additionally, there are soap dispensers, hooks to hang clothes and a toilet for convenience.” The corporation claimed that this is a pilot project, and depending on the response, it will be replicated in other community toilets. Muse Foundation’s survey highlighted that around 56% of girl school students had to come back home to change their menstrual hygiene products as they had unclean toilets at the institutions. Around 18% of women who work did not have any provision to change their hygiene products at their workplace. The foundation prepared a list of recommendations and submitted them to the TMC in October. Nishant Bangera, founder, MUSE Foundation, said, “We will be conducting a sensitisation programme in the community, to educate women about the room and safe menstrual hygiene practices. The wall of the community toilet has been colourfully painted to invoke joy in people, thus promoting sanitation. The wall also promotes sustainable menstruation with essential points listed on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-sets-up-menstrual-room-in-thane-community-toilet/story-NwZrzy3Il6eldogRrdp4UJ.html

07-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC extends interim relief for senior advocates of Lawyers Collective||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday continued the interim relief granted to senior advocate Anand Grover and the NGO Lawyers Collective, whereby the Enforcement Directorate (ED) will not be able to summon them till January 15. While the petition filed by the Lawyers Collective, which sought quashing of the enforcement case information report (ECIR) and subsequent summons and probe, was to be heard by the division bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik on Wednesday, due to paucity of time the bench extended the interim relief. The petition had also challenged the summons issued by ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The petition was filed after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case for alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) against Lawyers Collective, which is run by senior lawyers Indira Jaising and Grover. The case, which mentioned Grover as an accused, was registered on a complaint from the ministry of home affairs, which had in 2016 cancelled the FCRA license of the NGO for allegedly using foreign contributions for political purposes. In the previous hearing on November 25, the bench had said that due to the pandemic situation and considering the age of the senior lawyer, ED could defer the summons and postpone its investigation. The court had then asked ED to file an affidavit in reply to the petition and directed that ED should not insist on the presence of petitioners till then. The court will hear the pleas next on January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-extends-interim-relief-for-senior-advocates-of-lawyers-collective/story-rZOdiMPDZaXHsk5m2RCVAI.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra realty boost: Construction premiums are slashed by 50%||In a major decision that will give a fillip to the real estate sector, the Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday passed a proposal to slash construction premiums by 50% under the new DCPR rule 2034 for all ongoing and new projects till December 31, 2021. The decision will also benefit homebuyers, as developers who avail the concession will have to pay the stamp duty on behalf of the consumers. Owing to the coronavirus-induced lockdown and liquidity crunch, the construction activity saw a slump in the state with very few new projects coming up. Subsequently, the state appointed a committee led by HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh, which recommended slashing the construction premiums. The municipalities charge this premium on floor space index or FSI, a tool that defines the extent of construction that is permissible on a plot. It is the ratio of the total built-up area to the total plot area. Premiums and taxes constitute a huge portion of the project costs. This severely reduces the ability of the builder to reduce the costs which ultimately impact the homebuyer. A senior urban development department (UDD) official said, “According to the revised scheme, developers will have to pay premiums based on the ready reckoner (RR) rates of 2019 or 2020, whichever is higher. All real estate premiums and charges are calculated on the basis of RR rates. Developers who opt for the 50% reduction in premiums will also have to pay the entire stamp duty when they sell flats to buyers.” Builders will have to give an undertaking to the local bodies that they will pay the entire stamp duty and not charge any stamp duty from homebuyers, the official added. The state has been taking steps to give an impetus to the realty sector that was sluggish. In September, the government lowered stamp duty from the existing 5% to 2% till December 31, 2020, and pegged it at 3% from January 1 till March 31, 2021. After the reduction in stamp duty charges, there was a jump in property sales in Mumbai and other major cities. The proposal was discussed in the previous cabinet, but was pushed back after cabinet ministers from the Congress raised some issues with the proposal calling it too builder-friendly. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis too criticised the decision and said it was drafted for the benefit of a few big builders and will lead to the windfall gain to some of the players from the industry. BJP leader and Bandra legislator Ashish Shelar questioned the government and asked if the decision would make homes affordable for people. “The government gave concession worth crores of rupees to developers to give a push to the construction activity, but will this benefit common man? Will homes for them become affordable,” asked Shelar in a statement. Shelar further added the decision to make the developer pay the stamp duty for the homes is an eyewash. “Beware, if you dole out premium concession to builders and bring in a condition to make builders pay the stamp duty to fool the people. We will question you if you make builders pay stamp duty after raising the cost of flats,” Shelar said. The sector welcomed the decision as they believe that it would give a boost to the construction activity. Niranjan Hiranandani, president, National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), said, “This move will go a long way in expediting the project completion and the industry will witness new launches in the market. This reduction in premiums will also help in quick turnaround of projects and uplifting the industry sentiment.” Deepak Goradia, president, Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI-CREDAI) and managing director, Dosti Realty Private Limited, said the decision served as a big boost to the realty sector. “We welcome this historic decision and are confident that this move will expedite the economic recovery of Maharashtra with more than 250 allied industries, which will generate jobs,” said Goradia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-realty-boost-construction-premiums-are-slashed-by-50/story-ueiCkqjiFWw5neODY2kKYK.html

The SVB had registered a case of extortion, wrongful confinement and restraint under provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act against Gurugram police officials, including the station house officer of Kherki Daula and a head constable. The head constable was also arrested in the case. The owner of a call centre had complained that the SHO and head constable were allegedly extorting money from them. Addressing a press conference, Sharma said that it was surprising that the case was registered by Faridabad SVB unit despite the fact the crime allegedly took place in Gurugram. “This only indicated that there was an apprehension that police officials posted in Gurugram could influence the investigations and interfere with the administration of justice. It is a very serious matter that a citizen was kept in illegal detention, assaulted and asked to cough up huge sum by the police. There was no FIR registered against the detained person,’’ the MLA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/look-into-assets-of-cops-named-in-extortion-racket-cong-mla/story-2hn3sTzBqHNfbWLk4yHg3M.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s air quality very poor, may improve over next 2 days||Air quality in Mumbai dropped to its worst so far this year, with the air quality index (AQI) — a pollutant measuring indicator — at 309 on Wednesday. The air quality measured on Wednesday was in the very poor category and was higher than the AQI measured on January 1 (307). The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. “The AQI in Mumbai is on the borderline of very poor. This is because of low dispersion of pollutant particles [owing to drop in minimum temperature]. Air quality is likely to improve over the next two days but will remain in the poor category,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR. Of the 10 stations at which the air quality was measured, Borivli had the poorest air with AQI of 344. This was followed by Navi Mumbai, where the AQI was measured at 329. While Mazagaon recorded AQI of 327, both Andheri and Malad, recorded AQI of 321. Meanwhile, minimum temperatures dropped marginally. The Santacruz station, representative of Mumbai suburbs, recorded a minimum temperature of 19.8 degree Celsius, 0.7 degrees lower than Tuesday’s minimum temperature, but 2.7 degrees above normal. The Colaba station recorded a minimum temperature of 21 degree Celsius, 0.5 degrees below Tuesday’s minimum temperature, but 1.4 degrees above normal. Santacruz recorded a maximum temperature of 30.3 degree Celsius, 1.2 degrees below normal. At Colaba, the maximum temperature was 27.5 degree Celsius, a drop of 3 degrees below normal. “The marginal dip in temperatures is because of the active western disturbance spreading from central Pakistan to the Arabian Sea. Cloudy weather is likely to continue for the next couple of days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-air-quality-very-poor-may-improve-over-next-2-days/story-Dlks8WnfplwWxMtnLe2ukN.html
07-01-2021||Chandigarh||All villagers around Panipat refinery to undergo health check-up by June 30||Following the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), health check-up of all residents of six villages located around the Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery will be conducted in the next six months to find out the impact on their health due to the pollution caused by the facility as alleged by the locals in their complaint to the agency.The decision was taken at a meeting of officials from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) and district administration on Wednesday. The villages in question are: Singhpura, Sithana, Dadlana, Bohli, Bal-Jattan and Kutana.The villagers had filed a complaint with the NGT in 2018, alleging that the emission and liquid discharge from the refinery was polluting the air and ground water in the area, which was affecting their health. The complaint was filed by Singhpura sarpanch Satpal Singh Sarpanch.Taking note of the complaint, the NGT in 2018 formed a joint committee comprising the officials from the CPCB, HSPCB and district administration to find out the impact on human health and environment.In its report, the inspection team highlighted that the issues being raised by the people were true to some extent. It cited a kutcha drain as a source of pollution, along with refinery that it found was discharging effluents in the forest.In May 2019, on the recommendations of the first assessment report of the joint committee, the NGT directed the oil company to deposit ₹17.31 crore as an interim compensation to the CPCB for the restoration of environment and later in July last year, the tribunal again directed IOCL officials to deposit a sum of ₹25 crore as interim compensation for restoration of environment, subject to further orders. Panipat chief medical officer Sant Lal Verma, who attended Wednesday’s meeting, said the directions have been issued for the health check-up of the villagers. “We will submit a report about the infrastructure and manpower required for the check-ups,” he said.Officials from the state pollution control board said all the basic tests related to respiratory problems will be conducted by June 30, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/all-villagers-around-panipat-refinery-to-undergo-health-check-up-by-june-30/story-0CMlCzFoUYdVZgjhiT9uHJ.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra waives entertainment duty of ₹3.40 crore for 1996 Michael Jackson concert||The state cabinet on Wednesday decided to waive off entertainment duty worth ₹3.40 crore and release the amount to the organisers Wizcraft Entertainment, against a concert of late pop artist Micheal Jackson organised in Mumbai around 24 years ago. This is the second time the state government is making the decision, as its previous move was struck down by the Bombay high court (HC) in 2011, and the waiver amount had to be deposited in the court’s treasury. The court had further asked the state government to reconsider its decision in eight weeks. On November 1, 1996, Raj Thackeray-led Shiv Udyog Sena (SUS), the Shiv Sena wing created for the generation of jobs, had organised a Michael Jackson concert in Mumbai. The state government-led Shiv Sena had waived the entertainment duty worth ₹3.40 crore for the organisers, on the grounds that the profits would be used for charity.“Following the Bombay high court (HC) order on April 13, 2011, the state government revisited its decision taken under section 6(3) of the Maharashtra Entertainment Duty Act, 1923. The Act empowers the state government with discretionary powers to grant a waiver. Using them, the state cabinet on Wednesday decided to waive off the entertainment duty, and interest amount levied on the pop concert in 1996,” a statement by the chief minister’s (CM) office stated.The proposal came for discussion before the cabinet headed by CM and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, 24 years after the state decision. His estranged cousin Raj Thackeray had formed his own political outfit — Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in 2006. In April 2011, a division bench of the HC had slammed the state for “non-application of mind” and set aside its order for exemption from the entertainment duty. “We have taken an opinion from the law and judiciary department, which states that the waiver was granted according to the law. The organisers too have requested the state government to release the amount,” said an official from the revenue department.The Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP) that had challenged the waiver in the HC has objected to the decision, terming it as untenable. They may consider challenging it again in the court of law, said advocate Shirish Deshpande, chairman MGP. “As soon as we came to know a proposal for the same is coming for discussion before the state cabinet, we have shot an urgent letter to the CM, requesting him not to take the decision. We have asked him to use the amount through the CM Relief Fund for those affected by Covid-19,” said Deshpande.“Our main objection is that Wizcraft is an event management firm, and the beneficiary was supposed to be Shiv Udyog Sena, which no longer exists. How can Wizcraft claim the waiver on behalf of them? This is untenable. Surprisingly, the decision came even after us submitting an elaborative presentation to the revenue secretary in 2018, during a hearing in the matter,” Deshpande added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-waives-entertainment-duty-of-3-40-crore-for-1996-michael-jackson-concert/story-zjLOkK4il8oGcYD5F4amcK.html

State industries minister Subhash Desai said the amendment will help boost the sector. “Firms will invest ₹20,000 crore in this sector, which will yield an annual production of electronic items worth ₹1 lakh crore. If we calculate GST (goods and services tax) of 12%, we can garner at least ₹12,000 crore in taxes,” he added.Desai said that through the amendment, 60,000 more jobs can be generated in the state. “After petroleum products, electronics occupy the second rank in imports, thus draining away our precious income in procuring these goods. There was hardly any manufacturing activity in the state, and all that was done was assembling the parts imported from various countries. If we manufacture them here, we will save money and also add to our economy and generate new jobs,” he added.The Electronics Policy was first approved in 2016 by the then Bharatiya Janata Party-led Devendra Fadnavis government. It promised to remove all red-tapism and attract industries to set up shop in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-approves-amendment-to-electronics-policy-to-boost-manufacturing-activity/story-JKHzFJPxJ8iXC4p5e44DYM.html
07-01-2021||Chandigarh||BJP rebellion stemmed ahead of Chandigarh MC polls||Going by appearances, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to have contained the rebellion in the party ahead of the January 8 mayor elections.On Wednesday, 19 party councillors presented a united front at the BJP city headquarters, Kamalam, in Sector 33. The 19 councillors in attendance, out of a total 20, included both Chandervati Shukla and Bharat Kumar, who had openly rebelled against the party on January 4, on the last date of filing of nomination papers.While Shukla had filed nomination papers for mayor’s post, Kumar had walked out of the party in protest over being ignored for any of the three posts of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.BJP councillor Heera Negi didn’t attend the Wednesday meeting because of poor health. After the meeting, Gopal Shukla, Chandervati’ husband, said, “We are with the party. The anger was momentary. After detailed discussions with senior party leaders including state BJP chief Arun Sood, our grievances have been resolved. Our vote and support is with the party.”Despite repeated calls, Kumar failed to respond.The turnaround among belligerent councillors, it has been learnt, came after Sood met Shukla and Kumar, and pursued them to come back to the party’s fold. “Sood met them at their houses. Organisation secretary Dinesh Kumar and state party in-charge Dushyant Gautam also talked to them. In the case of Shukla, her options had narrowed down after her nomination papers were rejected on Tuesday on technical grounds,” said a senior party leader, requesting anonymity.Scores yet to be settled“The choice of candidates for the mayoral elections has left a bitter taste among the councillors, even though only two openly expressed it. With the MC elections due this year in November-December and their tickets at stake, most councillors have decided against openly venting their anger,” said a councillor, who didn’t wish to be named.There are also personal rivalries that have been accentuated. “Some in the party want to embarrass Sood and can cross vote, others can aim to dent the chances of election of party candidates,” added the councillor.Meanwhile, the Congress on Wednesday wrote to the UT administrator demanding to not permit phones, cameras, pens, smart watches, etc inside the voting room to avoid clicking/recording of the ballot /vote.In earlier elections, parties have used pictures of votes casted to ensure no cross voting take place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-rebellion-stemmed-ahead-of-chandigarh-mc-polls/story-yMGn5bQrmyzpxNxdA0RRPN.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees over 4,000 fresh Covid cases after 20 days||With Maharashtra all set to roll out its Covid-19 vaccination drive, the state cabinet discussed the road map for it on Wednesday, even as the state recorded a slight rise in daily infections with 4,382 new cases recorded, pushing the count to 1,954,553.The state has crossed the 4,000 mark for fresh cases after 20 days, amid authorities’ fears of a spike in the first week of January in view of the crowding during new year and Christmas celebrations. The toll reached 49,825 after 66 new casualties were reported. Of them, 36 occurred in the past 48 hours, 11 in the last week and the rest 19 were from the period before last week, the health officials said.On the vaccination drive, with a dry run scheduled on January 8, ministers were informed by the health department that the state was awaiting the Centre’s policy on the drive. “Health officials informed the state cabinet that the priority list has been decided by the Centre itself, following which healthcare workers, frontline workers, people above 50 years of age and those with co-morbidities even below the age of 50 will be given vaccine shots in the first three phases. The quantity of the vaccine to be distributed in districts will depend upon the stock made available by the Centre. We have completed our preparations, developed the required infrastructure, trained our staff and waiting for the Centre’s plan to start the vaccination programme,” said a senior minister, wishing not to be named.The cabinet was further informed that Centre will provide Covishield and Covaxin for the immunisation drive in the beginning.The state is also pushing for free vaccination for the poor and a demand for the same is going to be made with the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) on Thursday. With second round of dry run to be undertaken in all 36 districts on January 8, the state health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday took a meeting of health officers of all districts to review preparations for the state-wide exercise. He directed them to identify the issues and prepare accordingly so that the drill can be completed without any hitch, said a senior health official, requesting anonymity.It was also decided that all the guardian ministers will remain present in their respective districts on the day of the dry run to monitor the drill.With preparations for dry run going on full-fledgedly in Maharashtra, there are a few districts where mobile connectivity and internet connectivity could pose a challenge, especially those having tribal areas. In many tribal areas, there is no connectivity and thus operating Co-WIN, a specially designed app by the health ministry, in tribal belts has emerged as a problem before the district administrations.Many districts such as Palghar, Thane, Nandurbar, Dhule, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal and Chandrapur have tribal population.The central government has introduced a new Co-WIN app to roll out the vaccination drive across the country. Each and every individual has to be registered on the app and their vaccination status will also be updated after administering the shot, apart from other details. The same process is applicable even for the dry run to be held on January 8.Dr Dayanand Suryavanshi, district health officer, Palghar district said that they won’t be facing any difficulty for conducting dry run, but during the actual vaccination programme, the problem will arise. “Palghar has tribal areas where network connectivity has been an issue. The dry run is going to be conducted only at three places so we won’t be facing any difficulty, but while starting the first phase of vaccination programme, we have to identify those sites where connectivity is not an issue and thus also have to provide transportation to those who have to travel long distance to reach vaccination centres,” Suryavanshi said.In that scenario, the second phase would be more challenging as the number of beneficiaries will increase and so would the number of vaccination centres, he said.Around 16,000 healthcare workers from the district will be vaccinated in the first phase of the drive.On Tuesday Tope said the people below poverty line cannot afford the vaccine even if two doses of it are priced at Rs500. “People below the poverty line, persons with comorbidities and above 60 years should be given the vaccine for free. We are going to raise this demand during our conference with the MoHFW on Thursday. Though there is no clarity on it as yet, we believe that it has been made free for health workers, frontline workers. The poor, too, should get it for free,” he said.Meanwhile, two patients who have returned from the United Kingdom (UK) and detected positive with the new strain of coronavirus were discharged after two RT-PCR reports found negative. Of the two, one is from Mumbai and another is from Pune. All the rest are asymptomatic, said state surveillance office Dr Pradip Awate.On Monday, eight UK returnees tested positive for the new variant and till date there is no rise in their number.“Till date 4,854 UK returnees who had landed between November 15 and December 23 have been traced till date. RT-PCR tests have been conducted on 3,438 of them 72 samples were found positive. Of them, 71 samples have been referred to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune to ascertain if they are infected with the new variant,” he said.Mumbai has clocked 795 cases on Wednesday, taking the case count to 296,320. Of them, active cases are 7,484. There were eight deaths reported and the toll in the city has reached 11,155.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-over-4-000-fresh-covid-cases-after-20-days/story-E4loPVWOBEDVXCxgxqLhGL.html

A special team from Delhi will be arriving on Thursday,” she added.Meanwhile, the poultry industry says they are taking precautions and that there has been no impact on their functioning and sales. “The casualties also include routine deaths of birds. There has been no impact on the business. The industry is fine,” said Darshan Kumar, president, Haryana Poultry Farmers’ Association.Team from Jalandhar collects 57 samplesSpeaking on the delay in results, Dr Mohinder Pal Singh, director, Regional Disease Diagnosis Laboratory, Jalandhar, said, “There was a delay in reporting the matter to us. Secondly, the four samples sent to us on January 3 were not of requisite quality, hence the reports were inconclusive.”On January 5, Dr Singh sent a four-member team to Panchkula to collect fresh samples. “The team returned on Wednesday after collecting 57 samples of dead birds from 15 poultry farms. The report will be out by Friday,” he said.What nextThe director said if avian influenza was detected, bird culling will be conducted in the 1-km area around where it was found, and surveillance will be stepped up in the 10-km area.Centre’s flip-flopWhile avian influenza has been confirmed in neighbouring Himachal Pradesh, apart from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kerala, mystery still surrounds the cause behind the mass bird deaths in Barwala belt.Even as the reports are awaited, earlier in the day, the Union ministry of health and family welfare issued a press note confirming presence of bird flu in samples from dead birds in Panchkula, only to retract it later.“There was some confusion. We are still awaiting reports from the Regional Disease Diagnosis Laboratory in Jalandhar and avian Influenza has not been confirmed yet,” said Dr Sukhdev Rathi, deputy director, Haryana animal husbandry and dairying department.‘Cooked meat safe to eat’Issuing an advisory, Haryana animal husbandry department said, “Poultry products can be cooked and consumed as usual with no fear of acquiring avian influenza virus, as it is sensitive to heat.”It advised people not to touch bird’s excreta or dead birds with bare hands, adding that poultry farm workers should wear masks.ALSO READ: Bird flu outbreak: Here’s all you need to knowThere are many strains of the bird flu virus and most of them are mild and may only cause low egg production or other mild symptoms among birds. However, some are severe and cause deaths of large number of birds.Generally, people coming in close contact with infected alive or dead birds contract the flu, and it does not usually spread from person to person, according to the World Health Organization, which also said that there is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and cooked poultry food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-uncertainty-over-bird-flu-centre-rushes-rapid-response-team-to-haryana-s-barwala/story-tK2HjuJdQc2tElNUGqBi9M.html

As per the Indian Meteorological Department’s (IMD) website, Ambala recorded 8.5 mm of rain in the last 24 hours till 8.30am on Wednesday. The weatherman said the minimum temperature is expected to drop to as low as 6°C on January 12 with fog, as compared to 12°C on Wednesday. Officials said that wheat is cultivated on nearly 80,000 hectares of land in all six blocks of the district. Agri experts said the crop was sowed in the first two weeks of November, followed by the first round of irrigation. Now, it is time for the second round. Gurvinder, a farmer from Mohra village, who just returned from the protest site near Delhi, said that he has grown the crop on nearly five acres of land. “My crop has already grown considerably, so the rain won’t have any impact. But, the extremely cold conditions expected around Lohri will be highly beneficial,” he said. Guru Prem, soil and water management scientist at Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Ambala’s Saha, said the showers will act as the second irrigation mechanism for crops that are currently at the tillering stage. “Nowadays, the farmers start irrigating the field after getting useful information from social media or M-Kisan/DD Kisan. So, most of them were yet to initiate the process. Now, they can straightway start using fertilisers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/light-rain-comes-as-relief-to-wheat-cultivators-in-ambala/story-HhFOWt6VGsnykfXBRQXRYP.html

The party has also galvanised its organisation set up with an eye on winning maximum 14, 234 gram panchayat elections happening on January 15. BJP state president Chandrakant Patil alleged that many irregularities were witnessed in the Council elections held a few weeks ago, and it resulted in the ruling parties winning maximum seats. “Thousands of voters who have just passed Class 6 and 7 were enrolled as voters for the graduate constituencies. More than 5,000 voter slips were blank in the Aurangabad constituencies, while in Pune constituency, 137 to 157 votes were cast in just 60 minutes when one vote takes three minutes to be cast. Many voting centres were cancelled at the last minute in Pune, with specific intention. We are moving the high court (HC) and submitting a petition to the election commission,” he added. In the elections held for six seats in the last week of November, four seats were won by the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), one each by the BJP and an independent. The BJP had to face a humiliating defeat in Nagpur and Pune graduate constituencies, held by it for years. Responding to the defeat, the party’s central leadership had taken state leadership to task. The party held brainstorming sessions in the presence of the state in-charge CT Ravi in Mumbai. “Yes, we held an introspection session over our defeat in the Council elections, and have chalked out a strategy to win a maximum number of gram panchayats. BJP’s 28 senior leaders will visit 34 districts between January 8 and 10, and take stock of the ground situation. BJP will maximum village panchayats,” Patil said. The party has also announced to outreach program till village level to collect donations for the Ram Mandir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/alleging-irregularities-in-maharashtra-legislative-council-elections-bjp-announces-plans-to-move-court/story-VKAl3PE3xDL5N1cvbuVzMO.html

In July, the city had recorded 11 deaths in a day. Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC, said, “We had set an aim to achieve zero deaths in KDMC, which has now turned into a reality. This is very motivating for health workers, who are working round-the-clock to achieve it. The death rate has always been below 2%.” Even though Kalyan-Dombivli continues to record a maximum number of Covid-19 cases in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it has managed to keep the number of cases below 100 for the past few days. “The highest number of cases in the MMR are being recorded here (Kalyan-Dombivli), however, the number of active cases and the death rate is comparatively low,” said Panpatil.Civic chief Vijay Suryavanshi, earlier in December, had asked its officials to focus on zero deaths in KDMC.For the past one week less than 100 cases were recorded, as per the state figures. On Wednesday too the twin cities reported zero deaths.On December 28, the civic body recorded 48 new cases. In September, the civic body had reported the highest number of new cases with 600 cases daily. Presently, the number of progressive cases in KDMC is 62,028 and deaths is 990. The civic body has the highest progressive cases as compared to neighbouring Thane and Navi Mumbai, which are yet to cross the 60,000 mark. As per the KDMC, the active cases in Kalyan-Dombivli are 903. The KDMC has so far conducted 286,753 tests in its vicinity, with 1,200 tests being conducted daily on an average. The doubling rate in KDMC is now 356 days and the recovery rate is 95.53%. Meanwhile, Thane currently has 999 active cases, while Navi Mumbai has 936 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-dombivli-sees-no-covid-19-death-for-a-week-maharashtra-govt-data/story-EbJ56VBpITW3slmHLEhJdL.html
07-01-2021||Chandigarh||Lockdown may have pushed communities back to traditional cooking fuels: Study||A study has raised concerns that the Covid-19 lockdown may have impacted the transition towards clean cooking fuels in the country, suggesting that there was an immediate need to frame policies to address long-term changes, such as switching back to traditional cooking fuels in the current era of fuel transition. The study that appeared in the Environment International journal, published by Elsevier on December 28, last year, was conducted jointly by scientists from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Panjab University, Indian Council of Medical Research and Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health, Emory University, Atlanta.Policy actions for clean fuel transition “Focus and target policies to the poor and other marginalised populations to ensure sustained uptake and transition to clean fuels and intensified efforts to involve direct engagement of private entrepreneurship for continued clean cooking fuel provision is required,” the study recommended.The researchers have also recommended for Covid-specific packages to be introduced for the severely affected communities to deal with the economic impact of the lockdown, beyond what has already been implemented.The researchers have also stressed on development of reward mechanisms to ensure sustained use of LPG. For example, if the household commits to using only LPG, the cost of the second cylinder of fuel could be waived.“The nationwide lockdown is likely to affect key factors such as energy access, income, transportation, that play a key role in decisions influencing household fuel use. The rural population already bears the burden of poverty and may not be able to afford and access clean cooking fuels during the lockdown. They are, thus, vulnerable to reversion to their traditional cooking methods using solid biomass fuels,” said Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, one of the authors from the Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER.The household air pollution caused due to the use of polluting fuels increases their susceptibility to non-communicable diseases, and thus may intensify the risk and severity of Covid-19 infection. Hence, there was an urgent need to expand sustainable energy solutions worldwide, the study said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-may-have-pushed-communities-back-to-traditional-cooking-fuels-study/story-O0vXCDV0u3mdfmk2ySv7TK.html

Ahmad and Mohd were convicted under Sections 302 (murder), 34 (acts done in furtherance of common intention), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death), 460 (house trespass) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, while Ram was found guilty under Section 302 - read with Sections 109/111 (abetment), 394/397 of the IPC.Begum and Verma were convicted under Section 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the IPC.Midnight heistThe youngest son of jeweller Jagdish Verma, whose shop is located near Kali Mata Mandir in Kalka, Shubhanshu used to sleep on the shop premises. After breaking into the shop around 2am on the intervening night of July 4 and 5, 2016, the three lifers had bludgeoned the teen to death with an iron rod, before looting gold and silver jewellery worth around Rs 50 lakh. The crime was captured in the shop’s three CCTV cameras, which led to their arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/three-get-life-imprisonment-for-kalka-teen-s-murder-robbery/story-Dxox91vHJPwx6TWPXeXxXK.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||Cannot set aside convictions based on compromise between parties: Bombay HC||A three-judge bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has clarified that it is not permissible to ordinarily set aside the conviction for non-compoundable offences at an appellate or revisional stage, only on the ground of compromise between the parties.The bench comprising justices AS Chandurkar, Vinay Joshi and NB Suryavanshi said HC should exercise powers under section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to set aside such convictions “only in rarest of rare cases,” when found necessary to prevent the abuse of the process of the court or to secure the ends of justice.The bench said any compromise entered into post-conviction for a non-compoundable offence cannot, by itself, result in acquittal of the accused. “Similarly, the court has no power to compound an offence which is not permitted to be compounded under section 320 of the CrPC,” the bench added.The compromise entered into, therefore, is just a mitigating factor, the bench observed, adding that such compromise can be taken into account by the appeal or revisional court to impose an appropriate sentence.The three-judge bench was hearing a reference - whether the power under section 482 CrPC ought to be exercised for setting aside the conviction altogether upon a settlement between the convict and the victim.The issue was referred for consideration of the larger bench after a two-member bench at Nagpur refused to accept the view taken by a division bench at Aurangabad, striking down a conviction on the ground of settlement between the parties, observing that maintaining cordial relations between individuals - between the convict and victim in that case - was in the larger interest of the society and therefore inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code were required to be invoked to set aside the conviction.The three-judge bench has cautioned against a casual approach in setting aside convictions on the ground of settlement. It said if a conviction cannot be set aside in an appeal or revision (on merits), such a result cannot be achieved using section 482 of CrPC only on the ground that the parties have entered into a compromise.The three-judge bench has therefore held that a post-conviction compromise can be raised only before the appellate or revisional court and ordinarily it should be considered as a mitigating factor for sentencing.It would be a sound exercise of discretion under section 482 of the code and under the law of the land to refuse to quash criminal proceedings post-conviction for a non-compoundable offence only on the ground of compromise between the parties, the larger bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cannot-set-aside-convictions-based-on-compromise-between-parties-bombay-hc/story-IzaEWh3WlnWlYfIqiZS5gM.html

According to the complaint lodged by assistant commissioner of Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) SN Bhalerao, Shantinagar police had booked Shiv Sena candidate Pravin Gulvi and five others under sections 353, 141, 143, 147, 149, 171(c)(1) and 427 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and then arrested them on Tuesday night. The gram panchayat elections are set to be held on January 15. The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon at Bhadwad Sampada Naik hall where Bhalerao is appointed as the returning officer. As per the complaint, Gulvi along with his associates went to the election office and hit Ganesh Gulvi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) candidate. The accused also allegedly caused obstacles in election work and damaged property. “A complaint was lodged with us by the officer. Based on that, we have arrested six accused in the case. The scuffle broke out after Ganesh had come to the election office to complain about illegal banners put up by Pravin. They also damaged some chairs,” said SV Raut, senior inspector, Shantinagar police station. Bhalerao said, “Ganesh had complained about an illegal banner put up by Pravin, based on which, I had served notice to the Sena candidate. When both of them were called to the office, they started arguing. Pravin and his aides picked up chairs and started throwing those on others. So, I called the police and lodged a complaint.” This was the fourth incident of violence related to the upcoming gram panchayat elections in Bhiwandi. Earlier, two contestants were beaten up. In a separate incident, two unknown bikers opened fire on Shiv Sena shakha chief Deepak Mhatre in Kalher, Bhiwandi in the wee hours of Sunday. Mhatre, who is contesting the gram panchayat elections from Kalher, escaped the firing. Meanwhile in Gundavali village, a contestant and his two brothers were beaten up by 20 youngsters. In another incident, the car of a woman candidate from Kharbao, Kavita Bhoir, was torched.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/six-arrested-for-creating-ruckus-in-election-office-in-bhiwandi-ahead-of-gram-panchayat-polls/story-Yr01sasx7MkLKxlWG21UnJ.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: MMRDA looks to acquire RIL-led Versova-Ghatkopar Metro||In a significant development, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is likely to take over the operations of the Reliance Infrastructure Limited (RIL)-led Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL), which runs the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro-1 corridor. The authority is looking at appointing a consultant for “strategic acquisition” of Mumbai’s first Metro corridor.In August 2020, HT had reported that MMOPL, which has been facing losses since its inception, has written to the Maharashtra government proposing transfer of its shareholding to MMRDA. According to the tender document accessed by HT, Reliance is ready to consider a fair offer from MMRDA for transferring its stakes.The document states that the consultant will have to carry out a valuation exercise and also look at the commercial and legal aspects involved in acquisition. “In the event MMRDA decides to proceed with the transaction, (it) would require assistance in negotiation with RIL, as well as execution and delivery of the transaction documents.”A senior official from MMRDA said, “Reliance has expressed its interest in selling its stakes and we are giving it a due consideration.” While the MMRDA was earlier looking at appointing a consultant for undertaking a performance review of Metro-1, it had not stated that it was planning to take over Metro-1. MMRDA did not receive any response for the first tender. MMOPL is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that was constituted to develop and run the 11.5-km Metro-1 on a public-private-partnership model. RIL owns 69% stake in MMOPL, MMRDA owns 26% and Transdev (formerly Veolia Transport) owns 5%. According to MMRDA, the total cost of the project is ₹2,356 crore, which includes ₹650 crore granted by the authority as a viability gap funding (VGF), of which ₹471 crore was released by the government of India between 2009 and 2014.The corridor has been operational since 2014, with a daily ridership of around 4.5 lakh, before it was shut owing to the pandemic. MMRDA is executing a 337-km Metro network in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The state government has also formed the Maha Mumbai Metro Operation Corporation Limited (M3OCL) for the operation and maintenance of all upcoming metro corridors in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane.In March 2019, HT had reported that MMOPL was in talks with lenders for a resolution plan for its mounting debt of ₹1,928 crore. MMRDA had then given a go-ahead for its proposal provided the authority’s equity does not get diluted. Anil Ambani led-RIL has been in the news for its mounting losses. Sources said that the pandemic-ensued lockdown wherein services were shut for seven months made it worse for the company.The company’s plans to increase fares to meet its cost overruns have also been facing roadblocks. In 2019, the second fare fixation committee appointed by the Central government rejected MMOPL’s claims on increasing fares and asked the company to re-look at innovative non-fare revenue methods to sustain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-mmrda-looks-to-acquire-ril-led-versova-ghatkopar-metro/story-Er7MnYr5CzJYmkIY9Z9oKO.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||PMC Bank fraud: ED summons Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s wife again||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday issued fresh summons to Shiv Sena member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut’s wife Varsha Raut for questioning in the alleged money laundering in the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank fraud case.According to ED officers, Varsha Raut may visit the ED office on January 11 for the second round of questioning. She was questioned, for nearly three hours, on Monday (January 4) by the agency,however, the ED officers were not satisfied with her responses. ED officers are to question her in connection with “suspicious” transactions that cropped up while the officials were scanning Pravin Raut’s transactions. Pravin Raut is Sajany Raut’s friend and former director of Guruashish Constructions Private Limited, a subsidiary of the Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL), which is accused of defrauding PMC Bank of over ₹6,670 crore by fraudulently obtaining nearly 70% of the bank’s overall loans.During an investigation into PMC Bank case and the involvement of HDIL, ED discovered that ₹95 crore had been siphoned off through HDIL by Pravin Raut in “active conspiracy and connivance” with various persons. The sources of the funds were illegally availed loans or advances etc. by HDIL from PMC Bank. There was no document or agreement in support of these payments made to Pravin Raut. Further, as per the HDIL’s ledger, the funds were given to Pravin Raut for acquiring land in Palghar, the ED said.Pravin Raut paid an amount of ₹1.6 crore to his wife Madhuri from the proceeds of crime. Madhuri then transferred₹55 lakh in 2010 and 2011 as an interest-free loan to Varsha Raut. The amount was utilised to purchase a flat in Dadar East, the ED said.The investigation further revealed that Varsha Raut and Madhuri are partners in Avani Construction. Varsha Raut received ₹12 lakh from this entity as overdrawn capital converted into a loan on a contribution of mere ₹5,625. The loan amount of ₹12 lakh is still outstanding. ED officials wish to question Varsha Raut regarding these transactions.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has already provisionally attached Pravin Raut’s properties worth ₹72 crore under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the PMC Bank fraud case.Pravin Raut was also arrested by the Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) in February in connection with the ₹1,034 crore redevelopment fraud case, in which Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) is the complainant.ED’s money laundering probe in the PMC Bank case is based on the Mumbai EOW’s September 2019 FIR registered against HDIL, its promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan, the bank’s former chairman Waryam Singh and managing director Joy Thomas and some other accused of allegedly causing losses worth thousands of crores to the bank to reap gains for themselves.Previously, Sanjay Raut had termed ED’s action as a witch hunt. He said his wife works as a teacher and had taken a loan of ₹50 lakh from her friend 10 years ago. “For the past one-and-a-half months, ED has been following up with us. We’ve given all the documents they demanded and showed our IT (income tax) returns and my Rajya Sabha affidavit. As the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) failed in their intention, they are now targeting our family members,” Sanjay Raut alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-fraud-ed-summons-shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut-s-wife-again/story-WKmO0mK8gAKslIPiyIYiFM.html

According to police, Pandey is a native of Raniganj area of Pratapgarh district and has completed Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Lucknow. However, as he started creating troubles for locals in a bid to gain hold in Pratapgarh, his parents sent him to Mumbai in a bid to refrain him from getting involved in criminal activities, said a police officer from the crime branch.The accused has a past case of attempt to murder in Uttar Pradesh and a case of kidnapping and rape in Jharkhand. He was arrested in both the cases and was out on bail. “During his custody, he allegedly came in contact with few criminals and got the phone number of Mahato. He called him on August 14, threatened him and demanded ₹15 lakh,” said inspector Deepak Chavan of unit 6. He threatened Mahato that he would go to his house and kill him if he failed to hand over the amount, Chavan said.Initially, a case was registered in Gonda police station in Ranchi, Jharkhand, against an unknown person. The Jharkhand Police conducted an inquiry and traced the mobile‘s location in Mumbai. They also identified the person and shared his photograph along with his location with the Mumbai Police.

07-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lookout notice against UK couple for cheating people, aide arrested||The Mumbai Police has initiated a lookout notice against a couple from the United Kingdom (UK) for allegedly duping people of crores through six websites by luring them into investing in rare coins and promising them high returns citing that the value of these coins would rise. Khar police arrested the couple’s Mumbai-based associate identified as Amir Yakub Shaikh, 30, on Wednesday. The case came to notice after a woman approached Khar police after she allegedly lost ₹72 lakh to the couple’s ponzi scheme. Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police (zone 9), said the accused, identified as Ahmed Khan, had opened a company named EA Rarcoa Collectibles Pvt Ltd in Mumbai and Bengaluru, and launched six websites to lure people into investing in rare coins. “In the beginning, Khan gave returns to his investors but later he duped them,” said Trimukhe. When the investors demanded answers, Khan allegedly asked Shaikh to buy coins from Chor Bazaar in Mumbai and gave it to the clients claiming that he had given them rare and precious coins. He had, however, warned them not to open the box. After the woman lodged a complaint, Khar police tracked Khan and his wife but they fled to the UK. The police then arrested Shaikh from Mumbai Central on Wednesday. While investigating the case, the police found out that Shaikh had collected ₹1 crore in his company account called Iliana Marketing. “We have issued lookout notices for Khan and his wife and are investigating the came to find out how many more people the trio cheated,” said Trimukhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-lookout-notice-against-uk-couple-for-cheating-people-aide-arrested/story-yaH0XgXzwbZY6mDssC5N4K.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||MVA government forms third panel to look for Mumbai Metro car shed plot||The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) on Wednesday formed a nine-member committee under state chief secretary Sanjay Kumar for looking at alternate plots for building the car shed for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) and Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar to Vikhroli). The committee will specifically look at the plots in Aarey and Kanjurmarg. According to a government resolution issued on Wednesday, the committee is expected to submit its report in a month. This will be the third committee to look at alternate plots for the Metro-3 car shed since 2015. On December 26, HT had reported that the state is likely to form a committee to resolve the unending dispute. Thackeray has been squarely criticised by the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the shifting of the shed saying it will delay the project by three years and lead to the escalation of the cost at least by ₹4,000 crore. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis attacked Thackeray saying the decision of shifting the shed location was to satisfy his ego. As per the terms of reference, the committee will have to see if the proposed car shed in a 25-hectare plot in Aarey would suffice or would the project require more land and tree-cutting to be undertaken at the plot. Thackeray, in his address to the state in December, had stated that the project would require more land in Aarey, which would end up destroying the green lung. The committee has to look at the feasibility of integrating lines 3 and 6 and also look at the estimated cost and timeline in doing so. The committee has to also see if Kanjurmarg will be a better option than Aarey and if the 102-acre plot in Kanjurmarg would suffice future requirements for line 3,6 and 4 (Wadala-Thane-Kasarwadavali). “The committee has to look at all available options and recommend the right plot looking at the future of the project,” the resolution states. While MVA shifted the car shed from the controversial Aarey to Kanjurmarg, the Bombay High Court (HC) stayed the transfer after the Central government and private parties claimed ownership of the plot. The state government had planned to build an integrated car shed for lines 3,4 and 6 at Kanjurmarg, which would also serve as an integration with the proposed line 14 (Kanjurmarg to Badlapur). In 2015, the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had formed a committee under former metropolitan commissioner UPS Madan to find an alternative site for the depot. The MVA government, too, in December 2019, had formed a committee under additional chief secretary (finance) Manoj Saunik to study the alternatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mva-government-forms-third-panel-to-look-for-mumbai-metro-car-shed-plot/story-WQvhIAuqxjMOh08rZGSowK.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||Process to find new Maharashtra Congress chief begins, in-charge meets senior leaders||The process of change in the guards in the state unit of the Congress has begun. The state in-charge of the party, HK Patil, on Wednesday, met party legislators and senior leaders to discuss names of the leaders, for the new responsibility. The party is expected to declare the new chief to Maharashtra Congress, in the next few weeks. During his interaction with party legislators from both the houses on Wednesday, the central leadership reportedly received mix opinions about the incumbent leadership and the potential names. A few party members of Legislative Assembly (MLA) and members of Legislative Council (MLC) opined to continue Thorat in the post, while others wanted a change in leadership and also suggested names. Rajya Sabha member of Parliament (MP) and party’s Gujarat in-charge Rajiv Satav, Maharashtra Assembly speaker Nana Patole, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar and women and child welfare minister Yashomati Thakur are believed to be frontrunners for the post. All of them are non-Maratha leaders and being considered, after the party’s central leadership reportedly decided to handpick state unit chief from other backward classes. The party is reportedly serious about picking a leader from Vidarbha, which has been assumed to be a stronghold of the party. Thorat, who currently holds three positions – state revenue minister, Congress legislative party chief, besides state unit chief- has reportedly told the central leadership that he was ready to quit if a party wishes so. After meeting KC Venugopal, general secretary, All India Congress Committee, in Delhi two days ago, he said that he will cooperate the new leader. He is reportedly pushing for Satav’s candidature. A few other senior leaders have opposed Satav saying he has hardly worked in Maharashtra and had even opted out of the fray during 2019 Lok Sabha election. Senior party leader and public works minister Ashok Chavan has been batting for Wadettiwar, while Prithviraj Chavan reportedly said that there was no need of the change in leadership at this juncture. “Party has probably decided to go for one leader one position policy. Indeed, many leaders like Nitin Raut, Nana Patole in Maharashtra and Kamal Nath in Madhya Pradesh and other states hold multiple posts. In the wake of the major upcoming district councils, municipal corporations and other civic body polls, the changes are likely to happen at the earliest,” a senior party leader said. Meanwhile, reiterating that they want to go solo in Brihnamumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections to be held in 2022, Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap on Wednesday demanded completed waiver of property tax to the flat measuring less than 500 sq ft in Mumbai. He has demanded a 60% discount in property tax to the flats measuring between 501 and 700 sqft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/process-to-find-new-maharashtra-congress-chief-begins-in-charge-meets-senior-leaders/story-ELXGDBLA7BxkYq5LhrPG0J.html

He said the Maharashtra cabinet has taken a decision to rename Aurangabad airport after Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and a resolution on the same was also passed unanimously in both the houses of the state legislature. Thackeray said that the chief secretary’s office has also been communicating with the Union ministry on it. “So, a notification to rename Aurangabad Airport as Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Airport should be issued at the earliest,” he added.Meanwhile, ruling Shiv Sena and Congress are at loggerheads over renaming of Aurangabad city as Sambhaji Nagar. The Sena has raked up its decades-old proposal to rename the city, which is expected to have civic polls in the next few months, while the Congress has opposed the renaming.While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is cornering Thackeray-led Shiv Sena on the issue of renaming Aurangabad city after its alliance partner Congress opposed it, the Sena has questioned as to why the BJP-led Central government was not clearing the airport renaming proposal sent by the state. Earlier on Monday, Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut had said that BJP leaders from Maharashtra must go to Delhi and ask why the Centre has not cleared the proposal.Interestingly on Wednesday, CMO’s official Twitter handle referred to Aurangabad as Sambhaji Nagar while putting out a tweet on a cabinet decision. However, the statement from the CMO on the cabinet decision to increase of 165 beds and create 360 posts in government medical college and cancer hospital in Aurangabad did not refer to the city as Sambhaji Nagar.

The army, in response to HT’s queries, clarified that no tree has been cut nor any machine used, and the area has been developed as a “recreational spot”.The Delhi forest department, last October, had sent a notice to the army, noting that a portion of the green area between Mandir Marg and Cassels Road in Cantonment was being developed as a recreational spot named “Taurus Plaza”. The notice said teams from the office of deputy conservator forests (western range) conducted inspections in the area and found that bushes and undergrowth had been cleared away with excavators, which was not only a violation of the Forest Conservation Act, but also in contrivance of a 1997 Supreme Court judgment, which prohibits such “non-forest” activity. “During field visits by officials of this division, it has been observed that the user agency has cleared away bushes and grass and has levelled the area using JCB machines (excavators). Also, there is work of landscaping going on in the area,” the notice from the forest department read. The notice added, “You are hereby directed not to carry out any non-forest activity within the deemed forest land of 3 hectares.” The original list of marked deemed forest areas, which was submitted as an affidavit before the Supreme Court in 1997, includes the three-hectare green space between Mandir Marg and Cassels Road in Delhi Cantonment. When Hindustan Times visited the area that is now known as ”Taurus Plaza”, where benches and pathways have also been laid out for the public, we saw that while developing the space as a recreational spot, trees have been drilled and decorative items and art installations such as bird houses, cycles and mannequins have been speared onto them. The residents of the cantonment said till a few months ago, this area was a green space with a walking path and a few benches placed near the roadside, where people could sit and watch the peacocks. Now that the thick bushes and undergrowth have been hacked away, and with more people visiting the plaza, peacock sightings have become rare. Responding to HT’s queries on the development of this space, which has been marked as ”deemed forest land”, an army spokesperson said that army is involved in tree plantation drives at all its stations. “Delhi Cantonment is considered the lungs of Delhi by contributing to the clean air. Within the cantonment, we also maintain recreational and environmental parks, which provide open spaces to communities and also educate our future generations about the relevance and importance of nature,” the office of additional directorate general, public information, said. It further said, “We have replied to the agency concerned that there has been no cutting of trees or the use of any plant machine in the said area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/portion-of-deemed-forest-in-delhi-cantt-cleared-of-bushes-to-make-way-for-park/story-Kv9XTHpjbdXtAwTmSanFmL.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||Temperature to dip from Thursday, dense fog in store: IMD||Residents of the Capital on Wednesday woke up to a hailstorm, followed by a brief but intense spell of rainfall. The increased moisture in the air, along with slow winds, which also changed direction, also caused a rise in the city’s pollution. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the four-day spell of intense rain in Delhi and the National Capital Region, as the result of a western disturbance, ended in a hailstorm in some parts of the Capital around 7.30am on Wednesday. IMD data shows that Delhi has over the last four days received 56.6mm rainfall, the highest in January since 1999, when the city received 59.7mm. In 2019, the city had received 54.1 mm rain in the month. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the western disturbance crossed Delhi on Wednesday afternoon. “The impact of the western disturbance was leading to higher maximum and minimum temperatures in Delhi and NCR towns. Temperatures will start dipping from Thursday,. There is also a forecast of dense fog over Delhi in the coming two days,” Srivastava said. The minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker of the city, on Wednesday was 13°C, six notches above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 21.3°C, two above normal. The met department’s forecast said that by January 8, the minimum temperature will fall to around 8°C.Scientists said that low wind speeds and dense fog on Wednesday pushed Delhi’s air quality into the ‘poor’ category. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Wednesday was 226, in the ‘poor’ zone. On Tuesday, the AQI was 140, categorised as ‘moderate’. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said the AQI is expected to deteriorate further on Thursday as there is a forecast of dense fog and calm winds. “On Wednesday too, we saw foggy conditions throughout the day, which led to an accumulation of pollution. Air quality is expected to worsen till January 9, when another western disturbance will cross Delhi and lead to light rain in certain parts. Wind speeds will improve and pollution particles will start dispersing,” said Soni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/temperature-to-dip-from-thursday-dense-fog-in-store-imd/story-QQK80EVLVvE4sa60oMJrWM.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||Ahead of talks with govt, protesting farmers to carry out tractor march today||Thousands of farmers protesting on Delhi’s borders demanding repeal of three contentious farm laws will carry out a tractor march on Thursday, converging on the eastern and western peripheral expressways that form a ring around Delhi. However, they will not enter Delhi, farm leaders said on Wednesday. “This will be a dress rehearsal for the tractor parade by farmers on Republic Day in the national capital,” said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India who is among the coordinators of the protest.Farmers, primarily from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 28, demanding repeal of the laws, and a legal guarantee on minimum support prices for their crops, among other issues.The farmers announced last week that if their demands were not met, they will march in their tractors at Rajpath on Republic Day, where India’s annual military parade and cultural programme is held on January 26.Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha, said hundreds of tractors will march on Thursday from Singhu and Tikri borders to the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal or Western Expressway. “Hundreds of tractors from both the protest points will leave around 11am and drive towards KMP Expressway. From there, we will return to our camps,” said Sandhu.Joginder Singh Nain, a farm leader from Haryana, said:“Women drivers will lead a part of the rally representing the Haryana contingent.” Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson, Rakesh Tikait said the tractor march will not enter Delhi, and culminate at the respective borders after travelling up to Dasna and Palwal. “It will be a peaceful tractor march. The farmers protesting at Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border will march towards Bulandshahr via Dasna on their tractors. The other groups of farmers coming from the different borders of Delhi will meet near Bulandshahr, where we will have ‘langar’. From there, the other group would move towards Palwal while we will return to UP Gate border by evening,” said Tikait.Unlike the other BKU groups, the farmers associated with BKU’s Bhanu group that has been protesting at the Chilla (Delhi-Noida link road) border will carry out a tractor march from Mahamaya flyover up to Chilla border.“Our tractor march will be of nearly two kilometres. We will stop at the Chilla border,” said BC Pradhan, spokesperson for BKU’s Bhanu group.Shalini Singh, joint commissioner of police (western range), said that since the march is not scheduled to enter Delhi, the police arrangement would remain like before. But traffic on the outskirts is likely to be affected.Police in Gautam Buddh Nagar said they will enforce diversions on the Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal or Eastern Peripheral Expressway. “In view of this, vehicles will not be allowed to get on the eastern peripheral expressway from Beel Akbarpur and Sirsa cut towards Palwal from 12pm to 3pm. Similarly, vehicles won’t be allowed on the expressway from Sirsa cut and Beel Akbarpur towards Sonipat from 2pm to 5pm and will be diverted,” police said in a statement.GB Nagar’s police commissioner Alok Singh on Wednesday inspected the situation along the expressway. Singh, along with additional CP (law and order) Love Kumar and DCP, Greater Noida, Rajesh Kumar Singh, visited the Beel Akbarpur toll, Sirsa toll and Palwal border area.National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials also said the tractor march will affect traffic on both eastern and western peripheral expressways. “Tractors are not allowed on EPE and there will be traffic disruption if they carry out a march. We will speak to the district officials about the issue. Already, the farmers have made two major tolls at Palwal and Sonipat free and it is affecting our revenue. It is estimated that the tolls fetch us about Rs 90 lakh per day, but we are collecting only about Rs 25 lakh per day since December 25,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said farmers from several Rajasthan districts will march on their tractors up to the Shahjahanpur protest site on Thursday. “A group of farmers from Maharashtra joined our agitation today. Tractors from other protest sites on the Delhi border will start their march in the morning, and we will have a huge cavalcade of farmers on the KMP stretch tomorrow,” said Madhav. Deepak Lamba, member of Jai Kisan Andalon which is a part of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, said that the march would start at 11am on Thursday and continue through the day. “One batch of tractors will start from Singhu border and one from Tikri border. They will converge at KMP before returning back to their respective protest sites. Other segments of tractors from Palwal, Ghazipur and Mewat will also come together on the KMP stretch,” said Lamba. Rampal Jat, president of the Kisan Mahapanchayat, which is protesting at the Haryana-Rajasthan border, said that around 100 tractors from Palwal will join the rally. “Tractors from different regions will join the march tomorrow. Due to rain, our tents at the border have been uprooted or flooded, but we will participate in the rally as much as possible. Around 100 tractors from here will join the march from Palwal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-to-march-on-highway-ring-around-delhi-in-tractors-to-press-their-demands/story-Qa3GF1mZVm6wGUD7Cq1q8L.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Govt Asha, anganwadi workers, teachers to help bust myths, dispel Covid vaccine hesitancy||With the national capital is set to roll out the Covid-19 immunisation drive, the key stakeholders -- including- Accredited Social Health Activists (Ashas), Anganwadi workers (AWWs), and government teachers -- have been given the crucial responsibility of building confidence among people and to address issues related to “vaccine hesitancy”.According to the Ashas, AWWs, and teachers, who have attended training sessions for the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Delhi, they have been asked to inform people, during the ongoing door-to-door survey, about the importance of the vaccine and also work on busting myths and misinformation about the vaccination, including the fear of side effects, that is prevalent among the general public. The Delhi government had last week identified 5.1 million people who will be the first to get the vaccine shots under the Central government’s “priority category”. The beneficiaries will receive messages via SMS and will be asked to report to the vaccination centres on a particular day and time.The survey work is still on in some districts with Ashas, AWWs, and teachers participating in it, along with other government officials. Usha Thakur, general secretary of Delhi Asha Workers’ Association (DAWA) who attended a Covid-19 vaccine training session in the south-west district on Monday, said Ashas have been asked to create awareness about the vaccination process in the community. “There are so many rumours about the vaccine on social media. We have to work on busting myths during our survey work. We have to make people understand the importance of vaccination...Besides, we have also been told to go door-to-door in our localities once we get vaccinated and share our first-hand experience with residents.”Thakur said Ashas were also asked to share the difficulties they have been witnessing during the survey work. “I was on field duty last week to update the age of residents in Indra Park in order to identify beneficiaries. A group of women, in their 50s, refused to disclose their age and said they do not want to be vaccinated. They even expressed apprehensions that they might die of the side effects from the vaccine dose. It took us an hour or so to dispel their fears and update their correct age in the records.”Recalling similar fears among the public about the polio vaccine, Chameli Devi, 48, an Asha, said there was so much resistance back then -- in the early 80s -- as well. “People used to say that their children would die if they took polio shots. They would shut doors on volunteers saying \they didn’t have children at home. We are hoping that people don’t behave like that this time around. Although people are responding to the survey, there is a lot of hesitation among them. We have been informing people to only rely on authentic information released by the government and to not trust any forwarded messages on social media or WhatsApp,” she said.Workers have also been asked to encourage people to get vaccinated. Kavita Kumari, an anganwadi worker in east Delhi, said, “We have been assigned to identify people (above 50 years of age) who are showing resistance or hesitancy to get vaccinated and to clear their doubts. We have to convince them that it’s like any other vaccine, say, the smallpox vaccine.”Officials said the Ashas, AWWs, and teachers have been selected for the “myth-busting” work because they have close ties in the community. Arun Mishra, district magistrate (east Delhi), said, “This is the best way to counter vaccine hesitancy among people. They regularly meet residents in their localities and people also listen to what they say. That’s why they were found most suitable for such an outreach programme.” Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said, “Vaccine hesitancy is well known. Many studies have proved that. It was not there till September. But after that, with the emergence of a new strain of the virus, vaccine hesitancy has increased among people. So, it’s important to bust the myths and misconceptions. Asha workers and anganwadi workers can be good to reach out to people. But, there will be a requirement of a broader communication strategy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-asha-anganwadi-workers-teachers-to-help-bust-myths-dispel-covid-vaccine-hesitancy/story-ekPZg1826GNUjqFMzqlRjJ.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||Court dismisses Delhi lawyer Pracha’s plea seeking video footage of office raid||A Delhi court has dismissed a plea by advocate Mehmood Pracha seeking copy of the video footage of the search conducted at his office on December 24, 2020, in connection with an alleged cheating and forgery case arising of the north-east Delhi riots, while stating that the plea is legally not maintainable.Pracha represents several people accused of perpetrating violence or conspiring to cause the riots that ravaged north-east Delhi in February. His clients include Bhim Sena chief Chandrashekhar Azad and Gulfisha Fatima.Additional sessions judge Dharmendra Rana rejected the plea by Pracha, who had challenged an earlier order of the duty magistrate who had refused to give the copy of the video footage but had instead preserved it. “Perusal of the section 165 (5) CrPC would reveal that IO is required to send the record forthwith to nearest magistrate and on application, the applicant is also entitled for a copy of the same. However the word “forthwith” classifies only the record sent to the magistrate and it is not the requirement of law that the record is also required to be ‘forthwith’ furnished to the applicant,” Rana said.Pracha, in his revision plea, had said the search of his office premises was a matter of grave concern for the legal fraternity, as the police had compromised the confidential and privileged information and data of hundreds of his clients.He had also alleged that the police had committed several illegal and criminal acts during the search, all of which will be clear when the video footage is perused. He said he fears the police will make every attempt to manipulate and tamper with the video footage so as to prevent their illegal and criminal acts from being exposed and which will also exonerate him.“Perusal of the impugned order of December 27, 2020, would reveal that the prayer of the revisionist for supply of video footage has neither been denied nor has been conclusively determined,” the court said in its order of January 5.On August 22, police registered an FIR against Pracha after one of the riot victims told a court that the lawyer has asked him to fake a deposition and frame three people in riot cases. Police had then told the court that they had filed a case against Pracha for giving false information to the court, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy. The Karkardooma court had passed a direction asking the police to look into the allegation.At the time itself, Pracha denied the police’s allegations and said that the case was meant to intimidate him. Pracha was also a prominent face of the protests against the citizenship amendment law .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/court-dismisses-delhi-lawyer-pracha-s-plea-seeking-video-footage-of-office-raid/story-AkKxWAODSWbsqQLDLJzDaP.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||Lok Nayak hospital OPDs reopened, rapid tests must for all patients||The Delhi government-run Lok Nayak hospital has reopened its outpatient clinics for non-Covid patients after nine months, with all those coming in being tested for the coronavirus disease using a rapid antigen kit before being allowed inside. The 2,000-bed hospital had been converted into a dedicated hospital for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in March last year. The hospital, which used to see around 9,000 patients a day in its outpatient clinic before the onset of the pandemic, was asked to re-start non-Covid services on half its beds at the beginning of the year. With the number of Covid-19 cases on the decline for over a month, the government had decided to de-escalate the number of beds earmarked for the treatment of those with the viral infection across 115 hospitals on December 31. The number of beds could go down by around 14,000 across hospitals, from over 18,700 beds the government had reserved when the city saw its third and worst wave of cases in November. With even the OPD building housing some of the non-ICU beds, the hospital took a few days to put in place protocols to ensure the Covid-19 and non-Covid patients remain in separate areas before the clinics were reopened on Monday. To maintain social distancing, the hospital has started with clinics of a select few departments, with attendance in each being restricted to 50 persons, as per doctors from the hospital. “However, we probably got around 20 patients on the first day. The number will go up in a week or two as more people come to know that the OPDs have opened. However, we are currently focussing only on the more stable patients, not those who are very sick,” said a senior doctor from the hospital on condition of anonymity. Admissions of non-Covid patients haven’t started yet, the doctor said. The hospital currently has a special ward for those who are suspected to have the mutant variant of the virus that was first discovered in the United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lok-nayak-hospital-opds-reopened-rapid-tests-must-for-all-patients/story-ubYKjA5NFLcTopaB3mRlZK.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||DTC board approves funds to procure and maintain 1,000 low-floor AC buses||The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) on Wednesday approved funds for the procurement of 1,000 low-floor air-conditioned CNG buses, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said. The buses are likely to start arriving over the next six months, senior transport officials said. The proposal was tabled and approved in the board meeting of the DTC, chaired by Gahlot, on Wednesday. The board also approved an increase in the ceiling of gratuity for DTC employees from the current Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh, the transport corporation conveyed in a statement.“We have approved funds for the procurement of 1,000 low-floor CNG buses and also for the comprehensive annual maintenance of these buses for their entire lifespan. This will help in reducing the downtime of buses and increase the overall user experience,” Gahlot said.The new low-floor CNG buses would be equipped with facilities such as real-time passenger information system, CCTV cameras, panic buttons, GPS and other features besides being differently abled friendly.Funds for the annual maintenance of buses up to 7.5 lakh kilometres per bus and covering 12 years’ comprehensive maintenance insurance, were also approved, the statement further said. The DTC had last inducted buses into its fleet in 2011, a year after the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Currently, it has a fleet of 3,762 buses. Apart from these, there are the cluster buses – operated by concessionaires – with a fleet size of 2,839. The cluster bus fleet has witnessed an increase over the past few years while the DTC fleet had remained stagnant, government records showed.In November 2019, the Supreme Court had observed that at least 11,000 buses are needed to cater to Delhi’s population of over 20 million.Last year, the DTC had floated a tender for the 1,000 buses which first failed and was put up again. Senior transport officials said after Wednesday’s approval of funds, the DTC will now issue a letter of interest (LOI) to the bus manufacturer which will then start the process of readying the new buses. Last month, the DTC also issued a tender to create a real-time passenger information system, which will enable commuters to access information on bus routes, estimated time of arrival, fare, location of nearest buses which a passenger wishes to board, availability of seats and best options for interchange -- all on their mobile phones.The tender document titled “engagement of vendor to design, develop, implement, operate and maintain real-time passenger information system for DTC buses” is broadly divided into three categories focusing on a mobile application for commuters, a separate mobile app for DTC staff, and an interface to help crunch passenger usage statistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dtc-board-approves-funds-to-procure-and-maintain-1-000-low-floor-ac-buses/story-soXoiZnqyJdyiyJKN3g6EJ.html

In a statement issued on Wednesday, the commission said that in the earlier quarter, between July and September 2020, it had disposed of 432 cases. “In the last quarter, out of a total of 890 cases, a substantial number of 533 complaints related to missing children where Commission is the monitoring authority, 195 complaints related to the right to education and 125 complaints related to health & nutrition of children were resolved. Through grievance resolution, the DCPCR has been making crucial interventions such as in a case, a child who was being denied admission in Class XI on the basis of certain discriminatory admission rules and had suffered mental agony running from pillar to post, was able to obtain admission with the assistance of DCPCR, despite the rules being contrary,” the statement stated.“In a critical case, where a child was found COVID positive in Udayan Care Child Care Institution and all other children, who were needed to be tested could not be taken outside due to risk of exposure, DCPCR intervened to arrange COVID testing of all 24 children within the Children’s Home,” the statement added.DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu said, “It is not the existence of grievances with the government that separates a good democracy from a poor one but how the government chooses to respond to it. The Commission will continue to promote the cause of the children, be their relentless advocate, and amplify their voices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dcpcr-disposes-of-890-cases-in-the-last-quarter/story-qt41nAefSWDQ7KoneIoDBL.html
07-01-2021||Delhi||HC notice to Delhi govt, IHBAS over extension of director’s tenure||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the response of the Delhi government and the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS) on a plea challenging the extension of tenure granted to IHBAS director NG Desai after he attained the age of 65 years.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued a notice to the Delhi government and IHBAS, seeking their stand on the petition by a former employee of the institute.“It is unfortunate that individual or small vested interest gets masqueraded as public interest which is evident from the petitioner’s allegations. With full respect to the judicial process and the integrity of the administrative system, I would not like to say much except the fact that the claims in the plea are distorted and conveniently interpreted. All respondents, Including myself will clearly reply to the court as sought,” Nimesh G Desai, Director, IHBAS said.The petitioner, Tej Bahadur Singh, has said the present director of the institute was appointed to the post in 2016 for five years, or up to the age of 65 years, whichever came first. According to Singh, Desai turned 65 in October 2020 and, thus, he cannot continue as director without the lieutenant governor approving the extension of tenure.Singh claimed that when he had attained the age of 62 in 2012, and had sought an extension from IHBAS, he was told that no person can be permitted to remain in service beyond the superannuation age as fixed under the rules.Therefore, a different yardstick cannot be applied in case of the present director, he contended. The plea has sought the quashing of all decisions, including the appointment of joint director (administration), taken by Desai after he turned 65.The plea also sought an interim direction prohibiting Desai from taking any administrative decisions during pendency of the petition. However, the bench refused to pass any such order.It has further sought directions to the Delhi government to hand over post of director of IHBAS to the head of a government hospital till a new director is appointed.Appearing for IHBAS, advocate Tushar Sannu told the court that the petitioner was a former employee and, therefore, had a personal interest in the matter.The matter would be now heard on January 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-notice-to-delhi-govt-ihbas-over-extension-of-director-s-tenure/story-cdmqqB74sXDLeENHFvFZoM.html

The BMC plans to finalise the contractor by March-end for the ₹6-crore project. Thereafter, the contractor will be given 15 months, excluding monsoon, to complete the construction.According to civic officials, BMC has floated bids to appoint a contractor for the reconstruction of the Himalaya foot overbridge (FoB) that had collapsed in March 2019, killing seven. “We are going to finalise the contractor and issue a work order by March-end. The work will start from April 2021 but will be impacted for eight months during the monsoon of 2021 and 2022. Due to this, the bridge will only be ready by 2022-end,” said an official from the bridges department.“We have made changes in the design based on suggestions and recommendations from the heritage department. Traffic during the construction period will not be majorly affected for pedestrians or vehicles,” the official added. According to BMC officials, the busy Dr Dadabhai Naoroji (DN) Road, on which the Himalaya Bridge will be reconstructed, will not remain shut for traffic or vehicular movement. “There might be minor diversions but no closure of the road,” the official said.However, during the launch of the bridge, DN Road may be shut for a week. The bridge construction is expected to be done using stainless steel that will be supported by pier. As per BMC’s draft design, there will be three entry and exit points for the bridge, of which two will be on DN Road and one on the service road that leads to St Xavier’s College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/csmt-bridge-in-mumbai-likely-to-be-ready-by-2022-end/story-vFjpsswxrfVAeai2gmAmWL.html
07-01-2021||Mumbai||No FYJC seat yet for 10K Mumbai Metropolitan Region students||More than 10,000 students in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) did not get a seat even in the second special merit list for first year junior college (FYJC) admissions declared on Tuesday evening. A total of 32,368 students had applied in the round, of which 21,835 students secured a seat. Of the students who got a seat, only half (10,058) got their first preference. This is even as more than 1.38 lakh seats in the MMR (including general and quota seats) were vacant after admissions in the first special round concluded on December 31. Several prominent colleges in the city did not declare the second special list as all seats were full after the first four admission rounds. For instance, in the arts stream, prominent colleges such as St Xavier’s College in Dhobi Talao, Ruparel and Ruia College in Matunga and Mithibai college in Vile Parle had no list. For science, some prominent colleges like Mithibai, Ruparel and St Xavier’s saw a marginal increase in the cut-offs compared to the first special round. Principals said while a large number of students have managed to secure a seat by now, many who are still uncertain might still be left out. “There might be some with lower percentages who might want to try till the end and have thus not secured a seat. Sometimes, students also opt for colleges whose cut-offs are way higher than their score. Also, with the results for the Class 10 supplementary exams being declared recently, some students who passed the exam might have also applied,” said a principal of a suburban college. Students who have been allotted seats under the second special round can secure their admission by January 8. This year, there will be no first-come, first-served (FCFS) rounds for admissions this year. FCFS rounds usually follow regular admission rounds wherein students can claim seats against vacancies across colleges in a particular city or district and are allotted seats on the basis of who claims them first. These rounds were introduced in the academic year 2018-19, but were criticised by many parents and experts as they allowed students with lower scores to get into top colleges against vacant seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-fyjc-seat-yet-for-10k-mumbai-metropolitan-region-students/story-a402QRAUARY1WYiqmaeMjN.html

On Monday some of them seized the South Korean-flagged Hankuk Chemi for alleged violations of environmental laws, something its operator has denied.South Korea has already sent its own warship, the ROKS Choi Young, toward waters near the strait, and a diplomatic delegation left for Iran early on Thursday to negotiate the tanker’s release, Yonhap news agency reported.Iran has used its influence over the Persian Gulf to push back against US-led attempts to isolate it economically. A government spokesman this week linked the seizure of the tanker to billions of dollars trapped in South Korea by US sanctions.Thursday’s parade was part of commemoration events for the one-year anniversary of the killing of IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani by the US, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-holds-navy-drills-in-persian-gulf-amid-standoff-over-tanker/story-ap5iadCDqGaO8ODCwNob9L.html

The judge said Tuesday the filing is deficient because it does not include a “certified copy of prisoner’s trust fund statement” and a $402 filing fee.An email seeking comment was left Thursday with the federal Bureau of Prisons.Tsarnaev alleges his cap and bandana were confiscated by prison guards “because, by wearing it, I was ‘disrespecting’ the FBI and the victims” of the April 15, 2013, bombing.During the investigation, Tsarnaev was referred to by law enforcement as “White Hat” when he was seen on surveillance video leaving the scene of the bombings.Three people died and more than 260 people were injured at the scene when two pressure cooker bombs were set off near the marathon’s finish line.Tsarnaev’s older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police three days later.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted and sentenced to death, but the death sentence was overturned last July by a federal appeals court that said the judge who oversaw the case did not adequately screen jurors for potential biases. That decision has been appealed to the US Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boston-marathon-bomber-sues-federal-govt-over-treatment-at-prison/story-2jXOM8Whqfi09etuJ0mvtK.html

Monaco spent almost two decades at the Justice Department and was homeland security adviser in the Obama administration. Gupta headed the department’s Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama.Biden praised the nominees as “among the most accomplished legal minds in our country.”“They will restore the independence of the Department so it serves the interests of the people not a presidency, rebuild public trust in the rule of law, and work tirelessly to ensure a more fair and equitable justice system,” he said.Biden will introduce the nominees at an event later Thursday.Garland, 68, is a veteran of the legal community and Justice Department.He first served in the department as a special assistant in President Jimmy Carter’s administration before going into private practice. He returned to the department for a brief stint in 1989 as an assistant US attorney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-us-capitol-violence-biden-vows-to-restore-rule-of-law/story-XoOc3fb8P9e0pDps1J6AZK.html
07-01-2021||World||Britain working with Pfizer, AstraZeneca to increase vaccine supplies||The pace of Britain’s rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is being limited by the supply of shots, and the government is working with both Pfizer and AstraZeneca to increase supplies, health minister Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The government must quickly ramp up the rate of vaccinations in order to meet an ambitious target to inoculate more than 13 million people who are elderly, vulnerable or frontline workers by mid-February. “The rate limiting step is the supply of vaccine, and we’re working with the companies, both Pfizer and of course AstraZeneca, to increase the supply,” Hancock told broadcasters.“The manufacturers are doing a brilliant job, and they’re delivering to the schedule that’s agreed, but that schedule is the amount of vaccine that we have ... we expect to see that amount of vaccine being delivered going up.” Hancock spoke after the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University was rolled out in doctors surgeries from Thursday.More than 1.3 million people in the United Kingdom have received one shot of either AstraZeneca’s or Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, but the government needs to be administering around 2 million doses a week to hit its February target.In a sign of supply constraints, one doctor visited by Hancock on Thursday said she had not received the delivery of AstraZeneca’s vaccine she had been expecting. Birmingham City Council’s leader and local lawmakers also wrote to Hancock saying no AstraZeneca vaccine was available in the central English city and that stocks of the Pfizer shot would run out on Friday.Britain is prioritising the administration of an initial shot to more people, delaying second doses beyond a month after the first. Just 20,000 people received their second shot of the Pfizer vaccine before the guidance was changed. Pfizer has said there is no data for the efficacy of the first shot beyond 21 days.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that if the vaccine rollout goes to plan, new lockdown measures introduced this week could start to be eased in February. Johnson, who will give a news conference later on Thursday, has previously cited the time it takes for the regulator to approve batches of AstraZeneca’s vaccine as one limiting factor.AstraZeneca’s vaccine was first deployed in hospitals on Monday. It does not have the ultra-low temperature requirements that Pfizer’s does, making it easier to roll out. Initial boxes of the Pfizer vaccine contained nearly 1,000 doses, but the NHS said smaller boxes had also been approved for use that could be used in settings like care homes without wasting doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-working-with-pfizer-astrazeneca-to-increase-vaccine-supplies/story-GrvW4JYqTh6SedyytvYWBK.html
07-01-2021||World||US human rights lawyer arrested in Hong Kong granted bail||An American human rights lawyer who was detained in Hong Kong with scores of democracy activists and supporters as part of a sweeping crackdown was granted bail, his associate said Thursday.John Clancey, who works at law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners, was one of 53 people arrested Wednesday under the national security law over their participation in an unofficial primary election last year that authorities say was part of a plan to paralyze the government and subvert state power.The mass arrests were the largest move against Hong Kong’s democracy movement since Beijing imposed the law last June to quell dissent in the semi-autonomous territory following months of anti-government protests in 2019.The primaries were held by the pro-democracy camp to determine the best candidates to field as they sought to gain a majority in Hong Kong’s legislature.While most of those arrested were candidates in the primaries, Clancey was a treasurer for political organization Power for Democracy, which was involved in the event.The legislative election that would have followed the unofficial primaries was postponed by a year by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who cited public health risks during the coronavirus pandemic.The remaining activists will be granted bail without charge, although most had their passports confiscated as evidence, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, which cited unnamed sources.The security law criminalizes acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers to intervene in the city’s affairs. Serious offenders could face up a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.Authorities pointed to a plan called “10 steps to mutual destruction” allegedly indicating that the primaries were part of a broader push to cause damage to both Hong Kong and mainland China.That plan was published as an opinion piece in Apple Daily newspaper by former law professor and pro-democracy activist Benny Tai, who was also arrested on Wednesday. He said that between 2020 and 2022, there would be 10 steps to “mutual destruction,” including the pro-democracy bloc winning a majority in the legislature, intensifying protests, the forced resignation of Lam due to the budget bill being rejected twice, and international sanctions against the ruling Chinese Communist Party.The arrests drew condemnation from the UN, the US, and Europe.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called them an outrage and said the US would explore further sanctions and restrictions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials and entities.“I am also appalled by the news of the arrest of an American citizen as part of this campaign of political repression,” he said, adding the United States would not tolerate the arbitrary detention or harassment of its citizens.Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, said the arrests indicate that “the offence of subversion under the National Security Law is indeed being used to detain individuals for exercising legitimate rights to participate in political and public life.”Kurt Tong, the former U.S. consul general in Hong Kong, saw the arrests as part of a methodical and escalating campaign to eradicate viable opposition politics both among the protesters and elected parties.“The national security law provides the legal foundation to do that,” said Tong, now a partner at The Asia Group consultancy in Washington, D.C.China wants to preserve Hong Kong’s economic vibrancy and free market without what it views as political complications, he said. He didn’t predict a mass exodus by companies, saying the city retains its residual energy and dynamism, but warned there could be a measurable impact over time.“China’s taking a big gamble by picking away at parts of the Hong Kong system that it doesn’t like,” he said. “It really risks damaging parts that it values.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-human-rights-lawyer-arrested-in-hong-kong-granted-bail/story-8xavie0kcO8W2vHzCx5muJ.html
07-01-2021||World||US weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fall||The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly dipped last week while staying extremely high, with the labor market recovery appearing to stall as a raging Covid-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm the country.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 787,000 for the week ended Jan. 2, compared to 790,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 800,000 applications in the latest week.Elevated claims are in line with other data that have suggested the economy was taking a beating from business restrictions and retrenchment in consumer spending because of the pandemic. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Dec. 15-16 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers expected soaring coronavirus cases “would be particularly challenging for the labor market in coming months.” Covid-19 cases in the United States have jumped to more than 21 million, with the death toll exceeding 352,000 since the virus first emerged in China in late 2019, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A report on Wednesday showed private companies shed workers in December for the first time in eight months. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed a steep decline in the number of employees working in December compared to November. The reports raised the risk that the economy lost jobs in December, though a survey this week showed factory employment rebounding last month. The government is scheduled to publish its closely followed employment report for December on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 71,000 jobs after rising by 245,000 in November. That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and mean the economy recouped about 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.Jobless claims are above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March. The government in late December approved nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus, including the renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14.Economists expect the unemployment subsidy will push up first-time jobless claims after uncertainty whether it would be renewed contributed to a drop in applications in recent weeks.Government-funded programs for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their benefits were also extended in the latest pandemic relief package. More fiscal stimulus is likely. Democrats on Wednesday completed a sweep of the two Senate seats up for grabs in runoff elections in Georgia, giving the party control of the chamber and boosting the prospects for President-elect Joe Biden’s legislative agenda.Congress on Thursday formally certified Biden’s election victory hours after hundreds of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.The economy plunged into recession in February. Though it is expected to have expanded at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the bulk of the rise in gross domestic product will likely come from the rebuilding of inventories after they were depleted early in the pandemic. The economy grew at a historic 33.4% pace in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-weekly-jobless-claims-unexpectedly-fall/story-enn66NwlzARTEqvnFF5LbI.html

A shortage of vets to issue the forms is causing delays, Buchan said.Buchan said Transports Mesguen, a French trucking company that moves fish, had intended to send four trucks for export Tuesday, but had only managed to send two due to the customs hold-ups.“We’ve been ill-prepared,” Buchan said. “The government hasn’t listened to the warnings the industry has continually been giving.”Britain’s free-trade deal with the EU saw it negotiate a 25% increase in the catch for UK’s boats in British waters over the next five years, followed by annual negotiations. However, being outside the EU’s single market and customs union, fishermen face poorer market access, and must follow rules such as sending their fish through designated border control posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scottish-fishermen-hit-by-brexit-delays-shortage-of-vets/story-MdGsotFBQZH0qr9epOijDI.html
07-01-2021||World||Trump’s comments directly led to violence, says UK’s Priti Patel||British Home Secretary Priti Patel on Thursday condemned the “awful” scenes of riots on the Capitol Hill in Washington DC and blamed US President Donald Trump for the violence that resulted in four deaths in clashes between protesters and American police.The senior Cabinet minister told the BBC that it was the outgoing President’s words that fuelled the violence and accused Trump of doing nothing “de-escalate that”.“His comments directly led to the violence, and so far he has failed to condemn that violence and that is completely wrong,” said Patel.“He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn’t actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever... what we’ve seen is completely unacceptable,” she said.Hundreds of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday – where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Biden’s election victory – and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC after he made several claims of electoral fraud. Both chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released.On Thursday, a White House spokesperson issued a Twitter statement to say there will be an “orderly transition” to Democrat President-elect Joe Biden, whose November 2020 election victory has since been by US lawmakers.“Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a Twitter statement.UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there was “no justification for these violent attempts to frustrate the lawful and proper transition of power”.The condemnation of the scenes in the US capital was cross-party in the UK, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer saying it was a “direct attack on democracy”, while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the events “utterly horrifying”.A Friend of President Trump and leader of the Brexit Party which has now transformed to Reform UK, Nigel Farage, also tweeted: “Storming Capitol Hill is wrong. The protesters must leave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-comments-directly-led-to-violence-says-uk-s-priti-patel/story-nOXbqg38FAwx0YWVWDA4sI.html

The UAE is also conducting Phase III trials of a vaccine developed by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm). The UAE has approved the vaccine and it is available for free to anybody who wants it, with priority given to more vulnerable individuals, according to the health ministry. Last month, the emirate of Dubai only began inoculating people with the vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTec.Authorities in the UAE, which has a population around 9 million, say 826,301 vaccines had been administered as of Tuesday, without specifying which type. They added the UAE aimed to vaccine more than 50% of the population in the first quarter of this year. In October, Sinopharm’s local partner, G42, said it intended to start manufacturing the vaccine in 2021. A G42 representative told Reuters on Wednesday plans for manufacturing in the UAE were at an advanced stage and more details would be made available soon. The UAE has seen the number of new daily cases more than double in the past ten days. On Wednesday, the health ministry reported 2,067 new infections, a daily record. The UAE does not disclose where in the country infections or deaths take place and has not recently announced new measures to prevent its spread.In total, the Gulf Arab state has recorded 218,766 infections and 689 deaths from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-starts-trials-of-russia-s-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-as-cases-rise/story-7QVIelUqQgwaAEk2H02iTN.html
07-01-2021||World||Nearly 20k second doses of Pfizer vaccine given in England before rule change||Nearly 20,000 second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech were given to people in England before guidelines were changed to prioritise giving out first doses, the National Health Service said on Thursday.The figures showed that 19,981 second vaccinations were given between the Dec. 29 and Jan. 3, out of 1.1 million total administered in England. Across the whole of the United Kingdom, 1.3 million doses have been deployed.The day after second vaccinations began, health officials said they would prioritise giving as many people as possible a first shot of a Covid-19 vaccine to offer some protection over the rollout of booster shots.That means second shots will now be given up to 12 weeks after people receive their first shots, prompting criticism from some scientists, and frustration from people who have seen appointments cancelled.While AstraZeneca’s shot was tested with different intervals between doses, Pfizer has said there is no data to demonstrate the efficacy of its first dose after 21 days.On Tuesday, England’s Chief Medical Officer said that the balance of risk supported the move, adding protection from a single dose would likely be more than 50% even if it did pose a small risk of an “escape mutant” of the coronavirus.Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes that by giving at least some protection to more than 13 million people in priority groups over the next six weeks, it will be possible to consider easing strict lockdown measures from mid-February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-20k-second-doses-of-pfizer-vaccine-given-in-england-before-rule-change/story-XAuGjlNuGKRNOwCaopIrjN.html

07-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Negative coronavirus test required for air travel to Canada||As the winter surge of the pandemic continues in Canada, the government has made it mandatory for all Canada-bound international travellers to produce a negative Covid-19 test result before being allowed to board a flight to a Canadian destination.Air travel remains restricted to the country as the ban on entry of foreign nationals, first announced in March last year during the initial outbreak of Covid-19, remains in force. However, multiple flights continue to bring passengers into the country, including several each week from India, as part of an air bubble arrangement. Passengers booked on the incoming Vande Bharat Mission flights operated by Air India with a reciprocal arrangement with Air Canada, will be impacted by the new measures that went into force on Thursday.The government will only accept results from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) or transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification or RT-LAMP tests, which will have to be taken within 72 hours before the departure of the Canada-bound flight.The new measures have also resulted from a public backlash against several politicians who went abroad during the Christmas break in December, leading to the resignation of Indo-Canadian MP Kamal Khera from her post of parliamentary secretary to the minister of international development in PM Justin Trudeau’s government, among several others including the finance minister of the province of Ontario.Trudeau has criticised those who had chosen to vacation abroad while the second wave of Covid-19 has seized the country. The total number of confirmed cases in Canada stood at 626,317, a daily increase of over 8,000 new infections, surpassing the numbers witnessed in the spring. The number of fatalities has reached 16,369.More restrictions are coming into place in several Canadian jurisdictions. The hardest hit, the province of Quebec, has announced the first ever curfew in the country, lasting from 8pm to 5am for a month beginning on January 9.Similar negative tests are already required by other countries, including India, but such a step hadn’t been implemented earlier. Explaining the reason for the move, Canada’s transport minister Marc Garneau said during the course of a media interaction, “The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. We need to continue to be vigilant, and we need to continue to take action to reduce the risks of spreading the virus by air travel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-negative-coronavirus-test-required-for-air-travel-to-canada/story-6fY86ip0C7uKtgBfjViOwJ.html
07-01-2021||World||US Capitol violence: Deputy NSA and top China adviser Matt Pottinger resigns||White House deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger has resigned, joining a number of officials who are leaving the administration of President Donald Trump following the storming of Capitol Hill by his supporters.Pottinger, a leading figure in the development of Trump’s China policy, resigned on Wednesday in response to Trump’s reaction to a mob of protesters who breached the U.S. Capitol, a senior administration official told Reuters. Bloomberg first reported the resignation.Pottinger’s boss, national security adviser Robert O’Brien, has no plans to quit, the official said.“A strong national security team remains in place at the State Department, the Department of Defense, Treasury, the intelligence community and the National Security Council.”The official said the team has been making sure there are no foreign threats to the United States prior to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. The team has been coordinating with the Biden transition team for several weeks.The White House had no immediate comment. O’Brien had asked Pottinger to stay on past election day to facilitate the transition to Biden’s new team, the official said.“Pottinger completed those tasks,” the person said.An administration official described Trump as “increasingly isolated” and said that “national security officials who are loyal to their oath to the constitution will be standing watch until Inauguration Day and will then turn over power to the duly elected new president.”Four people died during the chaos - one from gunshot wounds and three from medical emergencies - after hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to overturn his election defeat to Democrat Biden.In a video posted to Twitter while the rioters roamed the Capitol, Trump called the protesters “special” and repeated his false claims about election fraud, although he urged protesters to leave.The melee delayed the certification process of Biden’s victory for hours.Two top aides to first lady Melania Trump also resigned on Wednesday. Stephanie Grisham resigned as chief of staff to the first lady.“It has been an honor to serve the country in the White House. I am very proud to have been a part of Mrs. Trump’s mission to help children everywhere, and proud of the many accomplishments of this administration,” Grisham said in a statement.Grisham, who spent a year as White House press secretary before becoming chief of staff to the first lady, did not say whether her resignation was in reaction to the violence, but a source familiar with her decision said it was the last straw.The White House social secretary, Rickie Niceta, also resigned, as did a deputy White House press secretary Sarah Matthews, two sources told Reuters.There was also talk inside the White House that deputy chief of staff Chris Liddell might resign, a source said.Pottinger, a former Reuters and Wall Street Journal reporter who left journalism to join the US Marines after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, had served in the White House since the beginning of Trump’s presidency in 2017.The departure of the fluent Mandarin speaker comes at a time of high tension with Beijing.Trump’s administration has pursued hardline policies towards China on issues ranging from trade to espionage and the coronavirus and relations plummeted to their worst level in decades when the president ramped up rhetoric in his unsuccessful re-election campaign.Early on Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was considering sanctions and other restrictions on those involved in the arrest of over 50 people, including American lawyer John Clancey, in a new Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong hours before Wednesday’s events in Washington.Pompeo warned that Washington could target Hong Kong’s economic and trade office in the United States, and in a move likely to further rile Beijing, announced that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft would visit Chinese-claimed Taiwan - which is not a U.N. member due to China’s objections.U.S. lawmakers called the action by Trump’s supporters an embarrassment to American democracy that would play into the hands of rivals like China.“I think they’re high-fiving in Beijing,” Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a China hawk, told Tucker Carlson on the Fox News channel. “It kind of bolsters their claim that we’re falling apart and they’re the country of the future.”On Wednesday, China’s Washington embassy issued an advisory warning Chinese citizens to strengthen safety precautions in light of the “large-scale demonstration” in the U.S. capital and a curfew announced by the local government.

07-01-2021||World||Justin Trudeau slams US Capitol chaos, calls it ‘an attack on democracy’||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has described the violence unleashed by supporters of outgoing US President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday as “an attack on democracy”.As the events in Washington, DC unfolded, Trudeau tweeted, “Canadians are deeply disturbed and saddened by the attack on democracy in the United States, our closest ally and neighbour. Violence will never succeed in overruling the will of the people. Democracy in the US must be upheld - and it will be.”His views were echoed by Canada’s foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, who tweeted, “Canada is deeply shocked by the situation in Washington, DC. The peaceful transition of power is fundamental to democracy - it must continue and it will. We are following developments closely and our thoughts are with the American people.”The statements from Canadian leaders came even as small pro-Trump protests also took place in several cities in the country. A convoy of vehicles driven by those describing themselves as “Canadians for President Trump” drove past the US consulate in Toronto. About a dozen vehicles participated, according to Global News, and they carried “Stop the Steal” flags, reflecting the accusations by Trump that the 2020 election had been lost due to electoral manipulation by supporters of his Democratic Party rival, Joe Biden.A small demonstration was also staged outside the US consulate in Vancouver, while a rally took place outside the City Hall in Calgary in the province of Alberta.However, police in these cities did not report any incidents of violence during the course of the protests.In a separate statement issued by his office, Trudeau said his government was “concerned” over the developments in Washington, DC and was “following the situation minute by minute as it unfolds”.“We certainly hope things will calm down, but we’re going to keep watching carefully,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-slams-us-capitol-chaos-calls-it-an-attack-on-democracy/story-okroV8JJzjrqBT5AcvY2nK.html

This compared with 20 cases reported in the province, which surrounds Beijing, a day earlier.Authorities in Shijiazhuang, home to 11 million people, have launched mass testing drives and banned gatherings to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. In addition to barring people from leaving the city, people and vehicles from areas of the city considered high-risk were not allowed to leave their district, authorities said.Hebei entered a “wartime mode” on Tuesday, meaning investigation teams would be set up at provincial, city and district levels to trace the close contacts of those who have tested positive.Chinese state television earlier reported that Shijiazhuang had banned passengers from entering its main railway station. The city had previously required travellers to present a negative nucleic acid COVID-19 test result taken within 72 hours before boarding a train or a plane in the province.Total new COVID-19 cases for all of mainland China stood at 63, compared with 32 reported a day earlier, marking the biggest rise in daily cases since 127 cases were reported on July 30. The number of asymptomatic carriers, who have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease but have yet to develop any symptoms, also rose, to 79 from 64 a day earlier. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China since the outbreak first started in the city of Wuhan in late 2019 now stands at 87,278, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. In the city of Dalian in Liaoning province in China’s northeast, which has reported local infections in recent days, residents in medium or high-risk areas have been barred from leaving the city. Residents in other areas were told to refrain from unnecessary trips out of Dalian. Authorities in Guangdong province in southern China late on Wednesday reported a patient infected with a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus discovered in South Africa.Some scientists worry that COVID-19 vaccines currently being rolled out may not be able to protect against this variant because of certain mutations that have been observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-china-locks-down-city-11-million-barred-from-leaving-hebei/story-hNk3f79Lfrx2paamJWpesN.html

Qassim Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the court’s media office said. They were killed outside the capital’s airport last January.Al-Muhandis was the deputy leader of the state-sanctioned Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group composed of an array of militias, including Iran-backed groups, formed to fight the Islamic State group.Soleimani headed the expeditionary Quds force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps.The arrest warrant was for a charge of premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty on conviction. It is unlikely to be carried out but symbolic in the waning days of Trump’s presidency.The decision to issue the warrant “was made after the judge recorded the statements of the claimants from the family of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis,” according to a statement from the Supreme Judicial Council. The investigation into the killings is ongoing, the court said.The killings sparked a diplomatic crisis and strained US-Iraq ties, drawing the ire of Shiite political lawmakers who passed a non-binding resolution to pressure the government to oust foreign troops from the country.Iran-backed groups have since stepped up attacks against the American presence in Iraq, leading to threats by Washington to shutter its Baghdad diplomatic mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/soleimani-death-iraq-court-issues-arrest-warrant-against-donald-trump/story-z4hbG3QPDRayDPeduhLM3O.html

He is facing extradition to India on charges of major financial offences linked to a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB).At the last hearing on November 3, citing the December 2018 judgment in the extradition case of businessman Vijay Mallya, the court had rejected objections by Modi’s defence team on admitting evidence submitted by the Indian government.District judge Samuel Goozee said he was bound by the Mallya judgment delivered by chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot, adding that he would adopt the “approach taken in Mallya”.Statements of several witnesses to Modi’s alleged fraud are part of India’s documentation in the case, including individuals who alleged that they were threatened at the behest of Modi.Modi is the subject of two extradition requests - one lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Charges against Modi involve PNB’s Mumbai branch that extended his companies’ loans worth over Rs 11,300 crore. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs or loan agreements). The ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case, relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (“criminal intimidation to cause death”).The magistrates’ court had cleared Mallya’s extradition in December 2018. His appeals in the high court were also turned down, but the extradition currently awaits resolution of a legal process, widely believed to be an application for asylum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-s-extradition-case-closing-arguments-in-court-starting-today/story-yL82WXTXygUwcIZXkJ6ECK.html

And if it is needed, of course, then it will be used,” he said, referring to a field hospital that was set up at the start of the pandemic.England began a new national lockdown on Tuesday, with schools closed and citizens under orders to stay at home, as the government sought to contain a surge in infections, partly driven by a highly contagious new coronavirus variant.On Wednesday, the daily number of deaths from Covid-19 across the United Kingdom surpassed 1,000 for the first time since April. The country’s total Covid-19 death toll since the start of the pandemic is over 77,300, the highest in Europe.London and the southeast of England have been the areas worst-hit by the new variant.The Nightingale hospital, based at the ExCel conference centre in east London, was originally set up for Covid-19 critical care, but only 51 patients were treated there before it was mothballed in May.The British Medical Journal reported that it was being repurposed to take non-Covid patients recovering from operations and procedures, in order to relieve the unprecedented demand for beds elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-london-field-hospital-to-reopen-as-shortage-of-critical-beds-looms/story-84g6Q7Ha3zIfPn8yko48BJ.html

US damages totaled at least $95 billion, with $67 billion of that in insured losses, said Munich.The disasters piled up as the world came within 0.01 Celsius of tying the warmest year on record set in 2016, Munich said. While it didn’t draw direct link between 2020’s disasters and climate change, the insurer said the ongoing issues caused by a warming world would raise the potential for more perilous years ahead.“Even if the weather disasters for one year cannot be directly linked to climate change, and a longer period needs to be studied to assess their significance, these extreme values fit with the expected consequences of a decades-long warming trend for the atmosphere and oceans that is influencing risks,” said Ernst Rauch, chief climate and geoscientist at Munich Re.The year’s single worst disaster was flooding across China during its monsoon that amounted to $17 billion, of which only about 2% was insured, Munich said. Globally, 60% of 2020’s losses weren’t insured. The growing Asian economies saw the least number of insured losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-warmest-year-on-record-cost-the-world-210-billion/story-ZZ8rtz7fOOpFdZGfGD7zOK.html
07-01-2021||World||Mike Pence hits breaking point with Trump in blessing Joe Biden’s Win||Donald Trump’s relationship with his most loyal lieutenant, Mike Pence, splintered on Wednesday after the vice president defied the president’s call to overturn his loss in the November election.Trump attacked Pence on Twitter after the vice president announced he lacked the power to throw out Electoral College votes cast for President-elect Joe Biden. Pence, the president tweeted, “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done.”Desperate to cling to power, Trump turned what is normally a drama-free joint session of Congress to ratify the election results into a loyalty test for Pence. The gambit had catastrophic results, not just for the relationship between the president and vice president but also for the peaceful transition of power.Pro-Trump protesters violently stormed the US Capitol after Trump exhorted them to march to the building to support Republican lawmakers who planned to challenge Electoral College votes in some states. Pence found himself caught up in the chaos and had to evacuate from the Senate chamber after presiding over the joint session.Though Pence’s defiance of Trump’s demands he reject Electoral College votes was rooted in the Constitution, which gives the vice president no such power, it was still by far the vice president’s most serious break with his boss. Pence has been unfailingly loyal to Trump, never publicly criticizing the president or disagreeing with any policy.When the Senate reconvened hours later on Wednesday night, Pence condemned the Trump supporters who committed acts of violence yet did not mention the president by name. He vowed that protesters who breached the Capitol would be prosecuted, separating himself slightly from Trump, who has not suggested they did anything wrong.“To those who wreaked havoc in our capitol today, you did not win,” the vice president said. “Violence never wins. Freedom wins. And this is still the people’s House.”Wednesday’s events mark a devastating conclusion to their relationship, and the fallout may have implications for Pence’s political future, which included a possible presidential run of his own in 2024.Trump LoyalistsPence’s conclusion that the Constitution gave him no power to interfere with the count of Electoral College votes triggered criticism of the vice president in Trump’s inner circle, according to people familiar with the matter. Some of Trump’s allies believe Pence doomed his 2024 presidential aspirations by bucking Trump’s demands, and that the president’s loyalists will no longer be supportive of any of Pence’s future political endeavors, one of the people said.If so, Pence’s four years of unstintingly loyal service to the president would go unrewarded.He took on Herculean tasks, like overseeing the White House’s coronavirus response, and was exceedingly deferential to Trump when they appeared together in public. The approach allowed Pence to remain in Trump’s good graces without echoing his most outlandish claims.Tying himself so tightly to Trump could have allowed Pence to appeal to the president’s supporters if he decided to seek the Oval Office. But the blowback from the president over Wednesday’s events may spoil those plans.Signs of a split between Pence and Trump’s hardcore base began to emerge shortly after the election. Pence sought to focus on the coronavirus task force and the Senate runoff election in Georgia, rather than the Trump campaign’s election challenges.In public, the vice president raised concerns about the election and said every legal vote should be counted, but didn’t repeat Trump’s baseless claims the November contest was stolen.But Pence’s role in presiding over Congress’s Electoral College certification, which was completed early Thursday morning, proved to be too big of a challenge for his relationship with Trump to survive unscathed.Trump’s repeated insistence that he won re-election forced Pence into a bind between upholding the Constitution he swore to protect and supporting the president to whom he has shown devotion.Ministerial RoleAs president of the Senate, the vice president’s job is largely ministerial during the Electoral College ratification. Yet Trump for days argued that Pence had the power to refuse to certify electoral votes and send the matter back to states to decide.“If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency,” Trump tweeted on the eve of the vote.After consultations with his legal team and the Senate parliamentarian, Pence ultimately decided he could not do Trump’s bidding.“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence said in a letter to Congress released before the joint session.While Pence said it was within his power to allow lawmakers to challenge the results, the Constitution’s separation of powers prevented one single official from determining an election’s outcome.“Vesting the vice president with unilateral authority to decide presidential contests would be entirely antithetical to that design,” Pence said.In some ways, Trump’s decision to turn on his vice president shows how isolated the president has become in his final days in power. Republican leaders in Congress and some right-leaning news outlets have come to shun Trump’s insistence he won and have urged him to accept defeat. When Trump looked to Pence for his last stand, he was once again denied.During a fiery speech to supporters outside the White House before the joint session of Congress, Trump urged Pence not to join Republicans who had said they wouldn’t challenge the election results, deriding them as “weak” and “pathetic.”“I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do,” Trump said. “And I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINO’s and the stupid people,” he added, using an acronym that refers to Republicans in name only.Minutes before Trump uttered that line, Pence had already announced he would not overturn the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-hits-breaking-point-with-trump-in-blessing-joe-biden-s-win/story-cHzYbDDdvlpRQg95axKxzL.html

Wong, who won the primary vote, has been repeatedly detained for his role in organising pro-democracy rallies. He was also among 12 opposition candidates disqualified from running in the legislative election, which has since been postponed with the government citing the coronavirus.Of Wednesday’s arrests, authorities cited the opposition’s campaign to win a majority in the legislative election with the view to pressure the government to enact democratic reforms by blocking its proposals in the city’s assembly.The arrests have raised alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn following the imposition of the new law, which targets what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was considering sanctions and other restrictions on those involved in the arrests.In response, China said the United States will pay a “heavy price” for its wrongdoing.Critics say the security law crushes wide-ranging freedoms unavailable elsewhere in China which were promised on the territory’s return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula.Supporters say it has restored order following months of often violent anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019.Since its imposition, leading activists such as media tycoon Jimmy Lai have been arrested, some democratic lawmakers have been disqualified, activists have fled into exile and protest slogans and songs have been declared illegal.It was unclear who could run for the opposition in any future polls following the mass arrests. Those arrested on Wednesday have yet to be charged and were expected to leave police stations on Thursday or Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-suspected-of-violating-city-s-new-security-law/story-fEmWtXoHR86UYoengmw8CN.html

07-01-2021||World||Donald Trump says his term is ending, transition will be orderly||President Donald Trump said there would be an “orderly transition on January 20th” after Congress concluded the electoral vote count early Thursday certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory hours after he appeared to excuse the violent occupation of the US Capitol by his supporters.Trump acknowledged defeat in the Nov. 3 election for the first time, after a day of chaos and destruction on Capitol Hill perpetrated in his name by supporters that halted business in Congress for more than six hours.“Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,” Trump said in a statement posted to Twitter by aides. His personal account was locked by the social media company for posting messages that appeared to justify the assault on the seat of the nation’s democracy.ALSO WATCH | How media captured the unprecedented storming of US Capitol Trump added, “While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!”Trump on Wednesday had encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol to protest lawmakers’ actions, expressed empathy for the mob, which violently forced its way inside, clashed with police and forced lawmakers into hiding.“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,” Trump wrote in a message that was later deleted by Twitter. He added, “Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”In an earlier video he had praised the protesters as “special” people and said he understood their pain. Twitter later locked his account for the first time as it demanded he remove the tweets and threatened “permanent suspension.”Also Read| US Congress certifies Joe Biden, Kamala Harris victory in US electionsTrump’s response to the violence underscored his monthslong obsession with trying to overturn the results of the election, spending the final days of his presidency angrily stewing and lashing out at Republicans for perceived disloyalty.Trump spent much of Wednesday afternoon watching the insurrection on television from his private dining room off the Oval Office. But aside from sparing appeals for calm issued at the insistence of his staff, he was largely disengaged as the nation’s capital descended into unprecedented scenes of chaos as a mob of thousands tried to halt the peaceful transition of power.Instead, a White House official said, most of Trump’s attention was consumed by his ire at Vice President Mike Pence, who said he would not overturn the will of voters in the congressional electoral count. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke only on the condition of anonymity.The violence, coupled with the president’s tepid response, appeared to drive many Republicans to the breaking point after years of allegiance to Trump. In a sign of growing frustration, a number of White House aides were discussing a potential mass resignation, according to people familiar with the conversation, although some harbored concerns about what Trump might do in his final two weeks in office if they were not there to serve as guardrails when so few remain.After four years with no shortage of fraught moments, Wednesday’s events quickly emerged as the nadir of morale in the Trump White House, as aides looked on in horror at the chaos at the Capitol fomented by Trump.Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s chief of staff and a former White House press secretary, submitted her resignation Wednesday, but declined to say what has prompted her move. Deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, White House social secretary Rickie Niceta and deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews also resigned, according to officials. More departures were expected in the coming days, officials said. But other aides indicated they were staying to help smooth the transition to President-elect Biden’s administration.Trump has been single-mindedly focused on his electoral defeat since Election Day, aides said, at the expense of the other responsibilities of his office, including the fight against the raging coronavirus. Indeed, it was Pence, not Trump, who spoke with the acting defense secretary to discuss mobilizing the D.C National Guard on Wednesday afternoon.Trump only reluctantly issued the tweets and taped a video encouraging an end to the violence. The posts came at the insistence of staff and amid mounting criticism from Republican lawmakers urging him to condemn the violence being perpetrated in his name, according to the official.And even as authorities struggled to take control of Capitol Hill after protesters overwhelmed police, Trump continued to level baseless allegations of mass voter fraud and praised his loyalists as “very special.”Also Read| Trump supporters storm US Capitol, 4 dead, 52 arrested: In photos“I know your pain. I know your hurt. But you have to go home now,” he said in a video posted more than 90 minutes after lawmakers were evacuated from the House and Senate chambers. “We can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You’re very special.”In a sign of the extraordinary events that had unfolded over the previous 24 hours, Trump’s statement acknowledging that he would leave office on Jan. 20 could not be posted on the president’s Twitter or Facebook feeds because both accounts have been suspended by the companies. Instead, it was released via the Twitter account of Trump’s social media director, Dan Scavino, who frequently tweets on his behalf.Hours earlier, Trump had appeared at a massive rally near the White House, where he continued to urge supporters to fight the election results and encouraged them to march to the Capitol in remarks that were peppered with incendiary language and rife with violent undertones. At one point, he even suggested he might join them — a prospect that was discussed by the White House but eventually abandoned.“We’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue ... and we’re going to the Capitol ... we’re going to try and give our Republicans ... the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country,” he said.Earlier in the rally, his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had advocated what he had called “trial by combat.”Trump’s tweets and video also drew the attention of the social media giants he has frequently maligned. The video was removed by Facebook, “because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence,” said the site’s head of integrity, Guy Rosen. Twitter took a more punitive approach, locking Trump’s account and warning, “Future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account.”Before Trump released the video, Republican lawmakers and former administration officials had begged the president to intervene as the violence spiraled.“I called him. I think we need to make a statement, make sure that we can calm individuals down,” House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California told Fox News.A Senate ally, Republican Marco Rubio of Florida, appealed directly to the president in a tweet: “Mr. President @realDonaldTrump the men & women of law enforcement are under assault. It is crucial you help restore order by sending resources to assist the police and ask those doing this to stand down.”Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., posted a video message urging Trump to “call it off.”“This is banana republic crap that we’re watching right now,” said Gallagher, who had spoken out against objections from fellow Republicans to certifying the Electoral College vote that Biden won.Former White House staff also issued pleas.Also Watch| Watch how media captured the unprecedented storming of US Capitol“Condemn this now, @realDonaldTrump — you are the only one they will listen to,” tweeted former White House communications director Alyssa Farah.Added his former chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney: “The best thing @realDonaldTrump could do right now is to address the nation from the Oval Office and condemn the riots. A peaceful transition of power is essential to the country and needs to take place on 1/20.”Pence, who was ushered out of the Senate chamber to a secure location as protesters breached the building, also called for protesters to disperse.“The violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now,” he tweeted. “Anyone involved must respect Law Enforcement officers and immediately leave the building.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-his-term-is-ending-transition-will-be-orderly/story-EWx2vqDmrrqUhCLU4BvaqI.html

Without it I can’t leave the city,” one young woman at Shijiazhuang train station told state broadcaster CCTV.Three officials from Shijiazhuang’s Gaocheng district -- the epicentre of the latest outbreak -- were reprimanded for their handling of the outbreak, the local disciplinary commission said Thursday.The officials had allowed a woman who had tested positive to leave the area, the commission claimed.Gaocheng district has been declared high risk and sealed off, and authorities said tens of thousands have already been tested for the virus.There were 63 new Covid-19 infections in mainland China on Thursday, including 11 imported cases and one other domestic case in the northeast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officials-punished-as-china-logs-highest-daily-covid-cases-since-july/story-QekpaXCwxySTOV3Cn0SCWJ.html

07-01-2021||World||Trump supporters storm US Capitol, 4 dead, 52 arrested: In photos||US President Donald Trump’s supporters violently forced their way inside the US Capitol, where lawmakers were meeting to certify Joe Biden as the winner of the November 3 elections. Trump, who has refused to concede his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, had urged his supporters multiple times to come to Washington for a rally on the day the US House of Representatives and Senate were scheduled to certify the results of the Electoral College.US President-elect Joe Biden called the scenes at the US Capitol ‘chaotic’ and said they “do not represent who we are”.“Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it’s disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now,” Biden said on Twitter.The violence, that forced lawmakers to flee the US Capitol, resulted in the death of four people. Among them was a woman who was shot by police. Three others lost their lives to medical emergencies, police of Washington DC said.“Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,” Trump had tweeted on December 20. “Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” he had said. After his supporters displayed violence at the US Capitol, he tweeted, “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly unfairly treated for so long.” This message was later deleted by Twitter. He added, “Go home with love in peace. Remember this day forever!”Democrats and some Republicans blamed Trump for inciting the violence on Wednesday. His failure to rein in his supporters stood in sharp contrast to his attitude at the time he threatened arrests to break up protests against racial inequality last year.The mayor of Washington, DC, Muriel Bowser, ordered a curfew in the nation’s capital beginning at 6pm Wednesday and later in the day, extended it for 15 days.Lawmakers resumed business after officials said the Capitol premises were safe, hours after the attack. They formally certified the electoral victory of Biden as the next US President and Kamala Harris as the Vice President in the November 3 election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-supporters-storm-us-capitol-4-dead-52-arrested-in-photos/story-36xFvpjUtHxGMpwxw3UzVO.html

07-01-2021||World||Kim vows to bolster North Korea’s military at party meeting||North Korea leader Kim Jong Un vowed to strengthen the country’s military defences in a speech at a major ruling party meeting that provides insights into his priorities amid growing economic challenges and a US presidential transition.Kim made clear his “will to reliably protect the security of the country and people and the peaceful environment of the socialist construction by placing the state defense capabilities on a much higher level, and put forth goals for realizing it,” the Korean Central News Agency said.The state media report Thursday on Kim’s speech to the Workers Party congress the previous day didn’t elaborate. North Korea has previously underscored its need for nuclear weapons and missiles as a deterrent and a pre-emptive strike capability to cope with what it describes as American hostility. Cheong Seong-Chang, a fellow at the Wilson Centers Asia Programme, said Kims speech likely contained “sensitive contents” that can provoke the United States and South Korea.Kim halted his country’s nuclear and long-range missile tests before engaging in high-stakes summitry with President Donald Trump in 2018. But with his advancing arsenal on the negotiating table, their diplomacy fell apart due to wrangling over the weapons and US-led sanctions on North Korea.Kim since then has openly pledged to expand his nuclear capability that he says already put the American mainland within its striking range. However, he has not resumed high-profile weapons tests, which some analysts say could completely derail diplomacy with the United States and further diminish prospects for winning sanctions relief.South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers in late November that Kim was worried about President-elect Joe Biden’s expected new approach on North Korea. Biden has called Kim a “thug” and criticized his summit diplomacy with Trump.This years congress — the first in five years — comes as Kim faces what appears to be the toughest moment since taking power in late 2011, due to what he calls “multiple crises” caused by an economy battered by pandemic-related border closings, a series of natural disasters and the sanctions. On the first day of the congress Tuesday, Kim admitted his previous economic development plans failed, saying that “almost all sectors fell a long way short of the set objectives.” He said the congress would work out a new five-year development plan. Kim on Wednesday presented goals for developing the North’s transport, construction, commerce and other industries and proposed ways to expand production in agriculture, light industry and fishing to improve public livelihoods, KCNA said.State media didnt provide much details on Kim’s economic review. Cheong said North Korea likely didnt want foreign experts to learn its poor economic performance too easily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-vows-to-bolster-north-korea-s-military-at-party-meeting/story-lrIy9wyqGX5nx9jqszceXM.html
07-01-2021||World||Trump summoned supporters to ‘wild’ protest and told them to fight. They did||The chaos in the US Capitol on Wednesday unfolded after President Donald Trump spent weeks whipping up his supporters with false allegations of fraud in the Nov. 3 election, culminating in a call to march to the building that represents US democracy.Trump, who has refused to concede his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, had urged his supporters multiple times to come to Washington for a rally on Wednesday, the day the US House of Representatives and Senate were scheduled to certify the results of the Electoral College.“Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,” Trump, a Republican, tweeted on Dec. 20. “Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”They turned out in the thousands and heard the president urge them to march on the Capitol building to express their anger at the voting process and to pressure their elected officials to reject the results. Also Read: Capitol Police fail to hold back pro-Trump mob with too few cops“We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women,” Trump told the crowd, speaking with the White House as a backdrop.Appearing at what could be his last rally as the sitting president, Trump exhorted his supporters “to fight.” “We will never give up, we will never concede,” Trump said, delighting the crowd by calling Democratic victories the product of what he called “explosions of bullshit.”“Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!” people chanted in reply.Trump has sought for weeks to thwart a peaceful transfer of power, aided by groups like “Stop the Steal,” which promoted https://stopthesteal.us the day’s protest and peddled false claims about voter fraud on Facebook and other social media.Wednesday’s events were the culmination of those efforts. About 50 minutes into the speech, some of his supporters, waving Trump flags, began heading toward Capitol Hill, where unprecedented mayhem ensued. Protesters fought through police barricades, stormed the building and entered lawmakers’ chambers. The certification process was stopped and Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress were evacuated.One civilian was shot dead, Washington police said. As night fell, a Capitol official said the building had been cleared, but outside some way from the grounds, scores of protesters remained, including members of militia and far-right groups.‘I KNOW YOU’RE HURT’ Monitoring the scenes of violence on cable news television from the Oval Office, Trump tweeted about an hour after the Capitol was put on lockdown that the protesters should “remain peaceful.” As criticism mounted that he had incited a riot, he was urged to say more by a Trump stalwart, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, and some of the advisers who remain in the White House for his dwindling days in office.Biden had come out forcefully on live television and said the violence was “not a protest, it’s insurrection.” He called on Trump to demand “an end to this siege.”Eventually, Trump posted a recorded video on Twitter.Also Read: Lawmakers vow to investigate police after Capitol breach“I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election,” Trump said, repeating familiar falsehoods. “But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order.”He posted another message that called the mob “great patriots” who were reacting to an election victory “viciously stripped away.” Twitter later hid three tweets and locked Trump’s account.Trump’s failure to rein in his supporters stood in sharp contrast to his attitude last summer when he threatened arrests and the use of force to break up protests against racial inequality.During the Black Lives Matter protests, Trump discussed using the military in response, and an area near the White House was forcibly cleared for him to stage a photo-op in front of a church, holding a Bible. Democrats and some Republicans blamed Trump for inciting the violence on Wednesday.“Today’s violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump,” Jim Mattis, a former defense secretary under Trump, said in a statement.Weeks have passed since the states completed certifying that Biden won by 306 votes in the Electoral College to Trump’s 232, and Trump’s extraordinary challenges to the result have failed in courts across the country.Yet Trump’s rally speech on Wednesday was filled with grievances and voter fraud allegations that have not been backed up with evidence. He singled out several Republican lawmakers for criticism, including Senator Mitt Romney and Representative Liz Cheney, while hailing as heroes those who have sided with him to stop the electoral votes from being certified.Several times he also urged Pence to intervene. But while Trump was still speaking, Pence released a lengthy statement saying he would carry out his constitutional duty to certify the vote.“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence wrote.About an hour later he was being escorted from the House chamber as a mob tried to break in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-summoned-supporters-to-wild-protest-and-told-them-to-fight-they-did/story-dDmAECeNO9IeixZ1XOhiDI.html
07-01-2021||World||Japan to declare Covid-19 emergency for Tokyo region after record daily infections||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is set to declare a state of emergency Thursday for Tokyo and adjacent areas, trying to stem Covid-19 infections that hit a daily record in the capital.The declaration will cover the capital and the surrounding prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba, and is likely to be imposed from Friday until Feb. 7, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said. It will be revoked when infections fall below levels laid out by the government, he added.Suga is set to hold a news conference at 6 p.m. to discuss the matter. Tokyo found more than 2,000 cases of coronavirus Thursday, a record, broadcaster NHK reported, citing an unidentified official.Japan’s emergency doesn’t imply the kind of lockdowns seen in some parts of Europe, and the government is seeking far less stringent measures than under its previous emergency last year, which triggered the worst economic contraction on record.Residents will be asked to avoid going out only after 8 p.m. and bars and restaurants will be instructed to close at that time. Authorities can’t enforce compliance for now, though Suga is seeking to amend the law to add penalties for businesses that don’t abide by government measures, and formalize incentives for those that do.Bloomberg Economics’ Yuki Masujima sees the emergency declaration shaving up to 0.7% off the economy for each month it lasts. Tokyo and neighboring areas account for about one-third of the country’s gross domestic product.Ballooning infections have been a blow for Suga, who had sought to restore growth despite the pandemic, including by offering domestic travel incentives to bolster the tourism industry. His public support has slumped, with polls showing most voters favor tougher pandemic measures.“This increases the possibility of an economic contraction,” economist Yoshimasa Maruyama at SMBC Nikko Securities said of the emergency. “Suga wanted to wait until after the New Year’s holiday to make the declaration and that has put him behind the curve to limit the spread of the virus.”Even before Suga first hinted he would declare an emergency, the economic recovery was forecast to slow in the first three months of 2021, with companies scaling back investment and households opting to save more.The restrictions on activities are likely to hamper the effectiveness of the economic stimulus package Suga put together last month, which is to be funded by an extra budget. The package is no longer suitable in the current environment, Nomura Research Institute economist Takahide Kiuchi said in a research note.“The government should change the content of the third extra budget and change the course of economic policy in order to strengthen support for companies and individuals,” Kiuchi said.The emergency declaration decision will be formally announced after a day of consultations with advisers and reports to parliamentary committees. An advisory panel on the pandemic on Thursday approved the emergency proposal, Nishimura said.It will be the second in Japan after a declaration that began in April, but is not expected to cause as much pain as the first, when the virus slammed the brakes on the economy and sent it into its worst downturn.Suga’s signature “Go To” travel campaign, which had already been suspended through Jan. 11, is unlikely to be revived while the state of emergency is in place. The government will press for a return to remote work, aiming to cut the number of commuters in the region by 70%, Nishimura said. Schools, however, will not be asked to close and university entrance exams will go ahead as scheduled.Japan has had by far the lowest infections of any Group of Seven nation, recording fewer cases in the past year than the US has seen in recent days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-declare-covid-19-emergency-for-tokyo-region-after-record-daily-infections/story-cPHgpokQzVF0GgPIYnc3rK.html
07-01-2021||World||Capitol Police fail to hold back pro-Trump mob with too few cops||The US Capitol Police force was caught unprepared by a mob of pro-Trump extremists on Wednesday, in a failure to protect the seat of American democracy unparalleled in modern times.Rioters, many bearing Trump garb, breached the barricades set up by an under-staffed police force and swarmed the Capitol, disrupting the certification of President-Elect Joe Biden’s election and forcing the evacuation of Vice President Mike Pence and other lawmakers.One woman was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer, Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee III told reporters late on Wednesday, without divulging more details about the circumstances of the shooting. He said at least 14 officers were also injured, one seriously, during the disruptions.Calm was eventually restored after the National Guard was called out and more than a dozen people were arrested. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 6 pm-6 am curfew and later extended an emergency declaration for 15 days, pushing it just past Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.With Washington routinely the scene of large protests, the Capitol Police “should have been preparing for this for years,” said Daniel Schuman, policy director at Demand Progress, an advocacy group. “So the question is, ‘Why did they fail so terribly?”’The failure is all the more remarkable because local authorities were on high alert over the arrival of thousands of Trump supporters as they gathered to hear the defeated president -- who had invited the protests -- bemoan the unfounded allegations of election fraud.“They knew this group was coming, they knew it was going to be enormous but they didn’t do any preparation to control the crowd such as fencing, barricades, and cement structures to prevent traffic and people flow,” said Timothy Dimoff, a former SWAT force member who runs a security consulting company.A spokesperson for the Capitol Police did not respond to a request for comment on criticism surrounding preparations for the day.The mayhem shortly after midday signalled the start of an extraordinary episode that saw District of Columbia police, officers from neighbouring Virginia and Maryland, and the D.C. National Guard join to recover control of the US Capitol from the president’s supporters.“It was clear that the crowd was intent on causing harm to our officers by deploying chemical irritants on police, to force entry into the United States Capitol building,” Contee said in an earlier news conference.“What we witnessed was unlawful and riotous behavior,” Contee said.Protesters flooded the building, with some of them entering the House chamber and sitting at the dais while one man apparently entered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office. Video on social media showed one policeman desperately trying to hold back more than a dozen protesters as they ran up the stairs inside the building.Around 3 pm, the District of Columbia’s National Guard called out its entire roster of about 1,100 people to help restore control, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said. The D.C. National Guard is unique among such forces because it reports only to the president.By nightfall, police were using flash-bang devices to disperse crowds around the building. The US Capitol was declared secure on Wednesday evening, about four hours after the mob stormed the building. Debate on certification of the Electoral College soon resumed, with lawmakers clearly shaken by the day’s events.On the floor of the Senate Wednesday evening, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the breakdown at the Capitol “a stain on our country not so easily washed away.” Many Republicans put the blame on Donald Trump, with longtime ally Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas saying it was “past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence.”‘Go Home Now’While Trump eventually told violent protesters who stormed the US Capitol to “go home now,” he earlier egged them on to help stop the transfer of power from taking place.“President Trump doesn’t say go out and attack the Capitol but he is encouraging people to believe that the election was stolen,” said Jessica Stern, a professor on terrorism and white supremacy at Boston University. “The pressure has built up to the point they felt inspired to act now.”The Capitol Police force describes its mission as protecting “Congress, Members of Congress, employees, visitors, and Congressional buildings and grounds from crime, disruption, and terrorism.”The department has an authorized sworn strength of more than 2,000 and an annual budget of $460 million. In addition it has over 350 civilian personnel who provide operational and administrative support.Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking House GOP leader, applauded their efforts.“You saw the Capitol Police do what they do every day. They risked their lives for us,” Scalise said in a statement after the Capitol had been secured. “They keep the Capitol safe — those heroes that we love.”But Democratic Representative Tim Ryan, chairman of the panel responsible for funding the Capitol Police, told reporters that some law enforcement officials should lose their jobs.“It’s pretty clear that there’s going to be a number of people who are going to be without employment very, very soon,” Ryan, of Ohio, said in a digital press conference Wednesday. He criticized “the lack of professional planning and dealing with what we knew was going to occur.”Ryan, chairman of the House Appropriations Legislative Branch subcommittee, said he talked to House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving and Capitol Police officials about the long-planned protest as recently as Tuesday, and that it was clear protesters were not supposed to be “anywhere near the Capitol,” instead restricted to a nearby area to “protest and express your view,” Ryan said.House Administration Chairperson Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, promised a review of Capitol security.“The breach today at the US Capitol raises grave security concerns,” Lofgren said in a statement.Republicans Recoil From Trump After Mob Violence Proves Too MuchPeople who went up the Capitol steps should have been immediately arrested, and there should have been reinforcements ready to help, Ryan said.“There were clearly enormous strategic and planning failures by the Capitol Police, by the sergeant at arms, and anybody else who was a part of coordinating this effort here,” Ryan said.The US Capitol Historical Society, a congressionally chartered educational group, posted a message on its website Wednesday under the heading, “Democracy is Stronger Than Terror.”The then unfinished building first housed Congress in 1800 and was famously overrun and burned by British troops in 1814 as part of the War of 1812.“The United States Capitol Historical Society is shocked and heartbroken by today’s violent disregard for American values and our Constitution,” the group said. “The US Capitol is more than a building – it is the embodiment of American democracy and our way of life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-fail-to-hold-back-pro-trump-mob-with-too-few-cops/story-ArY40zkR3XdggfthroU1JM.html
07-01-2021||World||Lawmakers vow to investigate police after Capitol breach||Lawmakers are vowing an investigation into how law enforcement handled Wednesday’s violent breach at the Capitol, questioning whether a lack of preparedness allowed a mob to occupy and vandalize the building.US Capitol Police, who are charged with protecting Congress, turned to other law enforcement for help with the mob that overwhelmed the complex and sent lawmakers into hiding. Both law enforcement and Trump supporters deployed chemical irritants during the hours long occupation of the complex before it was cleared Wednesday evening.Four people died, one of them a woman who was shot and killed inside the Capitol. Three other people died after suffering “medical emergencies” related to the breach, said Robert Contee, chief of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department.Police said 52 people were arrested as of Wednesday night, including 26 on the Capitol grounds. Fourteen police officers were injured.Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Administration Committee, said the breach “raises grave security concerns,″ adding that her committee will work with House and Senate leaders to review the police response — and its preparedness.Lawmakers crouched under desks and donned gas masks while police futilely tried to barricade the building when people marched to the Capitol from a rally near the White House in support of President Donald Trump. Washington’s mayor instituted an evening curfew in an attempt to contain the violence.Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., a former police chief, said it was “painfully obvious” that Capitol police “were not prepared for today. I certainly thought that we would have had a stronger show of force, that there would have been steps taken in the very beginning to make sure that there was a designated area for the protesters in a safe distance from the Capitol.’‘In an interview with MSNBC Wednesday night, Demings said it appeared police were woefully understaffed, adding that “it did not seem that they had a clear operational plan to really deal with” thousands of protesters who descended on the Capitol following Trump’s complaints of a “rigged election.’‘The rioters were egged on by Trump, who has spent weeks falsely attacking the integrity of the election and had urged his supporters to come to Washington to protest Congress’ formal approval of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. The protests interrupted those proceedings for nearly seven hours.The mob broke windows, entered both the Senate and House chambers and went into the offices of lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.Demings said there were “a lot of unanswered questions and I’m damn determined to get answers to those questions about what went wrong today.’‘A police spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment late Wednesday.Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said she was outraged to see accounts on social media of a Capitol Police officer posing for a photo with a protester. “Would you take a selfie with someone who was robbing a bank?” she asked. “I can’t imagine if a couple of thousand of (Black Lives Matters) protesters had descended on the Capitol ... that there would be 13 people arrested.”Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, suggested there could be leadership changes at the Capitol police.“I think it’s pretty clear that there’s going to be a number of people who are going to be without employment very, very soon because this is an embarrassment both on behalf of the mob, and the president, and the insurrection, and the attempted coup, but also the lack of professional planning and dealing with what we knew was going to occur,” Ryan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-vow-to-investigate-police-after-capitol-breach/story-GaCKEfePRuACCEjSI3UCPP.html
07-01-2021||World||At least four dead after Trump supporters ransack US Capitol||At least four people have been reported dead, according to latest reports, as supporters of President Donald Trump stormed US Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, overpowered security personnel to reach deep inside the building, forced lawmakers to shelter in place under desks and in rooms, and brought to a halt a key constitutional procedure that had just got under way to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory.Clashes broke out between the insurrectionists and security personnel and several people were reported injured apart from the deaths. The injured include law enforcement personnel and dozens have been taken into custody. They had been driven out of the building by late evening. But even though a nighttime curfew came into effect at 6pm, the mobs, though thinned down, continued to loiter around the complex, menacingly, hurling invectives at police.“To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, and to threaten the safety of duly elected officials is not protest,” Biden said in remarks to the nation. “It is insurrection. The world is watching - and like so many other Americans, I am shocked and saddened that our nation, so long a beacon of light, hope, and democracy has come to such a dark moment.”Former President George W Bush, a Republican, also slammed the mob action as an “insurrection”, as did other Republicans such as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Mitt Romney, also a 2012 presidential nominee.Calls went up shortly for Trump to be impeached, even if there were just two more weeks left of his term, or be removed from office under the 25th Amendment of US constitution, which empowers the federal cabinet to sideline the president finding him unfit to govern. Leading legal experts such as Lawrence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, told CNN that Trump had “engaged in inciting sedition”.The world watched in horror as well. “Distressed to see news about rioting and violence in Washington, DC. Orderly and peaceful transfer of power must continue. The democratic process cannot be allowed to be subverted through unlawful protests,” said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a close Trump ally, tweeted. Statements of shock and outrage flowed from capitals of other US allies and partners.The rioters had marched to the Capitol from a rally nearby where Trump had railed against his election defeat, attributing it to fraud and cheating. And then he called on them to march on the Capitol, promising to walk with them. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” Trump told his cheering supporters, referring to the certification process. “And we’re probably not going to be cheering, so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong.” But he did not walk with them. He went back to the White House to watch the mayhem on TV.Men and women carrying Trump campaign flags and the national flag stormed the over 200-year-old Capitol, which was last breached in 1812 by the British in a war, overwhelming security personnel with their sheer numbers. They made it to the well of the Senate and one of them posed for pictures sitting in the Senate president’s seat, which was occupied by Vice-President Pence just a while ago. Another man went into Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, took her seat and posed for pictures with his feet up on her desk. One of them left a note for her, “We will not back down.”US congress had just started a joint session at the time to certify Biden’s election victory. And the two chambers had broken up to debate, separately under the rules, the first of the several objections Trump’s allies in congress had planned to raise against the certification. They were soon sheltering in place as rioters took over the building, forcing back Capitol police, some of whom were seen posing for selfies with the rioters. The process resumed later in the evening after the complex had been cleared of Trump’s supporters.Though shocked and outraged, leaders of both parties resolved to put forth a joint front to demonstrate they would not be intimidated and resumed the certification process later in the evening. They planned to continue the process as long as it would take, even if it meant going through the night.As news of the insurrection spread, calls were issued for Trump, as the instigator and inciter, to intervene and call off his supporters. He ignored them for a while and then responded with an insipid tweet saying, “Stay peaceful.”He posted another tweet and then, after a public appeal from Biden to “step up”, Trump posted a long message with a video, in which he reiterated his claim the election was stolen, appealed to the rioters to go home calling them patriots and saying he loved them.Facebook took down that video and so did Twitter, which went a step further and locked the US president’s Twitter account for 12 hours.“This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence,” said Guy Rosen of Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-four-dead-after-trump-supporters-ransack-us-capitol/story-bQdcE70WtTsGpBWQSu3RNL.html
07-01-2021||World||Former US presidents denounce Capitol violence||Every living former US president on Wednesday denounced the violence of a mob that stormed the Capitol building in Washington, forcing lawmakers to flee to safety and leaving one woman dead.The crowd, made up of supporters of President Donald Trump, opposed the certification underway in Congress of Joe Biden’s presidential election win in November. George W. Bush called out fellow Republicans for fueling the “insurrection,” likening the situation to a “banana republic.”“I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions and our law enforcement,” Bush’s statement said, in a barely veiled swipe at Trump. Barack Obama also blamed Republicans and Trump, “who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election,” he said in a statement. Also Read: ‘Moment of shame’: Obama calls on Republicans to speak out in response to US Capitol violenceTrump’s most recent predecessor called the incident “a moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation.” “But we’d be kidding ourselves if we treated it as a total surprise,” Obama said, calling the events of the day “the consequences” of Trump and his supporters refusing to accept the results of last year’s election. Bill Clinton denounced the riot as “unprecedented assault” on the US Capitol and the nation itself.“Today we faced an unprecedented assault on our Capitol, our Constitution, and our country,” the Democratic former president said in a statement.“The match was lit by Donald Trump and his most ardent enablers, including many in Congress, to overturn the results of an election he lost.”And the oldest member of the exclusive club, 96-year-old Democrat Jimmy Carter, said he was “troubled” by Wednesday’s scenes, which he called a “national tragedy.” “We join our fellow citizens in praying for a peaceful resolution so our nation can heal and complete the transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries,” he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-presidents-denounce-capitol-violence/story-0H1OCYEKJ3Tpxt2HjN9KvO.html

07-01-2021||World||China goes online to mock ‘beautiful sight’ of US Capitol chaos||China’s internet erupted in mirth at America’s troubled democracy after supporters of President Donald Trump broke into the US Capitol, comparing the chaos to the Hong Kong anti-government protests of 2019.On Thursday morning, state media tabloid Global Times tweeted side-by-side photo comparisons of Hong Kong protesters occupying the city’s Legislative Council Complex in July 2019 with Wednesday’s Washington riots.The latter saw hardcore Trump fans invade the US Capitol to protest the election defeat, taking selfies, scuffling with security and ransacking parts of the building.Also Read: Former US President Obama says Trump incited violence at the Capitol“@SpeakerPelosi once referred to the Hong Kong riots as ‘a beautiful sight to behold’,” the Global Times said in the tweet, referring to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s June 2019 comment about Hong Kong’s mass pro-democracy demonstrations, which were mostly peaceful at that time.“It remains yet to be seen whether she will say the same about the recent developments in Capitol Hill.”China’s Communist Youth League also described the unrest as a “beautiful sight” on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.The hashtag “Trump supporters storm US Capitol” pinballed across Weibo on Thursday, racking up 230 million views, as users compared the global support for Hong Kong’s protesters with the outpouring of condemnation for the pro-Trump mob.“At present, all European countries’ leaders have shown double standards and condemned it (Washington rioting),” read one Weibo comment which gained over 5,000 likes.Also Read: World leaders are appalled by storming of US Capitol“I don’t know what kind of double-standard reports will be carried by Hong Kong or Taiwan media this time.” “What happened in the Hong Kong Legislative Council last year is being repeated in the US Capitol,” wrote another user in a comment with over 4,500 likes. Hong Kong protesters had stormed the legislature to demand democracy -- a battle they appear to have lost as China smothers the territory with a national security law, sweeping oppositions figures and activists up in mass arrests.US President-elect Joe Biden said the US rioters were undermining democracy by trying to overturn Trump’s defeat in November’s election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-goes-online-to-mock-beautiful-sight-of-us-capitol-chaos/story-Qxtjg7lajRdMnoywgf4tUO.html

07-01-2021||World||Cabinet members discussing Trump’s removal: US media||Members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet on Wednesday discussed the possibility of removing Trump from office after his supporters stormed the Capitol, three US news channels reported.The discussions focused on the 25th amendment to the US Constitution, which allows for a president’s removal by the vice president and cabinet if he is judged “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” Invoking it would require Vice President Michael Pence to lead the cabinet in a vote on removing him.CNN quoted unnamed Republican leaders saying the 25th amendment had been discussed, saying they had described Trump as “out of control.”CBS reporter Margaret Brennan said that “nothing formal” had been presented to Pence, and ABC reporter Katherine Faulders said “multiple” sources had told her that discussions took place on the unprecedented move.Trump’s encouragement of the protesters, his unfounded claims that he lost the November 3 presidential election due to massive fraud, and other bizarre behavior have raised questions about his ability to lead.While only two weeks remain before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, after the attacks on Congress Wednesday Democratic lawmakers called for invoking the 25th Amendment as well.Democrats of the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Pence urging him to act to remove Trump, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and “sought to undermine our democracy.”Pointing to a rambling speech Trump gave Wednesday, it said he “revealed that he is not mentally sound and is still unable to process and accept the results of the 2020 election.”Others blamed Trump for fueling terrorism.“The President incited a domestic terror attack on the Capitol. He is an imminent threat to our democracy and he needs to be removed from office immediately,” said Representative Kathleen Rice in a tweet.“The Cabinet must invoke the 25th Amendment,” she wrote.The lawmakers’ call was echoed by the influential Washington Post.“Responsibility for this act of sedition lies squarely with the president, who has shown that his continued tenure in office poses a grave threat to US democracy. He should be removed,” the Post said.“The president is unfit to remain in office for the next 14 days. Every second he retains the vast powers of the presidency is a threat to public order and national security,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cabinet-members-discussing-trump-s-removal-us-media/story-LywjMxgMzsOkhGu980HXEP.html
07-01-2021||World||Building, location and importance: US Capitol Hill fast facts||There were unprecedented scenes in Washington, DC on Wednesday evening after thousands of Donald Trump’s supporters laid siege to the US Capitol. These supporters want Trump’s defeat in the US presidential election in November last year overturned.The trigger for these protest was a speech given by Trump, who asked his supporters to “fight” to stop the “steal” of the election and march on the Capitol where a ceremony is being held to certify the Electoral College votes that will formalise President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.The scenes that Americans are accustomed to watching in distant lands, played out in their own backyard as the protesters pushed through police barricades and broke windows. The violence also included gunshots fired in the Capitol, which led to the death of a woman.Here is everything you need to know about the seat of the US government.About the building and US Capitol complexThe five square kilometre neighbourhood houses about a dozen, most high-profile buildings of the United States, including the Senate, the house of Representatives and the Supreme Court.It is one of the oldest residential neighbourhood in Washington, DC. According to the US Capitol Visitor Centre, the construction began in 1793 and the country’s Congress met for the first time in the completed portion in November, 1800.The Capitol was expanded after a legislation was passed in 1850. The architectural work took 18 years to get completed, according to the visitor centre. The Capitol has more than 540 rooms, according to the visitor centre.The RotundaThe Rotunda is the very heart of the Capitol. Although it serves no legislative function, it is a ceremonial centre where state funerals have been held for presidents from Abraham Lincoln to Lyndon Johnson, distinguished members of Congress, military heroes, and eminent citizens.Many visiting heads of state have been received in the Rotunda, and memorable individuals and events celebrated.How important is the US Capitol?Symbolically, the United States Capitol is among the most important buildings in the country. It stands as the monument to the American people and their government.The Capitol complex also has a museum of American art and history. It has a separate police branch - the US Capitol Police - which is entrusted with protecting the Congress members, employees and visitors.The domed Capitol building has for centuries been the scene of protests and occasional violence, including a 1954 shooting involving Puerto Rican nationalists. But Wednesday’s events were particularly astounding both because they unfolded at least initially with the implicit blessing of the president and because of the underlying goal of overturning the results of a free and fair presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/building-location-and-importance-us-capitol-fast-facts/story-wVlsvMIX0waqqcK4f7RbFN.html

07-01-2021||World||Twitter, Facebook and Instagram muzzle Trump amid US Capitol violence||Hours after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol, social media giants Twitter, Facebook and Instagram locked the outgoing President’s page on their respective platforms.Twitter locked Trump out of his account for 12 hours and said that future violations by Trump could result in a permanent suspension. The company had asked Trump to delete three of his tweets, including a short video, which is at the centre of the storm.Trump deleted those posts; had they remained, Twitter had threatened to extend the suspension of his account.Facebook and the platform its owns - Instagram - said Trump’s pages will be blocked for 24 hours, reported Associated Press. Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, said, “This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video.”“This is what happens,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a communications professor at Syracuse University. “We didn’t just see a breach at the Capitol. Social media platforms have been breached by the president repeatedly. This is disinformation. This was a coup attempt in the United States.”So far, YouTube has not taken similar action to muzzle Trump.Trump has harnessed social media - especially Twitter - as a potent tool for spreading misinformation about the election. Wednesday’s riot only increased calls to ban Trump from the platform.In the video which has now been deleted by social media platforms, Trump had expressed empathy for the mob which violently forced its way inside, clashed with police and forced lawmakers into hiding.“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,” Trump said in the message. He added, “Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”Trump has been single-mindedly focused on his electoral defeat since Election Day, aides said, at the expense of the other responsibilities of his office, including the fight against the raging coronavirus.

07-01-2021||World||Democrats’ Georgia alliance is diverse and broad. Is it durable?||President Donald Trump came to the north Georgia mountains Monday night to gin up turnout in conservative strongholds and stave off the Democratic challengers who threatened the GOP’s Senate majority in two runoff elections.It didn’t work.Republicans’ overwhelming white, older and rural and exurban coalition failed the GOP Senate candidates in Tuesday’s high-stakes elections, while Democrats proved their alliance that succeeded in defeating Donald Trump in the state in November was not a fluke.Black and young voters, suburbanites and the many recent arrivals to the state showed up a second time in two months to back Democrats, handing Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock narrow victories over Republicans David Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler.Across Georgia, a fast-growing, diversifying Deep South state, Tuesday’s election returns told the same story: Record runoff turnout -- more than 4.4 million -- didn’t match the 5 million ballots cast in November, but Democrats consistently came closer than their rivals to replicating their November vote totals, even in the large towns where Trump rallied.It was true in north Georgia’s Whitfield County, Trump territory, where Perdue and Loeffler got 89% of the votes that Perdue won in the general election, when he led all Senate candidates in the first round of voting. That would be an impressive showing in most runoffs, which almost invariably see a turnout drop. But Ossoff and Warnock managed slightly more than 90% of their November totals.And it was true across the Atlanta suburbs, both the northern, whiter enclaves that have for two decades assured statewide victories for Republicans and the southern ring of communities where Black voters tilt the ledger to Democrats. Democrats also outperformed Republicans in metro Atlanta, the center of an ever-expanding footprint that has remade the Georgia economy and, now, its politics.Behind the Democrats’ victories — two months after Biden became the first Democrat since 1992 to win the state’s presidential electoral votes — are a mix of factors: The double runoffs and their national consequences brought bottomless resources to a party infrastructure that had been expanding for years.Black voters were driven by the possibility of Warnock becoming the state’s first Black senator, an achievement coveted even more coming two years after Democrat Stacey Abrams narrowly missed becoming the first Black female governor in US history.And Trump shadowed over it all as he sowed chaos within his party over his fraudulent claims of a rigged election and continued to repel college-educated suburbanites. Democrats narrowly edged out Republicans among that group, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 3,700 Georgia voters.Democrats argue their new path to power in Georgia will outlast the president.“We’ve been building a multiracial, multiethnic, multigenerational statewide coalition — truly a statewide coalition for years,” said Lauren Groh-Wargo, who managed Abrams’ 2018 campaign and has been at the center of organizing work conducted by a range of groups on the left.According to AP VoteCast, Democrats were competitive with the help of small but mighty groups in the diversifying state. Black voters — 32% of the electorate in the runoff, according to the survey — supported Ossoff and Warnock almost universally. VoteCast showed Black voters were 29% of the November electorate. That slight uptick could by itself account for tipping statewide results in a close Georgia election.Voters in households earning under $50,000 are roughly 40% of voters in the state, and about 6 in 10 backed Democrats. And, even as Republicans hoped Loeffler might appeal to female voters, Democrats handily won majorities of women in cities and suburbs, Black and Latino women and college-educated women.The racial divide in the state was stark. Sixty percent of voters were white, and about three-quarters of them backed Republicans. The GOP candidates won majorities of white voters with and without a college degree, across age groups and genders. Roughly two-thirds of small town and rural voters supported Loeffler and Perdue, including comparable shares of men and women. Voters who have lived in Georgia for more than 20 years — about two-thirds of all voters — slightly favored the GOP.But it wasn’t enough in rapidly changing Georgia.Since 2017, census figures show that roughly 280,000 people moved to to the state annually. That influx has steadily tilted the state away from Republicans. About 6 in 10 of voters who moved there within the past 20 years voted for the Democrats, VoteCast found.That growth has pushed suburbs deeper into the state. The Atlanta area has expanded an average 61 square miles each year between 1990 and 2010, almost two times more than any other city in the country, according to economist Issi Romem. The rapid expansion caused Atlanta’s suburbs to become denser and more diverse, a pattern that favored improved margins for Democrats.Roughly half of Georgia’s voters in the Senate runoffs identified as suburban; Democrats won this group 54% to 46%, according to VoteCast.Republicans bemoaned those losses in places that once solidified GOP victories statewide.“Suburbs, my friends, the suburbs,” wrote Josh Holmes, a former top aide to outgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Twitter. “I feel like a one trick pony but here we are again. We went from talking about jobs and the economy to ... election conspiracies in 4 short years and — as it turns out — they were listening!”By about 2 to 1, moderate voters favored Ossoff and Warnock, according to VoteCast.Democrats have been mining Georgia’s suburbs for support for years and effectively capitalized on expanded mail and early voting opportunities this election season.About 6 in 10 Georgia voters say they were contacted on behalf of Democratic candidates, compared with about half for Republican candidates, according to VoteCast. Democratic voters were roughly twice as likely as Republican voters to say they responded to the contact by receiving help with registering, planning when to vote or voting absentee.The evidence showed up in the results.Cherokee County, fast-growing suburbs and exurbs north of Atlanta, remains a deep trove of Republican votes, even as Democrats have upped their performance in years. But Loeffler and Perdue managed just 90% of Perdue’s November high mark of nearly 100,000 — a net loss of more than 9,000 votes. Ossoff managed 94% of his November total, with Warnock a percentage point higher.South of Atlanta is Clayton County, which has the highest proportion of Democratic votes in the metro area. Democrats’ raw vote totals there are often comparable to Republicans’ in Cherokee. On Tuesday, Ossoff and Warnock managed 96% of Democrats’ November total, losing only 3,500 votes. The Republicans matched less than 80%.Groh-Wargo, the Democratic strategist and organizer, said the population growth and Democrats’ efforts across the state will intensify, not wane, after the victories.“The party that is reaching out and expanding across demographics, geography, figuring out how to connect with all voters,” she said, “the party that’s doing that is going to be the ascendant party in Georgia and any diverse state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-georgia-alliance-is-diverse-and-broad-is-it-durable/story-FvS0U1N9dGaZfL8zAh5FRL.html
07-01-2021||World||Twitter, Facebook suspend Trump accounts after violence at US Capitol||In an unprecedented move, Twitter and Facebook have suspended President Donald Trump’s accounts after he continued to push conspiracy theories about the November 3 election following the storming of the US Capitol by his supporters.Twitter suspended Trump’s account for 12 hours and also blocked three of his tweets including a video of his address to his supporters.“As a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, DC, we have required the removal of three realDonaldTrump Tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,” Twitter Safety said.“This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked,” said the social media company.Twitter also warned of permanent suspension of Trump’s account if he continued to violate its policies. “Future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account,” it said.”Our public interest policy — which has guided our enforcement action in this area for years — ends where we believe the risk of harm is higher and/or more severe,” it said, adding that it will continue to evaluate the situation in real-time, including examining activity on the ground and statements made off Twitter.“We will keep the public informed, including if further escalation in our enforcement approach is necessary,” it said.Facebook said it would be blocking the president’s account from posting for 24 hours due to two policy violations.One of Trump’s tweets that was removed by Twitter included a video of him repeating unfounded claims that the election was taken from him and encouraging his supporters to disperse after violence erupted at the Capitol.He said that law and order were needed and that he loved his supporters.Facebook and YouTube have removed the video from Trump’s accounts.Trump posted that video after protesters entered the Capitol, interrupting lawmakers meeting in joint session to confirm the Electoral College results and President-elect Joe Bidens victory in the election.“I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it--especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order,” Trump said in his video that lasted for less than a minute. “This was a fraudulent election but we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace, so go home. We love you. You’re very special. You’ve seen what happens. You see the way, others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace,” Trump said.Trump has refused to concede the election. He alleges that there was a massive fraud and electoral malpractice. Election officials have denied the allegations. Facebook’s vice president integrity Guy Rosen said: “This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.” In a blog post on October 15, 2019, Twitter said that the accounts of world leaders are not above its policies entirely.It listed out areas that will result in enforcement action for an account on its service.Prominent among them include the promotion of terrorism, clear and direct threats of violence against an individual, posting private information, such as a home address or non-public personal phone number; and posting or sharing intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-facebook-freeze-trump-accounts-as-tech-giants-respond-to-storming-of-us-capitol/story-53vdXjMkrxQJWytfHhi5TK.html

Biden, who is just days away from his inauguration, called it disorder and not dissent.“Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it’s disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now,” Biden said on Twitter. Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it's disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now.“Today is a reminder, a painful one, that democracy is fragile.

07-01-2021||World||World leaders are appalled by storming of US Capitol||Leaders around the world condemned the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump on Wednesday, expressing shock at the chaos unfolding in a country they once relied upon for global leadership.“Disgraceful scenes in US Congress,” tweeted Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, a staunch ally of the United States over generations. “The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.”Other allies were similarly appalled at what they described as an attack on American democracy, though some said they believed US democratic institutions would withstand the turmoil. Some leaders singled out Trump for harsh criticism.Click here for live updates US Capitol breach“Trump and his supporters should finally accept the decision of the American voters and stop trampling on democracy,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas wrote on Twitter. “From inflammatory words come violent deeds.” He added that “contempt for democratic institutions has disastrous effects.”“The beauty of democracy?” with a shrug emoji was the reaction tweeted by Bashir Ahmad, a personal assistant to the president of Nigeria, which has seen several coups since independence — including one led decades ago by President Muhammadu Buhari, who most recently entered the office via a vote.Chilean President Sebastián Piñera and Colombian President Iván Duque were among those in Latin America who denounced the protesters, but both also said they were confident that American democracy and the rule of law would prevail.“In this sad episode in the US, supporters of fascism showed their real face: anti-democratic and aggressive,’‘ tweeted Luis Roberto Barroso, Brazilian Supreme Court justice and the head of the country’s electoral court. He said he hoped “American society and institutions react with vigor to this threat to democracy.’‘Venezuela, which is under US sanctions, said the events in Washington show that the US “is suffering what it has generated in other countries with its politics of aggression.”Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has survived US-backed opposition efforts to oust him despite accusations of human rights abuses, civil unrest and a humanitarian crisis that has forced millions to flee the oil-rich country.In Puerto Rico, many people took to social media and joked that the US territory no longer wanted statehood. Independence, they said, looked appealing for the first time in decades.In fact, it was that pursuit of independence that marked one of the last times the US Congress was stormed violently. Four members of Puerto Rico’s Nationalist Party opened fire on the House floor in March 1954, wounding five lawmakers.Italians watched the events with shock, having always considered the US to be the model of democracy and the country that rescued Italy after its fascist descent during World War II.“This is the widely anticipated outcome of Trumpism,” tweeted a retired Italian center-left politician, Pierluigi Castagnetti. “And unfortunately it won’t end today. When politics is replaced by deception and fanaticism of the people the drift is inevitable.”European Parliament President David Sassoli, who leads one of the largest legislatures in the world, also denounced the scenes at the Capitol. The European Union has spent four cantankerous years dealing with the Trump administration, and its top officials have repeatedly said they are looking forward to a better relationship under President-elect Joe Biden.“This is insurrection. Nothing less. In Washington,” tweeted Carl Bildt, a former prime minister of Sweden.Turkey, a NATO ally that has sometimes been at odds with Washington, expressed concern over the images of angry Trump supporters trying to thwart the certification of Biden as the new president. The chaos forced lawmakers to be rushed from the building.A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement urged all parties in the United States to use “moderation and common sense.”“We believe that the United States will overcome this domestic political crisis with maturity,” the ministry said.The ministry statement also urged Turkish citizens in the United States to stay away from crowds and demonstrations.Trump issued a restrained call for peace well after the melee was underway but did not immediately ask supporters to disperse. Later, he urged them to go home and called them “very special people.”Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was “deeply disturbed” by the events in the US, Canada’s closest ally and neighbor.“Violence will never succeed in overruling the will of the people. Democracy in the US must be upheld — and it will be,” Trudeau tweeted.Volkan Bozkir, president of the 193-member United Nations General Assembly, said he was saddened by the developments. But, he tweeted, ″I believe that peace & respect for democratic processes will prevail in our host country at this critical time.”Polish President Andrzej Duda, who twice visited Trump at the White House and hosted him in Poland, said on Twitter that his country had “full confidence in the power of American democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-leaders-are-appalled-by-storming-of-us-capitol/story-WYNwRsjdo57xBgiVKMHzdL.html

Facebook’s vice president of integrity Guy Rosen tweeted the social media company believed the video “contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence,” saying the action was part of “appropriate emergency measures.”Google-owned YouTube said the video violated its policy against content that alleges “widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 US Election.” YouTube spokesman Farshad Shadloo added the company does allow copies that include additional context. Click here for live updates of US Capitol breach Twitter Inc restricted users from retweeting the video “due to a risk of violence,” as hundreds of protesters sought to force Congress to undo the president’s election loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.Twitter also restricted a later tweet from Trump, again falsely alleging he had won the election.Social media companies have been under pressure to police misinformation on their platforms around the election. Trump and his allies have continuously spread unsubstantiated claims of election fraud that have proliferated online.In a statement on Wednesday, the Anti-Defamation League called for social media companies to suspend Trump’s accounts, saying the events at the Capitol resulted from “fear and disinformation that has been spewed directly from the Oval Office.”Also Read | Woman shot at US Capitol has died: PoliceFormer Facebook security chief Alex Stamos tweeted: “Twitter and Facebook have to cut him off. There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won’t do it.”A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.According to researchers and public postings, violent rhetoric and advice on weaponry ramped up significantly in the past three weeks on many social media platforms as multiple groups planned rallies for Wednesday, including Trump supporters, white nationalists and enthusiasts of the wide-ranging conspiracy theory QAnon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-youtube-pull-trump-video-after-protesters-storm-us-capitol/story-s9sjE1HfIeEnwSRaBRwIJI.html

07-01-2021||World||Woman shot at US Capitol has died: Police||A woman has died after being shot on Wednesday during the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, a spokeswoman for the Washington police department said.No other details were available, the spokeswoman said. It remained unclear who shot the woman, but a witness said the shooting occurred after law enforcement authorities urged people to “get back.”Hundreds of Trump supporters entered the Capitol building on Wednesday in a bid to overturn his election defeat, forcing Congress to postpone a session that would have certified Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the Nov. 3 election.A protester from New Jersey told Washington CBS affiliate WUSA he witnessed the woman being shot at the Capitol after police and other law enforcement officials warned people to get back.“Well, we had stormed into the chambers inside, and there was a young lady who rushed to the windows; a number of police and Secret Service were saying, ‘Get back, get down, get out of the way,’“ he said. “She didn’t heed the call and as we kind of raced up to grab people and pull them back, they shot her in the neck, and she fell back on me.”The man told the local television station he saw blood coming from the woman’s mouth and neck and nose.“It could have been me, but she went first,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-shot-at-us-capitol-has-died-police/story-vOtxdBoWRpFG1o18JvCaBI.html
07-01-2021||World||China plays down concern after WHO’s rare rebuke||China played down on Wednesday World Health Organization (WHO) concern about a delay in authorisation for a visit by team of experts looking into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, saying arrangements were being worked out.The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Tuesday he was “very disappointed” that China had not authorised the entry of the team for the investigation, which he said was a WHO priority. “We are eager to get the mission underway as soon as possible,” he said. The coronavirus disease was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and has since spread around the world.Much remains unknown about its origins and China has been sensitive about any suggestion it could have done more in the early stages of the pandemic to stop it.Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, told a regular news briefing in Beijing that the problem was “not just about visas” for the team.Asked about reports that the dates had been agreed upon, she said there had been a “misunderstanding” and the two sides were still in discussions over the timing and other arrangements and “remain in close communication”.“There’s no need to overinterpret this,” she said. China’s experts were also busy dealing with a renewed spurt of coronavirus infections, with many locations entering a “wartime footing” to stop the virus, she said.The delay by Chinese authorities fuels concern that Beijing is obstructing international efforts to trace the origins of a pandemic that has now killed over 1.8 million people worldwide.The 10-strong team of international experts had been due to set off in early January as part of a long-awaited mission to investigate early cases of the disease.China has been seeking to shape the narrative about when and where the pandemic began, with senior diplomat Wang Yi saying “more and more studies” showed that it emerged in multiple regions. WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan has previously called this “highly speculative”. China has also dismissed criticism of its handling of early cases although some including US President Donald Trump have questioned its actions during the outbreak.The WHO, too, has been criticised for being too deferential to China through the course of the pandemic, and has been blamed by other countries for initially downplaying the severity of the crisis. Trump said last year that the superpower would terminate its relationship with the WHO unless it “demonstrated independence” from China. The US President also called for a “transparent” investigation and criticised the terms under which Chinese experts conducted a first phase of research.The mission is due to be led by Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO’s top expert on animal diseases that cross the species barrier, who went to China on a preliminary mission last July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-plays-down-concern-after-who-s-rare-rebuke/story-W2MwbhKTzt1Gfv8tt2PAvL.html
07-01-2021||World||Democrats on the brink of US Senate control||Democrats won one hotly contested US Senate race in Georgia on Wednesday and pulled ahead in a second, edging closer to control of the chamber and the power to advance Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s policy goals when he takes office this month.Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock beat Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, TV networks and Edison Research projected. Democrat Jon Ossoff held a narrow lead over Republican David Perdue in the other race, with a final outcome not expected until later on Wednesday.With 98% reporting, Warnock was ahead of Loeffler by 1.2 percentage points, roughly 50,000 votes, according to Edison Research. Ossoff on Wednesday claimed victory on Wednesday morning as he held a slight lead of about 16,000 votes in a race that was still too close for major news organisations to call. “It is with humility that I thank the people of Georgia for electing me to serve you in the United States Senate,” Ossoff said in a video statement.Democrats must win both contests to take control of the Senate. A Democratic sweep would create a 50-50 split in the Senate and give vice president-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, the tie-breaking vote after she and Biden take office on January 20. The party already has a narrow majority in the US House of Representatives.If Republicans hold the second seat, they will effectively wield veto power over Biden’s political and judicial appointees as well as many of his legislative initiatives in areas such as economic relief from the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, healthcare and criminal justice.Most of the votes remaining to be counted were in counties Biden won in November, with roughly 13,000 votes still to be counted in Democratic-leaning DeKalb County near Atlanta, according to Edison Research estimates, fuelling Democratic optimism about an astounding Georgia sweep. No Democrat had won a US Senate race in Georgia in 20 years. But it could take days to get the final tally, as thousands of military and overseas ballots can still be counted as late as Friday. The narrow results will almost certainly spark legal challenges or recounts that also could delay a final determination of Senate control.“We were told that we couldn’t win this election. But tonight, we proved that with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible,” Warnock, a Baptist preacher, told supporters in a livestream message.“I am going to the Senate to work for all of Georgia, no matter who you cast your vote for in this election.”Warnock will become Georgia’s first Black US senator and Ossoff, at 33, would be the Senate’s youngest member if he wins. The critical races drew an estimated 4.5 million voters -- a record for a runoff -- along with nearly half a billion dollars in advertising spending since November 3 and visits on Monday by Republican President Donald Trump and Biden.Even if they manage to secure a slim Senate majority, Biden and Democrats could find it difficult to advance some legislative priorities in the Senate, where most bills need to clear a 60-vote procedural threshold in the 100-seat chamber. The head-to-head runoff elections in Georgia, a quirk of state law, became necessary when no candidate in either race drew more than 50% of the vote in November’s general election.Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger said election officials would take a break overnight but resume counting on Wednesday morning. “Hopefully by noon we’ll have a better idea where we are,” he said on CNN. Perdue is a former Fortune 500 executive who has served one Senate term. Loeffler, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, was appointed a year ago to fill the seat of a retiring senator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-on-the-brink-of-us-senate-control/story-GmwIjgETg6tYW3rpP0nC6H.html
07-01-2021||World||Explainer: How Democrats won Georgia’s two Senate runoffs||The Associated Press on Wednesday declared Democrat Jon Ossoff the winner of his US Senate runoff election, the second such seat captured by the party in twin contests that were held in Georgia on Tuesday.Earlier in the day, the AP declared Democrat Raphael Warnock the winner of the other race.The two victories will give Democrats control of the Senate for the next two years.Here’s a look at the contests:WHY AP DECLARED OSSOFF THE WINNEROssoff held a lead of about 25,000 votes, or about 0.56 percentage points, over Republican David Perdue out of about 4.4 million cast when the AP called the race at 4:20 p.m. Wednesday.The call was made after an analysis of outstanding ballots showed there was no way for Perdue, who was seeking a second term, to overtake Ossoff’s lead.Tens of thousands of outstanding votes remain to be counted, but the vast majority were in six Democratic-leaning counties that Ossoff was winning.Many of the ballots left to be counted were mail votes, a form of voting that overwhelmingly favored Ossoff. The remaining votes left to be counted in Republican-leaning areas that favored Perdue were not enough for him to catch up.Georgia elections officials said there were about 14,000 outstanding overseas and military ballots that had been issued but not returned. Those must be received by Friday in order to be counted. Gabriel Sterling, a top Georgia elections official, said they expected only a fraction of those ballots would be returned in time.WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER RACE?Warnock defeated Loeffler after an analysis of outstanding votes showed there was no way for Loeffler to catch up to him with the remaining ballots left to be counted in Republican-leaning areas.Warnock held a lead over Loeffler of about about 1.2 percentage points, or about 62,000 votes as of 4:15 p.m. ET Wednesday, an edge that is likely to grow as more votes are tabulated.Almost all the votes left to be counted statewide were mail ballots and early in-person votes. Of those, most are in Democratic-leaning counties.Warnock was winning mail ballots by 68%, according to an AP analysis conducted early Wednesday morning. And most of the early in-person votes left to be counted were in DeKalb County; that method of voting in the county favored Warnock by about 70 percentage points.WHAT’S AT STAKEThe outcomes of the two races will help determine the country’s political trajectory over the next two years. With Democrats winning both races, they will have a 50-50 seat split with Republicans in the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris poised to cast tie-breaking votes.That would enable President-elect Joe Biden to enact an agenda that includes liberal priorities like raising the minimum wage, approving additional economic stimulus to combat the effects of the pandemic and expanding health care.But Republicans need to carry only one of the seats to hold a slim 51-49 majority that could serve as a conservative bulwark to limit Biden’s ambitions.The fact that Georgia will determine which of these two dueling visions could become reality speaks to its recent emergence as a swing state. Georgia has been a Republican stronghold for decades, like much of the rest of the South. These two elections are testing just how much the state has changed.Georgia’s government is dominated by the GOP. Until Warnock, a Democrat hadn’t won a U.S. Senate contest in the state since former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller in 2000. And until Biden won it by just under 12,000 votes in November, a Democratic presidential contender hadn’t carried the state since Bill Clinton in 1992.But it has slowly morphed into a battleground — a change driven in part by demographic shifts, particularly in the economically vibrant area of metropolitan Atlanta.As older, white, Republican-leaning voters die, they’ve been replaced by a younger and more racially diverse cast of people, many of whom moved to the Atlanta area from other states — and carried their politics with them.Overall, demographic trends show that the state’s electorate is becoming younger and more diverse each year. Like other metro areas, Atlanta’s suburbs have also moved away from Republicans. In 2016, Hillary Clinton flipped both Cobb and Gwinnett counties. Four years later, electoral maps showed a sea of blue in the more than half-dozen counties surrounding Atlanta.In 2018, Democrat Stacey Abrams galvanized Black voters in her bid to become the country’s first African American woman to lead a state, a campaign she narrowly lost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-how-democrats-won-georgia-s-two-senate-runoffs/story-8iImh07Ik5ZcmDKbGMLz2L.html

US lawmakers were asked to shelter in place and made to wear gas masks for use in case law enforcement officials used tear gas to clear the protesters. Police later responded with drawn guns and tear gas in a bid to evacuate the House of Representatives and the Senate after pro-Trump protesters marched through the halls of congress. The protestors reached the congress building in Capitol Hill from a rally nearby, where they had heard Trump rail against his election defeat and air false, baseless allegations of election fraud that have been rejected by more than 60 courts, including three times by the US Supreme Court. The entire US congress complex was put in lockdown and Washington DC officials declared curfew to disperse the protesters, but it had no immediate impact on the crowds still swirling in and around the building. Trump called for peace but after the supporters had stormed the building, in a potentially dangerous situations for lawmakers inside. While Pence, who presided over the joint session of congress, had been escorted from the senate, visuals showed protesters sitting in his chair. The incoming vice-president Kamala Harris was also reportedly in the building. “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful,” Trump tweeted, but said no more, despite calls from allies and former aides to issue a specific call for the protesters to stand down. Some protesters were armed, according to reports that also indicated armed standoffs between them and law enforcement personnel. A few of them had reached the well of the US senate in a major breach of security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-person-shot-inside-us-capitol-after-trump-supporters-storm-building/story-YyzF4PTFDn2eEO2l7ymtkK.html

Police confirmed 53 people - including a US citizen - were arrested for “subversion” in an early morning operation that involved about 1,000 officers. The charges were sparked by an attempt by opposition groups last year to win a majority in the city’s partially-elected legislature. Hong Kong’s security chief John Lee described the arrests as “necessary” and aimed at a group of people who tried to “sink Hong Kong into an abyss” and “overthrow the government”.Britain has criticised the arrests, accusing China of deceiving citizens about the true purpose of its security law. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab called the detentions “a grievous attack on Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms”.Germany also condemned the crackdown. Foreign minister Heiko Maas said, “China is deviating further from the commitments it made to Hong Kongers and the international community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hk-arrests-53-oppn-figures-sparks-outcry/story-JECs0SPqfpd6iwqsML3sBP.html

Trump falsely claimed that he won the election as he spoke on an outdoor stage framing the White House. Crowds gathered at the “Save America March” wore Trump-approved red baseball caps and cheered as Trump repeated the groundless conspiracy theories that have consumed his final days in office. “You don’t concede when there’s theft involved,” Trump said. “Our country has had enough and we will not take it any more.”Weeks have passed since the states completed certifying that Biden, a Democrat, won the election by 306 Electoral College votes to Trump’s 232, and Trump’s extraordinary challenges to Biden’s victory have floundered in courts across the country. Congress was due to confirm Biden’s victory on Wednesday. Many of Trump’s fellow Republicans have promised a stonewalling effort that was certain to fail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-disagrees-after-donald-trump-denies-he-lost/story-JQWN9O41G9vbacG1uI4ocK.html
07-01-2021||World||Moderna vaccine gets EU’s approval||The European Union’s medicines watchdog on Wednesday approved a second coronavirus vaccine, in a relief to struggling European countries as the world reached a grim new record of 15,700 deaths in the last 24 hours.The Moderna vaccine is now set to join Pfizer-BioNTech’s jab for use in the 27-nation EU, where governments are grappling with soaring caseloads and slow roll-outs of the vaccines already available. “Good news for our efforts to bring more Covid-19 vaccines to Europeans!” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen tweeted.The breakthrough came as more than 15,700 Covid-19 deaths around the world were registered in the past 24 hours, according to a count by AFP - a new record.The United States, the world’s worst-hit country, logged a record 3,936 daily coronavirus deaths in a separate tally maintained by the US-based Johns Hopkins University. In Portugal, health authorities reported 10,000 new cases in 24 hours in the nation of just 10 million people.Mass vaccinations are seen as key to returning the world to a semblance of normality, but the EU’s campaign has got off to a sluggish start compared to the US, Britain and Israel. The Netherlands administered its first shot on Wednesday, becoming the last EU country to get started.As it recorded 1,041 new virus deaths, the most since late April, UK returned to a full lockdown on Wednesday. Authorities are battling to contain the alarming spread of a new coronavirus strain that appears to be more infectious. One in 50 people in England were infected last week, according to official data, rising to one in 30 in London.The global crisis shows no signs of slowing, with more than 1.8 million people known to have died worldwide among some 86mn cases.Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, announced on Tuesday that it was toughening its partial lockdown and extending measures such as store closures until the end of January.Along with other leaders, such as France’s Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations from critics that her government should be rolling out vaccines much faster in order to spare people from more disruption to virtually every aspect of their lives.Concerns are also growing over the new coronavirus strains first located in Britain and South Africa, which have since been detected in dozens of other countries. While there is no evidence so far that available vaccines will prove less effective against them, the increased transmissibility of the new variants has officials worried that their spread will outstrip the rate at which they are able to protect people.The Cannes, the world’s biggest film festival, may be moved to the summer this year from its usual May date because of the Covid-19 crisis, organisers said on Wednesday.The festival, originally scheduled to be held from May 11 to 22, “will certainly take place in 2021”, a spokeswoman told AFP, but could be postponed to a time between the end of June and the end of July.The festival was cancelled last year, while rival European events in Berlin and Venice went ahead under strict health restrictions. Organisers still need some time “to evaluate the situation at the start of the year” before making a decision, the Cannes spokeswoman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-gets-eu-s-approval/story-FSOUtfaqwUTKRJhwdqAhjK.html

An announcement was played inside the Capitol as lawmakers were meeting and expected to vote to affirm Biden’s victory.Due to an “external security threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recording said. Both chambers abruptly went into recess. The skirmishes occurred outside in the very spot where president-elect Biden will be inaugurated in just two weeks. Protesters tore down metal barricades at the bottom of the Capitols steps and were met by officers in riot gear.Some tried to push past the officers who held shields and officers could be seen firing pepper spray into the crowd to keep them back. Some in the crowd were shouting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back. A suspicious package was also reported in the area, Capitol Police said. The skirmishes came just shortly after Trump addressed thousands of his supporters, riling up the crowd with his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally near the White House on Wednesday ahead of Congress’ vote. “We will not let them silence your voices,” Trump told the protesters, who had lined up before sunrise to get a prime position to hear the president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-locked-down-as-trump-supporters-clash-with-police-security-breach-reported/story-D7RzT0lFAUvnqQkwPxxCAN.html

The Hindu temple was vandalised and set ablaze by a mob of hundreds on December 30, sparking an outcry.Pakistan’s chief justice Gulzar Ahmed, who had taken suo motu notice of the attack, gave the ruling after minority lawmaker Ramesh Kumar briefed him about the temple being vandalised during their meeting in Karachi last week.The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and Auqaf department have been directed to start the work immediately and submit a progress report in two weeks. The chief justice also observed that the people who vandalised the temple should pay for its restoration. The court has also asked for reports on the number of temples in Pakistan, encroachment on land belonging to the Auqaf department, and the steps taken by the authorities against land grab. All temples in Pakistan come under the Auqaf department.Earlier, Muhammad Shoaib Suddle, a former police chief and one-man commission on the rights of minorities at the Supreme Court, submitted a report on the vandalism. The commission recommended a comprehensive investigation into the vandalism of the temple. Maulvi Sharif, the main suspect in the case, is believed to have incited people to carry out violence, the report said. It added that the record of the temple land at the time of Partition should be looked into.The report also recommended that the home department should take steps to stop the entry of suspicious people inside the temple. Exemplary punishment should be handed out to suspects to prevent such incidents in the future, the report recommended.The temple was first attacked and demolished in 1997. After intervention by the Supreme Court in 2015, the local community had agreed to its reconstruction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/restore-temple-in-2-weeks-pak-sc/story-bvbIYgRoI83fNOWwhUjRfO.html

But Trump had persisted, openly calling for his deputy to “come through”.Congress started the process of certification as scheduled on Wednesday afternoon and will continue for hours as the president’s Republican allies will attempt to have the election overthrown, knowing they will fail.The development came on the sidelines of a tense runoff contest in the state of Georgia, where the two parties were battling for two Senate seats up for grabs, which would eventually determine who controls the Senate.A Democratic candidate was projected to win one of the two runoff elections in the state, while and a fellow party nominee expanded his lead in the second race on Wednesday, setting up a likely defeat for the Republicans in their stronghold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-breaks-with-donald-trump-as-congress-meets-to-certify-joe-biden-s-win/story-CLtLb8yeljcW1KGPgsD2cP.html

He says no||Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed his inability to visit members of the Hazara community who have refused to bury 11 miners killed by Islamic State, even as protests against the killing spread to other parts of Pakistan. Khan on Wednesday urged the protesting members of Balochistan’s Shia Hazara community to bury the bodies of the miners killed in a brutal attack in Mach coalfield, promising he would visit them “very soon”.“I want to reassure the Hazara families who lost their loved ones in a brutal terrorist attack in Machh that I am cognisant of their suffering & their demands,” he tweeted, adding that the government was taking steps to prevent such attacks in the future. He claimed he knew that “our neighbour is instigating this sectarian terrorism.”He added: “I share your pain and have come to you before also to stand with you in your time of suffering. I will come again very soon to offer prayers and condole with all the families personally.” “I will never betray my people’s trust. Please bury your loved ones so their souls find peace.”But this assurance has not helped in any way, said protestors. Several roads in Karachi were blocked on Wednesday as protests continued for a second day.The Majlis-i-Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) has insisted that they want Khan to visit Quetta where the dead bodies have been placed as part of the protest and give assurances for the safety of the community. The MWM also held protests in Karachi and Quetta on Tuesday that were attended by hundreds of men, women and children. A number of Shia organisations have taken part in the protests which are demanding measures to ensure the safety of the Shia Hazara community.On Wednesday evening, the MWM said that it would extend the protests to other cities in Pakistan. Sunday’s attack was the first major assault on members of the Hazara community since April last year, when a suicide bombing in a market killed 18, most of whom were Hazaras. There have been constant attacks on members of the community by militant groups. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Sunday attack. IS, Taliban and other Sunni extremist groups are known to have carried out attacks targeting the community. In 2013, three bombings killed more than 200 people in Hazara neighbourhoods in Quetta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hazara-refuse-to-bury-slain-miners-protest-spreads-in-pakistan/story-qxansmqA7SQT0qXM7D9MnK.html

The ordinance signed by the President Ram Nath Kovind, amending section 13 and 88 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act 2019, and issued by the ministry of law stated that the members of IAS, IPS and IFoS for the existing cadre of Jammu and Kashmir will now become part of AGMUT (Arunachal, Goa, Mizoram and Union Territories) cadre. The officers from these UTs can now be placed in J&K and vice-versa. According to the ordinance, “all future allocations of All India Services for the UT of J&K and UT of Ladakh shall be made to AGMUT cadre for which necessary modifications may be made in corresponding cadre rules by the Centre”. This J&K cadre of All India services had stopped inducting new officers after the government had recategorised the erstwhile state into two UTs – J&K and Ladakh after scrapping Article 370, which gave the state somewhat special status, on August 5, 2019. The merger of J&K cadre into AGMUT was delayed till now as officials had sought clarification on seniority and nature of posting etc, according to an official at the Centre. J&K is considered to be a ‘hard posting’ for government officials. The ordinance will pave the way for officials from Delhi and other UTs to be posted as District Magistrates, Superintendents of Police, or Director General and other important capacities. It is not clear yet whether this number of officers who can be posted in J&K from other UTs will be limited and what will be the duration of their term. The rules regarding the tenure duration etc will be included in the rules, which will be prepared by the ministry of home affairs (MHA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-cadre-of-all-india-services-merged-with-agmut/story-ug1jcyxIMcBmtCr7j6IxxL.html

Senior advocate Satish Chandra Mishra, appearing for BSP, said that the merger of the six MLAs with Congress cannot be recognised as past rulings of the SC have clearly held that for this to be true, there should be a split in the party at the national level. “Only then, one-third of party members can merge with any political party,” Mishra said. “We will issue notice,” the bench said while seeking responses, including from the Assembly secretary as well as the six MLAs.Six MLAs of the BSP had merged with the Congress giving a boost to the Ashok Gehlot government as the tally of the Congress increased to over 100 in the House of 200 MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notices-on-plea-against-merger-of-6-bsp-mlas-with-cong/story-akQjpN2uLuJ9ANcAqOB5HP.html

07-01-2021||India||Kerala assembly session to commence on Friday||Sparks are expected to fly in the final session of the present Kerala Assembly commencing on Friday with the opposition Congress-led UDF set to attack the CPI(M)-led Left Front government on various issues including corruption allegations.Adhering to strict Covid-19 protocols, the Assembly session will commence with the customary address by Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan.The Assembly had recently met for a one-day special session on December 31 and passed a unanimous resolution seeking scrapping of the three contentious farm laws passed by the centre.Though the Governor had at first turned down the Left government’s plea to convene the House on December 23 for discussing the agri laws, against which farmers have been agitating on Delhi borders for over a month, the session was held on December 31 after the clarifications sought by him were furnished.The last budget of the CPI(M)-led LDF government, which would be vote on account, will be presented by Finance Minister Thomas Isaac on January 15.The session will conclude on January 28.The LDF government, which is hoping to break the jinx and ride back to power for a second term, is expected to line up new proposals and projects for the state’s development, launch people-friendly schemes, besides announcing sops for various sections with an eye on the assembly elections due by April-May this year.The opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) will ensure that the final session will not be a cakewalk for the LDF and will hit out at the government on various issues, including the gold smuggling case in which M Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary of Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, now under suspension, is among the accused.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala told P T I that the UDF will “expose” the government in this last session.“This is the most corrupt government”, he alleged.Besides the gold smuggling case, irregularities in the Life Mission project at Wadakancherry are among the various corruption allegations which are likely to be raised by the opposition, which has already served a notice seeking removal of the Speaker, P Sreeramakrishnan after his name cropped up in the smuggling case.Assembly sources said all arrangements have been made for the legislators to undergo antigen testing from 7 AM at the Assembly premises on January 8, 11 and 18.The members, who will be provided N-95 masks and gloves, will undergo thermal scanning before entering the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assembly-session-to-commence-on-friday/story-wcNaIoS1BQAeSCcWuPnPvO.html
07-01-2021||India||SC issues notice on plea to bar turncoat lawmakers from contesting bypolls||The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notice to the Centre and Election Commission to examine whether lawmakers who resign to topple an elected government and later join hands with the rival political faction for the lure of ministerial berths should attract disqualification under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued notice on a petition filed by Jaya Thakur, a social activist from Madhya Pradesh, who demanded that a six-year ban should be imposed on such political turncoats in view of the recent trend emerging from the states of Madhya Pradesh as recently as in March 2020 and Karnataka in 2019. Thakur, in her petition filed through advocate Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “The object of the Tenth Schedule (inserted in the Constitution in 1985) was to curb the evil of political defections motivated by lure of office or other similar consideration which endanger the foundations of our democracy. Evil of the political defection has been a matter of national concern. Therefore, now time has come that a defector should be debarred for a period of six year, so that corrupt practice must be discouraged.” The petition also demanded that any person who gives up membership of the party should be barred from holding any office of a Minister or any other remunerative political post until the term of the House expires. “Politicians including political parties find out a new path to defeat the motive of the Tenth Schedule by giving resignation from an elected post and choose to join the ruling party and take ministerial post or any other public office by contesting bye-elections within six month at the cost of the public exchequer. It is necessary to ban such type of people for up to six years from contesting elections and debar them from holding any public office,” the petition said.The petition cited the recent example of Madhya Pradesh where 22 rebel members of the state Assembly belonging to the Congress resigned to topple the Kamal Nath government in the state. Later, they contested the bye-elections and got re-elected from the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). Some of them joined as ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.The petition also gave the example of Karnataka where 10 out of 17 members of legislative Assembly (MLA) in the state resigned or stood disqualified for anti-party activities in 2019. Later, on getting re-elected, the BS Yeddyurappa government gave ministerial berths to 10 such MLAs.Senior advocate Anoop G Chaudhary who argued for Thakur told the Court, “MLAs, MPs contesting the election at the public exchequer’s cost cannot resign for personal benefits with ulterior motive. They are defeating the law laid down by the Parliament in the Tenth Schedule, later upheld by the Supreme Court in the Kihoti Hollohan case of 1992.”The Tenth Schedule lays down the process by which legislators may be disqualified on grounds of defection by the Presiding Officer of a legislature based on a petition by any other member of the House. A legislator is deemed to have defected if he either voluntarily gives up the membership of his party or disobeys the party whip on voting.The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, agreed to issue notice on the petition to both the Centre and the Election Commission. Since a petition raising similar issue is already pending before the Court in a case titled Lok Prahari v Union of India, the Court tagged Thakur’s petition to be heard along with that case. Chaudhary requested the Court for an early date citing elections in several states but the bench refused to assign any date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-on-plea-to-bar-turncoat-lawmakers-from-contesting-bypolls/story-pHvjPSD3pIGjonu0tYTdBK.html
07-01-2021||India||Ahead of 2nd dry run, Centre says vaccine delivery shortly; alerts 4 states as Covid-19 cases spike||The Union health ministry has informed all states and union territories that the first supply of Covid-19 vaccine will be dispatched shortly. On Friday, the second phase of nationwide vaccine dry run will be taken up by all states and UTs except Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh as they have already conducted dry run in all districts.States like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal will receive their supply of vaccines by suppliers. While other 18 states and UTs Andaman and the Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Daman and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura and Uttarakhand, will receive their vaccines from their respective government medical store depots.Though preparation is on for rolling out the vaccination drive, Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh are worrying, the health minister said. The ministry on Thursday wrote to these three states and West Bengal to check the sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in these states.Interacting with the state health ministers regarding the dry run, Harsh Vardhan asked them to submit their inputs after the dry run gets completed. Kerala health minister KK Shailaja raised the issue whether doctors who are practising only in private will be registered for first phase vaccination etc. There is a confusion over the cost of the immunisation drive as well. While priority groups will get the vaccine free, the Centre has not yet spelt out whether the state governments will have to pay for the doses.Like the last round of dry run held on January 2, tomorrow too the districts will identify three types of sessions for the mock drive: district hospital, medical college/private health facility, urban/rural outreach. The steps of a dry run include beneficiary registration, micro-planning, vaccination and the Union minister emphasised that the site organisers will have to hold review meetings after the session to gather feedback. There will be four types of officers deployed at a site. Vaccinator officers include doctors, staff nurses, pharmacists who are legally authorised to give injections. Then there will be vaccine officer 1 including police, home guard, civil defence, NCC, NSS to check the registration status of a beneficiary. Then there will be vaccine officer 2 who will verify documents. Vaccine officers 3 and 4 will manage the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-2nd-dry-run-centre-says-vaccine-delivery-shortly-alerts-4-states-as-covid-19-cases-spike/story-CPwfJRYKG4DAEDjJ3nw1yI.html
07-01-2021||India||NGT stops activity in 436 acres in Bhubaneswar for lack of forest clearance||The National Green Tribunal has halted further activity across 436 acres of forest land in one of the prime areas of Bhubaneswar having hotels, government and corporate offices citing lack of forest diversion clearance.“In view of the acknowledged encroachment of forest land and, diversion of forest land having been undertaken without obtaining the mandatory clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, we are of the firm view that no further activity shall be taken up without first complying with the requirements of law,” ordered the NGT bench of justice SP Wangdi and expert member Saibal Dasgupta referring to the 436 acres of land marked as Forest Category (Jungle II) in government records.The NGT bench further said that if the state government allows violation of the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, then the Ministry of Forest MoEF&CC can take appropriate action under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003 against those responsible for permitting such violations. It also directed the state government, the Divisional Forest Officer and the MoEF&CC before the next hearing on February 19.The January 5 order was uploaded on the NGT’s website on Thursday.The NGT order came in response to a petition filed by Bhubaneswar-based activist Subash Mohapatra in 2019 challenging the inaction of the state government in checking the illegal and unauthorized use of 568 acres of revenue forest land (Jungle II Kisam) in Khata No 1427 of Jaydev Vihar Mouza in Bhubaneswar for non-forestry purpose. Mohapatra in his petition to the NGT had said that 44 institutions had set up hotels, corporate offices, a school and hospitals without applying for diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. Hotels like Mayfair, Trident, Swosti Plaza, Sandy’s Towers and Suryansh and offices like Tech Mahindra, Nalco, Employees Insurance Corporation and Loyola School have come up on these lands over the last three decades. A CAG report in 2012 had first flagged the alleged violation of the FC Act by some of these entities.Under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, forest areas can be diverted by the environment ministry for non-forestry purposes. In lieu of the land, money is collected by the government which is then used by the authorities for afforestation.After Mohapatra filed his petition, the NGT in May 2019 had formed a committee comprising district collector and Divisional Forest Officer of Khurda to ascertain the veracity of his allegations and to take action in accordance with law if any of the alleged violations were found to be correct.The committee in its report had informed the NGT that huge tracts of forest land were diverted for non-forest activities by various institutions without obtaining necessary clearances under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. It also said that the state government had asked 44 central and state Government, central and state undertakings and private institutions situated on the forest land to file proposals for diversion of forest land for non-forestry use and to obtain necessary clearances from the MoEF&CC. However, out of 44 institutions, clearance has been accorded by the MoEF&CC to only three institutions between 2014 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-stops-activity-in-436-acres-in-bhubaneswar-for-lack-of-forest-clearance/story-5bf4zuyAEY7UBCyqI0x7SM.html
07-01-2021||India||Railways extends time to claim refunds for trains cancelled from March-June last year||The Ministry of Railways has extended the time limit for cancellation of counter tickets for train journeys between March 21 and June 30, 2020 from the present six months to nine months in view of the coronavirus crisis. The ministry had earlier extended the facility from three days to six months when the coronavirus pandemic had led to the cancellation of all regular trains.“Ministry of Railways has decided to extend the time limit beyond six months and up to nine months from the date of journey for cancellation of PRS counter tickets and refund of fare across reservation counters for the journey period March 21, 2020 to June 7, 2020. It is applicable only for regular time tabled trains cancelled by Railways,” the ministry said in a statement. “After lapse of six months from the date of journey, many passengers may have deposited the tickets to Claims Office of Zonal Railways through TDR or through general application along with original tickets. Full refund of fare on such PRS counter tickets shall also be allowed for such passengers,” it said. Soon after the lockdown was announced in March and regular train services were suspended due to the pandemic, the time limit for ticket cancellation was extended from three days to three months and in May it was extended to six months. This was done to restrict the number of passengers at counters and prevent transmission of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-extends-time-to-claim-refunds-for-trains-cancelled-from-march-june-last-year/story-sO3Ih1hqGiDccAcPgQVtbK.html
07-01-2021||India||Ahead of FATF meet, Pakistan seeks Maulana Masood Azhar’s arrest; court issues warrant||With its Financial Action Task Force (FATF) review around the corner, Pakistan on Thursday acknowledged the presence of Jaish-e-Mohammad chief – Maulana Masood Azhar on its territory and sought an arrest warrant against him, top officials in the government said. Based on a disclosure made by Pakistani authorities, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) judge at Pakistan’s Gujranwala – Natasha Naseem Supra issued an arrest warrant for Masood Azhar on charges of terror financing and directed that he be produced in court on Friday, they said. This, Indian officials added, is clearly linked to FATF taking up Pakistan’s case in meetings this month and February. JeM was among the groups specifically named by FATF for terror financing in its reports in the past two years. India has already provided evidence on JeM and Azhar’s role in last year’s Pulwama attack, in which 40 personnel of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed, an incident that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Pakistan’s Punjab province moved the court seeking an arrest warrant for Azhar on the charges of ‘raising funds’. The CTD had arrested six JeM terrorists - Muhammad Afzal, Muhammad Amir, Allah Ditta, Muhammad Iftikhar, Muhammad Ajmal and Muhammad Bilal Makki, under pressure after the Pulwama attack. Officials said Azhar’s arrest has been sought in the same case. “The move is to duck the FATF black listing by showing that it is taking action against United Nations listed terrorists. The FATF is taking up Pakistan’s case in meetings scheduled this month and in February. JeM was among the groups specifically named by FATF for terror financing in its reports in past two years,” said an official. Pakistan was placed on the ‘grey-list’ by the financial watchdog in June 2018 and had asked it to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019. The deadline was extended due to Covid-19 pandemic. Azhar’s last location was said to be at a safe-house in Bahawalpur. The CTD had said in a statement last year that it had raided the JeM’s safe house and arrested its members who were collecting funds for JeM. “The suspects were collecting funds to finance activities of JeM. The chargesheet against them has been submitted to the Anti-Terrorism Court Gujranwala and they are being interrogated,” the CTD had said. The UN had, in May 2019, designated Azhar a “global terrorist” after China lifted its hold on a proposal to blacklist the Pakistan-based JeM chief, a decade after New Delhi approached the world body for the first time on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-fatf-meet-pakistan-seeks-maulana-masood-azhar-s-arrest-court-issues-warrant/story-YdD4uhH9T43QEgBXa4BepL.html
07-01-2021||India||PM should talk directly with protesting farmers: Harsimrat Badal||A day before the government’s eighth round of talks with protesting farm unions, SAD leader and former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said the Centre has lost the trust of the entire farming community and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should directly talk to agitating farmers. Expressing her anguish over the pain of farmers, Badal, leader of the ruling BJP’s erstwhile ally, said, “It is strange that farmers are spending nights in open during the chilling winters and even then their demands are falling on deaf ears.” In an interview to PTI, Badal who resigned from Union Cabinet in September last year when the three farm bills were being passed in Lok Sabha, said what farmers have gone through in last six-seven weeks, is the same what she went through when she was a Union Minister. “...To avoid the situation which has arisen now and the protest, I kept pleading for months, whether it was in cabinet meetings or in direct meetings with top leaders of the central government that please listen to farmers before bringing these three bills as they are ‘annadaatas’ of the country, otherwise it would lead to agitations and protests. But my all pleas fell on to deaf ears,” she said. Asking who will be held responsible for deaths of farmers during the protest, Badal said the Centre has lost the trust of farmers across the country. “Farmers are dying at the doorstep of the central government while protesting for their demands. Who will be responsible for deaths of ‘annadaatas’ of the country?” Badal said. Talking about the ongoing meetings between protesting farmers and Centre, Badal said after seven rounds of meetings nothing concrete has come out. “After several rounds of meetings if ministers are unable to resolve the farmers’ issues then Prime Minister Narendra Modi should directly talk to protesting farmers,” Badal said. She also attacked the Congress-led Punjab government and state chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and said he has failed to fulfill his responsibility as guardian of the state and its people. “Both the central and state governments are equal partners in this crime against farmers. While farmers were sitting on dharna, the Chief Minister of Punjab was having fun in his farmhouse. Captain Amarinder Singh has miserably failed to fulfil his responsibilities as chief minister of Punjab and as guardian of its people,” Badal said. Harsimrat Kaur Badal was Union Food Processing Minister in the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre and resigned when the bills were taken up for passage in Lok Sabha. Her husband and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had announced her resignation in the lower house while participating in the debate on the three farm bills.Days later, SAD also moved out of the ruling NDA breaking its decades-old alliance with the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-should-talk-directly-with-protesting-farmers-harsimrat-badal/story-4GqRRadg4zbKIeMzYHVPHN.html
07-01-2021||India||India’s UNSC term critical for New Delhi, Paris, says French President’s top advisor||Emmanuel Bonne, the diplomatic advisor to French President, has called on India for combined initiatives between India and France during India’s tenure at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). “India will be a member of the UN Security Council for 2 years. This will be a critical occasion for both of us to take initiatives whether it’ll be on the Indo-Pacific region or it is about addressing terrorist threats,” he said, as quoted by news agency ANI. On January 4, 2021, India officially began its eighth term as a non-permanent member of the UNSC for a period of two years. France is a permanent member of the security council.Bonne also thanked the Indian government and people for their support to France when the country was “under attack by some leaders in Turkey and Pakistan and in other countries”, a veiled reference to the backlash France received from many nations, including Pakistan and Turkey, after the killing of French teacher Samuel Paty. The French government was condemned for its support to acts that hurt their religious sentiments. “We very much appreciate the support we got not only from your authorities but also from Indian civil society when our country was under attack by some leaders in Turkey and Pakistan and in other countries,” he added. The remarks from Bonne came after his meeting with India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval earlier on Thursday. The meetings were a part of the annual strategic dialogue between India and France, which was confirmed by the ministry of external affairs in its official statement on Wednesday. The ministry also said that the two sides would discuss “wide-ranging bilateral and global issues.”Bilateral ties between India and France have been strengthening recently with India’s purchase of the Rafale jets from French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation. Earlier in December 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up the French President Emmanuel Macron and expressed his support for France’s fight against terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-unsc-term-critical-for-new-delhi-paris-says-french-president-s-top-advisor/story-nmhYXbFsHcpdz46r5lbHEL.html

07-01-2021||India||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot urges PM Modi to restart stalled railway projects||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday urged PM Narendra Modi to restart the sanctioned and stalled railway projects of the state on priority. He said the majority, around 42% of the New Rewari-New Madar section of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC) crosses Rajasthan for Gujarat. “We have demanded that a railway station should be made in Bhiwadi town as it has a Japanese investment zone, the first-of-its-kind in India, with around 6521 industrial units,” he said. Speaking about the virtual inauguration of WDFC by PM Modi, the Rajasthan CM said, “A number of projects of Rajasthan, which were sanctioned and had been started are stalled due to some reasons. The PM should take them up on priority and restart the projects.” Gehlot said projects such as Sarmathura-Gangapur via the Karauli railway line was inaugurated but closed later; the Pushkar-Medta road railway line, and Chauth ka Barwada to Ajmer via Tonk railway line work too have been stalled. “The state had 50% partnership in the Banswar-Dungarpur-Ratlam project, benefitting the tribal area adjoining Gujarat. The state had given around Rs 250 crore and the work had started but later due to some reasons it was stalled. I urge the Centre to resume the work on priority but as the state isn’t in a sound position, the entire expenditure now has to be borne by the Railways,” said the CM. “Oil and Gas is there in Jaisalmer and Barmer – the country’s 20% oil is supplied from Barmer. Now the refinery work has also started. The demand for a rail line to connect the Mundra-Kandla port with Jaisalmer-Barmer is there for the last 40 years, which is justified looking to the future,” said Gehlot. The CM added that the gauge conversion of the Loharu-Sikar-Reengus rail line had been done but the operation of trains has not started yet. Welcoming the PM’s move of giving a major part of the WDFC to Rajasthan, the CM said the state is committed to the cause but how the Delhi–Mumbai industrial corridor will be made and developed along the Delhi-Mumbai Freight Corridor continues to remain a big challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-urges-pm-modi-to-restart-stalled-railway-projects/story-IBBEMOxyGgDvdl9lJY7m2I.html
07-01-2021||India||Sonia Gandhi accuses BJP of profiting off people’s woes as fuel prices soar||Congress leader Sonia Gandhi accused the Narendra Modi-led government of bringing instability in the nation citing the ongoing farmers’ agitation and the rise in fuel prices. She lashed out at the BJP government alleging that petrol and diesel prices are the highest in 73 years because the Centre is trying to make profits ignoring the hardships faced by the citizens.Sonia Gandhi alleged that the government recovered Rs 19,00,000 crore from the country’s citizens by increasing excise duty and denied extending the benefits of the global reduction of oil prices across the globe. Oil prices across the globe hit record lows last year due to the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdowns it brought across several countries and major cities.Sonia Gandhi called the government ‘insensitive’ and alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party is busy profiting from the pandemic instead of extending a helping hand to the masses. “I demand from the government that the rates of excise duty on petrol and diesel be made similar to that during the UPA regime and provide immediate relief to the affected people,” she said in her statement, released by the Congress.Petrol prices on Thursday rose by 23 paise per litre to Rs 84.20 in the Capital, which is among the all-time highest prices recorded. Diesel prices rose by 26 paise to Rs 74.38 in New Delhi.Gandhi also said the nation is facing a crisis and appears to be standing at crossroads for the first time since independence. “The country is standing at the crossroads today for the first time in the history of independent India. On one hand, the country’s ‘annadata’ is standing on the borders of Delhi for the last 44 days in support of their legitimate demands, while the country’s autocratic, insensitive and ruthless BJP government is busy breaking the back of the poor, farmers and middle class,” the statement said.Sonia Gandhi in her statement demanded that the prime minister repeal the newly introduced farm laws. “I once again appeal to the government to repeal the three farm laws immediately and fulfil all the demands of farmers,” Gandhi said.The government is scheduled to meet the farmers’ unions on January 8. The farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders for the last 44 days demanding the repeal of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The farmers’ groups believe that these three laws will affect the procurement under the Minimum Support Price system and allow private and multinational companies to make profits off farmers as it will encourage corporate farming.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-accuses-bjp-of-profiting-off-people-s-woes-as-fuel-prices-soar/story-X6tNMUHqvBUxitpCDwEtGL.html

The Central government on December 31 had notified the appointment of Justice RS Chauhan as the new chief justice of the Uttarakhand high court.

In the affidavit, the government said that during investigation no evidence was found that the accused Nadeem was having ‘any illicit relation with the woman’. Further, during investigation, no evidence was found in support of the allegation that Nadeem was trying for her religious conversion as alleged by the complainant, Akshay Kumar in the FIR.The bench comprising chief justice Govind Mathur and justice SS Shamshery after hearing parties concerned directed the state government to file counter affidavit in the case and fixed January 15 as the next date of hearing in the case. Earlier, on December 18, last year the Allahabad High Court had asked the UP Police to not take any coercive action against the accused, Nadeem, and has tagged his plea, challenging the constitutional validity of the ordinance with other PILs in the matter.Senior Advocate SFA Naqvi representing Nadeem, had argued that the ordinance is ultra vires of the Constitution of India and any criminal proceeding initiated under the provisions of the ordinance should be quashed.Nadeem who is from Haridwar was booked by the UP Police on November 29, last year on a complaint by one Akshay Kumar of Muzaffarnagar.Nadeem had sought quashing of the FIR lodged against him under Sections 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120B (Criminal conspiracy) of IPC and Sections 3 and 5 of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance 2020.It was alleged in the FIR that Nadeem developed an illicit relation with the complainant’s wife with the purpose of converting her religion by marriage and was attempting to convert her by threat as well as by exerting undue pressure.Nadeem has denied all the allegations and asserted that he is a poor labourer who had been falsely implicated in the case by the complainant, merely to avoid payment of some dues which the complainant owed him.On December 31, 2020, charge sheet was filed under section 504 and 506 of Indian Penal Code against Nadeem as it was found during investigation that on an occasion Nadeem had called the woman and threatened to kill her.Regarding a batch of PILs challenging constitutional validity of the ordinance, the state government counsel informed the Court that the Supreme Court has taken cognizance of the matter and has issued notice to the state government.The court adjourned hearing in all the PILs till January 15.A bunch of PILs were filed on the issue claiming that the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 to prohibit religious conversions in the name of ‘love jihad’, impinges upon their fundamental right to choice and the right to change faith.According to the petitioners, the ordinance was violative of citizens’ rights under Article 14 (Right to Equality), 15 (Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, etc.), 21 (Right to life) and 25 (Freedom of conscience, etc.) of the Constitution.The government on Thursday filed an affidavit in response to the batch of PILs challenging its controversial ordinance.The government stated in the affidavit that the ordinance is aimed at preventing any form of unlawful conversion actuated by elements of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement, etc and the Constitution of India abhors any form of forceful conversion particularly in matters of religion. Being a secular State it becomes the foremost duty of the State to protect its citizens from any kind of unlawful or forceful conversion so that the liberty of thought, faith, belief and worship as well as equality of status stands safeguarded thereby assuring the dignity of the individuals.The bunch of PILs were filed by Advocate Saurabh Kumar, Ajit Singh Yadav and Anand Malviya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-evidence-found-up-police-drop-charges-of-religious-conversion-for-marriage/story-NH0mhaXHqN0nNDlYS90cMM.html

New Delhi will have to work with the Biden administration and other democracies to strengthen democracy around the world, Tharoor said. Hundreds of Trump supporters forcefully entered the US Capitol while the Congress was in a session, in a bid to overturn his election defeat. The violence that followed led to the death of four individuals. Tharoor commended the Prime Minister for distancing the Indian government from the violence by standing up for the peaceful and orderly transition of power. He also cautioned that Wednesday’s incident is a solemn reminder. “I don’t believe it should’ve any implications for our bilateral relations with the US but it’s a sobering reminder. PM expressing concern was a good sign, it showed that he and the Govt are distancing themselves from those who believe ‘iss baar bhi Trump sarkar’,” Tharoor told ANI.I don't believe it should've any implication for our bilateral relations with US but it's a sobering reminder.

Bird flu cases have been reported in Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Dilshad Qureshi, a chicken seller at Udaiganj, Lucknow said, “Sales have dropped considerably despite dip in rates. Chicken is now selling at Rs 140 per kg. It was Rs 180 to Rs 200 per kg last week.” Manjeet Singh, wholesaler of eggs in Alambagh said, “Sale of eggs has also dropped by about 20%. In Lucknow, around 2.5 to 3 lakh eggs are sold daily but according to our reports the sale has dropped to just 2 lakh eggs daily.” Meanwhile, the animal husbandry department has divided Lucknow into nine blocks -- Chinhat, Bakshi Ka Talab, Mal, Malihabad, Kakori, Sarojini Nagar, Mohanlalganj, Gosainganj and Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) areas -- to keep an eye on the health of birds being sold in the markets, said nodal officer of the department Dr Tej Singh Yadav. “All inspectors of the animal husbandry department, working at grass roots level, have started contacting chicken sellers to apprise them about the symptoms of bird flu in chickens. The bird starts dying after turning purple in case of bird flu. If the birds are turning purple after death or before death the vendors can call toll free number 18001805141 and a team of animal husbandry department will reach them immediately,” Yadav said.He also said: “The animal husbandry department has written to the forest department to keep an eye on the birds in the forest area, especially crows, sparrows, pigeons, peacocks, etc. These birds also can die due to bird flu.” The chief medical officer (CMO), Lucknow has also been alerted for possible spread of bird flu and asked to store Tamiflu in abundance. The zila panchayat department and police have also been intimated about the possibility of the spread of bird flu.Joint director, animal welfare, LMC Dr Arvind Kumar Rao, said, “We are going to follow all orders of the animal husbandry department. We are in touch with each other and have already started an awareness programme with bird sellers so that they can maintain cleanliness and keep their birds away from any sort of infection.” Dr Yadav has appealed to people not to panic. “They can eat chicken and eggs without any fear. The meat must be properly cooked and eggs properly boiled. People must avoid taking raw egg or meat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poultry-sales-crash-30-in-lucknow-on-the-back-of-bird-flu-scare/story-Lsra6OkS5KvslK0Nf7t8XI.html
07-01-2021||India||Telangana gets additional borrowing permission of Rs 2,508 crore||Telangana has become third state in the country to successfully undertake urban local bodies reform stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, becoming eligible to mobilise additional financial resources of Rs 2,508 crore through open market borrowings.Telangana has now joined Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh which have completed this reform, according to an official statement issued on Thursday.On completion of urban local bodies reform, these three states have been granted additional borrowing permission of Rs 7,406 crore.Reforms in urban local bodies (ULBs) and urban utility reforms are aimed at the financial strenghtening of ULBs in the state and to enable them to provide better public health and sanitation services.Economically rejuvenated ULBs will also be able to create good civic infrastructure.In May last year, the government had enhanced borrowing limit of the states by 2 per cent of their gross state domestic product (GSDP) to meet the challenges posed by Covid-19 pandemic.Half of this special dispensation was linked to undertaking citizen-centric reforms by the states which get permission to raise additional funds equivalent to 0.25 per cent of GSDP on completion of reforms in each sector.The four citizen-centric areas identified for reforms were implementation of One Nation One Ration Card system, ease of doing business reform, urban local body and utility reforms, and power sector reforms.So far, 10 states have implemented the One Nation One Ration Card System, seven states have done ease of doing business reforms and three states have done local body reforms.The total additional borrowing permission issued so far to the states which have done the reforms stands at Rs 54,190 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-gets-additional-borrowing-permission-of-rs-2-508-crore/story-yJ74rd1mCwqSfhconYHr5H.html

India’s neighbours and closest friends would, however, be given the first priority after setting aside the vaccine needed for people in the country, people familiar with the matter said.India had adopted the same format to make Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) available to friendly countries after studies indicated that the anti-malaria drug could be used as a prophylaxis. Besides sending HCQ supplies as assistance, India had commercially supplied half a billion HCQ tablets to 82 countries.India’s commitment to supply 12 million doses of the vaccine to Nepal, which will be conveyed to Kathmandu when foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali lands in New Delhi next week, is part of this template.Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had indicated the broad contours of this approach to extend India’s vaccine umbrella to countries in south Asia when he travelled to Nepal late last year. “The first priority will be for our closest neighbours, our friends,” Shringla had said.Indian diplomats said this format would be replicated elsewhere in the region but the terms of the arrangement could be different. There could be a certain quantity of the vaccine that is made available on a grant basis while the rest would be on a commercial basis.Bangladesh, which had contracted for 30 million doses, has granted approval to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. The vaccines are expected to start landing in Dhaka from early February, according to reports from Dhaka.The Sheikh Hasina government had logged out of clinical trials for Chinese vaccine Sinovac after the manufacturer Sinovac Biotech demanded that Dhaka co-fund the late-stage domestic trial of its potential vaccine. Bangladesh subsequently declined to opt for the Chinese vaccine beyond the 1.1 lakh doses that it was to get free according to the arrangement to allow the trials in the country.The company’s demand that Dhaka should pay for the trials was also contrary to President Xi Jinping’s stated position articulated at the World Health Assembly when he had called the Chinese vaccine a “global public good”, an attempt to recast the narrative around coronavirus in its favour in face of criticism for Beijing’s initial handling of the infection first report from the central Chinese city of Wuhan.Myanmar has, however, kept its options open and has announced a deal to source vaccines from the Serum Institute of India (SII).“The purchase contract for buying the first batch of the vaccines from India has already been signed. As soon as the authorities concerned in India have issued permission to use this vaccine, we have made arrangements for the import of these vaccines into Myanmar,” announced, State Counsellor Daw AungSan Suu Kyi in her New Year address to the nation. Myanmar already has a pact in place to buy vaccines from China.Myanmar has also asked the World Health Organisation’s COVAX programme and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation to secure vaccines for its poor. These, however, are expected to arrive by April.Brazil, which had been facing complications around the Chinese vaccines, has also reached out to New Delhi for vaccine consignments of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine made by the Pune-based SII.Pakistan, as expected, is relying heavily on the Chinese vaccines that are being supplied abroad, according to communist party-linked Global Times, to recoup the cost of giving free vaccinations to the Chinese people.A Global Times article that attributed India’s plans to use the India-made vaccine for political brand-building and counter the international influence of Chinese vaccines, grudgingly acknowledged India’s expertise in the vaccine business.“Experts suggested that India’s vaccines are no less competitive than Chinese COVID-19 vaccines in both research and production capacity, considering that India has the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer and lower costs in labor and facilities,” the Global Times report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/friends-first-india-adopts-hcq-model-to-send-covid-vaccines-to-neighbours/story-oAftKafzFPNNHK8DgiuLVK.html

The police, who had registered cases against her under Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 341 and 342 (wrongful restraint and confinement), 452 (trespassing), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 365 (abduction) of the Indian Penal Code, filed two more cases under Section 147 (rioting) and 385 (extortion) against her on Thursday. Meanwhile, Akhila Priya’s lawyer moved a bail petition in the Secunderabad court stating that her client was pregnant and suffering from health issues. The court asked the police to file a counter and deferred the hearing to Friday. Earlier, the police named AV Subba Reddy, another senior TDP leader from Kurnool, as accused No. 1 (A-1) and arrested him late Wednesday, but let him off after questioning and serving him notice under Section 41 of Criminal Procedure Code (which states the police can arrest a person any time without warrant). He has now been named A-2 in the case. “Her husband Bhargav Rao, who is A-3, is still absconding. Special teams have gone to Bengaluru on coming to know that he had gone there,” the Bowenpally police said, adding that efforts were on to track down other accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrested-ex-andhra-minister-prime-accused-in-kidnapping-case-say-police/story-ocxRXeskKumhdj1ih0OqjO.html

DK Singh, director of Rajaji Tiger Reserve said, “Taking cognisance of media reports regarding change of train speed while passing through the reserve, I have written to the railway authorities to reconsider the decision.” “As per the norms of the Union environment ministry and the Nainital High Court, speed limit of trains passing through Rajaji Tiger Reserve should not be more than 35 kmph as it is a wildlife sensitive area with regular movement. The train speed had been specially reduced to ensure that animals like elephants, leopards, tigers do not get killed by trains,” he added. In 2015, the National Board for Wildlife in a standing committee had decided that, “Speed limit of trains shall be followed strictly up to 35km/h during night and 40 km/h during day time.” In 2016, the Nainital High Court had ordered, “Forest department is directed to set up a monitoring cell to track movement of elephants and other wild animals and to inform railway authorities. There shall be coordination between the forest department and the railways. Railway authorities are directed to ensure that speed of trains should not be more than 30km/hr…” Elephant deaths after being hit by trains are a major problem in the Rajaji landscape. Last November, two elephants were found dead within three days in Lachiwala range in Dehradun in the state. Of these two, a 35-year-old female elephant was found dead in the range after being hit by a train. Last year in July, a carcass of a three-year-old elephant was found in a gorge near Nakraunda area in Dehradun forest division after it was hit by a train.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajaji-tiger-reserve-flags-railways-decision-to-increase-train-speed-inside-range/story-h9oLo2EPPiqm7wYlw08GIK.html

07-01-2021||India||‘Are farmers protected against Covid?’: SC asks Centre, cites Tablighi event||The Supreme court on Thursday asked the Centre whether the thousands of farmers camping in and around Delhi in protest against the three farm laws over the past many weeks are “protected from Covid”. The court likened the state of affairs to one involving the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in the capital in March last year that went on to become one of the biggest clusters of coronavirus cases. “This same problem is going to arise during the farmer protest. We do not know if farmers are being protected from Covid. What guidelines have you issued for prevention of such things,” remarked a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde. The bench, which also comprised Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, “Have you learnt from your experience in handling this [Jamaat] event? Have you found out how it happened?” Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, told the bench that the investigation into the Jamaat gathering was still on by the Delhi Police He added Covid-19 guidelines with regard to large gatherings were in place and sought two weeks to file a reply. The remarks were made during the hearing of a public interest litigation by Jammu-based lawyer Supriya Pandita for a CBI probe into the Jamaat gathering. The petition underlined the need for guidelines to prevent such events from creating harm to public health at the time of the pandemic. Pandita’s lawyer, OP Parihar, cited the Jamaat gathering and added the group’s chief Maulana Saad has not been arrested yet. The bench said it is not interested in one person. “We are interested in ensuring Covid guidelines are prepared and implemented.” The PIL alleged negligence on part of the Delhi Government and Centre in allowing a mass gathering of Tablighi Jamaat members to assemble in the Capital. The petition demanded that an independent probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation alone would indicate the administrative lapses. Pandita in her petition stated, “Ignoring all social distancing norms to avoid the deadly coronavirus, hundreds had been staying in the 100-year-old mosque since March 8 last year. More than 2,000 delegates from Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Kyrgyzstan attended the congregation of Tablighi Jamaat.” The area where the event took place was sealed on March 30, 2020. Pandita said that “cluster transmission” of the virus took place as at least 16,500 people visited Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters in Nizamuddin between March 13 and 24. The area was sealed by the police on March 30.In June 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs filed an affidavit in the apex court stating that all efforts were being made by the Delhi Police to complete the probe into the case. It rejected the request of the petitioner to entrust the probe to the CBI. Although the matter was heard by the Court since May 2020, notice on the petition was issued only on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-farmers-protected-against-covid-sc-asks-centre-cites-tablighi-event/story-wesvDKDLkU4gJfvd4caI6K.html

Later, the group of farmers was pacified by administrative and agriculture officials present there, he claimed.Saini, the legislator from Khatauli assembly seat who was the chief guest at the event, however, claimed that nobody opposed him. He further claimed that there were only two farmers who raised the issues related to their bank loans and power bills. A number of farmers attended the kisan mela.The MLA said he spoke about the issues which were related to farmers and mainly focused on how farmers could double their income by adopting modern technology in farming.“I am simply an MLA of the party and therefore can’t say much about farm laws. Top party leaders understand these issues better,” he added.Ahlawat described the new farm laws as a “death warrant for farmers” and said that the anger against BJP leaders was growing in the entire western UP. “The controversial farm laws have united farmers and they are fighting together to oppose them,” said Ahlawat.Jagdish Singh, pradhan of Chabaria village in Meerut district, also endorsed Ahlawat’s claim that anger among the farmers was growing. On the other hand, MLA Saini claimed that farmers of the region were happy with the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-interested-in-govt-s-feats-farmers-group-snubs-bjp-mla-in-up-s-khatauli/story-VFNa6zqwl5YBmPlVNRnXOM.html

Arrangements are being made by the suppliers to provide the vaccines in specialised containers that will keep the vaccines refrigerated safely for 24 hours during transportation and delivery to the local administration officials,” government officials said here.The major part of transportation by air would be done by commercial airliners.IAF would also be providing lending facilities to commercial airliners at the military airfields where commercial planes do not operate, the officials stated.The Air Force transport aircraft would be used for flying vaccines to remote airfields and advanced landing grounds in states such as Arunachal Pradesh and Union Territory of Ladakh.As per the plan, if required, the force would also use its helicopter fleet to take the coronavirus vaccines to the remotest locations. The discussions on the transportation of vaccines are still on and details are being finalised, they said.Last week, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) announced “restricted emergency use” for Bharat Biotech’s COVAXIN and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, which has been developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.In Delhi, the armed forces have identified Army Research and Referral Hospital, Base Hospital, Armed Forces Clinic, Air Force Centre, Subroto Park, and Air Force Station, Palam for administering the vaccines to its personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-commercial-airlines-to-provide-transportation-facilities-for-country-wide-covid-19-vaccination-drive/story-6m7CO4xONNWI10UTmQe0hN.html
07-01-2021||India||Government clears 8 hydropower projects on Indus in Ladakh||The government has cleared eight hydropower projects of 144 MW on the Indus river and its tributaries in Ladakh, the highest so far, sources in the Jal Shakti Ministry said on Thursday. At present, there are several small projects, with a collective capacity of 113 MW on Indus in Ladakh, and the new projects will have much more capacity than those constructed so far, a senior official added.The official said the new projects have been cleared by the Central Water Commission as well as the Indus Commissioner after a separate Union Territory of Ladakh was announced last year. These projects will come up in Kargil and Leh districts of Ladakh. Because of its topography, it is not feasible to construct big hydropower projects in the Ladakh region.Durbuk Shyok (19 MW), Shankoo (18.5 MW), Nimu Chilling (24 MW), Rongdo (12 MW), Ratan Nag (10.5 MW) hydropower projects have been cleared for Leh, while Mangdum Sangra (19 MW), Kargil Hunderman (25 MW) and Tamasha (12 MW) have been cleared for Kargil, the official added. Many of the existing projects as small as 1 MW of capacity. The construction of the new projects will begin after other mandatory clearances are obtained, the official said.   “The designs of these projects have been certified as compliant with the Indus Waters Treaty by the Central Water Commission. The information on the design of these projects is being provided to Pakistan as per the provisions of the treaty,” the official said. “The development of projects on the Indus river has been slow, especially in the Ladakh region. Only two major projects have been constructed so far --- Chutak project of 44 MW on Suru, a tributary of the Indus, and Nimoo Bazgo of 45 MW on the Indus,” the official said. Under the Indus Waters Treaty between New Delhi and Islamabad, the usage of water of Indus and its five tributaries flowing from India to Pakistan have been divided. The treaty specifies that waters of three eastern rivers namely Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, have been reserved for India while that of western rivers, namely Indus, Chenab and Jhelum, are for Pakistan. However, India claims it has unrestricted rights to develop hydroelectric power projects on the western rivers within the specified parameters of design. Of the total 168 million acre-feet, India’s share of water from Ravi, Beas and Sutlej is 33 mcf, which is nearly 20 per cent. India uses nearly 93-94 per cent of its share under the Indus Water Treaty. The rest of the water remains unutilised and goes to Pakistan. The efforts to tap that water through a number of projects like Ujh Multipurpose project, Shahpurkandi Dam project and the second Ravi Beas Link are being made, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-clears-8-hydropower-projects-on-indus-in-ladakh/story-YVTOIP5dNyWreuA0smkIvK.html

According to a party functionary, Nadda will launch the campaign in Burdwan district of the election bound state and the process will be carried forward by party workers who will visit farming households across 48,000 villages to collect rice. “It is a month-long drive to collect rice, which will then be used for a community meal for farmers, and the poor,” the functionary said. Nadda, who won high praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the party’s performance in the Bihar assembly election, has been leading the West Bengal election strategy as well. Since the Trinamool Congress is expected to rake up the issue of the ongoing farmers’ stir near the Delhi border, the BJP is pulling out all stops to dispel concerns about the new farm laws. The party has instructed its functionaries to carry out door-to-door campaigns, write letters and hold meetings locally across the states covering all the booths to dismiss the allegations that the farm bills are aimed at providing benefit to corporates. “What the party president will initiate will be taken further by the functionaries at all booth levels. The party has already underlined how farmers in the state have been deprived of the benefits of the Kisan Samman Nidhi that offers Rs six thousand a year to farmers through direct bank transfer,” said the functionary quoted above.

Mumbai Police declared it as a case of suicide which the CBI is probing.Rhea Chakraborty who was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau during a parallel probe into drug rackets in Bollywood and is now out on bail had filed a complaint on September 7 against Sushant Singh Rajput’s sisters Priyanka, Meetu and a doctor from Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for allegedly getting Sushant drugs without a physical consultation.Appearing for the sisters, Sushant Singh’s family lawyer Vikas Singh on Thursday said the medicines could have been referred to by doctors through telemedicine as per the ICMR telemedicine guidelines. He also said that this is part of the main case being investigated by the CBI.Appearing for Rhea Chakraborty, advocate Satish Maneshinde said Rhea was aware that Sushant was taking medications which led to an altercation between the two, but she was not aware of the prescription at that time. It was only after the prescription was leaked on social media that Rhea realised that her sisters got the prescription.“I pointed out to his household help that he was mixing narcotic substances with the medicines that he was taking. It was going to be a dangerous cocktail. I was aware that he was taking medications and I had an altercation with him on that, but I was not aware of the prescription. When the prescription was leaked in social media, I realised it was on advice if his sisters. So I realised that it could be a cause of his suicide. I have said in my complaint, that these medicines were prescribed by a doctor who had never prescribed him before. They were prescribed without seeing him physically. Telemedicine can be prescribed only with prior consultation with the doctor,” Maneshinde said presenting Rhea Chakraborty’s statement.“My complaint is in relation to a forged prescription of medicines. The circumstances that I am pointing out that should also be examined. His family is concerned with the cause of his death. They say I am responsible, I am giving different circumstances for investigation,” Maneshinde said on behalf of Rhea Chakraborty.The court has reserved its order and asked all parties to submit written statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-was-sober-innocent-observes-bombay-high-court-reserves-order-on-plea-by-his-sisters/story-8Wzy1WIzPb7pIJoyk6TBQL.html

07-01-2021||India||Andhra govt hits back at Chandrababu Naidu for questioning CM’s faith||The Andhra Pradesh government on Thursday launched a counter-attack on Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu for allegedly politicising the vandalism of Hindu temples by raising the issue of chief minister YSR Jagan Mohan Reddy’s faith. State minister for tourism and culture Muthamsetty Srinivasa Rao told reporters in Visakhapatnam that Naidu was creating communal hatred by linking Jagan Reddy’s Christianity to the recent attacks on temples. “The TDP president is repeatedly raising the issue of the chief minister’s Christian faith so as to gain political mileage. He is acting like a typical movie villain,” the minister said. Minister Kodali Venkateshwara Rao accused Naidu of launching a venomous campaign by alleging that the chief minister was not acting on vandalism in temples because he was a Christian. “Jagan doesn’t discriminate between Hindus and Christians in the implementation of welfare schemes. He launched the house sites distribution programme on December 25 which coincided with Vaikuntha Ekadasi as well as Christmas,” he said. Meanwhile, state director general of police Gautam Sawang has threatened to file a criminal case against the TDP president for attributing communal motives to him. “I am consulting my lawyers before proceeding with criminal action against Naidu,” the DGP said in Tirupati. “I never expected that Chandrababu Naidu, who had served as a chief minister for a long period, would talk so irresponsibly,” he said. The DGP went on to suspect a largescale conspiracy behind the series of attacks on temples in the recent past. “The sequence of events clearly shows that some vested interests are trying to create law and order problems in the state,” he said. A day ago, Naidu had said at a party meeting that the attack on Ramatirtham temple in Vizianagaram on the night of December 28 was due to inaction of the Jagan government. “The chief minister, the home minister (M Sucharita), the DGP and even the district SP are all Christians. They should have taken prompt steps to clear doubts among Hindu devotees. But they displayed total negligence,” Naidu said. TDP official spokesman NB Sudhakar Reddy expressed surprise over the DGP’s statement that he would file a criminal case against Naidu for raising his voice against destruction of temples. He said it was unwarranted on the part of Sawang to threaten the TDP president who had served as the chief minister for 14 years. “The DGP should stop acting like a YSRC worker and do his duty as per the law. Why didn’t he take any action when the chief minister and YSRC leaders repeatedly raised Naidu’s caste with regard to Amaravati issue?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-hits-back-at-chandrababu-naidu-for-questioning-cm-s-faith/story-mfRY9DvNfeibMt4FoxYBSK.html

They peak in May and June. Despite the onset of winter, forest fires were reported in the state and have damaged over 350 hectares of forestland since October.“Due to the lockdown imposed in view of Covid-19 during the summer months, movement in the forests was restricted. Due to this, a lot of combustible material mostly pine needles was accumulated. These materials are cleared annually through controlled burning but the exercise was affected, which is one of the reasons for forest fires,” said Maan Singh, the state’s nodal officer for forest fires.Also Read: Tiger killed in Uttarakhand’s Nainital after being hit by carSingh said little rainfall during the post-monsoon period has also contributed to the fires. “...forests became dry and added with combustible material, forest fire incidents are continuing. With rainfall in the plains and snowfall in the upper reaches of the state, now forest fire incidents are likely to reduce especially in Oak forests which have received heavy snowfall,” said Singh. He added human activities in the forests following the end of the lockdown also led to some man-made fire incidents.In Uttarakhand, 0.17% of the total forest cover comes under the extremely fire-prone, 1.60% under the very-highly prone, 9.32% under the highly-prone, 21.66% under the moderately prone, and 67.25% under less fire-prone categories.Over 44,554 hectares of the forest area has been damaged in fires since 2000. Uttarakhand forest department has 174 watchtowers and 1,437 station crews across the state to check the fires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unusual-wildfires-in-uttarakhand-officials-blame-scanty-rain-combustible-material/story-IO4cJxQ2BNWQxGNFMsymyN.html

Officials said the Gujarat police, in its request to trace and arrest Ranpariya, had cited the Interpol notice.Asked about the request to detain Ranpariya, a spokesperson for the Scotland Yard said they wouldn’t be able to reveal this information. “We do not search by names and we do not identify anyone who may or may not be subject to a police investigation,” the spokesperson said.Back in India, the federal financial crimes agency Enforcement Directorate had attached assets worth Rs 3.97 crore in one 2018 case related to usurping of land in Jamnagar.Ranpariya had been operating in Jamnagar for some years, extorting money from real estate developers and property owners when they tried to sell land or buildings. Ranpariya would get forged documents made and lay claim to the property to create a dispute that would make it impossible for the owner to sell the plot or building. He would back off only when he was paid. Police said the money would run into crores.Ranpariya hit the headlines after the murder of Jamnagar lawyer Kirit Joshi who had been filing criminal cases against him for extortion on behalf of his clients.Joshi was stabbed multiple times by two men when he was about to open his car on a busy road. Police later arrested two men who alleged that Ranpariya had paid them to kill the lawyer.Ranpariya, till then a local land mafia, had anticipated that the police would go after him after this murder and had slipped out of the country using a fake passport. He was believed to have based himself for some time in Dubai.According to Gujarat Police, Ranpriya had been contacting his victims using phone numbers traced to the United Kingdom and would cite the Kirit Joshi’s murder to scare them into paying up. Often, he would also keep the victim’s family under surveillance and threaten to harm them to create fear of his syndicate. Not many would come forward to file police complaints against him.According to the police, they were aware of several cases where people had paid up crores of rupees after his phone call; often in instalments spread over a year.(With inputs from Prasun Sonwalkar in London)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-uk-to-arrest-gujarat-s-jaysukh-ranpariya-for-killing-jamnagar-lawyer/story-wI99xH4L6lRssplBsTiMHL.html

India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13th amendment which was brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987.His remarks assume significance in the backdrop of moves by the ruling Sri Lanka People’s Party (SLPP) allies to mount a public campaign for abolition of Sri Lanka’s provincial councils system.The SLPP’s Sinhala majority hardliners have been advocating a total abolition of the island’s provincial council system established in 1987.The DMK had recently urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to prevail upon Sri Lanka to give up its ‘proposal’ to abolish the provincial councils as it went against the island nation’s 13th Amendment to Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/tamil-nadu/jaishankar-s-comments-signify-pm-modi-s-commitment-to-lankan-tamils-purohit/story-1xlrQPo0wV02axB1GHOXVM.html

The farmers of Madhya Pradesh are simple and the three new laws are against their interests, he claimed.Thousands of have been camping at several Delhi border points for over 40 days, demanding repeal of the new farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) for their crops, besides other issues.“Our protest (against the government) for the farmers’ cause at various levels including blocks and districts across the state - will continue till January 23,” Nath said.On January 15, a two-hour-long “chakka jam” (road blockades) will be held from noon across the state, he said.The Congress would also hold a massive “kisan mahapanchyat” (farmers’ meet) on January 20 in the state’s Morena district, he said.On January 23, farmers would gherao the Raj Bhawan (governor’s house) here over the demand for a repeal of the three new agri laws, the Congress veteran said.The Congress will launch a farmers’ awakening programme from Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh on January 16, the leader of opposition in the state Assembly said.Nath said he will address his party’s first awareness meeting for farmers on January 16.The party would hold such meetings at different places, he added.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-wants-to-privatise-farm-sector-kamal-nath/story-qBrXirPwjsV8ZxU90Qk1VO.html

On the same day, at the same ceremony in front of friends, well wishers and with some music to go with the celebrations. The marriage ceremony, which took place on January 5, was attended by about 500 people. The wedding video and invitation card of Chandu Maurya’s marriage function has gone viral on social media. It all started three years ago, when 24-year-old Chandu Maurya, a marginal farmer and labourer of a remote village of Maoist-affected Bastar district, went to install electricity poles in Tokapal area. There the man met 21-year-old tribal girl Sundari Kashyap and both fell in love. They then kept in touch over phone calls and planned to marry. A year later, 20-year-old Haseena Baghel reached Chandu’s village Tikralohnga to attend a relative’s marriage. Chandu fell in love again. When Haseena expressed her love, Chandu confessed that he was already in a relationship but Haseena insisted that they keep in touch over the phone. “Both Haseena and Sundari came to know about each other and agreed to have a relationship with me. We were in touch over the phone but one day Haseena landed at my home to live with me. When Sundari came to know that Haseena is here, she also came to me. And since then, we started living in the same house like a family,” Chandu, who lives with his parents and two siblings, told Hindustan Times. A few months later, the villagers and the family member started questioning the live-in relationship of Chandu with the two women and it was then that he decided to marry both of them. “Fed-up with the questions, I decided to marry both of them because they both loved me. I can’t betray them. They agreed they both will live with me forever,” said Chandu. The family members of Haseena came to attend the marriage ceremony but Sundari’s family skipped the function, said Chandu. Sudari, however, has expressed hope that her parents will come around. “They (parents) are not happy with me today but things will change. Both Haseena and me are very happy with Chandu and his family and will live with him forever,” said Sundari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bastar-man-marries-2-women-on-same-day-wives-say-they-are-very-happy/story-KCz3zz2ZaFh1E5hCwv2pQO.html

The Centre partially lifted the ban and resumed India to UK flights from January 6. The first flight from the UK will arrive in India on January 8. The civil aviation ministry has revised the number of flights allowed to operate between India and the UK and brought down the number to 30, from 70 till January 23. A detailed guideline has also been issued by the Union health ministry for passengers arriving in India from the UK. However, the Delhi CM took to Twitter and urged the Centre to not lift the ban until January 31. Centre has decided to lift the ban and start UK flights. In view of extremely serious COVID situation in UK, I wud urge central govt to extend the ban till 31 JanAfter a new, possibly more contagious strain of Coronavirus was detected in the United Kingdom in December, several countries imposed a ban on flights from the UK. India, too, on December 21 announced an embargo on UK flights which was effective from December 23 to December 31. Later, it was extended to January 7. With great difficulty, people have brought COVID situation in control. UK’s COVID situation is v serious. Now, why lift ban and expose our people to risk? https://t.co/ql8WIXHFFaThe civil aviation ministry clarified that while flights from the UK will be allowed to enter the country from January 8, India could start its flights to the UK from January 6. Two Air India flights were scheduled on January 6, after a gap of almost a fortnight.The Covid-19 situation in the United Kingdom is extremely serious, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted as he urged the Centre to reconsider the lifting of restrictions. “With great difficulty, people have brought Covid-19 situation in control. UK’s COVID situation is very serious. Now, why lift ban and expose our people to risk?” Kejriwal tweeted. As UK flights are mostly destined to Delhi and Mumbai, the caseload of the cities might get affected by the resumption of the flights.The UK on Wednesday recorded 1,041 deaths — the highest since the peak of the pandemic since April last year. The number of people who have tested positive for the new UK variant of virus in India has reached 73, according to the health ministry on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-urges-centre-to-extend-ban-on-uk-flights/story-MOJh7pRz4OGXFWLYfEg8jL.html

On August 24, the high court had asked the Speaker to decide within three months the disqualification petition filed by Dilawar.Allowing the plea partially, the high court had set aside the July 22 order of the Speaker rejecting the disqualification petition filed by him in March last year.It had dismissed a writ petition filed by the BSP in the matter, while giving the party liberty to file a disqualification petition with the Speaker.Dilawar had filed the petition in the high court challenging the merger of six BSP MLAs - Sandeep Yadav, Wajib Ali, Deepchand Kheria, Lakhan Meena, Jogendra Awana and Rajendra Gudha - with the Congress and demanded a stay on the execution of the order passed by the Speaker.The top court had on the same day disposed of as ‘infructuous’ Dilawar’s plea seeking stay on the Rajasthan Speaker’s decision allowing the MLAs to merge with the Congress after the high court had passed its order on the same issue.The MLAs had contested and won the 2018 assembly elections on BSP tickets but later defected to the Congress party in September 2019.The MLAs had submitted an application for the merger on September 16, 2019 and the Speaker issued an order on September 18, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-to-rajasthan-assembly-speaker-on-pleas-against-merger-of-bsp-mlas-with-congress/story-JpOIUMTSZACR7gFGWk1dLO.html
07-01-2021||India||Kerala Speaker and customs face off in gold smuggling case||Kerala Assembly speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and the customs department are headed for a face-off in the gold smuggling case after the former’s office rushed a letter to the customs saying it has to take permission of the Speaker before summoning his staff for questioning in the case. Customs had summoned Speaker’s additional personal secretary, K Ayyappan, to appear before the agency three days back but he did not. The Assembly secretary then sent a letter to the customs saying it has to take permission of the Speaker before summoning Assembly staff, because like law-makers, they also enjoy certain privileges.The Opposition Congress and legal experts have criticised the Speaker’s move as an attempt to scuttle the on-going probe into gold smuggling.The Speaker has defended his stance and argued that the legislature secretariat has not blocked any investigation into the smuggling case but it wanted all rules to be followed.“The legislature secretariat has reminded the agency about the house rules. Staff of the assembly also enjoys certain privileges under Rule 165,” he said.However, a senior customs official said the agency had sought legal opinion on the matter and that the Assembly staff wasn’t entitled to any privilege outside the house. He added that a fresh notice will be issued to the additional personal secretary. Meanwhile, the Opposition Congress has filed a notice to remove the Speaker in the wake of the allegations against him ahead of the budget session of the assembly, starting Friday. After the gold smuggling case surfaced, the Speaker was accused of close relationship with the main accused Swapna Suresh. He later admitted that he knew Suresh as an employee of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate and attended some functions on her invitation. Also Read: Kerala dollar smuggling case: Customs issues fresh notice to K AyyappanBut Congress and BJP leaders allege that it was more than an ‘official relationship’ and that Sreeramakrishnan had travelled with Suresh several times to West Asian countries.They also allege the accused smuggled US dollars to the Gulf countries using Sreeramakrishnan’s green channel access. They also alleged that a major portion of the smuggled US dollar was commission obtained from various projects. The Speaker has denied these allegations and said he was ready for any probe.“He is misusing rules and privileges to save his face,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. There is a strong likelihood that the Speaker will be summoned by the investigating agencies after the budget session. When the customs busted the gold smuggling racket in July, Suresh was working as a consultant with the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited. Before this, she worked at the UAE consulate at the state capital as its public relations officer. After the gold smuggling case surfaced, her degree was also found to be a fake. Last month Suresh told a court in Kochi that her life was in danger and sought special protection for herself and her family members. She said she was under pressure not to take big names and some people met her in the jail a couple of times to pressurise her. Later, the court directed the prisons department to provide her adequate security. Detained under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (Cofeposa), Swapna is lodged in the women’s jail in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kerala/kerala-speaker-and-customs-face-off-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-DOSOLEqLalGttr6gtrw4dM.html

The ordinance provides for two to 10- year imprisonment and a fine up to Rs50,000 for anyone found guilty of “forcing women, minors, and people from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to undergo religious conversion”.According to the ordinance, reconversion to embrace one’s “ancestral religion” will not be considered a crime, as per the official.An official said Patel has signed the drafts of all the 12 ordinances that the state cabinet approved and sent for her consent and promulgation on December 29. The ordinances were issued as the state assembly’s winter session was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They include the one that provides for life imprisonment for those found guilty of adulteration of food and drugs.Also read | Supreme Court to examine laws against unlawful conversion in UP, UttarakhandThe Madhya Pradesh Dharmik Swatantrata (Freedom of Religion) Ordinance defines ancestral religion as that of a person’s father at the time of birth. It replaces the 1968 Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act and prohibits conversion and attempts on conversion done through “misrepresentation, allurement, threat, force, undue influence, coercion marriage, and any fraudulent means”. “Conspiracy and abetment to religious conversion have been prohibited too...,” says the ordinance.It provides for annulment of inter-faith marriages solemnised by “misrepresentation, allurement, threat, coercion, undue influence, and fraud”. The ordinance seeks to provide parental property rights to children born out of such marriages and maintenance to the woman and children.The cases registered under the ordinance are cognisable and non-bailable and sessions courts are authorised to hear them.The ordinance has a provision for punishing organisations, which organise such conversions. A person embracing another religion voluntarily and the priest getting it done will have to inform the district magistrate at least 60 days prior to the scheduled date of conversion. Over two dozen Muslim men have been arrested in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh since a similar ordinance was enacted there last month. Other Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states like Haryana, Karnataka and Assam are planning to bring in similar anti-conversion laws that critics say are vague and being used to target inter-faith couples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-governor-approves-ordinance-to-regulate-inter-faith-marriages/story-MKPpZTpAhdxv84kMnUIwGK.html

07-01-2021||India||Jumbo committees have no adverse impact on Congress party in TN says Mani Shankar Aiyar||The jumbo committees formed in the Congress’ Tamil Nadu unit ahead of the assembly polls are not going to adversely impact the party as the move brings various factions together, senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar said on Thursday and predicted a “strong walkover” for the DMK-Congress alliance over the AIADMK in the upcoming elections.The comments by Aiyar, who has been named in several key poll-related panels of the Congress’ Tamil Nadu unit, come days after Congress MP Karti Chidambaram raised questions over the state unit rejig, saying such “jumbo committees” serve no purpose as no one will have any authority which would mean “no accountability”.In an interview with PTI, Aiyar said the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-Congress alliance was facing a “very divided” All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) between Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) and O Panneerselvam (OPS).Aiyar also said that if either of the “factions” in the AIADMK or the party as a whole joins hands with the BJP then that will be to its further disadvantage “because in Tamil Nadu there has never been and there isn’t now any kind of Hindu-Muslim divide”.“The Congress will not be fighting in Tamil Nadu on its own, it is going to be part of the alliance being put together by the DMK. Now we are faced with a very divided AIADMK between EPS and OPS, where there has been no reconciliation of hearts,” he said.“Although they (AIADMK) have succeeded against many people’s expectations, including mine, in being able to run a coalition government. I call it a coalition government because EPS and OPS are really running irreconcilable factions and these factional rivalries are bound to affect the ground prospects of the AIADMK,” the former Union minister and an ex-MP from Tamil Nadu said.Asked about Karti Chidambaram’s “jumbo committee” remarks and his own take on the Congress appointing 32 vice presidents, 57 general secretaries and 104 secretaries in its state unit last week, Aiyar said this is the “jumbo way” of running the Pradesh Congress.“It is a way of cross stitching differences in the very top provincial leadership of the party. I don’t see this being reversed,” he said.Aiyar hoped that the more active members of the jumbo establishment would form a smaller group of decision makers within the “jumbo committees”.Asked if such large panels in the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee could prove to be counterproductive for the party, he said, “It brings the party together.” “It makes all the factions feel that they have representation and that the representation will be effective to the extent that the representatives of these factions are effective in their respective committees.” “I don’t think the mere fact that they are jumbo committees is going to adversely affect the Congress,” he asserted.The fact is that there are factions and it is best that they be recognised, and the answer to this problem has been to make the entire election machinery as comprehensive as possible so that the party fights the elections unitedly, the 79-year-old leader said.Aiyar, who has been named in the TNCC’s executive committee, Pradesh election committee and the manifesto committee, said the issue in the upcoming polls will be the same that has always been there in Tamil Nadu -- good governance.As far as ideology is concerned there is very little to choose between the AIADMK and the DMK who are both offspring of the original Dravidian movement, he said.There would have been an ideological issue had the BJP turned out to be a more important political player than it is, but as the main battle is between the DMK and the AIADMK, there is little to choose ideologically, Aiyar said.“So it does come round to personalities, to whom would you entrust the government of Tamil Nadu, to Jayalalithaa or Karunanidhi. Now both of them have gone but that remains the fundamental challenge; would you prefer M K Stalin to either OPS, EPS or both, or do you have some third alternative in mind. I think the third alternative has been removed by developments over the last couple of years,” he said, referring to the “poor performance” of Rajinikanth and Kamal Hassan.Tamil Nadu has already had five years of OPS-EPS rule and its performance has not been sufficiently outstanding to be a walkover for them, Aiyar said.“Indeed I think it is going to be a pretty strong walkover for the DMK-Congress because as I said the fissiparous tendencies have become so pronounced in the AIADMK,” he said.The Assembly polls in Tamil Nadu are likely to take place in April-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/tamil-nadu/jumbo-committees-have-no-adverse-impact-on-congress-party-in-tn-says-mani-shankar-aiyar/story-qYS30D8wsd4kwf997G763M.html
07-01-2021||India||SC asks Centre: What steps have you taken to prevent Covid spread at farmers’ protest site||The Supreme Court on Thursday cited a gathering at Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters in Delhi in March that was blamed for a jump in Covid-19 infections and asked the Centre what guidelines were in place to prevent a similar situation at the farmer protest sites. It issued a notice seeking the Centre’s reply within two weeks.“This same problem is going to arise during the farmer protest. We do not know if farmers are being protected from Covid. What guidelines have you issued for prevention of such things,” a three-judge bench asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. “Have you learnt from your experience in handling this [Jamaat] event? Have you found out how it happened?”Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, told the bench that the investigation into the Jamaat gathering was still on. He added Covid-19 guidelines with regard to large gatherings were in place and sought two weeks to file a reply.Also Read: Farmers’ protest: Tractor rally today likely to disrupt traffic on Delhi outskirtsFarmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders against the three farm laws enacted in September to liberalize the sector. They say the reforms will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The bench was hearing public interest litigation by Jammu-based lawyer Supriya Pandita for a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the Jamaat gathering. The petition underlined the need for guidelines to prevent such events from creating harm to public health at the time of the pandemic.Pandita’s lawyer, OP Parihar, cited the Jamaat gathering and added the group’s chief Maulana Saad has not been arrested yet.The bench said it is not interested in one person. “We are interested in ensuring Covid guidelines are prepared and implemented.”A Delhi court last month acquitted 36 foreign nationals accused of violating Covid-19 protocol by attending the Jamaat event, saying the prosecution had failed to prove that the charges against them. In August, the Bombay high court struck down cases against 29 foreigners and five Indians facing similar charges. “A political government tries to find a scapegoat when there is pandemic or calamity, and the circumstances show that there is probability that these foreigners were chosen to make them scapegoats,” the court had said. “The material of the present matter shows that the propaganda against the so-called religious activity was unwarranted.”The Jamaat hit the headlines in March when authorities blamed the gathering at its headquarters in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin area for the jump in Covid-19 infections. The headquarters was sealed and thousands of attendees, including foreigners from countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the US, were quarantined. Police initially filed a case against Saad for violating a ban on big gatherings. He was later booked for culpable homicide, which carries a maximum punishment of 10-year imprisonment.The Jamaat, which has followers in over 80 countries, maintained many visitors at its headquarters were stranded after the government declared a lockdown to check the pandemic spread. The Centre blacklisted around 1,500 foreign Tablighi members for violating their visa norms and multiple cases were registered against them across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-steps-have-been-taken-to-prevent-covid-spread-at-farmers-protest-site-sc-to-centre/story-qPIaQ8n9GnMTFJSjPZ6ZYI.html

07-01-2021||India||Gauhati High Court rejects anti-CAA activist Akhil Gogoi’s bail plea||The Gauhati High Court on Thursday rejected a bail application of peasants’ rights activist Akhil Gogoi, who has been in jail since December 2019 in connection with a National Investigation Agency (NIA) case for his role in the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in the state. The decision by a division bench of the court has dashed hopes of his supporters across Assam who had been hoping that he would get released soon to take part in the upcoming assembly polls in the state. “We are waiting for a copy of the order to know the exact reasons for denial of bail. We will soon approach the Supreme Court with an appeal seeking bail for Gogoi,” said Santanu Borthakur, Gogoi’s advocate, after the court’s decision. The case pertains to one of the 13 cases registered against Gogoi, founder of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), for his role in the violent protests that took place in December 2019 against the citizenship law. Gogoi has secured bail in all the other cases, including another one filed by the NIA, except this. Initially filed at the Chandmari police station in Guwahati, the case was later transferred to the NIA. He has been charged under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, sedition, criminal conspiracy, support to terrorist organization, among others. Gogoi was arrested at Jorhat on December 12, 2019 for his role in the protests against CAA, which seeks to fast forward citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, Buddhists and Jains from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Three of his associates were arrested a day later. He was later handed over to the NIA and a court here sent him to 10 days custody of the agency on December 17. He was taken to New Delhi the same day for questioning. Gogoi was brought back to Guwahati on December 25 and has been in judicial custody ever since. The three associates of Gogoi, who were also arrested in December, are already out on bail. Gogoi’s organization, KMSS, which was at the forefront of the anti-CAA protests, has lodged a political party called Raijor Dal last year with the aim of contesting the state polls. The first convention of the party began at Moran in Dibrugarh district on Thursday and there were expectations that the court would grant bail to Gogoi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauhati-high-court-rejects-anti-caa-activist-akhil-gogoi-s-bail-plea/story-uqoAPsMeTncAaahy7CF1wK.html

In the complaint, BMC stated that Sood converted the Shakti Sagar Building on AB Nair Road into a hotel without permission. “It has been found that Sonu Sood has made a change in the use of land by himself. Apart from this, the residential building has been converted into a residential hotel building by making additional construction out of the fixed plan. For this, they have not even obtained the necessary technical approval from the authority,” Livehindustan reported the BMC as saying.The BMC also accused Sonu Sood of ignoring the notice in relation to the matter. Even after the notice was given, they continued to carry out unauthorised construction, BMC also said.Sonu Sood is known for his famous role in Dabangg, Simbaa and Jodhaa Akabar. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was at the forefront of the relief efforts as he helped stranded migrant workers and students by arranging buses, flights and trains for them to reach their homes. He also sponsored the medical treatment of the needy and has been involved in numerous humanitarian activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-accuses-actor-sonu-sood-of-converting-residential-building-into-hotel-files-case/story-ARv2OZ0BH2KjRTgG32eGpO.html

The march comes a day before the government and the farmers’ unions are slated to hold their next round of talks. Women in rural Haryana have been receiving training on driving tractors for today’s tractor march, reported news agency PTI. Union minister Piyush Goyal said on Wednesday that he sees the ongoing dialogue between farmers and the Centre as an opportunity to explain how beneficial the reforms can be for the former. However, the farmers unions camping at three sites near Delhi have insisted on a total repeal of the new farm laws, while the government has said it is ready to discuss changes to the existing laws. Thursday’s tractor march is being touted by the protesters as a ‘trailer’ of a much bigger march that is being planned for Republic Day.

07-01-2021||India||Air pollution raises risk of pregnancy loss in India, south Asia: Lancet study||Poor air quality is associated with a considerable proportion of pregnancy loss in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, according to a modelling study published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal, which says such losses are more common in north India and Pakistan.An estimated 349,681 pregnancy losses per year in south Asia were associated with exposure to PM2.5 concentrations that exceeded India’s air quality standard (more than 40 μg/m³), accounting for 7% of annual pregnancy loss in the region from 2000-2016, the study says.For air pollution above WHO air quality guideline, exposure may have contributed to 29% of pregnancy losses. Although WHO’s guidelines aim for a safer level of air pollution, the authors note that India’s standard is a more realistic target level, given the high average levels of air pollution in the region and the need to balance practical governance and public health.Also Read: Lockdown may have pushed communities back to traditional cooking fuels: StudyConsidered the first such study to estimate the effect of air pollution on pregnancy loss across the region, it says limitations in the survey data mean that it was unable to distinguish between natural pregnancy loss and abortions, which may have led to an underestimation of the effect of air pollution on natural pregnancy loss.The researchers included 34,197 women who had lost a pregnancy, including 27,480 miscarriages and 6,717 stillbirths, which were compared to live birth controls. Of the pregnancy loss cases, 77% were from India, 12% from Pakistan, and 11% from Bangladesh.The authors combined data from household surveys on health from 1998-2016 (from women who reported at least one pregnancy loss and one or more live births) and estimated exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy through combining satellite with atmospheric modelling outputs.They created a model to examine how exposure to PM2.5 increased women’s risk of pregnancy loss, calculating risk for each 10 μg/m³ increased in PM2.5 after adjusting for maternal age, temperature and humidity, seasonal variation, and long-term trends in pregnancy loss.Using this association, they calculated the number of pregnancy losses that may have been caused by PM2.5 in the whole region for the period 2000–16 and looked at how many pregnancy losses might have been prevented under India’s and WHO’s air quality standard (40 μg/m³ and 10 μg/m³, respectively).Gestational exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an increased likelihood of pregnancy loss, and this remained significant after adjusting for other factors. Each increase in 10 μg/m³ was estimated to increase a mother’s risk of pregnancy loss by 3%, the study says.Lead study author Tao Xue of Peking University says: “South Asia has the highest burden of pregnancy loss globally and is one of the most PM2.5 polluted regions in the world. Our findings suggest that poor air quality could be responsible for a considerable burden of pregnancy loss in the region, providing further justification for urgent action to tackle dangerous levels of pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-raises-risk-of-pregnancy-loss-in-india-south-asia-lancet-study/story-Gfnrtiq4OnCDrtX52bSeEL.html
07-01-2021||India||Yogi Adityanath govt paying for misdeeds of previous government: Patel||Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel has been visiting districts in the state and presiding over meetings to take stock of implementation of various development projects. Patel, even though she does not hold any Janata Darbars like many of her predecessors, is often called a proactive governor. Umesh Raghuvanshi spoke to her about her role and the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh. Q. Do you hold Janata Darbar? A. We don’t need to hold a Janata Darbar. If anyone comes to the Raj Bhawan with any problem, we convey the same to the minister of the respective department. There should be no direct intervention from the Raj Bhawan. Q. Are you working as a proactive governor? A. I am doing my duty as a governor. I don’t like the governor spending time within the four walls of Raj Bhawan. This is why I go on tours, meet farmers, teachers and others and visit schools. I convey the problems that are brought to my notice. Q. What about the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh? A. There has been a considerable improvement in the situation on the law and order front and there is a need for even further improvement. I understand many incidents of crime take place because of the complicity of some officers. There are officers who remain alert, and if officers are not hand in gloves with the criminals, they can bring about lots of change. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is very alert about such incidents. The houses/buildings (of Mafia/criminals) constructed illegally have been demolished recently. Q. You have worked as chief minister of Gujarat. How do you find Uttar Pradesh? A. There is a difference in work culture. A desired level of activeness on the part of officers is missing. The officers should be a bit more active. There should be expeditious disposal of files. The officers should feel that files shouldn’t remain pending with them for more than two to three days. But this keeps on happening since they don’t decide issues in three days. I feel bureaucracy is a bit lax in UP vis-a-vis Gujarat. UP’s officers need to expedite decision making. Q. What about implementing the e-office? A. UP is a big state. They (administration) are implementing e-governance. This should show results. Work may take time, but there will be results. Q. Your take on ordinances to make laws like the one enacted to check ‘love jihad’ A. Yes, the state legislature has not been able to meet due to Covid-19. Under such circumstances the governor gives nod to the ordinances in public interest. Q. What about your visits to Varanasi? A. I am associated with a project on ‘anganwadis’ in Varanasi. This may be a model project. The ‘anganwadis’ are being repaired and painted; toys and tricycles are being distributed there. I am involved as I have been asked to. Now, people are coming forward to contribute. In Lucknow, 26 engineering colleges have come forward. Each of them is going to help five ‘anganwadis’. Also Read: UP panchayat polls: BJP begins 10-day rural connect to find new, young facesQ. What changes have you brought about in Raj Bhawan? A. I have done many new things in Raj Bhawan. The women from families of Raj Bhawan employees are being given training in chikankari. We carried out a large plantation drive. We have set up two ‘chandan vatikas’. We have also set up a lotus pond and a zoo. Children are visiting Raj Bhawan. We are saving 25% on power bills. We also took out old crockery and sent them to Kasturba Gandhi Vidyalaya. We have cleared old files that have been unnecessarily stored for years. Q. What challenges do you face in the education sector? A. Yes, we do have a lot of challenges in reforming the education sector. Often small issues cause problems to students and their parents. I have tried to set the things right in this sector. People want jobs and the recruitment process should not have any flaws as this adversely affects the image of universities. We have asked for recording of all the interviews. We can revisit recordings to know about the candidate’s performance and the marks given. The governments in the past did not pay any attention to the issue of recruitment. A large number of cases are pending in courts and the government cannot make related appointments. Q. Why? A. This government is paying for the misdeeds of the previous government. The state government had to recruit 67,000 teachers. The Allahabad high court recently gave nod for recruitment of 32,000 teachers. The cases with regard to remaining posts will go on. How will academic work be carried out if we don’t get teachers? Q. How about the impact of Covid-19? A. Yes, academic classes did not take place due to Covid-19. Those from rural backgrounds are facing problems. A way forward is being worked out. Now work on starting the classes has begun. An improvement has been noticed in the number of students attending the classes. Q. What about political vice chancellors? A. I have stopped political appointments. There is no political interference in appointments. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his ministers don’t interfere with appointments and this has been left to me. This is done with the help of a search committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-adityanath-govt-paying-for-misdeeds-of-previous-government-patel/story-j4DOCy31ziMgDkab2d9b0J.html

07-01-2021||India||Centre’s advisory on bird flu: Here’s all you need to know||Authorities issued advisories to contain the spread of avian influenza, or bird flu, on Wednesday and asked all states to keep a close vigil to detect any unusual bird death as the Centre confirmed the outbreak has been reported from at least four states. Here is what we know about the outbreak:-- Thousands of birds have died in Kerala (mostly poultry), Himachal Pradesh (migratory birds), and Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (crows) since the beginning of the outbreak in December-end.-- Migratory birds are believed to have been the source of the outbreak.-- The government has set up a control room in New Delhi to keep a watch on the situation even as no cases among humans has been reported so far.-- Around 400,000 chickens have died in Haryana’s Panchkula district over the past 20 days.-- Similarly, three crows are suspected to have died of the disease in Uttarakhand’s capital Dehradun. Their test reports were awaited. -- Jharkhand and Gujarat, too, have sounded an alert.-- The Union health ministry has deployed special teams in Panchkula, apart from Kerala’s two epicentres.-- Experts said the current outbreak is caused by the H5N8 strain, though there are other strains circulating globally. A series of outbreaks have been reported in Europe in the past weeks, with wild birds suspected to be spreading the disease.-- Both H5N1 (another strain of avian influenza) and H5N8 have high pathogenicity (the ability of a pathogen to cause disease), but they do not infect humans much. -- Past outbreaks among farm birds have needed extensive culling.-- The current outbreak began barely a few months after India declared the country free from the disease on September 30. India notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006.-- The government has identified 12 disease epicentres: Baran, Kota, Jhalawar regions in Rajasthan; Mandsaur, Indore, Malwa areas in Madhya Pradesh; Kangra in Himachal Pradesh; and Kerala’s Kottayam and Alappuzha (four epicentres).-- Over 69,000 birds, including ducks and chickens, were culled in Alappuzha and Kottayam, Kerala, on Wednesday. -- Kerala has declared bird flu a state disaster and deployed rapid response teams for culling and surveillance efforts.-- Madhya Pradesh has banned transportation of poultry from other states as a measure to check the bird flu spread.-- Himachal Pradesh banned sale and export of poultry products and fish in the four subdivisions of Dehra, Fatehpur, Jawali, and Indora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-issues-advisory-to-check-spread-of-bird-flu-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-outbreak/story-qO1vOv0LuAQzN6w7Qbl7tL.html
07-01-2021||India||Over 3.5 tonnes of cannabis recovered in Odisha, Chhattisgarh||Police and directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) sleuths seized over 3.5 tonnes of cannabis from Odisha and Chhattisgarh on Monday and Tuesday.“On the basis of specific intelligence input, officers of the DRI Madhya Pradesh intercepted a truck of Andhra Pradesh’s registration number near Raipur (Chhattisgarh). The truck was carrying ganja [cannabis] which was concealed below organic fertilizer sacks,” the DRI said in a statement.The truck was carrying ​1​,​534 ​k​g ​(over 1.5 tonnes) of g​anja worth Rs3.07 crore from Araku Valley (Andhra Pradesh) to Maharashtra’s Rahta. Five people have been arrested in connection with the recovery and more arrests were likely.Over 2,000 kg (2 tonnes) of ganja in a 12-wheeler truck was recovered in Odisha’s Rayagada district on Tuesday even as those in the vehicle escaped.Deputy inspector general of police Jainarayan Pankaj said the consignment was headed for Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, and New Delhi.“Unlike Mallana cream from Himachal Pradesh or Idukki Gold ganja from Kerala, the ganja grown in Odisha and Arakku Valley of Andhra Pradesh are the most popular ones due to their low price. Though locally cannabis is sold at about Rs5,000 per kg, it sells anything between Rs10,000 a kg outside Odisha depending on its quality. In Odisha, the bordering forests of Malkangiri-Koraput districts, Kandhamal and Boudh districts and Rayagada-Gajapati districts are the areas where cannabis is grown on an extensive scale. The plants don’t require much water and can grow in three months,” said Pankaj.Officials said ganja is mostly transported through National Highway-30 in Chhattisgarh’s Maoist insurgency-hit Bastar.“Ganja from Odisha and Araku Valley is transported through NH-30. The trucks enter from Konta and pass through Sukma, Jagdalpur, Kondagaon, Kanker, Dhamatari and reach Raipur. Once the consignment reaches Raipur, it is easy for them to transport in Maharashtra through Rajnandgaon,” said a police officer in Bastar.He added police in these areas are involved in anti-Maoist operations and checking or tracking of ganja peddling is less priority. “We do not have enough police force to engage in tracking ganja…”An intelligence official said about Rs100 crore worth ganja is supplied every year through this route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-3-5-tonnes-of-cannabis-recovered-in-odisha-chhatisgarh/story-0EQQBh0uhXv41oJ0PLkWwO.html

07-01-2021||India||Govt plans WhatsApp chatbot for Covid-19 vaccine queries||The government plans to launch a WhatsApp chatbot to address queries regarding the Covid-19 vaccination, people familiar with the matter said. The queries can be sent on the number 9013151515 with the message “say vaccine”, they added. The project is at the pilot stage and is being used to respond to frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the vaccination.Once the chatbot is fully developed and launched, people will be able to get information about the nearest locations where they can get vaccinated, the number of doses, and when they will need to be administered.“The algorithms are done. We are just identifying the maximum number of possible queries before the launch,” an official said.Also read | 15 more test +ve for new UK Covid strain, total 73The Drugs Controller General of India on Sunday announced that it has approved Covaxin, Bharat Biotech International Limited’s locally developed vaccine for Covid-19, and Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India by the Serum Institute of India. The immunisation roll-out will begin with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.The Centre has faced criticism for prematurely rolling out Covaxin without the completion of its phase III trials.As per the chatbot’s FAQ section, the vaccine will be introduced in the country only after “regulatory bodies clear it based on its safety and efficacy”.The 13-page document addresses key issues, including who will get the vaccine first, whether those who have recovered from Covid-19 need the vaccine, and how vaccines are chosen for administration. It underlines the vaccination is mandatory.“Once the chatbot is fully functional, it will be linked to the Co-WIN app and be able to provide real-time data,” the official cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-whatsapp-chatbot-for-covid-19-vaccine-queries/story-WPZ4mfC7BBAOkoWRaV0U6H.html
07-01-2021||India||Wildlife Board nod to rail tracks through protected Western Ghats||The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has given its nod to Tinaighat-Castlerock-Caranzol railway doubling project. The project is likely to involve diversion of 10.45 ha of forest land of which 9.57 ha is in Dandeli wildlife sanctuary in Karnataka’s Western Ghats.“Happy to inform that in its 60th meeting, NBWL has recommended the proposal for Tinaighat-Castlerock-Caranzol Railway doubling of southwestern railways, Karnataka with certain mitigation measures as advised by the Wildlife Institute of India,” tweeted Union environment minister, Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday. The minutes of the meeting are yet to be published.According to a note by the Southwestern Railways, the existing railway single line between Hospet and Vasco was laid in 1900 and connects industrial areas in Hospet and Marmugoa port and various tourist places in Goa and Karnataka. Due to industrial growth and increase in tourists, the single line is saturated.According to a site inspection report by forest department published on the environment ministry’s Parivesh website, the area covering both Kali Tiger Reserve and Anshi Wildlife Division, harbours tigers, leopards, gaur, sambar etc and is endemic to Castlerock Night Frog. There are already Alnavar-Londa Vasco and Londa Khanapur railway lines in the region where many wildlife casualties have been reported due to train accidents. The proposal will involve the loss of 5,413 trees in Kali Tiger Reserve alone. The doubling of the railway line is mainly proposed for transport of coal according to the report.“The project was vehemently opposed by wildlife scientists in Karnataka and by some members of the Karnataka Wildlife Board also. The rail line will pass through a very eco-sensitive region. It also runs parallel to the NH4A which is being expanded. The two projects together will be a death knell for wildlife and biodiversity here,” said a senior wildlife scientist from Karnataka on condition of anonymity.“The Castlerock area was included in the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary in 2011 due to its ecological importance as it holds tigers, dholes and several other endangered wildlife species. It connects Dandeli to Bhimghad Wildlife Sanctuary. Adjoining Castlerock are the protected areas in Goa hence it is one of the largest contiguous wildlife habitats in central Western Ghats. It also acts as watershed for several of our streams, rivers and dams,” said Sanjay Gubbi, Conservation Biologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wildlife-board-nod-to-rail-tracks-through-protected-western-ghats/story-SpJ3N939rvQflXzcDS23uJ.html
07-01-2021||India||Haryana to hold Covid-19 vaccine dry run today, day before nationwide exercise||Haryana is holding a dry run, a simulation of the actual execution of the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out, on Thursday. This is being done to ensure efficient planning and management of the immunisation process which is expected to begin in a few days.In Gurugram, where vaccination dry run will be held at six session sites, regional emergencies director of World Health Organisation, Dr Rodrico Ofrin, is likely to visit two sites - at Bhangrola and Wazirabad.Bhangrola is a rural area, with the dry run being held at a primary health centre. Wazirabad, on the other hand, is an urban area, where the drive will be held at a government primary school.The drive will start from 11 am at all locations simultaneously, and is likely to continue till 1 pm.Since the mock drill will be conducted across 22 districts on Thursday, Haryana has been exempted by the Union health ministry from the massive nationwide mock drill to be held on January 8 across all states and union territories.Each district across the country has been asked to identify three types of session sites, similar to the previous dry run conducted on January 2, including a public health facility (district hospital/medical college), private health facility and rural or urban outreach sites, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan will hold a meeting with the health ministers of states and union territories on Thursday to guide them on conducting the dry run.The entire planning of the vaccination drive including beneficiary registration, microplanning and vaccination at the planned session site will be tested under the leadership of District Collector or District Magistrate during the dry run.The dry run will also familiarize the state, district, block and hospital level officers on all aspects of the Covid vaccine roll out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-to-hold-covid-19-vaccine-dry-run-today-day-before-nationwide-exercise/story-wVzP1I0H6hJA2jQ1zHGowM.html
07-01-2021||India||Rain likely to reduce significantly over NW India from today||Rain over plains of northwest India is likely to reduce or stop completely from today, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). Heavy to very heavy rains are however likely to persist over many parts of peninsular India due to intense easterly waves The Western Disturbance which brought rain and snow to the hills in the past four days has moved away and the moisture feed from Arabian Sea has significantly reduced, according to IMD’s Wednesday bulletin. Scattered snowfall is likely over Jammu-Kashmir-Muzaffarabad-Gilgit-Baltistan-Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Light rainfall is also likely over Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh-Delhi and east Rajasthan and scattered rainfall over West Uttar Pradesh. Dry weather is likely to set in over the northern plains from Thursday.A feeble Western Disturbance is likely to impact only the Western Himalayan region on Thursday and Friday bringing light rain and snow in the hills.Under the influence of a trough (area of low pressure) from central parts of south Arabian Sea to north Madhya Maharashtra and an active easterly wave spell, scattered to fairly widespread rain accompanied with thunderstorm, lightning is likely over southern peninsular India during the next 3-4 days. Heavy to very heavy rain is likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal and isolated heavy rainfall over Kerala, Mahe, coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema is also likely.Minimum temperatures are likely to fall again by 4 to 6 degree C over plains of northwest India during the next 4-5 days. Cold wave conditions are likely over plains from January 11 to 13. Due to abundant moisture and other favourable meteorological features, dense to very dense fog is likely in many pockets over northwest India between January 7 and 10.“When Western Disturbances bring rain to northwest India, easterly waves affect the peninsular region particularly Tamil Nadu. The northeast monsoon also hasn’t withdrawn completely from there. The easterly waves have been intense with moisture feeding in from the ocean. We are expecting more rains in peninsular India in the next few days,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.“Chennai’s Minabakkam and Nungabakkam recorded very heavy rains on Wednesday, a record definitely in the past decade and possibly many more decades. Rains reduce in January and normal are extremely low in February and March. So, this is unseasonal and unexpected. There have been record rains in many parts of northwest India due to a slow-moving western disturbance that persisted for 3 to 4 days and an induced cyclonic circulation over west Rajasthan which also persisted. Now again unseasonal rains are expected over Karnataka and parts of Maharashtra because a trough (line of low pressure) is extending from Arabian Sea to Madhya Maharashtra. Light snowfall is likely over the western Himalayas again on January 8 due to an approaching Western Disturbance,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-likely-to-reduce-significantly-over-nw-india-from-today/story-YUV5ghay1Cx6jvhDCldqzI.html

Siddhant Batra was ranked 270 in the All India Joint Engineering Entrance 2020 but clicked the ‘withdraw’ link during the online admission process. Disposing the petition filed by Batra, the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy asked IIT, Bombay to regularise Batra’s admission despite the fact that the institute had admitted students to its capacity and had even begun classes. However, the bench made it clear that this will not be treated as a precedent. On December 9, the SC issued notice on Batra’s petition and held, “By interim order, we direct that the petitioner should be permitted to join the respondent-institution and pursue his course subject to fulfillment of all other formalities.”Batra had initially approached Bombay High Court but IIT-Bombay refused to admit Batra’s action to be a mistake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-relief-for-student-who-lost-iit-b-seat/story-lV71vOZtfw4SoK4pDWgX8L.html

07-01-2021||India||Vaccine pricing still a sticking point?||Negotiation over pricing remains an issue that is being ironed out before the Centre signs a purchase order for the roll-out out of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, experts indicated on Wednesday, even as the government continued to finalise the infrastructure and other mechanisms to deploy the jabs against the coronavirus.While distribution in other nations started soon after approval with pricing deals signed ahead of time, New Delhi and Serum Institute of India – the world’s biggest vaccine maker by volume and AstraZeneca’s local partner – have engaged in months of discussions behind and are yet to sign a formal supply agreement, according to a Bloomberg report.SII previously said that it offered the vaccine to the government at the cost of Rs 200 per dose for the first 100 million doses. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is priced at 2.5 euros ($3) per dose in the international market.“The paperwork in these types of deals does take some time. Prices are negotiated when such huge orders are to be placed in bulk as India is launching one of the largest government vaccination drives. “What is more important is that the vaccine delivery management system should work flawlessly,” a government official said on condition of anonymity.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Tuesday said that the vaccination drive in India will begin 10 days after two vaccines, the one manufacture by SII and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, received emergency use authorisation. The approvals were granted on Sunday. Bharat Biotech has not made a public statement about the pricing of its vaccine so far.Bhushan did not respond to queries about the pricing still to be finalised. Niti Aayog’s Dr Vinod Paul also declined to comment on the matter.India plans to vaccinate 30 million health care and frontline workers in the first phase of the vaccination for free. The government has said it plans to vaccinate 300 million people on priority by July this year.An expert, who asked not to be named, said the paperwork should have been sorted months ago since the government had pre-ordered vaccines. As dry runs were being conducted over the past week, the vaccine roll-out should have happened by Monday, he argued. “There seems to be no other reason for the delay. Usually, negotiations take place around the price per dose as the volume is huge,” said a public health expert on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-pricing-still-a-sticking-point/story-N5rnIHEBBgHpI3gHmua5fN.html

A total of eight people have been arrested in the case that came to light in February 2019 when a 19-year-old woman filed a complaint against four men for allegedly sexually assaulting her and filming the act in Coimbatore district’s Pollachi town. During the investigation, it was revealed that a network of men sexually assaulted close to 50 women.

The party has appointed Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and senior party leaders Mukul Wanki and Shakeel Ahmad Khan as the senior observers for Assam. In Kerala, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro and former Karnataka deputy chief minister G Parameshwara will take charge, according to the statement.Former Karnataka CM Veerappa Moily, along with Pallam Raju and Nitin Raut will oversee the poll preparedness in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, the statement said. In West Bengal, BK Hariprasad, Alamgir Alam and Vijay Inder Singla have been appointed, it added.“The leaders will coordinate with the general secretaries to oversee preparations for the elections. They are all senior leaders who will monitor election management,” party general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal said.The party statement said Congress president Sonia Gandhi has appointed the leaders as senior observers for overseeing the election campaign management and coordination in states where assembly elections are going to be held in 2021. Their appointment is with immediate effect. They will discharge their duties in close coordination with AICC general secretaries and in-charges in the respective states, the party said. The party faces an uphill task after it suffered a drubbing in the Bihar assembly elections in November, where it only won 19 seats of the 70 seats it contested. The result of the Bihar polls has prompted the party to take other measures, including an outreach programme to win back women voters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-member-panel-set-up-ahead-of-state-polls/story-0nh44OL7jNQPnbYDc8q9AJ.html

07-01-2021||India||Doval, French prez adviser to hold strategic talks today||French President Emmanuel Macron’s top adviser Emmanuel Bonne and India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval will on Thursday hold an annual strategic dialogue that is expected to review the progress made over a 10,000-megawatt nuclear power plant to be set up in Maharashtra and the construction of six diesel-electric submarines under the Indian Navy’s P-75I programme, people aware of the developments said.The two top advisers will also discuss improving maritime security and developments in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly in the context of China’s aggressive moves along the Line of Actual Control, they said.Bonne, President Macron’s diplomatic adviser, is expected to call on PM Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar, and meet foreign secretary Harsh Shringla on Friday. “The two sides will hold discussions on wide-ranging bilateral and global issues,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement ahead of the strategic dialogue that will seek to reinforce deep ties between the two countries. France has been one of India’s most reliable partners in Europe for years but the two countries inched closer over the last few years, leading to a defence deal for 36 Rafale aircraft. When French defence minister Florence Parly was in India last year in the context of the induction of the fighter jets in the Indian Air Force, she and defence minister Rajnath Singh agreed to stick to the Rafale template of government-to-government deals for future defence purchases.India is expected to sign a $2.5-billion contract this year for 56 medium-transport aircraft under the Make in India initiative. India is also looking at the acquisition of six Airbus 330 multi-role transport tanker aircraft for expanding the IAF’s strike capability through latest mid-air refuellers as well as the Safran aircraft engines under the Make in India programme. The jet engines which are used by Dassault Aviation for the Rafale jets could be used to power the twin-engine advanced multi-role combat aircraft developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) till it develops its own version.An official said that France responded positively to New Delhi’s concerns about access of military technology to countries which have adversarial relations with India, a reference to Pakistan. France has decided against helping Pakistan upgrade its fleet of Mirage fighter jets, air defence system and Agosta 90B class submarines, a decision that was timed after Prime Minister Imran Khan’s loud criticism of French President Macron. Around the same time, France also conveyed to Qatar, which had earlier bought Rafale jets for its air force, not to allow any Pakistan-origin technicians near the aircraft for maintenance.Pakistan watchers said that it was on account of the French government’s restrictive approach that the Mirage 3 and Mirage 5 fighter jets in Pakistan air force’s inventory did not participate in last month’s joint aerial exercises, Eagle-IX, involving the Chinese and Pakistan air force. Doval and Bonne are also expected to discuss India’s other neighbour, China, in some detail, particularly given French concerns around Beijing attempting to flex muscles in the Indo-Pacific region. China has, for instance, been trying to get people in the French island group of New Caledonia to vote for independence in three referendums being held to decide its future. This island group with an area of 18,575 sq km, located in the South Pacific east of Australia, is one of the 16 overseas territories of France that are home to 1.5 million French citizens.In October last year, France formalised its interest in the Indo-Pacific when President Macron appointed Christophe Penot, one of his country’s most senior diplomats as the first French envoy for the Indo-Pacific. As part of this focus, France has forged new initiatives such as the trilateral dialogue launched with India and Australia in September last to enhance cooperation and strengthen multilateralism in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doval-french-prez-adviser-to-hold-strategic-talks-today/story-2qWm078ieDnCWZaWP7oRhI.html
07-01-2021||India||Heritage experts dissatisfied with SC verdict, worry about future changes||Heritage experts expressed dissatisfaction over Tuesday’s Supreme Court verdict that said only a part of the Central Vista area can be declared a heritage precinct while approving all environmental and land use changes to pave the way for the nearly ₹15,000-crore redevelopment project to begin. Five petitioners — and 10 petitions — had challenged the redevelopment project over the Centre’s alleged lack of transparency and objectivity in awarding clearances such as on land use change to proceed with redevelopment of the area.Pointing out that the Delhi Master Plan 2021 listed the Lutyens Bungalow Zone (or LBZ) as one of the six heritage zones in the city, founder-member of INTACH and noted architect-academician AG Krishna Menon contended that the heritage of Central Vista should not be seen in a piecemeal fashion; its heritage value lay as much in its present-day function as a seat of power as in its role as “a massive public space”. The redevelopment project, he said, “changed the significance of the place.” “Of course, change is important, but we have to ask what adds and improves the heritage value of a place. By demolishing buildings, and emptying out others, what significance are we retaining?” Menon, who was one of the five petitioners who challenged the project in the apex court, asked. Together with petitioners Rajiv Suri and Anuj Srivastava, he claimed that the redevelopment plan would destroy Central Vista’s heritage value. Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management Ltd, which will be redeveloping the Central Vista has proposed to convert the North and South Blocks — where ministries such as finance, defence and home, have offices — into museums. The redevelopment plan also proposes to raze some buildings located on either side of the avenue to build anew a set of buildings where all ministries’ offices, now spread across Delhi, will be brought to one place.Author and Delhi historian Swapna Liddle feared that the land use change that the top court approved —all seven plots up for redevelopment in the area have undergone changes that broadly pertain to four categories of land use: recreational, government, public-semi public and residential — would pave the way for future changes.“So, for example, a land use change from recreational to government means that it is lost to the public forever,” Liddle said.HCP director Bimal Patel said the plan would not tamper with heritage buildings.“The proposed master plan respects the existing layout and aims to strengthen it. All the works planned on the Central Vista are designed to respect the heritage buildings, spaces and their character. The notified heritage buildings being dealt with as part of this plan will be retrofitted in compliance with the prevailing regulations in all aspects,” Patel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heritage-experts-dissatisfied-with-sc-verdict-worry-about-future-changes/story-miAJlcCOEmFGonoV4MDSLO.html
07-01-2021||India||Talks healthy, closer to resolution, SC told||The central government on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that an “understanding” could be in sight with the farmers’ unions over the contentious agricultural laws, even as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) lamented that there was “no improvement in the situation”.CJI SA Bobde, however, also said that the top court has always encouraged talks, and that the legal adjudication surrounding the farm laws and farmers’ protests could wait if there was the possibility of a breakthrough. The court said it would take up the matter on January 11 but could defer the hearing in case there was some progress in talks.The statement by the government suggesting a headway in negotiation has come two days after the seventh round of talks between the Centre and farm leaders ended in a stalemate. The three Union ministers part of the negotiations had suggested it was not possible to commit to a rollback of the laws without wider consultations with higher authorities. The farm unions had rejected this position, and said they would enhance their agitation -- a large tractor rally has been planned on the outskirts of the Capital on Thursday. Both sides, however, agreed to continue the talks on January 8.On Wednesday, the CJI-led bench was hearing a plea by petitioner-advocate ML Sharma, who has challenged the laws on the ground that Centre lacked power to legislate on the issues directly relating to agriculture produce, its trade and market.The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, told Sharma that his petition could also be heard along with another batch of petitions on the same issue that are listed on January 8. At this point, the CJI remarked: “There is no improvement in the situation at all.”The comment triggered a response from solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who said that the government was into “healthy discussions” with the farmers, and this is why they did not want to file an affidavit in response to the petitions in the court.“We will have to oppose the petitions if we file our counter affidavit. We are into a healthy discussion otherwise. So, we don’t want to file our affidavits and oppose the petitions. We don’t want to oppose anything formally since we are discussing right now,” Mehta submitted, indicating that a documented counter by the government at this stage may not be conducive for the talks.Attorney general KK Venugopal, who also represents the Centre in these matters, added that the government would not want to put on record any kind of opposition regarding the farmers’ issues. “There are good chances that parties may come to an understanding. In case such an understanding is to be reached, we would not want to file our affidavits and oppose anything,” said Venugopal. The law officers’ submissions prompted the CJI to observe: “We would like to encourage talks. That has always been our intention since we started hearing this matter.”The bench then assured Venugopal and Mehta that the court could simply adjourn the proceedings on Monday to a future date if the talks continue. “We don’t want to create more problems when the talks are going on,” it added.Asked about the government’s contention in the Supreme Court, Darshan Pal, a senior leader of the farmers’ agitation, said: “We are not a party to the any of the petitions regarding the three farm laws. Hence, we have no stand on this. The government must repeal the three laws, which continues to be our foremost demand.”Pal, however, said the government has not shown any signs of rolling back the laws, and he insisted that there could be no progress without that.Balbir Singh Rajewal, another farm union leader, said if there was any verdict by the court that has a bearing on the agitation, a response will be formulated only after studying the ruling. He said that the court had already made it clear that farmers had a right to protest peacefully.Thousands of farmers are “fully prepared” for Thursday’s tractor rally that is planned to converge on the KMP Expressway, Rajewal said. The rally, which the farm unions are calling a “rehearsal” for a larger rally on Republic Day, will cover both eastern and western peripheral expressways.“This will be a dress rehearsal for the tractor parade by farmers on Republic Day in the national capital,” said Yogendra Yadav, one of the leaders coordinating the protests.Meanwhile, the court issued notices on Sharma’s petition, which has also challenged the 1954-amendment in the Constitution by virtue of which Entry 33 of the Concurrent List was re-enacted. This re-enactment also gave Centre the authority to legislate on trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of foodstuffs, cattle fodder, raw cotton and cotton seeds; and raw jute.According to Sharma, the government misused Entry 33 to frame the three laws — Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Agriculture and Promotion) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. His petition contends the Centre has no authority under the Constitution to legislate on these issues, and only states can frame these laws. Sharma’s plea added the laws will lead to exploitation of farmers by big corporate houses.On December 17, hearing a clutch of petitions relating to the farmers’ protests, the top court allowed the agitations to go on, and showed its inclination of setting up an independent committee to mediate between the protesting farmers and the government. The decision on the constitution of the committee, however, was deferred since the prominent unions spearheading the protests did not participate in the court proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-healthy-closer-to-resolution-sc-told/story-y8UepwRdNsby30UAcVuZVP.html
07-01-2021||India||Bovine wisdom from govt body: India cow is clever, warm; jersey cow is lazy, emotionless||Indian cows, or “gaumata”, are clever and warm creatures who don’t sit in dirty places; produce milk with traces of gold; and their dung has anti-radioactive properties. In contrast, “exotic” jersey cows are dirty, lazy and emotionless creatures who sit idly all day and are prone to diseases because they’re unhygienic. Such bovine wisdom, and more, has been published by the national government body for cow welfare, Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog, to help candidates prepare for India’s first annual countrywide cow examination on February 25. “The cow is full of science and scientific facts. Gaumata will play an important role in building a $5 trillion economy,” said Aayog chief Vallabhbhai Kathiria.The exam, formally known as the Kamdhenu Gau-VigyanPrachar-Prasar Examination, will be held online in four tiers spanning primary, middle and high school students, college students and the general public. It will have multiple-choice questions for 100 marks across 14 languages. “This will infuse the curiosity into all Indians about the cows, and make them aware of the unexplored potential and business opportunities a cow can offer, even after it stops giving milk,” said the body in a press release on Tuesday. Successful candidates will be given awards and certificates. To help candidates prepare for the challenging examination, the body published a 54-page booklet specifying the various properties of the “gaumata”, her emotions, usefulness, and physical features. A highlight is the 20-point distinction between Indian and jersey cows. The Indian cow is “very active in nature and shares warmth with all,” it said. The jersey, in contrast, “sits idle and very inactive, likes to sit at one place.” “Whenever any unknown person comes near desi cow, she will immediately stand,” the booklet said. The jersey cow, however, displays no emotions. “Indian cows maintain hygiene, [are] hardy and clever enough not to sit at dirty places,” it stated. “Jersey cows are known to be very lazy and highly prone to diseases. It has also been seen that they attract infection by not being hygienic enough.” The reference material also hailed cow products and said the Indian cow’s milk is light yellow in colour because of traces of gold in it. “Cow dung has antiseptic, anti-radioactive and anti-thermal properties…In 1984, more than 20,000 people died due to gas leaks in Bhopal. People living in houses with cow dung coated walls were not affected. Even today, nuclear power centres in India and Russia use shielding dung to radiation,” the booklet read.It claimed that cow urine is an antidote for phlegm, abdominal diseases, eye diseases, bladder diseases, respiratory diseases, inflammation, liver diseases, acidity, leprosy and other skin diseases. “By regularly taking cow urine before sickness, we gain so much immunity that any attack of diseases is repulsed…the only disadvantage of Gaumutra is its smell or taste.”The booklet expands on the ideal feed for a cow, the properties of an ideal cow shelter and even links cow slaughter to earthquakes.“Acoustic anisotropy leads to a very strong anisotropic stress on a rock. The daily butchering of thousands of animals continually for several years generates acoustic anisotropy due to Einsteinian Pain Waves (EPW) emitted by dying animals. And the accumulated acoustic anisotropy is found to be related with the stress history of rocks.” A statement by the Aayog said Union education ministers, chief ministers, state education ministers, chairmen of cow welfare commissions of all states, district education officers of all states, principals of all schools, print and electronic media, NGOs and cow donors will be involved in the exercise. The test will be an annual affair.“I don’t know anything about this, but any claim needs to pass rigorous scientific tests based on facts,” said Samir Brahmachari, a biophysicist and former director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bovine-wisdom-from-govt-body-india-cow-is-clever-warm-jersey-cow-is-lazy-emotionless/story-SG3fEUVeIQfcBvKFSqZCtO.html
07-01-2021||India||UK flights resume after two-week suspension||Two weeks after India had suspended all flight operations to the UK, in the wake of the outbreak of a new COVID strain, the first flight for the UK left Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport on Wednesday with 252 passengers. Another flight left for London on Wednesday evening, from Mumbai. The first flight from London, will land at the Delhi airport on Friday, officials said.December 23 onwards, India had suspended all flights to and from the United Kingdom (UK) up to December 31 in order to stop the arrival of a new strain of Sars-CoV-2 that spreads faster. The ban was later extended till January 7.The two Air India flights that left India on Wednesday, from Delhi and Mumbai international airports will land at Heathrow airport in London on Thursday. The two flights carried a total of 491 passengers. On Friday, both the Air India flights are expected to return to their base in Delhi and in Mumbai. These will be the first flights coming to India from the UK since the flight suspension.Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri had also said on Tuesday that the number of flights to the UK from India have been reduced by 50 per cent.The government has laid down stringent procedures that the incoming passengers are required to go through upon their arrival. In a set of standard operating procedures (SOP), the ministry of health and family welfare said all the incoming passengers from UK will require declaring their travel history of past 14 days. The passengers also need to fill up a self-declaration form and upload it on the online portal at www.newdelhiairport.in at least 72 hours before their scheduled departure.The SOP says, “All passengers arriving from the UK should be carrying negative RT-PCR test report for which test should have been conducted within 72 hours prior to undertaking the journey. The same shall also be uploaded on the online portal at www.newdelhiairport.in.”The order also asks the airlines to check the negative RT-PCR test reports before allowing the passengers onboard.Asking the airport authorities to ensure adequate arrangements, the SOP mandates an RT-PCR test for all the passengers arriving from the UK upon their arrival in India. “Passengers testing positive shall be isolated in an institutional isolation facility coordinated by respective state health authorities. Those who are found negative on testing at the airport would be advised quarantine at home for 14 days,” it said.The order further said that all the contacts of the passengers arriving at various ports from the UK between January 8 and 30, who have test positive, would be subject to institutional quarantine in separate quarantine centers and would be tested as per the ICMR guidelines. For this, the bureau of immigration has also been asked to share the state-wise passenger manifest of the flights landing in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru, for the said period, with the state governments.Meanwhile, arrangements have been made at the Delhi airport for passengers scheduled to arrive from the UK on Friday. Dr. Gauri Agarwal, founder and director of Genestrings diagnostics that is conducting the RT-PCR tests at the Delhi airport, said her team is ready to receive the passengers.“It takes 4-6 hours to get the reports, however as a mandate the entire flight will have to be halted till the time all results are declared. All arrangements have been made to ensure that the RT-PCR tests for all the passengers and the crew arriving from the UK are conducted smoothly,” she said.Delhi airport operator and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) that guards the airport have also together set up a dedicated corridor to escort the arriving passengers up to the testing facility so that they do not mix with other passengers at the airport.Deputy commissioner of police (IGIA) Rajeev Ranjan said they have also made arrangements to make sure all the passengers arriving from the UK are tested and no one skips the test or attempts to escape.Two passengers had escaped on their way to quarantine facility in Delhi on December 22 after they had tested positive at the Delhi airport. While one had reached Punjab, another managed to reach Andhra Pradesh.As many as 11 passengers had tested positive for the Coronavirus at Delhi airport last month upon their arrival from the UK and 50 others who had come in direct contact had to be quarantined. These passengers were among 950 passengers who had arrived in four flights on December 21 and 22, right before the suspensions of flights between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-flights-resume-after-two-week-suspension/story-OaCfaBUlVPm9nPhZtZhcwJ.html
07-01-2021||India||States on alert as bird flu spreads, toll soars||The central government confirmed on Wednesday that avian influenza, or bird flu, cases were reported across 12 epicentres in at least four Indian states even as authorities issued advisories to contain further spread of the outbreak and asked all states to keep a close vigil to detect any unusual bird death.Thousands of birds have died in Kerala (mostly poultry), Himachal Pradesh (migratory birds), and Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (crows) since the beginning of the outbreak in December-end. Officials said migratory birds are behind the outbreak. The government said it has set up a “control room” in New Delhi to keep a watch on the situation. No case among humans has been reported.  In addition to the four states with confirmed cases, around 400,000 chickens have died in Haryana’s Panchkula district over the past 20 days. Similarly, three crows are suspected to have died due to the disease in Uttarakhand’s capital Dehradun. Their test reports were awaited. Jharkhand and Gujarat, too, have sounded an alarm. The Union health ministry said it has deployed special teams in Panchkula, apart from Kerala’s two epicentres.Experts said the current outbreak is caused by the H5N8 strain, though there are other strains circulating globally. A series of outbreaks have been reported in Europe in the past weeks, with wild birds suspected to be spreading the disease.Experts added that both H5N1 (another strain of avian influenza) and H5N8 have high pathogenicity (the ability of a pathogen to cause disease), but they don’t infect humans very effectively. However, past outbreaks among farm birds have needed extensive slaughtering programmes.“…people who are handling birds (culling them or handling meat) should be careful and take full precautions. If it does transmit to humans, the influenza can be very severe...Human-to-human transmission is also not common, but can happen. Eating properly cooked poultry is unlikely to transmit the infection. We have had several bird flu episodes in the past but managed to control them,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The current outbreak began barely a few months after India declared the country free from the disease on September 30, 2020. India notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006.“Bird flu cases can be found all over the world. India was declared free of bird flu in September. Then in October, we issued an advisory that the cold is coming and that there is a need to take precautions. Today, most of the cases are being reported from the places where migratory birds arrive, and they are the reason for bringing the virus to the country,” Giriraj Singh, the Union minister of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, told news agency ANI.“The government is on alert. Samples from all states are being sent to Bhopal (for testing at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases). There is nothing to worry about. The government will also provide compensation to the farmers for the poultry that died,” Singh said.In a statement, his ministry identified 12 disease epicentres: Baran, Kota, Jhalawar regions in Rajasthan; Mandsaur, Indore, Malwa areas in Madhya Pradesh; Kangra in Himachal Pradesh; and Kerala’s Kottayam and Alappuzha (four epicentres).In India, the ministry said, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds during winter months from September-October to February-March. The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out.“Infection in humans is not yet reported in India though the disease is zoonotic. There is no direct evidence that AI (avian influenza) viruses can be transmitted to humans via the consumption of contaminated poultry products,” it added.Over 69,000 birds, including ducks and chickens, were culled in Alappuzha and Kottayam, Kerala animal husbandry minister K Raju said on Wednesday. His government has declared bird flu as a state disaster. Rapid response teams are on the ground for culling and surveillance efforts.“The state cabinet, which met today (Wednesday), has decided to compensate the farmers for culling their birds. For culled birds over two months old, farmers will be given ₹200 for each… for those under the age of two months, farmers will be compensated at ₹100 for each,” the minister said.Madhya Pradesh has banned transportation of poultry from other states as a measure to check the spread, government officials said. “Testing of poultry samples from districts affected by bird flu suggests poultry is not affected, but as a precautionary measure, the Mandsaur district administration has ordered a ban on the sale and purchase of chicken and eggs... 250 crows have been found dead so far in the district,” said JN Kansotia, the state’s animal husbandry principal secretary.In Himachal, there was a complete ban on the sale and export of poultry products and fish in the four subdivisions of Dehra, Fatehpur, Jawali and Indora, according to Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati. “We can’t stop it (movement of migratory birds); it will continue till February-end,” said Prajapati.Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said six screening teams were sent to the worst-hit Barwala belt, considered Asia’s second largest poultry belt with over 7.7 million birds in 110 farms. Across states, poultry farm owners feared losses due to the culling of birds --- a likely outcome of the outbreak. “I have more than 40,000 chickens at my farm. If the virus spreads, culling would be carried out and that would mean losses worth lakhs or rupees,” said Pushp Barotia, a poultry farm owner in Kangra. The scare has led to a drop in chicken prices in many parts of the country. Annu Gulati, an office-bearer of the Uttar Pradesh Poultry Farm Association, said prices have come down to ₹20-25 per kg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-on-alert-as-bird-flu-spreads-toll-soars/story-U5M37npC49OTvwqFCpexSP.html
07-01-2021||India||Centre rushes teams to Kerala, Haryana affected by Avian influenza as precautionary measure||The Union ministry of health and family welfare has deployed multi-disciplinary teams to states affected by the Avian Influenza as a precautionary measure, officials said on Wednesday. The Union health ministry said in a statement that the teams have been deployed in Haryana’s Panchkula district and in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts of Kerala.“The two multi-disciplinary teams comprising experts from National Center for Disease Control, National Institute of Virology, PGIMER, Chandigarh, Dr RML Hospital, New Delhi, and Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, have been deployed to the affected districts by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare on 4th January 2021 to assist the State Health Departments in implementing Ministry of Health & Family Welfare’s Avian Influenza containment plan,” the statement said. “Directions have already been issued to states in this regard,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.The steps taken by the ministry are precautionary as no cases of the flu have been detected in humans so far. “So far, no human case of Avian Influenza has been reported. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare continues to keep a strict watch over the evolving scenario,” the ministry statement read.The Additional Director General (Wildlife) at Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Soumitra Dasgupta said that the states have been asked to report to the centre any new cases of the flu. “We have mainly received large number of positive H5N1 cases in Himachal Pradesh. Sporadic cases in poultry have been reported from parts of Kerala, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Reports are coming in everyday. In HP, the virus has been found in large number of bar-headed geese. All chief secretaries and chief wildlife wardens have been alerted and asked to send reports immediately,” Dasgupta said. The department of animal husbandry on January 4 notified the detection of Avian Influenza (H5N8) in samples of ducks found dead in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts of Kerala. A similar report of the bird flu was received from poultry samples from Haryana’s Panchkula district, following which the health ministry called a meeting of experts to monitor the situation.First set of high level team was sent to the affected states on January 4. Other states, including Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have similarly reported incidence of the avian influenza, involving crows and migratory birds. According to protocol, the department of animal husbandry has issued alerts to further intensify surveillance to detect any cases in poultry birds.The environment ministry had written to chief secretaries of all states on Tuesday directing them to constitute state level monitoring committees for the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rushes-teams-to-kerala-haryana-affected-by-avian-influenza-as-precautionary-measure/story-RwcpBeJsmJPDPozRoZhsmL.html

07-01-2021||India||274% excess rain in January first week||Very high rainfall was recorded over northwest India and parts of central and peninsular India in the first five days of 2020 --- unusual for this time of the year, according to the weather department.Overall, India recorded 274% excess rain till January 6 with 17 states recording “large excess”, or 60% above normal rain. There was no rain in 14 states during the week.India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said such widespread and heavy rains in January was being recorded for the first time in several decades.Usually, India sees an average rainfall of 2.4 mm from January 1-6. This time, it was 9 mm.  “Last year, we saw 27.4 mm rain in the entire country in January, while the normal is 16.1 mm. This year, we have already realised 9 mm. This spell was unique because it may be one of the longest wet spells recorded in January,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.While winter rain occurs over northwest India during January-February due to western disturbances (WDs), the intensity of the one that triggered rainfall in northwest India in the first week of 2020 was very high. In peninsular India, the northeast monsoon hasn’t withdrawn completely and intense easterly waves are bringing widespread and heavy rains.“The intensity, distribution and lingering rains for a number of days was striking this time. There is always winter rain; we expect six western disturbances on average in January and February, but they are not usually as intense as this one. The WD moved very slowly, bringing rain and snow continuously from January 3,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.The western disturbance has moved away and the moisture feed from Arabian Sea has significantly reduced, according to IMD’s Wednesday bulletin. A feeble western disturbance, however, is likely to impact only the Western Himalayan region on Thursday and Friday, bringing light rain and snow in the hills.Minimum temperatures are likely to fall again by 4-6 degrees Celsius over plains of northwest India during the next 4-5 days. Cold wave conditions are likely over plains from January 11 to 13. Due to abundant moisture and other favourable meteorological features, dense to very dense fog is likely in many pockets over northwest India between January 7 and 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/274-excess-rain-in-january-first-week/story-zj5VUI1C7cNnoASYm2nLeL.html

07-01-2021||India||Amid bird flu scare, poultry from southern states banned in MP, control rooms set up in districts||The Madhya Pradesh government on Wednesday decided to ban the supply of poultry from Kerala and certain other southern states like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu etc to Madhya Pradesh as a measure to check the spread of bird flu in the state while control rooms have been set up in every district to monitor the spread of the virus, according to government officials. Till now, 15 districts have been affected by bird flu. Control rooms have been set up in all the districts to monitor the situation. However, as per officials, the presence of H5N8 has been detected only in crows so far. Poultry remains unaffected, as per officials. The decision to ban the supply of poultry from southern states was taken at a meeting chaired by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday. Officials of the Animal Husbandry and Health departments attended the meeting. “Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has instructed that all efforts should be made for prevention of bird flu in chickens also, even though poultry remains unaffected by the disease,” said an official release. Principal Secretary, Animal Husbandry, JN Kansotia said, “Poultry supply to Madhya Pradesh is mainly done by states like Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Kerala has sounded a high alert and there is a report from there about culling of poultry. Hence, the state government has decided to take this measure.” The official release said, “Necessary precautionary measures are being taken. Districts have been made aware of the guidelines issued by the government of India. Poultry will be banned for a limited period.” The release said, “The Animal Husbandry department and allied departments and agencies are vigilant. The poultry farms where deaths of birds have been reported are being monitored. Daily status of bird flu in the state is being conveyed to the Government of India.” “Divisional teams are closely monitoring reservoirs, poultry farms and poultry markets in the districts. Necessary information about prevention of bird flu is being given to poultry farmers and businessmen. On receiving information regarding sickness or unnatural death of crows or chickens, immediate samples are collected and sent to the laboratory,” said the official release. According to the release, infected places are being disinfected and sanitised in collaboration with the local bodies of the district. “It is important for non-vegetarians to ensure that the chicken is cooked well before consumption so that it does not pose any threat to health,” states the release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-bird-flu-scare-poultry-from-southern-states-banned-in-mp-control-rooms-set-up-in-districts/story-WFd9wVwlqe8iSJ0W5HgDxJ.html
07-01-2021||India||Uttarakhand to conduct second dry run for vaccine rollout in 10 booths of every district on Jan 8||After challenges faced during the first dry-run for the vaccination drive in the state, the Uttarakhand government has announced a second trial process to be conducted across the state on January 8. Chief Secretary Om Prakash while conducting a review meeting of the preparations for Covid-19 vaccination on Tuesday informed that a dry run for the vaccination process will be conducted across the state on January 8. “All the necessary preparations have been ensured by the districts for vaccination. The dry run will be done on January 8 in ten booths in each district. The entire process of vaccination should be widely publicized and deployment of officers should also be ensured for arranging cold chain logistics and monitoring of vaccination sites,” said the chief secretary. He added that internet connectivity should be ensured at vaccination sites. “In areas where there is a problem in reaching the beneficiary due to lack of network connectivity or due to lack of registration, block-level officers should spread awareness like the election process. Ensure that all the necessary information is sent to the beneficiary,” he added. Kuldeep Singh Martoliya, nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination, said that on the day of the first dry-run (January 3) for vaccination process the health workers faced challenges while using the CoWin mobile application. “The one main challenge that we faced was of information technology issues while using the CoWin application, where details of vaccine candidates are to be uploaded during the process. Initially, our healthcare workers were not able to upload all details due to usage of the application and connectivity problems but gradually it was worked out. However, to avoid such incidents during the actual vaccination process, we are getting vaccination cards made, where details will be noted down and later uploaded on the portal of the Central government,” said Martoliya. The vaccination cards are being made as given the topography of Uttarakhand, internet or mobile connectivity is not always guaranteed in hilly areas. He further said that at present around 3000 healthcare workers have been trained on how to administer the vaccine and more nurses, medical professionals from government and private hospitals will be trained in the future as needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-conduct-second-dry-run-for-vaccine-rollout-in-10-booths-of-every-district-on-jan-8/story-ciuV7zmXLHm9lc5SemFhHI.html
07-01-2021||India||Centre gears up for another dry run on Friday||The central government is gearing up to conduct another dry run of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine across the country, except in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, on Friday, ahead of the actual execution of the vaccination roll-out, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday. “The roll out of Covid-19 vaccine is expected to begin in the near future. This milestone entails the need for testing of all planned mechanisms for conducting the vaccination drive in the country,” health ministry said in a statement. Each district will identify three types of session sites, similar to the previous dry run including a public health facility (district hospitals and medical colleges), private health facilities and rural or urban outreach sites.Health minister Harsh Vardhan will also hold a meeting with states in this regard on Thursday, to guide them on the conduct of dry run, the ministry said in a statement. The first nation wide dry run was conducted on January 2.As a simulation of actual execution, another round of dry run will be conducted in all 700 plus districts of all states and Union territories, except UP and Haryana which have planned to conduct theirs on Thursday. It is better to test the platform before the actual exercise begins to avoid last minute glitches. The idea behind having this drills conducted is to ensure there are no surprises on the D-day,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity.“The entire planning of the vaccination drive including beneficiary registration, microplanning and vaccination at the planned session site, will be tested under the leadership of District Collector/District Magistrate. The dry run will also familiarise the state, district, block and hospital level officers on all aspects of Covid-19 roll out. This activity will help administrators in strengthening the linkages between planning, implementation and reporting mechanisms, identification of any residual challenges prior to the actual implementation and to provide confidence to the programme managers at all levels to carry out a smooth implementation of the vaccination drive,” the health ministry statement read.The health ministry will be constantly monitoring the drill and provide necessary support, ensure timely resolution of the identified challenges before the actual vaccination roll-out.Union ministry of health and family welfare has been conducting mock drills to test functioning of the digital platform, Co-WIN, which is the backbone of the Covid-19 vaccine delivery management system, before the actual vaccination drive is rolled out sometime next week. The ministry has been conducting these mock drills in collaboration with the state governments and other stake holders.Two Covid-19 vaccines — Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin — have been given emergency use authorisation by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Sunday. To facilitate the entire vaccination process, Co-WIN has been repurposed for real time information of vaccine stocks, their storage temperature and individualised tracking of beneficiaries for COVID-19 vaccine. This software will assist the programme managers across all levels in conduct of the vaccination sessions. A dedicated 24x7 call centre has also been established for technical queries of Co-WIN users.The cold chain infrastructure (like walk-in-freezers, walk-in-coolers, ice-lined refrigerators, deep freezers) along with sufficient supplies of syringes and other logistics have also been ensured for the exercise.Around 1.7 lakh vaccinators and 3 lakh vaccination team members have been trained on the process to be followed at the vaccination sites which include beneficiary verification, vaccination, cold chain and logistics management, bio-medical waste management, adverse event following immunisation (ARFI) management and reporting on Co-WIN software. Detailed operational guidelines on all aspects of the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out, including session planning and management, session site layout and its organization, AEFI management, communication messages, infection prevention and control practices etc., have already been shared with the States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-gears-up-for-another-dry-run-on-friday/story-awCLeVwiZoms65sF4NetRN.html
07-01-2021||India||Former TDP minister held in Hyd abduction case||Hyderabad: The Telangana Police on Wednesday arrested Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader Bhumika Akhila Priya from Kurnool district in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh for her alleged involvement in the abduction of three brothers in connection with a land dispute, officials said.“We have taken Akhila Priya (a former tourism minister of Andhra Pradesh between April 2017 and May 2019) into custody from her residence in the morning…after preliminary interrogation, she was arrested her formally in the afternoon,” Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar told reporters. She was sent to 14 days of judicial custody.Another senior TDP leader from Kurnool, AV Subba Reddy, was arrested in connection with the case late Wednesday night.Akhila Priya‘s husband, Bhargav Ram, among others, too was believed to be involved in planning and executing the abduction, Anjani Kumar said. “We have formed special teams of the police for tracking down the other accused.” The three kidnapped – K Praveen Rao, K Sunil Rao and K Naveen Rao -- are related to Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, according to police officials who did not want to be named. Praveen Rao is a former national-level badminton player. “The brothers were said to be involved in a land dispute with the accused at Hafeezpet on the city’s (Hyderabad’s) outskirts. The details of the land issue are being probed into,” Anjani Kumar said. According to the police commissioner, about 10 people barged into the residence of Praveen Rao, who stays with his brothers at Krishna Residency apartment complex in Bowenpally’s Manovikas Nagar, around 7.20pm on Tuesday. They introduced themselves as income tax officers. “They separated the brothers from the rest of the family and asked them to sit in the hall. They forced others to go into the bedroom. Later, they whisked the three brothers away in a vehicle. They also took away laptops and mobile phones from them,” the police commissioner said. Family members alerted the police and a first information report (FIR) was registered on the basis of their complaint.Around 3.30am on Wednesday, the suspects released the three brothers at Kokapet-Narasingi area on Hyderabad’s outskirts.“Based on the complaint by the family members, we have arrested Akhila Priya. We are on the lookout for others,” the police commissioner said. Praveen Rao’s another brother, Pratap Rao, told reporters earlier in the day that there was a dispute between the accused and his family over 50 acres of land at Hafeezpet. TDP Kurnool president Somisetty Venkateshwarlu said it was Akhila Priya and her family’s “personal issue”, and that it had nothing to do with the party. “In any case, her arrest has not come up for discussion in the party yet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-tdp-minister-held-in-hyd-abduction-case/story-0FwQwC5uKiYKxWGJguhEKP.html
07-01-2021||India||SC agrees to examine U’khand and UP’s laws on conversions||The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to examine two contentious laws passed by Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand regulating religious conversion through interfaith marriages and sought responses from the respective state governments and the Centre on whether the legislation violated constitutional rights.But the three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, refused to order a stay. Soon after the SC order, a Muslim organisation, the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, applied to intervene in the case and alleged that the two laws were targeting Muslim youth. This application will come up for hearing along with the two petitions after four weeks. The bench was hearing petitions filed by advocates and a non-governmental organisation, Citizens for Justice and Peace, challenging the constitutional validity of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020 and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018.Initially, the top court hesitated to issue notice because separate petitions are pending before the Allahabad high court and Uttarakhand high court, respectively. “Only the society in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand will be affected by this law. Why should the petitioners not approach the respective high courts,” observed CJI Bobde. CJP told the court that the issue was arising in other states as well. “The state of Himachal Pradesh has re-enacted a similar law (HP Freedom of Religion Act) in 2019 after its earlier law prohibiting conversion from one faith to another was struck down by the Himachal Pradesh high court in 2012. Now the new law has roped in marriage by conversion as a ground to prosecute persons. We have multiple states,” said senior advocate CU Singh, representing the NGO.The other petition, filed by lawyers Vishal Thakre and Abhay Singh Yadav and researcher Pranvesh, asserted that the problem needed to be addressed by the top court and alleged the two laws violated the basic structure of the Constitution.The bench agreed to issue notice seeking responses on whether the laws violated fundamental right to practice one’s religion, guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution among other rights protected under Article 14 (right to equality), 15 (right against discrimination) and 21 (right to dignity). The petitioners also asked for a stay on the laws. But the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, was not convinced because the respective governments had not been heard. “Can a law be stayed if prosecution is oppressive or false,” the bench asked.The UP law was enacted on November 24 and prescribes a jail term up to 10 years and fine up to Rs 25,000 for conversion under force, fraud, allurement or marriage. The Uttarakhand law prescribes imprisonment of up to two years and a fine for anyone found guilty of conversion by misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-agrees-to-examine-u-khand-and-up-s-laws-on-conversions/story-CG54VewX4cZh2WEzEFY1OJ.html
07-01-2021||India||Covering all 300 million people could take 7-8 months: VK Paul||It could take at least seven to eight months for the 300 million people identified by the Union government for vaccination against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to get the shot in the first phase, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul said on Wednesday. “We would have enough stockpile to cater to the 300 million people in seven to eight months,” he said during the National Grand Rounds – a virtual platform for doctors to share knowledge about Covid-19 organised by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Paul, who was the head of the department of paediatrics at AIIMS, was talking about the logistics of the large-scale vaccination drive India is set to initiate and how the priority groups – healthcare workers, frontline workers, people over 50, and those who have comorbid conditions – were selected for the first phase. India’s drug controller has cleared two vaccines for restricted emergency use. While the one by Oxford University-AstraZeneca is being manufactured in the country by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the other one is Bharat Biotech’s indigenously developed candidate. “I will take whatever (vaccine) is allotted to me by the health department of my state. I will take absolutely without hesitation; I am willing to take it in public whichever vaccine is tossed up. And, if I was to exercise a choice… I have a preference for the vaccine that my institution AIIMS has tested,” said Dr Paul, referring to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. The government has faced questions for what critics termed rushed approvals to the two vaccines, especially Covaxin, which is yet to release its phase III data. Bharat Biotech, however, has said the vaccine is “200% safe”.At the event, vaccine expert Dr Gagandeep Kang said: “The phase III data of Covaxin will likely be available by March or April of this year. The next vaccine to be approved will likely be the one developed by Gamaleya (Sputnik V) that is conducting a restricted trial like the AstraZeneca vaccine. The full dataset will likely be available by April.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covering-all-300mn-people-could-take-7-8-months-paul/story-6UUxxIdReEOySDn1xRaeZM.html
07-01-2021||India||Amid vaccine dry runs, states say connectivity biggest hurdle||Two weeks into Covid-19 vaccinations dry runs state health officials said their biggest challenge was not crowd management, vaccine storage or transportation but updating the data of those mock vaccinated on the Union health ministry mobile application CoWIN (Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network) due to patchy internet connectivity. After eight districts in four states conducted the first dry run on December 28 and 29, an all-country dry run was carried out a day before the national drug controller cleared two coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines on January 3. Another all-India dry run of mass immunisation will take place in all districts over Thursday and Friday.Earlier this week, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a media briefing that the actual vaccination drive would take place around 10 days after the regulatory approvals. Based on that, mass immunisation with the approved vaccines is expected to take place around January 13.However, the lack of proper internet connectivity may throw a spanner in the works.The Centre has mandated that the details of everyone receiving the vaccine must be uploaded on the CoWIN app after they have been verified and approved. The app updates the information in real time and any glitch in the process means that the vaccine would not be released. “We faced connectivity issues at certain locations because of which the time taken to administer the vaccine was very high,” said a UP government official who did not wish to be named.The state conducted a dry run on Tuesday at six sites in all the 74 districts (12 in the state capital) to assess the preparedness for administering the vaccine against the coronavirus disease. Goa Health Secretary Amit Satija on Wednesday admitted that issues of connectivity affected the dry run that took place in the state on January 2.Uttarakhand chief secretary Om Prakash said another dry run will be conducted in 10 booths of every district on January 8. “Internet connectivity should be ensured at vaccination sites and awareness about the mock run would be created like it is done for elections,” he said. In Bihar, district administration also faced a sudden rush of health workers who thought that the real vaccine was being administered. “They went back after they were convinced that it was only a dry run and they would be informed through SMS about the real vaccination,” said a government official not willing to be named. State health departments are also required to record the time taken for transportation of the vaccine from the nodal office to district headquarters and thereon to health centres designated for the vaccination drive. A Bihar health department assessment found that many auxiliary nursing midwives (ANMs), engaged in the vaccination programme, were not aware of how to handle smartphones or tablets they were provided to upload the data from. “Our district immunisation officers will now train the ANMs for uploading the data,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director Bihar Health Society and also the nodal officer for the vaccination programme in Bihar. Officials in states such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Kerala, West Bengal, Punjab and Haryana said they faced no major problem during first dry run conducted earlier this week. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-vaccine-dry-runs-states-say-connectivity-biggest-hurdle/story-4J7j3Q8ySSba1wcKeBhtmI.html
07-01-2021||India||Congress lost focus, wrote Pranab in memoir||The Congress lost “political focus”, Sonia Gandhi was “unable to handle the affairs of the party”, Manmohan Singh’s “prolonged absence from Parliament” eroded contact with other parliamentarians, and if he had still been in active politics, the party would not have faced the “drubbing” it received in 2014, according to former president Pranab Mukherjee in his posthumously published memoir, The Presidential Years 2012-2017. In a wide ranging autobiography, the late Mukherjee — who passed away in 2020 — has documented his years as President, weaving in the personal and the political. The 2014 mandateMukherjee noted that he expected the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to be the single largest party in the 2014 elections with 195-200 seats — and while most political interlocutors had given him a similar sense, it was only Piyush Goyal — then BJP treasurer — who had said the party would get between 265-280 seats. When the final numbers came in, with BJP winning a comfortable majority on its own, Mukherjee writes, “I was greatly relieved over the decisive mandate but also disappointed at my one-time party’s performance. It was difficult to believe that the Congress had managed to win just 44 seats...I feel the party failed to recognise the end of its charismatic leadership.” His two PMs In his assessment of the two Prime Ministers Mukherjee worked with, the late president noted that Manmohan Singh had “determination…a strong sense of propriety…steely will power” and documented his long relationship with the former PM. Mukherjee said he had a clear understanding of his role as President and had resolved not to cross the limits imposed on him, but on one occasion, asked Singh about an ordinance that his government was bringing. “Sensing my disquiet, the PM spoke to his minister, who then informed me that the government had decided to withdraw the ordinance”. On Modi, Mukherjee said that his approach to maintaining cordial ties came from his belief in the parliamentary form of government and that Modi had received a decisive mandate — and that both knew how to manage those differences, “without bringing them out in the public”.Demonetisation The late president said PM Modi had not consulted him prior to the announcement of demonetisation in 2016, but believed that the criticism that the PM should have engaged in consultations was unwarranted. “Demonetisation could not have been done with prior consultation because the suddenness and surprise, absolutely necessary for such announcements, would have been lost after such a process.” But after addressing the nation, the PM visited Mukherjee and said he had three objectives — tackling black money, fighting corruption, and containing terror financing. Mukherjee said that four years after demonetisation, one thing could be stated — the multiple objectives of the decision have not been met. He then recounts how this was not new — and Mukherjee had sent a note on demonetisation in the early 1970s to the Prime Minister’s Office. Indira Gandhi then rejected the suggestion, “pointing out that a large part of the economy was not yet fully monetised and a substantial part of it was in the informal sector”. Foreign policyIn his assessment of PM Modi’s handling of foreign policy, Mukherjee noted, “One could expect the unexpected from Modi because he had come with no ideological foreign policy baggage.” But the late president did not agree with all his steps — in particular, the PM’s 2015 stopover in Lahore, terming it “unnecessary and uncalled for”. On China, Mukherjee said on his visit to the country in 2016, at the formal banquet, he and President Xi Jinping had an hour-long discussion — for most part without an interpreter though one was present — with Xi asking questions about functioning of the Indian government, the constitutional framework and implementation of policies. The only time he sought an interpreter was when Mukherjee discussed the McMahon Line. “After the discussion, (the then foreign secretary), S Jaishankar rushed to me and asked if anything important had been discussed. I told him the only important thing was that one had to revisit the story of India’s Constitution and its functioning since the 50s.”Mercy petitionsMukherjee, who acquired a reputation for rejecting mercy petitions of convicts sentenced to death, also wrote of the pain and anguish while taking these decisions. “The president is not the punishing authority…the president is the last resort”. He would take more than a week to read the case history and court judgments, but not take more than three weeks to dispose off a file.In an oblique criticism of his predecessors, Mukherjee noted that APJ Abdul Kalam and Pratibha Patil left a large number of cases pending, with the former hardly disposing off any petition and the latter granting clemency to 34 convicts and rejecting just three petitions. “I rejected 30 mercy pleas involving nearly 40 convicts...I saw no point in keeping such files pending.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-lost-focus-wrote-pranab-in-memoir/story-EPHZBnyQDWy2HvLHmNhwRP.html
07-01-2021||India||Crisscrossing migration puts India at high risk, say experts||India has one of the highest incidences of bird flu outbreaks globally because it lies underneath three transnational flight paths of migratory birds, officials have said.An outbreak of avian influenza has gripped four states, but it poses little risk to humans at this stage, the officials said, as the Union government put all states on alert to stop its spread and economic impact. “The current outbreak has been caused H5N8 strain, but there are other strains circulating globally,” said Dr C Tosh, principal scientist of the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD). In Kerala, mostly poultry have been affected, a federal official said, while in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan,thousands of crows have been impacted. In Himachal Pradesh, mostly migratory birds have taken ill. Several hundreds have died. “Reports show that the pathways of infection are mostly through migratory birds, although cross-contamination can’t be ruled out,” Tosh said. After confirmation of positive samples from NIHSAD, bird flu has been reported from the following epicentres: Baran, Kota and Jhalawar (Rajasthan), Mandsaur, Indore and Malwa (Madhya Pradesh ), Kangra (Himachal Pradesh), and Kottayam and Allapuzha (Kerala). Several streams of flight paths of migratory birds crisscross the country’s skies. India is also a terminal destination for many such streams, making it a biological hot spot for bird disease, according to Sobhit Pal of the Bombay Natural History Society.For instance, Amur falcons take off from Nagaland, racing southwards and flying over three oceans to South Africa and onwards to Mongolia. The feathered flier clocks 22,000km, outstripping the air distance between Delhi and San Francisco, the world’s longest commercial flight way, by nearly 8,000km. It takes the bird roughly two months to make the journey. Nearly 370 species of birds, from the northern wheatear to yellow-rumped flycatcher – crisscross India from Europe, Russia and Mongolia each year, according to Pal. This brings joy to birders, but also makes the country vulnerable to bird flu, which has occurred 24 times across states since the first outbreak 2004. The last outbreak happened in 2016, infecting poultry in Delhi, Kerala, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh. Data from states show that back then, nearly 400,000 poultry was culled due to the outbreak.Bird flu also has serious economic impacts. Government records show nearly Rs 400 crore have been paid to poultry farmers from 2004 till 2016 as compensation for mass killing of birds.When the poultry business gets hit, prices of maize, used as feed, tend to crash, hurting farm incomes, said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. Most cases in 2016 too were determined to be of the H5N8 type.“H5N8 type is highly pathogenic but it isn’t known to easily transmit to humans,” a government official said on condition of anonymity, citing a World Health Organization (WHO) update on India.All states, particularly those already infected and their neighbours, have been asked to follow bio-security measures for implementing the National Action Plan for Control and Containment of the Avian Influenza guidelines, which prescribe proper sanitisation, separation, use of PPE kits, surveillance and culling, among other measures.The agriculture ministry has said the National Institute for High Security Animal Diseases, which functions in coordination with the World Organisation for Animal Health, along with four specialised regional labs, is coordinating efforts to contain the outbreak.The government hasn’t banned poultry for human consumption. All bird sanctuaries with lakes have been advised to keep a close watch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crisscrossing-migration-puts-india-at-high-risk-say-experts/story-098ChCwiZbGpdj2ShH0BLN.html
07-01-2021||India||Vaccine drive: Those below 50 but with comorbidities may spike numbers under third category||The number of eligible people for the Covid-19 vaccine in the third category comprising those above 50 years and those with comorbidities in Delhi is going to be more than 4.2 million as was initially estimated by the city administration last month, senior government officials said on Wednesday.While the numbers of healthcare workers (300,000) and front line workers (600,000) remain roughly the same, a major spike in the number of beneficiaries is going to be seen in the “under 50 with comorbidities” category as the initial estimate of 4.2 million included only those above 50 years of age, a senior health official said.Government data accessed by HT showed that the 4.2 million beneficiaries in the third category are only those above the age of 50 years as per the electoral rolls. The age of the beneficiary as on January 1 will be considered for vaccination.Senior officials in the state chief electoral officer’s (Delhi CEO) office said the Delhi government estimate of 4.2 million is “nearly correct”.“As per the electoral roll published on January 6, 2020, Delhi had nearly 4 million people who are 50 and above. The electoral roll published on January 18, 2019, had over 3.6 million such voters. From 2019-2020 we had seen an increase of 8.6% in the 50 and above segment of voters. Till November 16, 2020, we added 151,723 new voters to Delhi’s electoral rolls taking the total voters in Delhi up to at least 14,843,859,” said an electoral officer on condition of anonymity. “As per the electoral roll published on January 6, 2020, Delhi had nearly 4 million people who are 50 and above. It’s been a year since then, so the number of such voters should be nearly 4.2 million as on date,” an electoral officer said, on condition of anonymity.However, complete data of those below the age of 50 having comorbidities is still being collected at the district level, a senior revenue official said. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the numbers announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last month across the three categories for the first phase of vaccination were broad estimates which are likely to change as the registration process intensifies.“The combined number of people who will get the Covid-19 vaccine shot in the first phase is fixed at around 5.1 million. However, the numbers within the categories of healthcare and front line workers are likely to decrease as their eligibility is being verified during the registration process. So, the vaccine shots slotted for other categories will also be given to the third category of 50+ people and those with comorbidities. Nevertheless, there is no need to panic and get stuck on specific numbers. Our vaccination programme will be an inclusive one and every one will get a shot sooner or later,” said Jain.On Tuesday, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul, during a press briefing, had said that the central government will soon release the inclusion criteria for states to identify those with comorbidities and prepare the priority list as per the severity of the comorbid conditions. “A committee has been constituted to identify comorbid conditions that increase the risk of mortality if the person contracts Covid-19. The committee will decide criteria for inclusion such as for how they had the condition, or what a report needs to show. The committee will also suggest ways in which the criteria can be implemented. The report of the committee is expected within a couple of days. We will consider it and move ahead,” Dr Paul had said. Senior officials in at least six of the 11 districts in Delhi said that a database of Delhi residents below the age of 50 with comorbidities was not available with them as on Wednesday. “Each district has readied the list of those above 50 years of age from the electoral rolls. The districts have also gone a step further and segregated those who are 60 or more years. However, there is only a rudimentary database available as of now on the people below the age of 50 with comorbidities,” said a district magistrate on condition of anonymity. A sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of South district who did not wish to be named said, “We have some data from the multiple surveys conducted during the last seven months. But, we don’t know whether that will be used or if some other mechanism will be used. We are told the Centre will issue some guidelines on how to identify and prioritise those below 50 with comorbidities.”But, some areas such as the southeast district have asked their surveyors to continue with the door-to-door survey which began from hotspots and containment zones on November 20.“That time, the focus was mostly on identifying comorbidities among high risk groups which includes senior citizens and pregnant women. Now, we have asked our anganwadi workers to specifically ask the age of a person and the types of comorbidities one has. It is true there is no fresh proforma to carry out the survey for identification of vaccination beneficiaries as of now,” said a senior official of the district.An Asha worker employed at a dispensary in southwest Delhi and currently involved in survey work said, “We have been asked to collect health data of those 60 years and above for the list of Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries. In addition, we have been asked to collect information of people who are 50-year-old and above with comorbidities as of now.”The country is set to roll out the vaccine first among the healthcare workers within 10 days of the two vaccines – by Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech – receiving emergency use authorisation from the apex drug regulator. Dropping by at the vaccination sites, however, will not help in registering for the vaccine.As per a senior Delhi government official, “Those above the age of 50 not on the electoral roll can either register themselves on the Co-WIN app or go to their Block Medical Officer to get registered. Those under the age of 50 with comorbidities will also have to do the same but they would need a doctor’s certificate on their current condition.” As for those who do not have an address proof of Delhi, any government issued ID proof along with a photo certificate issued by their workplace and verified by a gazetted officer will be acceptable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-drive-those-below-50-but-with-comorbidities-may-spike-numbers-under-third-category/story-KpA40QR25veFdAR39dOsEP.html

The minister has, however, hit back saying that he wants Abhishek Banerjee to tender an unconditional apology to the people of West Bengal for whatever Bhaipo (nephew) and Pishi (aunt) have done to the people of Bengal.The legal notice, sent through advocate Sanjay Basu, has also accused Supriyo of contempt of court and deliberate disobedience of court orders, including the Calcutta High Court. Supriyo had on December 31, 2020, while addressing the media allegedly said that Banerjee had used his black money earnings from cow smuggling, sand smuggling and iron smuggling to build his palatial house. “By making defamatory statements in violation of the orders of the city civil court and Calcutta High Court you have caused to willfully and deliberately violate and disobey the orders dated July 24, 2018 and July 5, 2019 passed by the courts,” the legal notice stated. Abhishek Banerjee happens to be the nephew of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The notice was sent on January 4. The notice says that Supriyo should withdraw his statements and “issue an unconditional apology within 72 hours retracting the alleged virulent and mala-fide statements and giving appropriate clarification for the same.” “I want Abhishek Banerjee to tender an unconditional apology to the people of Bengal for whatever the Bhaipo-Pishi (nephew-aunt) syndicate has done to the people of Bengal. As far as the legal notice is concerned, the legal team will send an appropriate response. He (Abhishek Banerjee) sends a plethora of defamation suits to all BJP leaders. It would be a hard job for my lawyers to find out which one he is talking about. He has his own interpretation of what the court says,” said Supriyo. This is, however, not the first time that BJP leaders have attacked the TMC supremo and her nephew over alleged corruption and nepotism. In most cases, however, the BJP leaders didn’t name the duo and launched veiled attacks. Supriyo, however, allegedly named Abhishek Banerjee in his statements. “We all know that our Bhaipo (nephew), who thinks that no one has the courage to take his name, so I’ll use his name “Abhishek Banerjee,” Supriyo had said according to the notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-s-abhishek-banerjee-sends-legal-notice-to-babul-supriyo-demands-an-apology-within-72-hours/story-8G4XuO1JZyudursiUYeyFI.html
07-01-2021||India||Farmers protest highlights: Mega waterproof tent installed at Singhu border as stir continues amid rain||Thousands of farmers protesting near Delhi against the Centre’s three farm laws have decided to postpone their tractor march by a day as sporadic rain hampered their plans to stage a protest. The tractor march, now scheduled to be held on January 7, is a glimpse of how farmers are planning to intensify their protest after the government on January 4 refused to repeal the laws.“We will take out tractor march at four borders of Delhi including Eastern and Western peripheral. This will be a trailer for what lies ahead on January 26. As you know that the government has held seven formal rounds of talks with the farmers on January 4,” Swaraj India’s Yogendra Yadav, who has joined the protests, said.“Seven months have passed when the ordinance was brought and later made into law. We are demanding the repeal of these laws. The only option left is to intensify our protest,” he added. Why are the farmers protesting?Through one of the largest strikes in decades witnessed by India, the farmers are demanding the repeal of the three contentious laws. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has, however, tried to allay these fears and even said that it is ready to discuss changes to the law. The government has made it clear that it won’t scrap these laws.Here are the highlights:Mega waterproof tent installed at Singhu border as stir continues amid rainAmid the rainfall reported in the national capital and neighbouring regions, protesters installed a mega tent at centre stage where their leaders address protesters every day. The 60 feet x 280 feet dimension waterproof tent covers the sitting area in front of the main stage. Discussions with farmers opportunity to explain them benefits of laws: GoyalUnion minister Piyush Goyal said on Wednesday that he considers the ongoing discussions with farmers as an opportunity to explain them the benefits of the new farm laws against which they have been protesting. “For example, when I go along with Agriculture Minister Tomar for discussions with farmer unions, should I see that as a problem for myself or as an opportunity that I am getting,” he said.Madhya Pradesh Congress leaders take out tractor rally in CM’s home districtThe Madhya Pradesh Congress leaders had taken out a tractor rally in chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s home district of Sehore to protest against the farm laws.  Madhya Pradesh Congress leaders take out tractor rally in Sehore, the home district of CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, to protest against #FarmLawsWill approach SC regarding farm laws: Punjab CMPunjab chief minister captain Amarinder Singh said that he would approach the Supreme Court regarding the farm laws since he felt that they were ‘anti-farmer bills’. We are very clear in our mind, these are anti-farmer Bills.

07-01-2021||Editorials||The destructive legacy of Donald Trump | HT Editorial||On Wednesday, what was once unimaginable happened on the streets of Washington DC. After having conclusively lost the presidential elections, Donald Trump — who has, baselessly, claimed the process was riddled with fraud and he was cheated out of a victory — incited a mob to march to the Capitol Hill. Mr Trump first tried to block the election certification process by telling his Vice President, Mike Pence, the presiding officer of the Senate, to block the results. When Mr Pence, rightly, did not do so, he resorted to egging his supporters on to do so through mob action. In the process, he disrespected the electoral mandate; undermined a fundamental tenet of democracy — the peaceful transfer of power; eroded America’s moral authority globally; indirectly caused outright violence; and showed why he never deserved to occupy the world’s most powerful office. The US will find it hard to live down one of the darkest days in its political and constitutional history. The mob violence only showed the hard task of democratic restoration that lies ahead of the Joe Biden administration. It revealed the absence of either principle or spine in the Republican Party — which enabled Mr Trump’s rise and looked the other way for way too long. And it will substantially damage Washington’s position to speak on the democratic deficit in the rest of the globe, at a time when the world is confronted with the rise of belligerent non-democratic States. But it is important, to safeguard domestic stability in the US and other democracies, to understand how Mr Trump could do what he did on Wednesday in the first place. A leader obsessed with building a personality cult, who has no hesitation in trampling over constitutional processes and institutions, and who has a strong streak of ethno-nationalism based on demonising minorities, can easily turn into an undemocratic and authoritarian figure. All those who dismissed Mr Trump as merely idiosyncratic rather than as a danger to democracy itself underestimated his destructive instincts. He must be held accountable, immediately — for leaving the country and the world with Mr Trump enjoying executive power for another two weeks till the inauguration is laced with risks. The US has, for long, preached the values of democracy and accountability. It is time to put it in practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-destructive-legacy-of-donald-trump-ht-editorial/story-sU2kwvyPxED0F7lpNBi9zM.html
07-01-2021||Editorials||Farm unions must be flexible | HT Editorial||On Friday, the government and protesting farm organisations will have the eighth round of talks to find a resolution to the standoff over the new farm laws. The agitation, led primarily by farmers from Punjab and Haryana, at Delhi’s borders, is now in its second month — and they have continued in severe cold, facing unseasonal rains, and at great cost to human lives and comfort. And the farm unions have a singular demand — repeal the laws. This maximalist approach, however, could be counterproductive.This newspaper believes that the government erred in not ensuring a process of adequate consultation and legislative scrutiny before the passage of the laws. It also should have read the mood on the ground in Punjab, refrained from a coercive response at the beginning, and understood the spirit behind the movement. But it must be acknowledged that the government, after its initial missteps, has consistently reached out to the farmers; it has shown flexibility in offering a set of amendments to the laws which would allay a set of apprehensions of the farmers; it has even agreed to roll back certain provisions on penalising farmers for their ecologically harmful practices. Yet, the farm unions have adopted a hard stance — in other words, my way or the highway.The fact is that an elected government, with an overwhelming legislative mandate, has the right to pass laws. Opposition to laws is legitimate. But this must not happen at the cost of economic logic, and even humanitarian consequences for fellow citizens and protesters themselves. By adopting an approach that settles for nothing less than a repeal, farmers are putting at risk the sympathy they have garnered from other quarters. Political leadership entails give and take. Agriculture needs modernisation, great interface with industry, and more choice for farmers. Institutionalising MSP in law is poor economics — even though the government must continue to offer support to farmers at all stages of the production cycle and during procurement when possible. While the government should continue to show flexibility and sensitivity, the ball is firmly in the court of farm unions to engage responsibly. The movement has already brought the issues concerning agriculture and the need for income security to the national centre stage. It is time for a resolution now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/farm-unions-must-be-flexible-ht-editorial/story-IWSTZk5BZhcLHLse147w8O.html
07-01-2021||Editorials||Where India and US diverge | HT Editorial||Over the past quarter century, the United States (US) has emerged as India’s primary economic and security partner, as well as home to India’s largest and most successful diaspora. These are incontrovertible facts cited by Kenneth Juster, the outgoing US ambassador to India and representative of the temperamental administration of President Donald Trump. He noted there remained gaps between the two democracies which would need to be addressed as they moved closer. The real concern is whether larger, more fundamental differences are arising which would drive India and the US in different directions or stall the evolution of bilateral relations.Mr Juster suggested that the idea of self-reliance, if taken beyond a certain point, would weigh down the trajectory of bilateral cooperation in defence and economics. He accepted it was natural that India wanted to have an indigenous defence industry, but unrealistic expectations regarding technology or the abilities of Indian firms would strain the defence relationship. There is an additional issue of India’s practice of buying bits and pieces of its arsenal from different countries and the degree it is incompatible with network-centred warfare, exactly where China is investing heavily. The issue of self-reliance in economics and investment is a more direct concern. India has begun constructing a wall of tariffs and other economic barriers against Chinese economic influence. However, New Delhi is now moving down a slippery slope where such trade barriers are seen as an easy path to domestic economic recovery and are being applied across the board. The US may be right to warn such policies are incompatible with sustained economic growth. But with Washington also moving in this direction, it is increasingly hard for a US envoy to make the case for economic openness.India and the US talk about a free and open Indo-Pacific but what they are practising is not fully aligned. There is a strong case for India and the US to consider creating an economic and technological partnership, in both civilian and military spheres, underpinned by concerns about China. The mantra behind all this should be strategic economic relations rather than the more exclusive and ultimately negative banner of economic nationalism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/where-india-and-us-diverge-ht-editorial/story-fPy0uthKnZr3iRrt6O8CLL.html
