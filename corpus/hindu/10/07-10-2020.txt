07 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Will ensure smooth probe into Hathras gang rape, says SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would ensure that the investigation into the alleged gang-rape and torture and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl by upper caste Hindus in Hathras would be conducted smoothly. “We will ensure the investigation part is smooth,” Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, heading the three-judge Bench, said. The court ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to file an affidavit and place it on record that the witnesses in the case are protected. “We want it on affidavit on how Hathras case witnesses are protected. We want you to ascertain whether the victim’s family has chosen a lawyer. We want to know the scope of the ongoing proceedings in the case before the Allahabad High Court and how we can widen and make it more relevant,” Chief Justice Bobde addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the State government. ‘Horrible and shocking’ The Chief Justice said there was no doubt that what transpired with the victim was “horrible” and “shocking”. There was no doubt that the case was “extraordinary”, the court said. The court is hearing a petition filed by Satyam Dubey to transfer the case to the CBI or form a special investigation team to probe the case under the supervision of the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/will-ensure-smooth-probe-into-hathras-gang-rape-says-sc/article32787439.ece
07 October 2020||New Delhi,||Centre to fix jurisdiction of river boards||The Centre will determine the jurisdictions of the Krishna and Godavari river management boards (KRMB and GRMB), Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said on Tuesday. He was speaking after convening an apex council meeting involving the Centre, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the second since 2016. The meeting is primarily to resolve the conflict between the two States over executing irrigation projects and sharing water from the Krishna and Godavari rivers. Key points The key points on the agenda at Thursday’s meeting which was convened via videoconference are: jurisdiction of the KRMB and GRMB, submission of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) of new projects by the two governments for appraisal and sanction by the apex council, establishing a mechanism to determine the share of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the Krishna and Godavari waters. Shifting of the KRMB office from Hyderabad to Andhra Pradesh — Amaravati/Vijayawada or any other city — was another important outcome of the Apex Council meeting. “The Centre will go ahead with notifying the jurisdiction of both KRMB & GRMB. Telangana Chief Minister dissented on this, but as per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, no consensus is needed. Both Chief Ministers agreed to submit the DPRs of all the projects taken up by their States. Their technical appraisal will be done in the shortest possible timeframe,” said Mr. Shekhawat. “We have taken the decision to enable the two boards function properly by notifying their purview as the Centre has powers to do so under the provisions of Reorganisation Act,” Mr. Shekhawat said. The headquarters of the KRMB would be located in AP, he added. With regards to sharing of river waters, the Telangana Chief Minister agreed to withdraw the case filed in Supreme Court, to allow the Centre to refer water sharing issues to the Krishna Godavari tribunal. Regarding the sharing of Godavari waters, both the States were asked to send in their requests to the Centre so that it could refer them to the tribunal, a statement from the Water Resources Ministry said. As expected, Chief Minister of Telangana K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, availed the opportunity to put forth their States’ argument on issues related to river waters. While Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao reiterated the injustice being done to Telangana in the matter of river water allocation from the days of combined Andhra Pradesh State and explained the perennial impact of the neighbouring State’s plans to divert Krishna water from Srisailam reservoir by taking up a new lift scheme such as the Rayalaseema lift irrigation scheme and enhancement of the carrying capacity of the Pothireddypadu head regulator, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy stressed on the impact of projects being executed by Telangana in Godavari Basin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-to-fix-jurisdiction-of-river-boards/article32787368.ece

07 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||A child has to learn mother tongue to gain a foundation: apex court||A child has to learn his mother tongue to gain a foundation, the Supreme Court accosted Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Andhra government’s logic that children, without learning English, get ‘isolated’. “For foundation, it is very important that a child learns his mother tongue,” Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde addressed senior advocate K.V. Vishwanathan, for the State government. The Andhra Pradesh government has approached the Supreme Court challenging its State High Court decision to strike down a government order of November 2019 which made English medium education compulsory from classes I to VI in primary, upper primary and high schools under all managements from 2020-21. It was to be gradually extended to each further class from the consequent academic years. Mr. Vishwanathan vehemently argued that English as the medium of learning has not been imposed on children. The choice of their parents would prevail. The government order is a “progressive measure”. He said Dalits, the oppressed, find the State’s move as progressive measure. Vernacular medium of education has its limits. “They have been kept in islands, isolated. The fees [in private English medium schools] are exorbitant,” Mr. Vishwanathan argued. The senior advocate said even the medium of language in the Supreme Court is English. The State cannot be restrained from taking progressive measures. But Chief Justice Bobde said there are “huge divergent issues” on the subject which needs to be extensively addressed and decided to hear it next week. The Union Ministry of Education has informed the Supreme Court that it is fully backing a push for “mother tongue” as medium of instruction in schools. The use of “home language” for learning will bridge the gap between the intelligentsia and the masses. It said an order was issued on September 10 to academic authorities, including CBSE, NCERT and NCTE, to initiate the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP), which was approved by the Union Cabinet in July 2020, to promote ‘mutlingualism’ and use of “home language” as a mode of instruction. The Centre’s affidavit had come in response to the court’s inclination to examine whether imposing English on a multitude of schoolchildren, whose language of instruction was their mother tongue, would amount to depriving them of an effective education guaranteed under Article 21A of the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/a-child-has-to-learn-mother-tongue-to-gain-a-foundation/article32787369.ece
07 October 2020||MANGALURU,||Much to the relief of Yakshagana artistes, melas to resume ‘tirugata’ from next month-end||Much to the relief of professional Yakshagana artistes, Minister for Endowment, Fisheries, Ports and Inland Transport Kota Srinivasa Poojari said here on Tuesday that Yakshagana melas (touring troupes) can commence their annual “tirugata” (professional tour) from this November-end. Speaking at a meeting of Yakshagana stakeholders in the office of Deputy Commissioner here on Tuesday, Mr. Poojari, who is also in-charge Minister of Dakshina Kannada, said that COVID-19 pushed many Yakshagana artistes into trouble since this March. Steps will be taken to provide financial assistance to such artistes from the government. The Minister said that Dakshina Kannada had over 20 melas of Tenku Thittu school of Yakshagana with more than 1,000 artistes and assistants. The artistes and assistants should get themselves tested for COVID-19 before starting the tour next month. The owners of melas should ensure that all the artistes and assistants were tested once in every week for COVID-19. It is to ensure the health of all. The artistes should prepare mentally and physically for the tour, he said and added that no artiste should remain unemployed. The Minister instructed the officials of the Muzrai and Kannada and Culture departments to document the details of artistes. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra asked the managers of melas to ensure that not more than 200 people gathered for a show. The surroundings of the venues of the show should be sanitised, social distancing should be maintained and audience should wear face masks, he said. A representative of Kateel mela said that all six troupes of the mela have made arrangements to start the tour. Representatives of Bappanadu, Sasihitlu and other melas spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/much-to-the-relief-of-yakshagana-artistes-melas-to-resume-tirugata-from-next-month-end/article32788066.ece
07 October 2020||Kolkata,||West Bengal Governor tweets rape, kidnapping figures||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday tweeted the figures of rapes and kidnapping in the State reported in the month of August 2020 triggering a vehement denial by the State’s home department. “Rapes-223 and Kidnappings-639 @MamataOfficial in August 2020 as per official reports indicate worrisome state of crime against women - a cause of concern. Time to douse fire under feet and put law and order in place @WBPolice @KolkataPolice, before attending flames elsewhere,” Mr. Dhankhar tweeted along with screen shots of a district-wise breakup of crimes in the month of August. The tweet triggered strong reactions from the home department which took to social media to call the allegations baseless and assert that the figures were not based on official data. “Rajbhavan dissemination of WB “statistics” on rape and kidnapping is not based on any official report, data, or information. Allegations are baseless, ill-founded, and misguiding: totally incongruous with authentic facts and figures,” the official handle of the home department said from its official Twitter handle. The Governor responded by calling the tweet a “terrible misrepresentation” and added that all figures are after “due diligence”. “Stunned@MamataOfficial terrible misrepresentation. Must apologetically withdraw and make amends. Statistics of Rapes-223 and Kidnappings-639 in August 2020 emanate from authentic reports officially sent to me from each of Divisions. All figures after due diligence.” Mr. Dhankhar said. He also warned that those “responsible for such outrageously incorrect assertions to run down a constitutional office will not be without consequences”. “Such a stance in public interest cannot be countenanced. Action will surely ensue. Hope they are as quick with truth as with falsehood and make amends,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/west-bengal-governor-tweets-rape-kidnapping-figures/article32787671.ece

07 October 2020||Benglauru,||Schools, PU colleges in State to remain closed this month||Schools and pre-university colleges will not reopen in Karnataka this month despite the Centre allowing States to resume classes from October 15 in a phased manner under Unlock 5. However, with the number of COVID-19 cases showing no signs of dropping, the State government is reluctant to reopen schools. A meeting was convened on Tuesday by B. Sriramalu, Health and Family Welfare Minister, with officials from the Department of Primary and Secondary Education and the chairman of the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Sriramalu said the Health Department will submit a report with a list of its recommendations. A source in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education said they had asked the Health Department when it was feasible for schools and PU colleges to reopen. “We have also sought advice on which classes can be started first and what kind of cooperation can be expected from community representatives,” said the source. According to a senior official in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education, more precautions need to be put in place to ensure the safety of students and staff. “We have not made any preparations for reopening schools. We have issued an SOP but that is not enough. Our schools need to adopt several precautionary measures, and it will not be feasible to do all of that in a week.” He added that parents, the department had consulted with, did not want schools to reopen so quickly. The Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS) opined that the government should allow students from grades nine to 12 to return to the classroom after all safety measures have been put in place. KAMS in a letter to the department also said that only three hours of classes should be allowed in the first month, and recommended a ban on gatherings and lunch breaks. KAMS also said they would prefer to conduct classes on alternate days rather than adopt a shift system. Schools have urged the department to ensure that COVID-19 tests are conducted on the school premises for staff, and to subsidise the cost of sanitisers and thermal scanners. Incidentally, the Centre on Monday issued SOPs and guidelines for health and safety protocols for reopening of schools and learning with physical/social distancing. As per the guidelines, schools and coaching institutions can reopen after October 15, in a graded manner, which had to be decided by State governments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/schools-pu-colleges-in-state-to-remain-closed-this-month/article32787586.ece
07 October 2020||Stockholm,||Black hole researchers get Physics Nobel||Roger Penrose of Britain, Reinhard Genzel of Germany and Andrea Ghez of the U.S. won the Nobel Physics Prize on Tuesday for their research into what the Nobel committee called “one of the most exotic phenomena in the universe, the black hole”. Mr. Penrose, 89, was honoured for showing “that the general theory of relativity leads to the formation of black holes”, while Mr. Genzel, 68, and Ms. Ghez, 55, were jointly awarded for discovering “that an invisible and extremely heavy object governs the orbits of stars at the centre of our galaxy”, the jury said. Ms. Ghez is just the fourth woman to receive the physics prize since 1901 when the first Nobel prizes were handed out. “I feel delighted to be recognised in that way because I think having visible role models can make a huge impact on young women thinking about becoming scientists,” Ms. Ghez said. The first woman to win the prize was Marie Curie in 1903, who was also the first person to receive two Nobel prizes when she won the 1911 chemistry prize. The term “black hole” refers to a point in space where matter is so compressed as to create a gravity field from which even light cannot escape. For years, physicists questioned whether black holes could really exist but Mr. Penrose, a professor at the University of Oxford, used mathematical modelling to prove back in 1965 that black holes can form. His calculations proved that black holes — super dense objects formed when a heavy star collapses under the weight of its own gravity — are a direct consequence of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the Nobel Prize winners in physics, chemistry and economics, said Mr. Penrose’s 1965 article “is still regarded as the most important contribution to the general theory of relativity since Einstein”. Mr. Penrose also worked closely with famed physicist Stephen Hawking, who died in 2018, and some experts lamented that he was no longer around to share the credit. Mr. Genzel and Ms. Ghez have led research since the early 1990s focusing on a region called Sagittarius A* at the centre of the Milky Way. Using the world’s largest telescopes, they discovered an extremely heavy, invisible object — around 4 million times greater than the mass of the Sun — that pulls on surrounding stars, giving the galaxy its characteristic swirl.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/3-black-hole-researchers-get-nobel-prize-for-physics/article32787443.ece

07 October 2020||CHENNAI,||Police seize 510 kg of ganja||City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal on Tuesday said police personnel were conducting an intensive special drive against drugs across the city. Over 1,680 kg of ganja was seized from drug cartels in the last three months. As many as 201 cases were booked and 368 accused arrested for possession and sale of the contraband, he said. Trailed gang for 3 days On Tuesday, the Commissioner inspected a major seizure of ganja by a special team of police personnel in Madhavaram. The team led by Madhavaram Deputy Commissioner of Police K. Balakrishnan shadowed a gang for three days. On the receipt of credible information, they intercepted a tanker lorry carrying contraband from Andhra Pradesh in the early hours of Tuesday. On inspecting the tanker, they found a secret chamber in which the ganja was concealed. The contraband was being smuggled from Vishakapatinam to Chennai and from here to Madurai, the police said. About 510 kg of ganja was seized and the driver was arrested. The total worth of the contraband could be around Rs. 70 lakh, they added. Talking to reporters, Mr. Aggarwal said, “All personnel have been taking effective action. We are not stopping with just the seizure of drugs and the arrest of suppliers, we also trace the retailers and nab them as well. In case the retailers are caught, we also trace the origin and nab the suppliers. We are also arresting suspects who are holed up in Andhra Pradesh.” Mr. Aggarwal said going by statistics, it could not be said that the number of murders had suddenly risen. He listed out the steps which had been taken to reduce the crime rate. “We are trying to prevent all crime and are invoking the Goondas Act against history-sheeters. The Deputy Commissioners in 12 police districts are using the powers conferred on them to frequently initiate proceedings against the offenders,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/during-special-drive-police-seize-510-kg-of-ganja-in-madhavaram/article32787942.ece

07 October 2020||CHANDIGARH,||I see in Hathras a major tragedy: Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said it was Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s prerogative to see an “international conspiracy” in the Hathras incident, but he “personally sees in it a major tragedy”. “Yogi Aditynath is entitled to his opinion, he can imagine what he wants, but what I saw was a lovely girl brutalised and killed, and her family threatened and subjugated,” he stated at a press conference in Patiala. Mr. Gandhi said he saw a tragedy in the incident and Mr. Adityanath should also have had the decency to do so. He said he found it interesting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not uttered a word about the incident, in which “a kid was raped and murdered and her whole family was under attack by the administration”. On FIRs being registered against many Congress workers, Mr. Gandhi said what he and his party workers suffered was minor compared to what the victim’s family was going through. “They are the ones who have really been pushed around.” Responding to a question that the Centre was able to take unilateral decisions because of a weak Opposition, he said, “give me free press and other key institutions and this [NDA] government will not last long.” ‘Institutions captured’ He noted that the Opposition in any country functioned within a framework, including the media, the judicial system and institutions that protected the voice of people. “In India, that entire framework has been controlled and captured by the Bharatiya Janata Party government; the entire architecture designed for giving voice to the people has been captured,” he said. No other country in the world today was faced with a situation where even the media did not question the government when its land had been seized by another nation, he said. “Mr. Modi is not interested in India’s people but is only concerned about protecting and promoting his image, which would have got dented had he admitted to China’s incursion. The media, by helping promote his image, is also to blame,” said Mr. Gandhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-see-in-hathras-a-major-tragedy-rahul/article32787391.ece
07 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Digital platform to track vaccine supply||The Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday that it was expecting COVID-19 vaccine supplies to be available from early next year. At a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said: “If all goes well, we are looking at vaccine supplies coming in the first quarter of next year. There is a digital platform that is being enhanced to track on real-time basis the vaccine movement, from procurement, storage to distribution and administration.” Discussions were under way on the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, he said. Balram Bhargava, director-general, Indian Council of Medical Research, said at the press conference that its studies had found no benefit of plasma therapy. Combined trials Sources said an expert panel at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) had asked Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories to submit a revised protocol for conducting Phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials in India for the Russian vaccine. The Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company had applied to the Drugs Controller-General of India late last week for permission to conduct Phase 3 trials. The Subject Expert Committee on COVID-19 at the CDSCO, which held its meeting on Monday, discussed the application, and asked the firm to submit a revised protocol stating that it will have to conduct trials for combined phases, sources said. The firm has been asked to provide some other information as well. “It means that Dr. Reddy’s laboratories will have to submit a new application. According to the Subject Expert Committee, they have to conduct both Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials and cannot directly hold phase-3 trial,” a source said. Dr. Reddy’s has collaborated with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct trials of Sputnik V vaccine as well as for its distribution. Upon regulatory approval in India, the RDIF shall supply to Dr. Reddy’s 100 million doses of the vaccine, the firm had said last month. 884 deaths in 24 hours Dismissing reports of India having reached and crossed its COVID-19 peak, Mr. Bhushan said that with the festival season round the corner, this was no time to lower the guard. The Ministry said that 48% of COVID-related deaths were being reported from 25 districts in eight States, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, adding that the Ministry was in talks with these States to control the deaths. “The target is to bring down the overall fatality below 1%,” Mr. Bhushan said. He added that 884 case fatalities were reported in 24 hours. “India continues to report a trend of steadily declining active cases as a percentage of the total positive cases. Presently, the active cases comprise 13.75% of the total positive cases of the country, standing at 9,19,023. The declining trend of the percentage of active cases is commensurately supported by the rising percentage of recovered cases. The total recovered cases stand at 56,62,490. The gap between recovered cases and active cases has crossed 47 lakh (47,43,467). Higher number of recoveries has aided the national recovery rate to further improve to 84.70%,” he said. The Ministry noted that 75,787 patients got discharged in 24 hours, whereas the new confirmed cases stood at 61,267. “74% of the new recovered cases are concentrated in 10 States/Union Territories, namely Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal. Maharashtra alone has contributed the maximum with nearly 13,000 single-day recoveries,” said Mr. Bhushan. On the insurance claims of deceased healthcare workers, Mr. Bhushan said that in 95 cases of deaths of healthcare workers engaged in COVID-19 duties, insurance had been claimed for Rs. 50 lakh each. A total of 176 claims are in process. In addition, 79 claims are yet to be received from different States. Vaidya Rajesh Katoch, Secretary (AYUSH), who was present at the press conference, said the Ministry had released the National Clinical Management Protocol based on ayurveda and yoga for COVID-19 management.

07 October 2020||Kolkata,||Home Ministry meet on GTA sparks confusion||Confusion, speculation and also some resentment have prevailed in the Darjeeling hills over a meeting called by the Union Home Minister on the “issues related to Gorkhaland Territorial Administration”. Scheduled on October 7, the representatives of the Centre, officials of the State government and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha have been invited for the tripartite meeting. The earlier version of the meeting notice issued by the Home Ministry’s Centre State division said “Meeting to discuss issues related to Gorkhaland-reg’. The term Gorkhaland is synonymous to the long-standing demand of a separate State of the people of Darjeeling hills and the reference to Gorkhaland created strong reactions in West Bengal. The Trinamool Congress leadership which has always opposed any talks on Gorkhaland said it was a ploy to divide the State. The Home Ministry later changed the subject to “issues related to Gorkhaland Territorial Administration”. The GTA is the regional autonomous body formed as a result of the State, Centre and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) tripartite agreement in 2011. Neeraj Tamang Zimba, who won the Darjeeling Assembly seat on a BJP ticket, told The Hindu that the development has led to “confusion among the people of the hills”. “It shows that the Centre is not serious about finding a political solution to the Darjeeling hills, the way it is for other long-pending issues like the people of Ladakh and Nagaland,” Mr. Zimba said. The MLA said no elected representatives in Darjeeling Hills has been invited to the meeting. While it is not clear whether the officials of the State government will attend the meeting or not, the Home Ministry has also extended an invite to the president Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) to participate in the meeting. Two factions The party has two factions one led by its founder Bimal Gurung and another by Benoy Tamang. While Mr. Gurung had to leave the hills after the violent 100-day statehood stir in 2017, it is the Benoy Tamang faction of the GJM which wields control over the GTA with the support of the Trinamool Congress. Both the factions claim that they represent the party and the matter is also sub judice.  Trinamool Congress leader from Darjeeling district and State Minister Gautam Deb said whenever elections are around, the BJP rakes up the issue of Gorkhaland. “From Trinamool Congress we are very clear that there should be no talks on any subject that leads to the division of Bengal.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/home-ministry-meet-on-gta-sparks-confusion/article32787409.ece
07 October 2020||KOCHI,||‘Main conspirators’ in gold smuggling case held in UAE||Faisal Fareed and Rabins Hameed, two “main conspirators” in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case, have been arrested in the UAE. The UAE authorities, who arrested the two accused, have informed the National Investigation Agency (NIA) that strict action would be taken against all conspirators as the “accused in the case had attempted to damage the friendly relations between India and the UAE,” the NIA submitted before the Special Judge considering the case on Tuesday. It was while opposing the bail plea of Muhammad Shafi, an accused in the case, that the NIA made the revelations. The UAE authorities had revealed that the crimes were committed by Fareed and Hameed pursuant to the conspiracy hatched with the other accused who were arrested in India. They were on the run in the UAE. All the accused had knowingly funded, facilitated and smuggled gold through the diplomatic cargo of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram by forging or deceitfully obtaining the authorisation certificates from the UAE diplomats, it stated. The NIA said it had moved the Interpol for issuing Blue Corner notices against the “fugitives,” Fareed and Hameed, Siddiqul Akbar, Ahamed Kutty, Raju, and Mohammad Shameer, for securing their presence in India. The request for mutual legal assistance is being finalised for obtaining the evidence in this case from the UAE, as a major part of the transactions, especially funding through reverse hawala and purchase of smuggled gold, had taken place in the UAE. Multiple occasions The agency submitted that the investigations revealed that Shafi was one of the prime accused who invested, arranged and facilitated the smuggling of gold through the diplomatic baggage of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on multiple occasions with the other accused in the case. He had also facilitated the camouflaging and concealment of gold in the baggages in the UAE to avoid detection by customs authorities, the agency submitted in the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/main-conspirators-in-gold-smuggling-case-held-in-uae/article32787362.ece

In response to summons issued last week, Bineesh appeared at the ED office in Shanti Nagar, Bengaluru, on Tuesday. According to sources, he is being questioned about his links with the accused, Mohammed Anoop. Anoop is one of the three people arrested by the NCB in August. During the raids, the narcotics agency had recovered a huge cache of methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) pills and party drugs. During the course of their investigations, NCB officials tied Mr. Anoop to Bineesh. The latter had allegedly loaned money to the accused to set up a restaurant in Kammanahalli. The ED, which is looking at the finances of these peddlers and their sources, for money laundering and hawala transactions, had recently conducted an audit of their finances, questioned them and recorded their statements at Parappana Agrahara Central Prison, where they are currently lodged. “Mohammed Anoop in his statement said that Bineesh Kodiyeri had lent him Rs. 50 lakh. We will question him as to what are his links with a peddler, for what purpose was the money given, what was the source of this money and whether he has declared it in his financial statements,” a senior ED official had told The Hindu at the time of issuing a summons.

A high-voltage drama was witnessed at Haryana’s border with Punjab when the Congress’s ‘tractor-rally’ (Kheti Bachao Yatra) was stopped for a while, with Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja accusing that the Haryana police didn’t allow the party leaders and workers to enter the State.

07 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Solar projects may come under lens||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is not only probing the disproportionate assets allegedly amassed by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar, but is also digging into “certain specific decisions by him” when he was Energy Minister of the State, to see whether there was any quid pro quo involved, CBI sources said. On Monday, the CBI raided 14 premises linked to Mr. Shivakumar and his brother and MP D.K Suresh. Most of these instances are reportedly related to the solar power sector, which received a big boost in the State during Mr. Shivakumar’s tenure but was also dogged by controversies. The CBI has taken the check period for the disproportionate assets investigation to be from April 1, 2013, to April 30, 2018 — the financial years during which he was Energy Minister in Karnataka. “Proving that he amassed disproportionate assets while holding public office is itself proof of corruption. But the case will only be strengthened if the prosecuting agency finds specific instances of quid pro quo and a money trail to establish corruption. The CBI probe will focus on this aspect as well,” a source in the agency said. The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has probed the complex web of financial transactions of the former Minister and his associates, not only booked him for money laundering, but also recommended a CBI probe under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The ED has reportedly shared leads on instances where illegal gratification is suspected. Most of these relate to solar power projects and the alleged interests his associates acquired in the sector when he was Minister, sources said. Questioned earlier The ED had earlier questioned MLA for Belagavi Rural Lakshmi Hebbalkar, a close associate of Mr. Shivakumar, and the KPCC chief’s daughter Aishwarya Shivakumar over theiralleged interests in solar power plants, acquired when he was Minister. The ED had also probed six solar power plants at Hagaribommanahalli, Ballari district, on the suspicion that they were benami properties of Mr. Shivakumar. The rooftop solar power generation scheme of 2016, which was also dogged by allegations of corruption, is also being looked into. Not just that, other power purchase agreements inked during his tenure are under the scanner, sources in the CBI said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/solar-projects-may-come-under-lens/article32787359.ece
07 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Telangana mulls new lift scheme at Srisailam||Toughening its stand in the matter of getting judicious share in the Krishna river waters, Telangana government on Tuesday made it clear that it would lift 3 tmcft water every day from the foreshores of Srisailam reservoir with a barrage between Alampur and Pedda Marur in case Andhra Pradesh failed to stop its illegal projects to divert Krishna water. In a statement issued after after the apex council meeting, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said it was time A.P. changed its high-handed attitude to illegally divert the Krishna water from Srisailam reservoir with a new lift scheme and by expanding the Pothireddypadu head regulator water drawal system. He pointed out that A.P. had acted against the interests of Telangana region during the combined dispensation, but it would not be allowed now. He condemned A.P.’s plans to divert huge quantity of water from Srisailam reservoir without having any allocation and ayacut. He said the Telangana society had been opposing Pothireddypadu, which was actually planned with a capacity to draw 1,500 cusecs but the high-handed attitude of the A.P. leadership had made the then government to construct it with 11,150 cusecs capacity and later enhanced by another 44,000 cusecs, all along the movement for statehood. Now, AP plans to increase it to 80,000 cusecs, he noted. Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao brought to the notice of the apex council how Telangana government had written to the Centre immediately after formation of the State, on July 14, 2014, seeking to constitute a new tribunal for sharing of river waters against under the provisions of Section 3 of the Inter State River Water Disputes Act, 1956. However, the Centre had not acted for over a year on its plea and later the State moved the Supreme Court for justice. “Telangana has no objection to withdraw its case in the Supreme Court if the Centre assures to constitute a new tribunal or give new terms of reference to the existing Brijesh Kumar Tribunal to take up allocation of water afresh,” the Chief Minister said in the virtual meeting. He also hoped that allocation of water to Telangana both in Krishna and Godavari rivers would go up if the matter was referred to a tribunal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ts-mulls-new-lift-scheme-at-srisailam/article32788026.ece

In its first resolution, the BMS demanded that the government immediately withdraw the provisions, including those curtailing the right to strike in the Industrial Relations Code, that would be detrimental to workers, he said. The government should hold a consultation with all unions to make the labour codes more beneficial to workers, he said. The BMS would observe October 10-16 as a “warning week” and to educate workers about the changes, he said. Protests would be held on October 28 and if the “voice of workers” is ignored by the government, then national level strikes would be organised, he said.

On Tuesday, the family protested by putting her body on the Baldev-Sadabad road in Hathras. The villagers relented only after Aligarh SSP Muniraj P. suspended the Iglas SHO for laxity in arresting the accused. Complaint denied The father of the girl said that after his wife’s death in January last, he had sent his two daughters to live at her aunt’s place in Iglas, on her request. The younger daughter, he said, was raped by her cousin on September 14. “We came to know about it on September 17, when I was told she had developed an infection in the private parts. I approached the Iglas Kotwali but the SHO refused to lodge a complaint,” he said. The FIR was finally lodged on September 21, when the condition of the girl deteriorated and she was shifted to the JN Medical College in Aligarh. “Instead of arresting the accused, the SHO held his brother, a minor and mentally challenged boy, for the crime. He was sent to a juvenile home. We demand the right culprit be put behind bars and my elder daughter restored to me,” said the father of the victim. Local sources said the aunt was absconding. The girl was referred to the JN Medical College and Hospital. When her condition deteriorated, she was referred to the Safdarjung Hospital, where she died on Monday. The SSP has ordered a departmental inquiry against the SHO, and the district magistrate announced a relief of Rs. 10 lakh to the family from the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/6-year-old-from-hathras-dies-20-days-after-rape/article32787392.ece

To facilitate the mission with minimum movement of personnel to the spaceport, the space agency is setting up a ‘virtual launch control centre’ at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) at Thumba here. A replica of the mission control centre at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, the virtual facility will enable the ISRO to remotely carry out system checkouts on the launch vehicle from Thiruvananthapuram prior to the mission. “Of course, we will still need personnel at Sriharikota for the actual integration and further pre-launch operations. But this way, the number of personnel who have to physically travel to Sriharikota for a mission can be cut down by 70 to 80%,” an official said. Hoping to make up for lost time, the space agency hopes to have the PSLV C-49 mission (RISAT-2BR2 radar imaging satellite) in November. COVID fallout The COVID-19 outbreak had upset ISRO’s launch schedule for this year.

07 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||First of three ‘low key’ tsunami mock drills held||The first of three proposed Indian Ocean wide tsunami exercises was taken up by the Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre (ITEWC) at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) here on Tuesday, by simulating an earthquake followed by issuance of warning bulletins to 23 countries. India, along with several other Indian Ocean nations, is participating in the exercises codenamed ‘IOWave20’ where the communication channels are being tested instead of a full scale operation because of the physical distancing measures in place due to COVID-19. Hence, there is also no community engagement whatsoever, informed INCOIS director T. Srinivasa Kumar. Virtual tabletop Countries across the Indian Ocean and their respective disaster management organisations have been advised to test their communication protocols and conduct a “virtual” tabletop exercise as a minimum to assess organisational standard operating procedures (SOPs), plans and policies for tsunami warning and emergency response. IOWave20 exercise comprises three scenarios — the first one on Tuesday simulated an earthquake with 9.1 magnitude in Java region, Indonesia, at 8 a.m.; the second one on October 13 will simulate an earthquake with 9.2 magnitude in Andaman Trench of India at 9.30 a.m.; and the third one on October 20 will simulate an earthquake with 9.0 magnitude in the Makran Trench off-coast of Pakistan at 11.30 a.m. All scenarios INCOIS Director informed that all the scenarios will be limited to an hour, during which time ITEWC will issue four tsunami bulletins to both national and regional stakeholders through global telecommunications systems, e-mail, fax, SMS as well as on website. The exercise is being organised by the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, UNESCO. INCOIS has coordinated the exercise in close association with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) with the participation of all disaster management organisations of coastal States/Union Territories, Navy, Coast Guard, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), critical installations and port and harbours. Second exercise Entire east coast of India and Andaman & Nicobar Islands will participate in the second exercise and west coast of India and Lakshadweep Islands will participate in the third one, the Director of INCOIS explained. A webinar was held last month to finalise the SOPs for the ongoing exercise in which more than 150 officials from the 23 countries, including 46 officials from within the country drawn from various wings, had participated, Mr. T. Srinivasa Kumar added. Detailed manual A manual comprising information on tsunami exercise, detailed bulletins and feedback forms is also being prepared and circulated to the stakeholders. Feedback from the participants after the exercise is expected to identify and fix any gaps in communication channels and the standard operating procedures of stakeholders, the director added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/first-of-three-low-key-mock-tsunami-drills-held/article32787996.ece

But there is narrative after narrative about the incident in the public domain. A young innocent girl has lost her life, let us not sensationalise it. We want a fair and free investigation, we want the investigation to appear free and fair... Please ensure that the investigation is supervised by the Supreme Court,” Mr. Mehta conveyed the stand of the U.P. government. An affidavit filed by the government said “false narratives gained momentum at the behest of vested interests”. There was a “criminal conspiracy to spread caste conflict and instigate violence”. The affidavit noted that the government has already formed a SIT and even asked the Centre for a CBI probe into the case. During the hearing, senior advocate Indira Jaising, seeking an intervention in the case, highlighted the manner in which the victim’s body was cremated in the dead of the night. She said 27 FIRs had been registered against protesters. It was necessary that the the stringent provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act were applied to the four accused. Ms. Jaising highlighted the need for witness protection. “The situation there is very tense”, she submitted. The issue of transfer of the case was wholly within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, she said. Mr. Mehta said the witnesses were already under police protection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-ensure-smooth-probe-into-hathras-case/article32787370.ece

The Kerala Union of Working Journalists, in a letter to U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, demanded the release of Mr. Kappan, saying he was trying to perform his duty as a reporter. Mr. Kappan is an elected secretary of the KUWJ. President of the KUWJ State committee in Thiruvananthapuram K. P Reji also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for Mr. Kappan's immediate release. The Mathura police said “suspicious literature, one that could have an adverse impact on peace,” was recovered from the four. However, police are yet to reveal the content or state the laws which the seized literature violated. In their statement, police did not acknowledge that Mr. Kappan is a journalist and claimed that the four in custody were linked to the Popular Front of India and its related group Campus Front of India. The Popular Front of India condemned the arrest, terming it deplorable and illegal. The PFI accused the U.P. government of targeting it to hide the failing law and order situation in the State and divert attention from the Hathras issue by creating a “conspiracy theory.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-journalist-three-others-held-near-hathras/article32787372.ece

Mr. Kappan was arrested en route to Hathras, where a 19-year-old was brutally raped and murdered. His whereabouts are not known. Mr. Kappan, who is based in Delhi, has not been able to contact his family and colleagues, the KUWJ said. Efforts to reach him have been futile so far. The petition, filed by advocate Shweta Garg and settled by advocate Wills Mathews, has arraigned the Centre, the U.P. government, the Director General of Police of U.P. and the Delhi Police Commissioner as respondents. “Media is the breath of democracy. The ultimate test of democracy is freedom of speech and expression,” the petition said. The petition submitted that denial of access to journalists to the place of news affects the fundamental right of ordinary citizens to gain information. Journalists require a “dignified and democratic working atmosphere”, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kuwj-moves-sc-against-journalists-detention/article32787385.ece

Mr. Prasad made these observations in a letter to DMK Rajya Sabha MP P. Wilson, who posted it on his Twitter handle on Monday evening. The Minister, responding to an earlier Zero Hour reference by the MP on shortage of judges in High Courts (HC), said as on September 1, there were 398 vacancies in various HCs. “While every effort is made to fill up existing vacancies expeditiously, they do keep arising due to retirement, resignation or elevation of judges,” he said, adding that 48 new judges to various HCs had been appointed as on September 1. However, the DMK MP, who is a former Additional Solicitor General, tweeted that the functioning of the judiciary has been ‘crippled’ by the shortage. “Union law minister @rsprasad writes to me in response to my question raised during zero hour speech in Parliament that there is no standoff between #judiciary and Executive but admits that as on 1.9.2020, 398 HC judges post are lying vacant [of the total strength of 1,079 in 25 High Courts) which means more than 1/3rd posts are lying vacant !

The decision follows the party’s aggressive campaign on women’s security and crimes against them post the Hathras incident. On Tuesday, former Lok Sabha member Sushmita Dev, who heads the All India Mahila Congress, said any person accused of “serious moral turpitude” should never be given ticket to contest any election. ‘Veto power’ “As the Mahila Congress president, I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that I am totally against anybody being given a nomination who has been accused of any serious moral turpitude. I feel that we should have a veto power against people like that. I have spoken about it internally in the party,” said Ms. Dev at a press conference. Her comments came before the Congress formally releases its first list of candidates for the Bihar elections. On Monday, the central election committee discussed 46 names and gave an in-principle approval. Of the 243 seats, the party will contest in 70 in alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Left parties.

This prompted ED officials to summon Bineesh. Bineesh reportedly told ED officials that he was in the restaurant business in Kerala. He knew Mohammed Anoop through common friends. He denied any knowledge of Anoop’s dealing in narcotics and said he was in no way connected with drugs, sources said. He is learnt to have submitted documents to show that he had taken a loan to give money to Mohammed Anoop for setting up a restaurant in Kammanahalli. “A loan was given almost three years ago. But there has been no financial transaction to suggest any regular repayment, raising suspicion,” sources said. Bineesh reportedly assured the ED that he would submit more documents to support his case. “His claims will be verified. He may be called again for questioning if need be,” a source said. Bineesh had been questioned by the ED on September 9 about his alleged links to the accused in a gold smuggling case in Kerala. Officials had told a court in Kochi that investigations by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had revealed that the accused in the drugs case had assisted those named in the gold smuggling case. Bineesh, who has been questioned in both cases, seems to be emerging as a common link.

Justice B.A. Patil passed the order while rejecting the petition filed by Mohammed Shariff, a resident of B. Mooda village in Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada district. It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that charge sheet filed against him has no ingredient to attract Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code as his statement has no reference to another religion or any allegation against another religion. However, the court said that, “on close reading of the contents of the speech in the complaint, there are two religions. One is the Muslim community and another one has been indirectly in the form of innuendo, and it has been stated with reference to the other religions.” “Whether he was having an intention or not, is a matter which has to be considered only at the time of trial.

A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul will deliver the judgment on a petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni several months ago, for a direction to shift the anti-CAA protesters of Shaheen Bagh, mostly mothers and their children, to an alternative site as they were “blocking” public movement and causing traffic snarls in the area. The protesters were later removed by the police on March 24 in view of the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown. The protesters had at the time written to Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde against their “forcible and vindictive removal” by the Delhi police. ‘Not an absolute right’ Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued that the right to protest, like any other right, was not “absolute.” Justice Kaul had orally said the avenue of debate was first Parliament in a parliamentary democracy. In addition, peaceful protests could be held. Mr. Sahni had said that though the reason for the petition — the blockage of the main road by Shaheen Bagh protestors — had become infructuous, the court should still pass specific orders that protests in future should not hinder public movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supreme-court-verdict-today-in-shaheen-bagh-protests-case/article32787386.ece

07 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘COVID-19 has helped the internet economy’||Fundamentally, COVID-19 has been the biggest blessing that the internet economy could get in India, according to Deep Kalra, founder and group executive chairman, MakeMyTrip. “At the end of COVID-19, we would have jumped from 110 million to 200 million buyers online because there is no other way to order or pay,” he said, addressing over 1,000 delegates at TiECON Chennai 2020, an event that was held virtually for the entrepreneurial community. Mr. Kalra also spoke about the travel and hospitality industry. “It is going to take time for the travel industry in India to open up. There is a silver bullet, but we don’t know when it is going to come,” he added. He said the future of the travel industry in the short-term was going to be tough. “But I am a firm believer that once we see this through, we are going to see revenge travel. I am very optimistic about the long term; there are no questions about travel being replaced by anything because it is experiential,” he said. This year, TiECON, organised by The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE), will have sessions in Tamil, too. C.K. Ranganathan, president, TiE Chennai, and chairman and managing director of Cavinkare, said entrepreneurs from across Tamil Nadu would hugely benefit from the sessions. Day one saw a panel discussion on ‘Local to Global: The Chennai Startup path’. The conversation touched upon the need for research and development and innovation, particularly in science and technology, the ability to cater to local as well as global markets, and the role of a supportive ecosystem.

07 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MSP will continue to be there: Finance Minister||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday reiterated that the minimum support price (MSP) for crops will continue and will not be withdrawn. “MSP was there and will continue to be there. But because of the focus on increasing the MSP of only paddy and wheat annually, it has brought a distortion in the agriculture sector as many farmers shifted from other crops to the cultivation of paddy and wheat,” she told journalists at Indian Bank’s corporate office here. Ms. Sitharaman added that only after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took over in 2014, the Central government started shifting the focus of MSP on other crops, such as coarse grains, oil seeds and spices, to reduce dependence on imports. Attacking the Congress, she said those who gave support price only for paddy and wheat, neglecting other commodities, are the ones who are now raising unreasonable apprehension. Talking about the three legislation on agriculture reforms, the Minister said that they would benefit farmers, and the bills were introduced keeping their welfare in mind. She said that prior to the introduction of the farm bills, the issue was extensively discussed with farmers and experts in the agricultural sector. Earlier, she launched MSME Prerana, an online business mentoring programme for MSMEs, an initiative by Indian Bank. MSME Prerana is the first-of-its-kind initiative by a bank in the country for the sector. This is for empowering entrepreneurs through skill development and capacity building workshops in the local language. The programme is in collaboration with Poornatha and Co, a firm that designs entrepreneurial development programmes in vernacular using web-based interactive sessions and case studies. Later, after a meeting with farmers, Ms. Sitharaman said the Centre had every right to enact legislation regarding inter-State farm trade. “What we have done is at the Central level. That aspect of farming, which deals with inter-State trade, is in the Central list. Parliament has every competence to pass legislation which has a bearing on inter-State trading,” she said. She was responding to a question on the call by Congress president Sonia Gandhi exhorting various Congress-led State governments to pass laws in their respective State Assemblies negating the Centre’s laws as agriculture is a State-subject. Slamming Ms. Gandhi, she said, “See how much of respect the Congress has for the Indian Parliamentary system. It is really disappointing that the president of the Congress party, which had been in power for a long time, can seek to undermine the parliamentary process.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/msp-will-continue-to-be-there-finance-minister/article32787534.ece
07 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Why are tin sheets used to block entrances, asks HC||The Madras High Court on Monday expressed its displeasure over the practice adopted by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) of using tin sheets to block entries and exits to places where COVID-19 patients have been detected and subjected to home quarantine. A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha directed GCC Commissioner G. Prakash to appear before them through video conferencing on November 10 and explain the rationale behind blocking entrances to individual houses using tin sheets. The judges wanted to know if there was a scientific basis behind such a course adopted by the Corporation and whether any of the guidelines issued by the Centre or the State government permit the use of tin sheets to block entrances. Maintenance of facilities The Bench also wanted the Corporation to explain whether facilities for institutional quarantine were being maintained hygienically. The interim orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate R. Priyanka. She argued the case in person and complained to the court that her husband was forcibly taken to an unhygienic institutional quarantine facility by Corporation officials, though he was asymptomatic and could have been subjected to home quarantine. Stating that they were living in a five-bedroom house, the petitioner accused the sanitary inspector of having ordered institutional quarantine on grounds that their house did not have two separate rooms or separate toilets, was in a slum area and had no cross ventilation. She said the inspector filled the referral form mechanically, without even visiting her house. She alleged that her husband was treated disrespectfully by the Corporation officials on August 20 when his test results returned positive for COVID-19. He was taken straight to an institutional quarantine facility because civic officials were interested in showing numbers at such facilities, so that the funds allocated by the Centre, for their maintenance, could be misappropriated, the litigant alleged. On August 23, civic officials blocked the main door to her house with tin sheets. “The officials, instead of blocking our main gate, blocked our front door, making it impossible for us to come out in case of emergencies like fire and other health-related problems,” she added. Finding some force in her submissions, the senior judge in the Bench told the Corporation counsel to also explain the amount of money spent on such tin sheets, whether contracts had been awarded to private firms and whether the sheets were being reused or not.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/why-are-tin-sheets-used-to-block-entrances-asks-hc/article32787512.ece

07 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruvottiyur Theradi Metro work delayed||When Chennai Metro Rail’s phase I extension project from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar opens, commuters living near Tiruvottiyur Theradi may not be able to use it as this station is unlikely to be ready before the inauguration early next year, sources said. This project is meant to cover 9-km of north Chennai with a stop at nine stations — Washermenpet, Thiyagaraya College, Tondiarpet, New Washermenpet, Tollgate, Kaladipet, Tiruvottiyur Theradi, Tiruvottiyur and Wimco Nagar. While Thiyagaraya College and Tondiarpet are being built as underground stations, the remaining ones are elevated stations. Usually, the underground stations consume more time than the elevated ones; but in this case, both Thiyagaraya College and Tondiarpet will be constructed and will be ready for the inauguration, while Tiruvottiyur Theradi, an elevated one, is likely to remain unfinished at the time of the inaugural, sources said. ‘Viaduct not connected’ It may be opened a few weeks after the inauguration, if the contractor doesn’t speed up the construction and pump in more manpower now. “The viaduct is not connected to the station yet. It is not clear how they can finish on time,” a source said. According to officials of the Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), there was a delay in land acquisition which subsequently affected the pace of the construction, too. “It took quite a lot of time to get access to the station. So, naturally, it had an impact and caused a delay in finishing it. Right now, we have been taking measures to complete it at the earliest, to get make it ready for the inauguration,” an official said. 22,000 passengers The detailed project report estimates that this Metro station may see nearly 22,000 passengers travelling in the year 2026. Meanwhile, the CMRL has been installing the signalling telecommunication system for this project. Also, the laying of tracks along this 9-km stretch is nearly over now and is likely to be completed in another week or 10 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruvottiyur-theradi-metro-inauguration-may-be-delayed/article32787945.ece
07 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Port-Maduravoyal corridor likely to have two more ramps||The Chennai Port-Maduravoyal Elevated Expressway Corridor that is being presently revived is likely to have ramps at Spurtank Road and Swami Sivananda Salai. This will allow vehicles other than those proceeding to and from the port to use it. Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said they were studying the feasibility of the proposal to construct up and down ramps at the locations. The State Highways Department insisted during a meeting with the NHAI that the ramps should be constructed as planned earlier, according to sources. “The project had been put on hold since the alignment was not proper. A change in the pillars was made and somewhere in this process, the two ramps seemed to have dropped,” a source in the department said. Original plan A former official of the Highways Department said the corridor’s original plan included three ramps — at Koyambedu, Spurtank Road and at Swami Sivananda Salai — apart from the up and down ramps at the port and at Maduravoyal on Poonamallee High Road. “In the affidavit submitted by the NHAI in the court, they said the corridor would be used to evacuate ambulances and other vehicles. If these ramps are not provided, it would only be a waste of public money. The State government has spent so much on rehabilitation of families living along the Cooum river, along which most of the 19.2-km-long alignment of the corridor runs. The government has borne 50% of the cost of land acquisition and relief and rehabilitation,” he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/port-maduravoyal-corridor-likely-to-have-two-more-ramps/article32787930.ece
07 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MCI for uniform bond conditions for medicos across country||The Medical Council of India (MCI) has informed the Madras High Court that it has recommended a uniform procedure to be followed by all States on execution of bonds by medical students who agree to serve State hospitals for a particular period in return for highly subsidised education in government institutions. Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy were informed by V.P. Raman, counsel for MCI (replaced with the National Medical Commission since September 25), that the recommendations were made to the Centre in July, following deliberations with representatives of the governments of 19 States. The MCI had constituted a committee to come up with a uniform bond policy in accordance with directions issued by the Supreme Court in 2019. While deciding a case involving the Association of Medical Super Speciality Aspirants and Residents and the Centre, the court had stressed the need for uniform bond conditions. Accordingly, the panel has recommended that the bond period for MBBS candidates should not exceed one year, and the bond value should not be over Rs. 10 lakh for those admitted under the all-India quota (AIQ). The bond value alone could be increased to a maximum of Rs. 15 lakh for students admitted under the State quota. After a year of bond service, the candidates could be allowed to serve for one more year. The State governments must induct the candidates into government service within three months of completion of internship, failing which the bonds would stand terminated. For PG students, the bond tenure should be restricted to a maximum of two years for State quota candidates and one year for AIQ candidates. Their bond values should not exceed Rs. 20 lakh and Rs. 15 lakh, respectively. In so far as super speciality courses are concerned, the committee has recommended a common bond policy of two years and Rs. 20 lakh. The submissions were made during the hearing of a large number of writ petitions filed by doctors who had pursued postgraduate degree and diploma courses under AIQ in government medical colleges in Tamil Nadu between 2012-13 and 2015-16. The government neither provided them jobs in government hospitals as per the bond conditions nor returned their original certificates. Chief Justice Sahi held that the government ought to have offered the petitioners jobs within the bond period of two years. Failure to do so would render the bonds infructuous, and all their original certificates must be returned forthwith, he ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mci-for-uniform-bond-conditions-for-medicos-across-country/article32787509.ece

Fisheries Department authorities and fishermen associations received his body near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). The body was later taken to his native Thangachimadam in Ramanathapuram district and cremated, Fisheries officials said. Karson, along with six others, had left for fishing on a boat on September 30. He went missing after he fell overboard. After those who left with him alerted the authorities, Fisheries Department officials undertook a search. An FIR too was registered in this regard. The Navy and the Coast Guard too joined the search that went on for four days. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan authorities said they had found a body that washed ashore at Allaipatty near Jaffna. After coordinating with officials of the High Commission of India and after completing necessary procedures, the body was handed over to Indian authorities near the IMBL on Tuesday afternoon. A senior official said that the Sri Lankan Navy accorded respects to Karson’s mortal remains before taking it on board the ship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sri-lankan-navy-hands-over-body-of-fisherman/article32787516.ece
07 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Agri admissions in deemed varsities subject to result of cases, says HC||The Madras High Court on Tuesday said that all new admissions made by deemed universities in the State in agriculture and allied courses would be subject to the result of writ petitions filed in the court challenging the Tamil Nadu government’s insistence on obtaining no-objection certificates from it after proving availability of requisite infrastructure. Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy passed the interim order on a petition filed by the Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences. The judges also clubbed petitions filed by the SRM Institute of Science and Technology and the Vellore Institute of Technology, challenging a government order issued on July 28. Advocate General Vijay Narayan defended the G.O. stating that it had become necessary on the part of the State government to ensure the availability of requisite infrastructure, since a greater number of educational institutions in the State had started offering agriculture and allied courses. When private agriculture colleges affiliated to Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) in Coimbatore were complying with the norms laid down by the State, there was no reason why deemed universities should not, he said. Advocate Abdul Saleem, representing TNAU, said he would adopt the arguments of the A-G. Stating that agricultural research and education falls under Entry 14 of List II (State list) of the Seventh schedule to the Constitution, the A-G said the State government was fully competent to require deemed universities to obtain NOCs. But Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan, representing the UGC, differed with him. Senior counsel G. Masilamani and Chitra Sampath, representing the petitioner institutions, said an interesting question of law with regard to the competence of the State government to insist on NOCs from deemed universities had been raised, and, hence, they would require time to argue the matter at length.

Palaniswami on Tuesday, urging him to immediately convene a special session of the Assembly, pass resolutions against the farm Acts and move the Supreme Court, challenging the legality of the legislation. “States have complete authority to frame laws on agriculture, which is on the State list as per the Constitution. Issues of land and land tenure, too, are on the State list. If one reads provisions 46, 47, 48 under the list together, only the States have the right to frame laws on agriculture. Hence, we cannot be silent when the Centre infringes on States’ rights,” Mr. Stalin said. The DMK has filed cases against the three legislation in the Supreme Court on the basis of the federal rights given by the Constitution, he said. Only States can know the needs of the farmers, fulfil them and protect them. It has been the State, that has, over the ages, saved farmers from the middlemen and ensured that they get a fair price for their produce, he said. “I urge you to convene the State Assembly to debate on the farm legislation that will cause immense and long-term harm to the farmers, and pass a resolution against the farm Acts. The government should also file a case against the three farm legislation in the Supreme Court,” Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/convene-assembly-to-pass-resolution-against-farm-legislation-stalin/article32787507.ece

A separate category called ‘Extreme Backward Class’ should be created for them to ensure that reservations in jobs and education continue, he said. Speaking to reporters, Dr. Krishnasamy said that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had promised that these demands would be looked into after the Lok Sabha election, but there had been no movement in this regard. “The Central and State governments seem to be stepping back from their promises. We want to remind them of their promises through this protest. We had informed the police about the protest but party office-bearers have been harassed and threatened, and the pandals that were put up have been removed,” said Dr. Krishnasamy. Party sources said the hunger strike was organised at over 600 places.

07 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Elective surgeries begin again in govt. hospitals||After spending the last six months focusing primarily on COVID-19, a number of government hospitals have slowly started performing elective surgeries. In the wake of COVID-19 cases, elective surgeries were put on hold in a number of government hospitals such as the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). These hospitals had earmarked wards for COVID-19 patients and had been handling hundreds of patients in the last six months. They have resumed elective surgeries with precautionary measures in place. RGGGH, which has been handling thousands of COVID-19 patients, started to perform elective surgeries from Monday. “Every day, we perform 15 to 20 emergency surgeries. We had four to five elective surgeries on Monday that included neuro and ENT. We can increase the number of surgeries slowly as we are handling several COVID-19 patients. We are readying the operation theatre for cardiac procedures too,” E. Theranirajan, Dean of RGGGH, said.  He added that prior to surgery, patients were screened for COVID-19. “If they are clinically symptomatic, we do a CT scan. If there are any findings, we put the surgery on hold,” he added. At Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, a senior doctor said they had started to take up elective surgeries last month. “It is slowly picking up. We are doing RT-PCR tests for the patients before the surgeries,” he said.  P. Vasanthamani, Dean of Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, said the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (OG), Burns and Orthopaedics had been continuously performing elective surgeries. “Nearly 50% of our beds are allocated for COVID-19 patients. So, we have about 600 beds for OG, paediatrics, burns and cardiology units,” she said. Affiliate assistance Earlier, the hospital referred a few cases to its affiliated institute, Government Royapettah Hospital (GRH), and also the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital. KMC and GRH have performed a total of 5,000 surgeries from April to September. This included 3,383 major surgeries. As elective surgeries are back on track, safety of the patient and health workforce was the main aim, a doctor of Government Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women and Children said. “We have now started performing elective surgeries with COVID-19 precautions. However, we do not encourage surgery if a patient belongs to the high risk category, that is has diabetes or hypertension or is morbidly obese, and if it can be postponed for two to three months later. Such patients require in-patient care before the surgery and this is a risk. We are doing the necessary investigations - RT-PCR test and CT scan - prior to surgery,” she said She said that doctors followed all safety precautions and educated the patients. “Still, we have patient relatives crowding at the hospital. Most of them keep their masks lowered and this is worrying as the COVID-19 incidence is rising in the city,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elective-surgeries-begin-again-in-govt-hospitals/article32787530.ece

A senior Corporation official of Ambattur zone said though active cases were well below 1,000 at 901, and there were only three to four cases in these streets, they were taking proactive steps so that the spread does not get out of hand. The total number of cases were also below the 12,000-mark at 11,188. The official said authorities did not want to take any chances since a certain level of autonomy had been given to the local officials to decide on containment measures. A senior official of the Health Department said they had given zonal officials a broad outline with the flexibility of taking their own decision to designate a street as a containment zone. This was decided at a recently held review meeting. He said unlike barricading the streets completely, the new system would only cordon off certain portions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ambattur-has-50-of-containment-zones-in-city/article32787933.ece

07 October 2020||KARAIKAL,TAMIL NADU||Announcement on reopening of schools draws flak in Karaikal||The announcement by the Puducherry government on reopening of schools from October 8 has apparently caused consternation among a section of parents in Karaikal district. Teachers in 68 government and private high and higher secondary schools in Karaikal district have received instructions from the School Education Department for attending duty on alternate days to clarify the doubts of students. “There will be no regular classes. Students who wish to get their doubts clarified by their teachers will be coming to school with the consent of their parents. The teachers have been asked to make sure that there are not more than 10 students in each class,” said Alli, Chief Educational Officer of Karaikal District The teachers are already engaging the students through online classes. Based on the outcome of the initiative, the students of Class IX and XI will be allowed to attend schools in batches of 10, Ms. Alli said. The announcement by the Puducherry School Education Departments states that schools in containment zones will continue to remain closed. In the backdrop of the Tamil Nadu Government cancelling its earlier order on re-opening of schools from the start of October and the Union Home Ministry issuing guidelines for States and Union Territories on re-opening of schools from October 15, the announcement of the Puducherry Government to open the schools at an earlier date has not gone down well with public welfare organisations in Karaikal. “Schools must be opened only after a vaccine is available for COVID-19 and students are immunised. Else, the lives of students, teachers and parents will be at stake what with the pandemic spreading fast,” S. Anandkumar, president, IAC Karaikal unit, said. The Puducherry government must desist from budging to the pressure exerted by private school managements to re-open the institutions, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/announcement-on-reopening-of-schools-draws-flak-in-karaikal/article32787521.ece

Out of the total vulnerable areas, 25 areas are within Madurai Corporation limits and the rest are in rural areas. Most of the areas are low-lying spots along the Vaigai. “The Corporation and the Highways Departments are constructing a retaining wall along the Vaigai as part of the Smart Cities Mission and this will help to reduce the vulnerability of the low-lying spots along the river,” he said. A district disaster management plan has been prepared and multi-departmental committees have visited the vulnerable spots to identify the problems. The 13 channels in the city are being desilted and garbage is being removed from them. “The Corporation has been instructed to prepare a detailed action plan to ensure that all the roads that are dug up under Smart Cities Mission are safe for public movement during the northeast monsoon,” he said.

07 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Only 10.8% of residents avoid crowded places’||Around 68% of the residents of Madurai city wear face masks every time, including instances when they step outside their homes or even have visitors at home. However, only 10.8% of the residents avoid crowded places, reveals a behavioural surveillance study conducted in 100 wards of the city by the district administration. Addressing the mediapersons here on Tuesday, the District Monitoring Officer B. Chandra Mohan elaborated the key results and observations of this study which was conducted during July and August. “Since usage of face masks, frequent handwashing and maintaining six feet distance in public places are key measures to prevent COVID-19 virus transmission, we conducted this baseline survey to understand the knowledge, attitude and practices that people follow to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic,” he added. The survey was conducted by the students, alumni and faculty of Madurai Institute of Social Sciences with consultation from private parties. A structured questionnaire was prepared and sent to the 2,125 randomly selected respondents, who filled it using their smartphones. Dr. Chandra Mohan said that respondents were all aged above 18 years and were categorised into different age groups, with maximum interviewees falling within the age category of 30 to 60 years. A total of 68.6% of the respondents said that they wear face masks every time. Four percentage of the respondents answered that they rarely wear face masks. “While it is encouraging to see that a large proportion of the population wear face masks, we are aiming to bring a behavioural change so that all the residents wear face masks every time they step out of their homes,” said the Monitoring Officer. Another key finding was that 67.2% of the respondents washes hands using sanitisers or hand wash every time in various situations. While 27.1% of the respondents washes hands sometimes, the rest rarely wash their hands. When asked about maintaining physical distancing in public places, only 10.8% of the respondents said that they will avoid crowded places. While 42.1% of the respondents said that they will maintain three feet distance, a total of 21% of the interviewees said it maintains a minimum of six feet distance in public places. Collector T.G. Vinay, who was present during the meet, said that they will step up the monitoring in public and crowded places. For questions asked about the steps taken to protect elderly persons against COVID-19, around 11.1% of the respondents said that they isolate them at home. Only 7.7% of the respondents said that they will avoid close contact with elderly persons at home. Dr. Chandra Mohan said that despite the relaxations for the past one month, there has not been a spike in positive cases in the district. “But, the public must cooperate with the officials and follow the safety precautions to further bring down the cases,” he added. The Collector said that a team will conduct a similar study to find out the correlation between the wards where cases are high and the compliance of safety precautions there. Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan said fine is imposed on those who fail to wear face masks in public places. All markets are monitored by officials to regulate the crowd, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-108-of-residents-avoid-crowded-places/article32788063.ece
07 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Fall armyworm in Madurai maize fields||In the villages of T. Kallupatti and Sedapatti in Madurai district, farmers have reported spotting fall armyworm, an invasive pest, in maize fields. Officials from the Agricultural Department, who recently inspected the maize fields however, say that the infestation of the pest is at the beginning stage, and can be brought under control by following safety precautions. Maize is cultivated on around 11,000 hectares in the district, with the majority of the area falling within rain-fed blocks, as it is not a water-intensive crop. Maize farmers are worried about possible crop damage that could be caused by the fall armyworm, said M. Muthuveeran, president of the Peraiyur Farmers’ Association. “The farmers faced heavy financial losses in the previous years due to fall armyworm attacks. Many farmers have still not received the insurance for the crops that were damaged in previous years,” he added. S. Sathuragiri, a farmer from Salichandai village in T. Kallupatti block, said that unlike other pests, the fall armyworm can destroy the entire crop. “Many farmers are able to find out about the attack only after the attack becomes severe. The proliferation of the pest is also fast,” he added. An official from the Agricultural Department, who had surveyed the affected fields, said that the damage was below the economic threshold level. “We have instructed farmers to use Metarhizium, a bio-pesticide, to protect the crop in the initial stages,” he said. M. Santhi, Professor and Head of Department of Agricultural Entomology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural College and Research Institute, Madurai, said that the fall armyworm had not entered the whorl of the crop in the fields that were inspected. “Since the infestation is at the early stage, we have issued pamphlets to the farmers regarding the safety measures that they need to adopt to prevent a massive fall armyworm attack,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fall-armyworm-in-madurai-maize-fields/article32787552.ece

Venkatesan has appealed to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to increase the ceiling for the waiver of compound interest on loans for the moratorium period, following the COVID-19 lockdown. Welcoming the move to provide the waiver on compound interest for loans up to Rs. 2 crore, Mr. Venkatesan, said that the ceiling of Rs. 2 crore would not benefit medium industrial units. Pointing to the affidavit filed by the Centre in the Supreme Court revealing its inclination to provide the compound interest waiver for the moratorium period, Mr. Venkatesan said that Rs. 2 crore was a very low amount. “This has created concern among MSME entrepreneurs on whether this would really benefit them to emerge from this severe crisis. Hence the government has to increase the ceiling for the waiver prescribed for loans to the MSME sector in such a way as to cover all Micro, Small and Medium industries,” he said. Besides, he said that the decision for the waiver should cover all kinds of financial institutions including non-banking financial institutions and said he expected announcement in this regard with much more clarity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hike-ceiling-for-waiver-of-compound-interest-on-loans/article32787538.ece

Arumugaraja who belonged to a scheduled caste community had faced threats from caste Hindus prior to his death. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi sought to know if the trial in the murder case had commenced and how many were arrested. Arumugaraja was hacked to death in Navaladiar, Srivaikuntam. The court adjourned the hearing in the case to October 12. The court was hearing the appeal preferred by the State against a single judge’s order directing the government to pay Rs. 25-lakh compensation to the family of Arumugaraja for not providing security despite the fact that they had faced threats from caste Hindus. Also the caste Hindus had failed to turn up at the peace committee meetings initiated by the district administration. In the appeal, the State said that prior to the court’s order, Rs. 5 lakh was already provided to the family as per the provisions under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and cases were registered against the accused under the relevant provisions of the Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-report-on-action-taken-in-murder-case/article32787556.ece

Mr. Basha, in his complaint, named Umesh, promoters of the Raj Litho Press and district office-bearers of the BJP, including president of Vellancode village panchayat C. Dharmaraj, and Muthukrishnan. Photos of the posters on social media and the posters pasted across Kanniyakumari and its neighbouring districts should be removed, he urged. Besides confiscating the electronic gadgets used for committing the crime, social media accounts of all the accused should be blocked, the complainant said.

07 October 2020||Nagercoil,TAMIL NADU||Conservation work saves Udayagiri Fort||A few kilometres away from the Padmanabhapuram Palace in Kanniyakumari district stands Udayagiri Fort, which once housed an iron foundry and arms manufacturing unit of the Travancore kings. Years of neglect and growth of thick forest inside the fort in Puliyurkurichi took a toll on its walls. Timely intervention by the Department of Archaeology in the form of restoration and conservation saved the fort from further deterioration. “The fund for the work came from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the allocation for Udayagiri Fort is Rs. 2.3 crore,” said T. Udayachandran, Commissioner of the department. The fort covers 99 acres of impenetrable forests and a hill and houses many wild animals and birds. The forest area comes under the control of the Forest Department. The conservation work includes strengthening of the fort wall and restoration of the memorial of Dutch warrior De Lonnoy, who became the Commander-in-Chief of the Travancore Army, his wife and son and a few other officials. Originally constructed as a mud fort during Venadu King Sri Vira Ravivarma’s period (1565-1607), it was reconstructed with stone during the reign of King Marthanda Varma (1729-1758), the maker of modern Travancore. When Marthanda Varma decided to strengthen all the forts of his kingdom, he assigned the task to De Lonnony, who was defeated and captured in a war at Colachel. The king was fascinated by De Lonnoy’s appearance and asked him to train his bodyguards in modern warfare. He gradually gained the confidence of the king and reached the position of the Commander-in-Chief of the Travancore Army. “Maharaja, seeing his extraordinary skills and superior knowledge, authorised him to superintend the construction of a strong fort around the hill at Udayagiri,” writes Sankunny Menon in his book,The History of Travancore from Earliest Times. “An iron foundry was established at the Udayagiri Fort where cannons, mortars and balls were cast, and all the batteries were supplied with the necessary pieces of artillery,” further writes Menon. Years of neglect resulted in the weakening of the wall of the fort. “Roots of the trees inside the fort penetrated the walls and dislodged many of them. We have removed the roots and fixed the stones again,” said K. Olimalik, assistant executive engineer of the Archaeology Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/conservation-work-saves-udayagiri-fort/article32787529.ece

Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari will dedicate the flyover through videoconferencing from New Delhi, while Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy and Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam will attend a function to mark the inaugural at Villianur. The opening of the overbridge will considerably ease traffic congestion in the fast-growing suburban town of Villianur. The work, which commenced in 2013, got stuck midway after nine persons approached the Madras High Court seeking more compensation for the land they provided for constructing the bridge at the Arumparthapuram railway gate. Mr. Namassivayam told The Hindu that the project was sanctioned towards the fag end of the UPA-II government, and construction started two years later. “It is one of the few infrastructure projects which the Centre agreed to bear the entire cost for. Around Rs. 30 crore was spent to realise the project,” he said. The government has approached the Centre again for providing assistance in constructing another overbridge at the railway gate on Cuddalore road. “We are awaiting a response from the Centre. It is a crucial project to ease congestion near the court complex,” Mr. Namassivayam said.  It is one of the few infrastructure projects which the Centre agreed to bear the entire cost for.

07 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Revive Krishi Vigyan Kendra: Ramadass||Former MP M. Ramadass has urged the Union Ministry of Agriculture to convert the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Puducherry, the country’s first, into an institution under the fold of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). In a memorandum to Narendra Singh Tomar, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Mr. Ramadass said the role of what was a fine institution was being gradually diminished. He sought the intervention of Mr. Tomar, who is also president of Indian Council of Agriculture Society, in salvaging the KVK by bringing it directly under ICAR’s governance. Mr. Ramadass pointed out that it was the ICAR that established the first Krishi Vigyan Kendra of the country in Puducherry in 1974 and its administrative control was vested with the Agriculture Department of Government of Puducherry since 1992. The Kendra commenced its agricultural operations in 1974 in an area of 200 acres with 16 permanent staff recruited by ICAR and 250 casual labourers engaged by the Government of Puducherry on a daily wage basis. The institution was making rapid and remarkable strides over the years to emerge as a first ranking KVK today among 715 kendras in the country. This distinct and unique achievement was made possible by the constant, dedicated and combined work of ICAR scientists and about 200 subordinate casual labourers recruited by the Government of Puducherry as and when required. However, the solid foundation of KVK began to crack when 153 casual labourers recruited after February 2009 were summarily and arbitrarily dismissed earlier this year. This action was prompted, presumably, at the orders of the Lieutenant Governor as this engagement, according to her, ran contrary to and in violation of G.O. Ms. No. 22 dated February 27, 2009. The labourers, who included highly-qualified candidates, were working for Rs. 200 per day for 20 days in a month for about 11 years without salary for six years with assignments involving both labs and 145 acres of land. Their work included collaborating with specialists in 21 departments and implementing schemes, programmes and projects, such as All India Coordinated Rice Improvement Project (AICRIP), sponsored by ICAR and National Horticultural Mission, Mr. Ramadass said. At a time, when the activities of KVK had increased manifold, necessitated growing demand for manpower — various committees constituted by the Government had estimated a requirement ranging from 220 to 270 casual labourers — the dismissal of 153 workers had crippled the institution, the former MP said. Mr. Ramadass also pointed out that he had drawn the attention of Lt. Governor, Chief Minister and Agriculture Minister of Puducherry to the emerging situation and requested remedial action. He urged the Ministry’s intervention to save this KVK, and specifically, to persuade the L-G to reinstate the 153 workers, pay them their back wages and arrears of wages for six years and work out a scheme of permanent rehabilitation of these productive workers. Since the Government of Puducherry is suffering from a serious financial crisis and is closing organisations, the feasibility of taking over Puducherry KVK and converting it into an ICAR-run KVK may be considered, Mr. Ramadass said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revive-krishi-vigyan-kendra-ramadass/article32788178.ece

Although the project, which is being executed at an estimate of Rs. 17.34 crore, began in June 2019, it is only in November that the work has gathered momentum. Amenities As per plan, the terminus will have 30 bus bays, a waiting hall for passengers, cloak room, feeding room for lactating mothers, ticket counters, food court and retiring room for police and bus crew. There will be provision for a parking lot with a capacity to accommodate 350 two-wheelers. Construction of 33 shops — 17 on the ground floor and 16 on other floor was also part of the remodelling project. To facilitate construction, special arrangements have been made to provide halts for city buses along a shopping complex alongside St. Joseph’s College. After about four months of hectic work, construction had to be stalled due to the lockdown in the last week of March. No progress could be made for two months from April.

However, officials claim that the project is on track again with redeployment of dedicated workforce of 100 skilled and unskilled workers drawn from Utter Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha. It is said that raising of pillars and construction of shops have been completed. Nearly two-third of the roof of the terminal has also been completed. The last leg of construction of the roof is on and it will be completed in 10 days. “The project is well on track. It is scheduled to be completed in May 2021. Going by the progress of work, we are confident that the terminal can be opened to the public in February or March,” S. Sivasubramanian, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation, told The Hindu . The official adds that 63% of work has been completed. The remaining work will be mostly interior in nature. Hence, it will continue even during the north-east monsoon.

07 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘Keep rhinoceros beetle at bay’||The Coconut Research Station, Veppankulam, has advised farmers engaged in replanting coconut seedlings in areas affected by cyclone Gaja to adopt an integrated approach to check rhinoceros beetle attack in trees. Rhinoceros beetle is a pest which cuts the leaves of coconut in a ‘V’ shape. Fallen coconut stems kept in heaps in farmers’ gardens and in common sites in villages serve as breeding ground for carry over population of rhinoceros beetles. From there they spread to coconut seedlings posing a threat to coconut farms, said V.G. Mathirajan, Assistant Professor, Coconut Research Station, Veppankulam, in an advisory to farmers. Coconut trees on 41,492 hectares of the total area of 54,133 hectares in Thanjavur, Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Pudukkottai districts were damaged in cyclone Gaja during November 2018, affecting the livelihood of thousands of delta farmers. With 76% of the total coconut area in the districts damaged due to cyclone, replanting of coconut seedling has been taken up in the affected areas. Mr. Mathirajan says adult rhino beetles damaged the replanted young seedlings through a unique mode of entry at the collar region, the junction point of seedling stem with soil. Soil bore holes are seen in the collar portion of the coconut seedlings and presence of adult beetle is noticed when the affected collar region is split opened. ““Drying of central shoots are seen in the damaged seedlings and these dried shoots come out when they are pulled out. The extent of damage by rhinoceros beetle in young seedling ranged from 21% to 30%,” he said. “The foremost management strategy to save the seedlings is removal and burning of coconut stems left in the garden and in the common places to maintain good sanitation,” he added. The beetle in its various bio-stages should be collected from the manure pits and destroyed. Green muscardine fungus (Metarrhizium anisopliae) can be sprayed at the rate of 250 ml with 750 ml water for every cubic meter area of manure pits to check the perpetuation of the pest. As a physical barrier, the young replanted coconut seedlings may be covered with old nylon net used by fishermen to curtail the entry of rhino beetle into the seedlings. To monitor and mass trap the adult beetles, light traps and pheromone trap (one each for a hectare) can be placed. A mixture of neem seed kernel powder and sand (150 gm/seedling) may be placed in the leaf axils at the rate of 1:2 ratio to keep the beetles at bay. Napthalene balls (12 gm per seedling) may also placed in the central whorl to repel the beetles attacking the young seedling, Mr. Mathirajan suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/keep-rhinoceros-beetle-at-bay/article32787501.ece
07 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Elephant rehabilitation centre moves towards fodder self-sufficiency||The Forest Department has developed a fodder plot inside the Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at M.R. Palayam near here. At present, there are seven captive elephants at the centre. The fodder plot to grow sorghum has been created on nearly two hectares on the 20-hectare premises and the crop is getting ready for harvest. Forest officials have used organic manure to raise the plant. The centre, adjoining Tiruchi-Chennai National Highway, became functional in September last when the first captive elephant, Malachi, was translocated from Madurai to the centre. Subsequently, five more captive elephants, including three pachyderms owned by Kanchi Mutt, were brought at different times. The latest entrant, Deivanai, was brought from Tiruppankundram Subramania Swamy Temple in Madurai district in June during lockdown. A balanced dietary schedule prescribed by veterinarians for the seven elephants is followed here. Forest officials say they decided to use a portion of the sprawling centre to develop a fodder plot with the twin objectives of expanding the greenery inside and for feeding the pachyderms. “Sorghum is rich in fibre, potassium and micro-nutrients, making it suitable for elephants for consumption,” says S. Ramasubramanian, Conservator of Forests, Thanjavur Circle. He also holds additional charge of Tiruchi Circle. The Forest Department has also planned to expand the fodder plot to nearly 10 hectares in the near future as this will enable in meeting green fodder requirements and avert the need to buy from outside which is the case at present. The centre has a team of seven mahouts, who are assisted by kaavadis , to look after the captive pachyderms, which are housed in separate sheds. Also, there are a couple of ponds and showers for the elephants to take bath, seven water troughs to drink water, 11 sheds and a two-km walkway for daily exercise. In addition to these facilities, there is a veterinary centre, separate kitchen to prepare dietary food for the elephants and quarters to accommodate the mahouts and kaavadis . Five borewells have been sunk to meet the water requirements. Eight surveillance cameras have been installed for real time monitoring even in mobile phones. According to Mr. Ramasubramanian, green fodder, including sorghum, naanal grass, coconut leaves, vaagai and alanthalai, are given to elephants, besides seasonal fruits and vegetables such as water melon, carrots and pumpkins. Cooked food such as raagi balls mixed with jaggery and salt are fed to the animals. The health condition of every elephant is closely monitored by local and forest veterinarians from Coimbatore and Vandalur Zoological Park. The animals have developed strong bonding and started communicating with each other inside the green environment, adds Mr. Ramasubramanian.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elephant-rehabilitation-centre-moves-towards-fodder-self-sufficiency/article32787496.ece

07 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Queries over high cost of online learning||While schools have completed a number of portions through online sessions over the last few months, a sizeable section of parents wonder why these institutions collected a big chunk of fee when the overheads expenditure would be much lesser under the online teaching-learning system. “The video-conferencing apps, which the schools deploy, are not that expensive to justify collection of the full fee. Also, the mechanism simply does not suit average and below average students,” Perumal, a parent said. The only saving grace is that the schools have not conducted exams online though short tests are being tried out, he said. “At the most, one can say that despite flaws, the online teaching-learning system is essential as students cannot be allowed to remain idle at home for months. However, the schools must consider some concession in fee,” Rajesh Kumar, another parent of a student of a CBSE school, said. Private managements say there is substantial expenditure involved in conducting online classes.The live video-conference classes conducted with open source software may not involve expenditure. But it is not possible for teachers to complete the portions by that method. For higher classes, delivery of quality video content of the classes through service providers is necessary. The advantage of the delivery of video content is that the students will have access to it for 24 hours. Those who do not grasp the concept can play it again. For delivery of quality video content, classes handled by experts need to be recorded with quality cameras. “The money we pay to service providers for this is e substantial. Also, teachers salaries constitutes a major portion of the expenditure,” a functionary of a private school management said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/queries-over-high-cost-of-online-learning/article32787525.ece

07 October 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Congress cadre stage dharna||Condemning the recent manhandling of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi by the Uttar Pradesh police even as they were on their way to meet the family of the murdered Dalit girl in Hathras, the party cadre staged a dharna in front of their party office at Kokkirakulam here on Tuesday. Led by party’s district president K. Sankarapandian, they raised slogans against the Uttar Pradesh Government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Uttar Pradesh government, which miserably failed to protect Dalits from being raped and killed mercilessly by powerful people in the State with money, muscle, caste and political power, is targeting those who stand with the voiceless during this time. The manhandling of our leaders will not go unanswered,” said Mr. Sankarapandian. Virudhunagar Congress cadre, led by Virudhunagar MP, B. Manickam Tagore, staged a dharna here on Tuesday in protest against the mishandling of Hathras gang rape case by Uttar Pradesh government. He condemned the U.P. police for not acting swiftly and its high-handedness in cremating the body of the victim without allowing the family members to take up the rituals. “Congress leaders, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi who went to console the family members were ill treated by the police,” he said. Party Virudhunagar east district president, Sriraja Chokkar, presided over the protest held near Kamaraj statue. When asked about Union Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman’s remarks that the Centre had not made any changes to the farm legislations but only had enhanced certain farmer-friendly aspects, he said that the Finance Minister knew nothing about farmers and farming. The new farm laws posed a danger to farm lands and the price of farm goods. “Under the law, the long-term relationship between small traders and farmers would be broken in favour of corporates,” he said. Party leaders, Ashokan, Gnanasekaran, Balakrishnasamy, and Vaeyilumuthu, were among those who took part in the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-cadre-stage-dharna/article32787546.ece

07 October 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||‘Sillahalla project site prone to landslips’||Members of the ‘Save Sillahalla Campaign’ have voiced their concerns over the stability of the slopes surrounding the area marked for the Sillahalla Pumped Hydro-electric Storage Project, following visits to the area after recent rains in the district led to findings of a number of landslips that occurred in the region. The ‘Save Sillahalla Campaign’ includes conservationists, non-governmental organisations, citizens’ groups and local residents from the Nilgiris as well as farmers who are dependent on the Sillahalla stream for irrigating their crops and will stand to lose a significant amount of their farmland if the project is given the green-light. Safety The members of the campaign have opposed the project on grounds of safety, its potential to impact local farming and indigenous communities and the environmental damage it could cause. Godwin Vasanth Bosco, a restoration ecologist from the Nilgiris and a member of the campaign, said “As opposed to what is claimed, this place is extremely prone to landslips and one has occurred in exactly the spot where they plan to build the dam. Downstream there are several other landslips reported along the stream.” He claimed that the Tangedco was intentionally suppressing information about the area being prone to landslips to force through the project. Some of the villages in the immediate vicinity of the project site have been notified as being moderate to highly prone to landslips, said Gokul Halan, who works for the Keystone Foundation in Kotagiri. “Landslips have been seen along the Bembatty slopes. The laterite soil in the area and seen across the Nilgiris, being highly porous, has the capacity to hold large amounts of water. However, it is also susceptible to being washed away when a certain threshold is exceeded,” said Mr. Halan. “Extreme weather events are increasing in intensity every year. We have seen this happen in the last three years in the Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve. Having such a big dam project with all the underground excavations and associated infrastructure will definitely exacerbate the issues of landslips and affect the stability of the hill slopes and the entire watershed,” added Mr. Bosco.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sillahalla-project-site-prone-to-landslips/article32787963.ece

One of the major concerns in the district since the outbreak of COVID-19 is how the healthcare infrastructure will cope when there is a surge in the number of cases.  However, prior planning by the district administration and the Health Department meant that there were enough beds to treat patients requiring medical care, the officials said. “As on date, there are 751 available beds in hospitals and COVID-19 care facilities in the district, of which 64 % or 447 beds are currently occupied,” said an official. Of the 751 beds, 221 had oxygen-support to treat critically ill patients. “We have also identified facilities where an additional 750 patients can be looked after and we will use these only when the current capacity is reached,” the official said. Despite the surge in cases, the officials said there was no immediate risk of the district running out of beds. “Though we are recording between 100-150 additional cases per day on an average, the number of people recovering from COVID-19 is also almost the same. As long as this trend continues, we should be able to manage the situation,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/healthcare-infrastructure-to-treat-covid-19-patients-sufficient/article32787955.ece

District secretary of the party K. Arjunan led them. “Residents are undergoing untold sufferings due to lackadaisical attitude of officials. Firstly, there was no planning in execution of both the works. Secondly, there was no coordination among officials of different departments,” complained the party Rajapalayam town secretary, B. Mariappan. The works that started in 2018 has left roads unmotorable almost in all parts of the 42 wards. “The work has not been completed even in part of the town. Even the dug up roads had not been levelled for use by motorists. Two persons have died due to bad condition of the road,” he alleged. Meanwhile, Rajapalayam Tahsildar, K.L.

Besides, the officials executing the UGD and Tamirabarani Combined Drinking Water Scheme were asked to closely coordinate with each other. “They have been asked to identify and make a list of roads where no further digging is required. Municipal authorities have promised to provide black topping on those roads at the earliest,” he added. The officials have been instructed to ensure quality of work and materials in construction of manholes for UGD. “We have cautioned the officials that the protest would be resorted to in all streets if their promises are not kept,” Mr. Mariappan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/protest-against-poor-condition-of-roads/article32787544.ece

Jothimani on Tuesday staged a protest in front of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi here, condemning the Uttar Pradesh government for its mishandling of theHathras gang-rape caseand the high-handed attitude of the police in preventing Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi from proceeding to Hathras. Carrying placards, the protesters sat in front of the Gandhi statue terming it a ‘satyagraha.’ The protest was withdrawn after about two hours. The protesters alleged that instead of taking action against the accused, who were involved in the brutal murder of a 19-year-old Dalit young woman, the Yogi Adityanath government had been protecting them, they said. The UP government was attempting to silence those who came out in support of the victim, they said. Condemning the lathi charge against the Congress cadres, who had accompanied the Gandhis while marching towards Hathras, Ms. Jothimani said that Opposition parties had every right to meet the affected persons. But, the UP government had cordoned off the village to prevent political leaders from meeting the parents of the victim. In Pudukottai, Congress cadre staged a sathyagraha in front of Gandhi Park. It was led by Congress north district president Royal Murugesan. In Tiruchi, Congress cadre resorted to a similar protest near Gandhi Statue. The protest was led by party's urban district president Jawahar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/karur-mp-jothimani-leads-congress-protest-against-up-government/article32787490.ece
07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Palaniswami ahead in Chief Ministerial candidate race||Among the issues that had engaged the leaders in prolonged discussions were the composition of the proposed steering committee, the need for other committees for purposes like seat-sharing negotiations with prospective electoral partners and election propaganda work, and the possibility of changes in the functions and powers of key functionaries. Sources indicated that as per an agreement worked out between the two camps, the steering committee could have six members from the Chief Minister's side and five from Mr. Panneerselvam's side, on the lines of what was agreed at the time of the merger of the two groups in 2017. Earlier, Mr. Panneerselvam was visited by several Ministers, including S.P. Velumani, P. Thangamani (both considered close associates of the Chief Minister), D. Jayakumar, C.Ve. Shanmugam and R.B. Udhayakumar. Another round of discussions took place both between and within the camps. An understanding between the two camps would end the months-long, intra-party debate on the AIADMK’s CM nominee. At a meeting of the party’s executive committee held on September 28, several senior members demanded that the issue be resolved immediately. They hinted their preference for Mr. Palaniswami. But a few others, like former Villivakkam legislator J.C.D. Prabhakar, did not approve of the way in which the matter was discussed. Senior party leader Panruti S. Ramachandran explained the rationale behind Mr. Panneerselvam’s position on the steering committee. The executive committee meeting was preceded by a discussion among senior functionaries on September 18, during which Electricity Minister P. Thangamani revived the issue of projecting a CM candidate.  Sources indicated that as per an agreement worked out between the two camps, the steering committee could have six members from the Chief Minister's side and five from Mr. Panneerselvam's side||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palaniswami-ahead-in-chief-ministerial-candidate-race/article32787948.ece

07 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Schools, colleges turn to virtual labs to teach practicals||In an attempt to break away from the tedium of a digital class format where a teacher talks online while students take notes, several city schools and colleges are conducting practical classes by making use of ‘virtual labs’ and also organising virtual field trips of museums and zoos. Virtual labs allow students to conduct experiments by testing formulae, clicking on icons and test tubes, etc. While it is a far cry from the actual experience of conducting experiments in laboratories, teachers say it’s the best option available given that the government is not allowing schools to open this month. Manila Carvalho, principal, Delhi Public School (Bengaluru East), said that science teachers in the school use these labs to help students visualise and understand concepts. “Many of our teachers, besides using these virtual labs which are available online, also come to school and record the experiments they conduct. They then share the videos with students,” she said. Many virtual labs conduct experiments that are aligned to the NCERT/CBSE and State board syllabi. Dakshayini Kanna, principal of Harvest International School, said that they have been conducting virtual field trips as well. “We can book virtual tours of museums and zoos. We cannot continuously only conduct online classes. We are trying to do everything to make sure that online learning is attractive for the students,” she said. Several enterprising teachers in government schools and colleges too are making use of these labs. Visvesvaraya Technological University has tied up with National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal to implement technology enabled learning through virtual labs for all institutions affiliated to the university. The university said that these labs can be used to provide remote experiential learning of courses in engineering and applied sciences. The move has received a mixed response from students. Karthik S., who studies in a government PU College, started using these virtual labs after his teacher recommended them. “Our college does not have a lab and I am glad that I found these tools to understand concepts better,” he said. However, Tanya S., a class twelve student of a CBSE-based school says that the virtual labs do not provide them hands-on experience like the regular practical classes. “We understand that our schools have no option but to conduct virtual practical sessions. But if we do not get any practical exposure this academic year, we want CBSE to cancel our practical examination,” she said.

07 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru Urban reports highest single-day increase of 5,012 cases||With 5,012 new cases, Bengaluru Urban reported the highest single day spike so far on Tuesday. With this, the total confirmed cases here touched 2,57,241 of which 55,736 are active cases in the district. Previously, on September 29, this district had reported 4,868 cases, the highest on a single day then. Munish Moudgil, who heads the State COVID-19 War Room, attributed the increasing cases in Bengaluru Urban to higher testing. The city is conducting an average of about 40,000 tests daily, the highest in the country, he said. “Mumbai and Chennai have been carrying out about 13,000 tests daily. If Bengaluru did a similar number of tests, our daily cases will be less than 1,500. The idea is not to reduce tests to falsely reduce daily cases,” he said. Overall, the State reported 9,993 new cases taking the total number of cases to 6,57,705. With 91 new deaths, the toll rose to 9,461. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths. Bengaluru Urban reported 34 of the total 91 deaths. With this, the toll in this district rose to 3,135. As many as 10,228 persons were discharged on Tuesday taking the total number of recoveries to 5,33,074. Active cases continued to remain over lakh with 1,15,151. Of these, 848 patients are being monitored in ICUs. As many as 92,491 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours including 48,035 rapid antigen tests. Testing compulsory Meanwhile, having learnt that certain individuals are refusing to get tested thus hampering the State’s efforts to stop transmission of the virus, the Health Department on Tuesday issued an Order making testing compulsory for all individuals identified by the government. The order stated: “All individuals who are identified for COVID-19 test by the government shall get tested so that the spread of the disease can be contained and lives can be saved.” Meanwhile, having learnt that certain individuals are refusing to get tested thus hampering the State’s efforts to stop transmission of the virus, the Health Department on Tuesday issued an Order making testing compulsory for all individuals identified by the government.

07 October 2020||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||BJP gearing up for a counter-campaign||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raids on Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar appear to have set the tempo for the ensuing bypolls to two Assembly seats, with the ruling BJP getting ready to launch a counter-attack if the Congress puts the raids on its bypoll agenda. “If the Congress tries to project the raids as a poll issue, then we will launch an aggressive counter-campaign,” a source in the party said. “We will wait and see the Congress’ campaign style. If they try to use the raids as a political agenda, then we will have to raise questions like from where Mr. Shivakumar got the Rs. 56 lakh that was recovered during the raids and about the sharp increase in his assets.” BJP sources said the party would also delve into “history of raids” conducted by the CBI against politicians from the Opposition parties during the Congress regime. BJP State spokesperson Capt. Ganesh Karnik argued that it was not proper to give a political colour to the CBI raids. Maintaining that the probe agency had autonomy to decide on raids, he claimed that the State and the Centre had nothing to do with the raids. He added that the raids were part of an investigation taken up in 2017 and it was “foolish” to ascribe a political motive to it. Accusing the Congress of misusing Central agencies such as the CBI when it was in power at the Centre, he said the party was looking at the raids with suspicion because of its own past. He also remarked that the people of the State, including the voters of the two constituencies set to see byelections, would “see through” the Congress’ allegations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-gearing-up-for-a-counter-campaign/article32787619.ece
07 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC seeks data on bed availability||Noting continuous rise in number of COVID-19 positive cases across the State, the High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the State government to submit district-wise data of availability of beds for COVID-19 patients both in public and private hospitals. Also the government will have to provide the details of beds with ICU facilities and the number of ventilators earmarked for COVID-19 patients both in public and private hospitals in all districts. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar passed the order while hearing through video conferencing the PIL petitions related to COVID-19 health management. PPE kit disposal As a large number of hospitals are handling COVID-19 patients across the state, the Bench asked the government to give details of the manner and facility prescribed for disposal of PPE kits used in these hospitals. The disposal of PPE kits in Bengaluru alone would be an important task as the city has 380 hospitals designated for COVID-19 treatment apart from a large number of medical practitioners and health care workers in other hospitals and clinics are also using PPE kits as per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) prescribed under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Bench noted. Inspection Meanwhile, the Bench termed as impractical the Government’s October 3 advice to the district-level expert monitoring committees to inspect one COVID-19 hospital in their respective district every week. At this pace, it will take 20 weeks to inspect all the hospitals in a district that has 20 hospitals designated for COVID-19 duties, and in Bengaluru city, even if the committee visits one hospital everyday, it will take more than a year to complete the inspection of all the 380 hospitals designated for COVID-19 treatment, the Bench said while directing the government to reconsider the advise given to the committees on frequency of inspection. As many urban local bodies were not disbursing monthly salaries to pourakarmikas regularly and they released the wages on government’s intervention after the Court’s direction, the Bench directed the government to ensure regular payment of salaries to pourakarmikas by all the ULBs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-seeks-data-on-bed-availability/article32787603.ece
07 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Panelists point to policy mistakes||Participants of a panel discussion on ‘Why did Karnataka slip from 10th to 3rd position in addressing COVID-19 pandemic?’ argued that the State government has made several ‘policy mistakes’ in controlling the pandemic. Several policy decisions such as dependence on private hospitals and poor preparedness in the initial stages resulted in the pandemic going out of control in the State, the participants said. Akhila Vasan from Karnataka Janarogya Chaluvali said the government failed in reigning in the private hospitals during the crucial period. “During this pandemic, it is business as usual for private hospitals and patients are still struggling to get a bed in a hospital,” she said. Participant Vani Kori, a medical practitioner, blamed it on initial poor preparedness. “Hospitals in rural areas were ill-equipped to handle the pandemic initially. But things have stabilised now,” she said. Earlier, Kerala Health Minister Shailaja Teacher launched a web paper brought out by Janashakti Media. “The pandemic is a litmus test for the whole world’s health system. We are watching the world to know if there are any better systems to control the pandemic,” she said. Former State Health Minister K.R. Ramesh Kumar, chairman of Kerala’s COVID-19 expert committee B. Ekbal, and K.S. Vimala from Janawadi Mahila Sangathane also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-panelists-point-to-policy-mistakes/article32787919.ece
07 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||How will Cong. use raids in bypoll campaign?||Though the Congress has questioned the timing of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raids on 14 premises linked to Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar and his brother and MP D.K. Suresh, whether the party will foreground it prominently as a poll issue in the forthcoming byelections to Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituencies remains a question. T.B. Jayachandra, former Minister and Congress candidate from Sira, did not call it a “pollissue” but said the people would teach the ruling BJP a “fitting lesson” for constantly targeting party leaders through the Income Tax Department, Enforcement Directorate, and the CBI during elections. Sources in the party said Mr. Shivakumar would talk about being “targeted” as he campaigns in both the constituencies. However, a party insider pointed out that the raids by Central agencies had become “almost a routine affair” in the past few years and might not transform into a “sympathy factor” in the bypolls. A few Congress leaders said that loyalties of caste, religion, and local issues were expected to play a major role in both constituencies. In Sira, all three political parties are expected to field candidates belonging to the Vokkaliga community. There are an estimated 49,000 Kunchitiga Vokkaliga voters and about 8,000 Hallikar Vokkaliga voters in Sira. The BJP may field Rajesh Gowda, son of former MP C.P. Mudalagiriyappa, while the JD(S) may field Ammajamma, wife of the late B. Satyanarayana, whose death necessitated the byelection. The Congress has decided to field Kusuma H., wife of the late IAS officer D.K. Ravi, in R.R. Nagar constituency in the city. Though the Vokkaliga community has a sizeable chunk of votes in the constituency, the BJP improved its base in the 2019 parliamentary elections. The JD(S) and BJP have not announced their candidates here. The results of these byelections will have no impact on the stability of the State government. But if the Congress wins both seats, it could claim that the results reflect the failures of the government. The Congress is expected to focus largely on the development works undertaken by the former Siddaramaiah government, the “anti-farmer” policies of the current State and Union governments, and the failures of the B.S. Yediyurappa government to handle the COVID-19 crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/how-will-cong-use-raids-in-bypoll-campaign/article32787617.ece

However, it was increased to 243 to ensure that the numerals added up to nine, he said. “The wards were increased to 198 by the previous B.S. Yediyurappa government.

Karnataka Rakshana Vedike leader Narayana Gowda also visited him and expressed his support. This attains significance in the run-up to the November 3 byelections in R.R. Nagar and Sira, both of which have a sizeable Vokkaliga voter base. The CBI action could acquire a caste colour in the run-up to the polls, sources said. When Mr. Shivakumar was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in 2019, Nirmalanandanatha Swami had visited his residence and was vocal in his support. Nanjavadhoota Swami had even taken to the streets protesting the arrest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vokkaliga-seers-visit-dks/article32787616.ece

The KIC has also slapped a fine of Rs. 25,000 on the officer. Showcause notices had been issued as to why Rs. 25,000 penalty should not be imposed for not providing the information, and also as to why compensation of Rs. 1 lakh should not be awarded for loss or other detriments suffered by the appellant. “Ms. Shashikala has not appeared before the KIC and also chose to ignore the directions, to submit her explanation for the showcause notices,” the order noted.

The DC conducted a video conference with the officers in Hassan on Tuesday. The State government has set a daily target of 3,300 tests for Hassan district. The taluk officers should make preparations to fulfil the target. The officers should convince the public who hesitate to undergo the test and trace the primary contacts, the DC said. He also instructed the THOs to involve medical officers and ASHA workers to identify vulnerable people and make them undergo the test. Arsikere taluk stands second in the number of COVID-19 cases in the district, after Hassan taluk. The staff at the community health centre and ASHA workers should be more active in the taluk to spread awareness among the public on COVID-19 and increase the number of tests, he said. He also suggested that the officers follow-up people home quarantined and ensure they did not come out of their houses. The taluk panchayat executive officers and tahsildars should take care of those home quarantined. The officers were told to impose a penalty on those who ignore the rule to wear masks in public places. Additional DC Kavita Rajaram, District Health Officer K.M.

Led by him, the officials intercepted pedestrians, commuters, motorists and tried to convince them of the need for wearing face masks. Apart from convincing them about the need to do so, they also imposed fine on them and several of them were subjected to swab tests for COVID-19 infection at the mobile COVID-19 unit. Speaking to presspersons after launching the drive, Mr. Patil said that the imposition of fine was being done mainly to warn people in view of COVID-19 spread and to control it. He said that so far penalty of over Rs. 35 lakh had been collected from people not wearing masks. He said that fine was being imposed on 500-600 persons daily. He said that it was the responsibility of every citizen to wear face masks, maintain physical distancing, wash hands with soap water and apply hand sanitisers to check the spread of coronavirus. Mr. Patil said that till a vaccine for the pandemic was developed, citizens had to strictly follow the guidelines issued by the government and the Health Department. “Till vaccine is found, mask should be considered as vaccine,” he said. Assistant Commissioner of Police Anusha, Dharwad Tahsildar Santhosh Biradar and other officers accompanied the senior officials and imposed fine on violators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/drive-launched-to-penalise-people-not-wearing-masks/article32787600.ece
07 October 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Fine opposed||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has opposed the move to impose heavy fine on people not wearing face masks and urged the government to immediately withdraw it. In a press release, Dharwad district CPI(M) secretary Mahesh Pattar has said that instead of properly sensitising people and convincing them of the need to wear masks, the BJP-led government has resorted to looting them by imposing fine of Rs. 1,000 in urban areas and Rs. 500 in rural areas for not wearing masks. He said that the government had failed to address the problems being faced by the people. “Now, it has resorted to looting the people in the name of penalty for not wearing masks,” he said. While the CPI(M) would appeal to the people to wear masks for their own safety, it would oppose such a loot by the ruling disposition, he said in the release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fine-opposed/article32787591.ece

The Vice-Chancellor said that the university desires that it should be the first in the State to implement the policy. Mr. Yadapadithaya said that the university is in touch with the Police Department to ensure that the drug menace did not hit campuses of its 208 affiliated colleges and its other educational institutions. Gathering intelligence inputs mattered the most to prevent the spread of the drug menace onto campuses. The university will soon issue a directive to principals and administrative bodies of colleges to be alert and take precautionary measures. “Our intention is to ensure that all our educational campuses are free from the drug menace,” he said. He said that the training and placement cell of the university on campus will be made more active by appointing a consultant soon. The university is in the process of opting for the third cycle of accreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). It has completed 60 % of the process.

07 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Travellers hit as Kerala, T.N. yet to restore inter-State bus services||Continued restrictions on inter-State movement of stage carriage buses by the neighbouring Kerala and Tamil Nadu governments have resulted in a peculiar situation where passengers are dropped every day at the border and they walk across to exchange buses. The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and its sister concerns (NWKRTC and NEKRTC) have resumed inter-State operations to all neighbouring States but for these two. RTCs of these two States are also not operating their services to Karnataka, despite Centre’s directive right from Unlock 3 that there should not be any restriction on movement of people. Consequently, KSRTC has been operating services between Bengaluru and Tamil Nadu border (Hosur) and Mangaluru-Kerala border (Talapady) to drop passengers towards Tamil Nadu and Kerala (Kasargod) respectively and pick passengers from those States towards Karnataka. Buses in those States also operate till borders with Karnataka. KSRTC’s Chief Traffic Manager (Operations) G.T. Prabhakar Reddy told The Hindu  the corporation operated special services to Kerala during Onam celebrations. At present, it operates hardly 3-4 long-distance services to Kerala instead of about 25 following several restrictions, including seven-day home quarantine for people. It operates about 15 buses doing four round trips from Mangaluru to Talapady on Kerala border to ferry daily travellers to and from Kasargod, he said. Towards Tamil Nadu, KSRTC operates 50 buses doing two round trips every day. KSRTC’s Mangaluru Divisional Controller Arun Kumar said while the corporation was clocking about 20,000 km with 50 buses on Mangaluru-Kasargod sector prior to COVID-19, it was doing just about 2,000 km a day these days. Buses are operated between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra told The Hindu he has urged the State government to impress upon the Kerala government the need for restoring normal inter-State bus services. He would also be writing to Kasargod District Collector, Dr. Rajendra said. Thousands of people travel between Kasargod-Mangaluru and Hosur-Bengaluru for their daily avocation and the travel restrictions have affected them. Rajesh Ulithaya, who regularly travels between Kasargod and Mangaluru for his job, said changing from one bus to another at the border was painful. Yet, the situation is better to a month ago when Kerala had imposed severe restrictions on people’s movement, including COVID-19 tests and certificates, he added. Traffic revenue The KSRTC and its sister concerns have gradually been restoring services, even as there was improvement in traffic revenues. Mr. Reddy said about 60% of the services were restored while there was about 50% restoration in the traffic revenue. However, there was not much demand for premium (air-conditioned) services which have see just about 5% restoration, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/travellers-hit-as-kerala-tn-yet-to-restore-inter-state-bus-services/article32787624.ece

In a statement, the MLA said that incidents such as cows being taken away from cowsheds after brandishing arms, lifting cows grazing on the roadside and transporting them to slaughterhouses, lifting stray cows illegally are recurring. Many farmers are dependent on cows for leading their life through dairy farming. Such farmers are facing trouble constantly due to cows being taken away illegally, Dr. Shetty said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mla-take-action-against-illegal-slaughterhouses/article32788081.ece

Khader, MLA, on Tuesday urged the district administration to open a helpline at the Deputy Commissioner or district in-charge Minister’s office to help beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharath scheme. Mr. Khader told reporters here that the district in-charge Minister had said that COVID-19 positive patients would be treated for free at all private hospitals under Ayushman Bharath. However, confusion still prevails with regard to treatment and billing, he said. The district nodal officer handling the scheme was suddenly removed and a medical doctor was proposed to be appointed to that role. It was not proper to appoint a doctor who has to treat patients as a nodal officer, Mr. Khader said, urging the government to appoint a non-medical doctor to discharge the responsibility. Former Minister K. Abhayachandra Jain said the government was not responding to the strike by contractual health support staff. Many people have told him that it was difficult to get treatment in private hospitals under the Ayushman scheme, he said adding Mr. Khader had rejuvenated the healthcare system when heading the health and family welfare department. Mr. Jain said it was essential that the Health Minister, Ministers and legislators work in unison to fight COVID-19. Despite there being several schemes from the government, it was an irony that poor were struggling to get treated in private hospitals, he regretted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/khader-demands-ayushman-helpline-at-district-level/article32788088.ece

07 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Councillors express anger over lack of beds in private hospitals||Councillors of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) have expressed their ire over lack of beds for COVID-19 patients in private hospitals in the city. The meeting convened on Tuesday saw many members airing their concern over the increase in the mortality rate and the rise in COVID-19 cases in Mysuru and the failure of the government to ensure that all hospitals reserve 50 per cent of the beds to treat the patients. Former Mayor Arif Hussain said though there is a government notification to that effect and was being complied with in Bengaluru, the private hospitals in Mysuru were denying beds to COVID-19 patients. He was supported by other members who said that the private hospitals were charging heavily to treat the COVID-19 patients and the poor were the worst affected. The undercurrent of rift and differences between Mayor Tasneem and MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde also came to the fore during the council meeting. Ms. Tasneem alleged that the position of the Mayor had been reduced to being symbolic, shorn of any significance, and that the Commissioner had not taken her into confidence on the allotment of Rs. 50 lakh grant for each ward. She said though she placed the demand before the Commissioner many times, it had been ignored and she as a Mayor felt slighted. She expressed indignation that as a result, her promises and assurances to the councillors were devoid of any substance. The district in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekar had held a meeting to resolve the perceived differences between the Mayor and the Commissioner in May. The differences emerged over the alleged failure of the officials to take the councillors into confidence on the steps being taken to handle the pandemic in the city. Mr. Somashekar had stated that there was a communication gap which had led to the differences and claimed that he had resolved it. But Tuesday’s council meeting indicates that the differences persist. There were acrimonious scenes in the council over the alleged rape and murder of a Dalit woman in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh as Congress and JD(S) members raised slogans against the BJP. This led to a war of words with the BJP councillors objecting to raising the issue in the council and argued that the members should discuss issues pertaining to the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/councillors-express-anger-over-lack-of-beds-in-private-hospitals/article32788099.ece
07 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Fatality rate rises in Kodagu||For every 100 persons tested for COVID-19 in Kodagu, one of the popular hill stations in South India, as many as 16 are tested positive. Also, the fatality rate is at 1.6 per cent which is equal to the State death rate, and the mortality rate rose to 2.2 per cent since the past five days. Disclosing this here on Tuesday, Minister for Medical Education K. Sudhakar said he was worried over the spike in cases as tourists may soon arrive in large numbers with the unlocking of many restrictions. There is a need to keep a watch on homestays and resorts which get visitors and the district administration can look at practically implementable solutions for checking the spread. The hospitality industry can insist on COVID-19 negative certificates from the guests if need be, he suggested. Mr. Sudhakar, who held a meeting to review the COVID-19 situation and management, said he has asked the Deputy Commissioner to work towards restricting gatherings and subjecting traders and street vendors to periodic COVID-19 tests for containing the spread. If necessary, village fairs can be shifted away from the human habitations.. He also told the officials to strictly enforce the penalty on those not wearing the mask since it is the only effective means at this juncture to combat the pandemic until the vaccine was developed. “People cannot be negligent all the time and it’s the responsibility of all to fight the pandemic. We have passed the awareness stage and fines have become inevitable.” The Minister told the healthcare authorities to track primary and secondary contacts of the infected persons within 48 hours of the infection. If the contacts are not tracked within the time, spreading can happen rapidly. The elected representatives of Kodagu urged the Minister to ramp up healthcare facilities in Kodagu since the district lacks adequate number of public and private hospitals and nursing homes and the people largely depend on Mysuru and Mangaluru for their healthcare needs. Mr. Sudhakar said he will speak to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on expanding healthcare infrastructure, including super speciality hospitals, keeping in mind what the MLAs have cited on the district’s position on the health map. “I know many are dependent on the hospital of Kodagu Institute of Medical Sciences which is presently tackling the pandemic,” he replied. Appachu Ranjan and Bopaiah, MLAs, and Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fatality-rate-rises-in-kodagu/article32788101.ece
07 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Why no raids against BJP leaders?’||Questioning the BJP’s claims of CBI’s impartiality, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah sought to know the reason behind the Central investigating agency’s failure to carry out similar raids against BJP leaders. Fielding queries from reporters on the raids carried out in the premises belonging to Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief D.K. Shivakumar and his brother D.K. Suresh, Mr. Siddaramaiah sought to know whether all BJP leaders were honest. He referred to the alleged irregularities in the purchase of medical equipment to fight COVID-19 that he had raised in the Legislative Assembly and questioned why the BJP Government failed to carry out a probe in the regard. “If their contention that they are not targeting anybody is to be convincing, such raids needed to be carried out against BJP leaders also,” he said. Earlier in the day, KPCC spokesperson M. Lakshmana sought to know why no such investigation by Central agencies was being carried out against the company owned by Jay Shah, the son of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Contending that the company run by the Home Minister’s son saw its bank balance multiply several thousand times between 2014 and 2015, Mr. Lakshmana said the absence of any probe in the matter shows the double standards of the BJP. He accused the governments at the Centre and State of pursuing vendetta politics against Mr. Shivakumar, who he called a successful businessman with interests in real estate, power and educational institutions.  ‘Yogi unfit to wear saffron robes’ Mr. Siddaramaiah also criticised Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, saying he was unfit to continue in the post or don saffron robes. Pointing out that there were a total of 27 cases that had been booked against Mr. Adityanath, Mr. Siddaramaiah said a rowdy sheet is opened against a person having just four to five cases. Mr. Siddaramaiah said the BJP should immediately dismiss him from the post to save the party’s reputation, adding that he was not fit to wear saffron robes. Mr. Siddaramaiah recalled the support given by the then Congress government in Delhi to the family of Nirbhaya, who was also raped and killed in 2012. He said the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh had forcibly cremated the Hathras rape victim with the assistance of the police. The UP government had also misused the police to assault Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/why-no-raids-against-bjp-leaders/article32788107.ece

I know Madikeri Dasara is also very popular and grand. But the situation does not permit us to allow a large gathering. Such a resolve from them can help contain the spread,” he told reporters. Curbs sought Earlier, Appachhu Ranjan, MLA, urged the government to impose Section 144 during Cauvery Theerthodbhava event and Madikeri Dasara fete for restricting the public gathering.

Raghu told The Hindu that they decided to increase the number of wards to 243 after ensuring that the average population of each ward is around 35,000. “The exercise was taken up based on the 2011 census and population projection reports. There has been decadal growth, mostly in outer areas of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). It is, therefore, in these areas that the number of wards has been increased. Around 35 wards will be added in the five outer zones while the rest will be in the core zones,” he said adding that the committee did not favour inclusion of new areas in the BBMP limits. Delimitation exercise The government is likely to constitute a committee to take up the delimitation exercise again, now that the number of wards has been increased. Mr. Raghu said the delimitation committee will be constituted along the lines of the committee in Chennai, Tamil Nadu where the city corporation commissioner is the chairperson. “It will have four members with the BBMP Commissioner as chairperson. The other members will be Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) commissioner, Deputy Commissioner of Bengaluru Urban district and BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Revenue) as its member secretary. The government order with regard to the constitution of the committee is likely to be issued soon,” he added. Several urban and civic experts have alleged that the whole exercise was a ruse to put off polls to the BBMP council. The five-year term of the BBMP council ended on September 10. Mr. Raghu rubbished these allegations and maintained that elections to the civic body will be held by the end of this year, or at the very latest early 2021. “There are legislators belonging to the Congress and the Janata Dal (S) in the Joint Select Committee. Even they are supporting the government in this exercise,” he said.  Around 35 wards will be added in the five outer zones while the rest will be in the core zones S.

The cases have spiked since past few days with 700-1,000 new infections being reported almost every day besides surging fatality rate. Ms. Sindhuri had told the COVID-19 review meeting chaired by Minister for Medical Education K. Sudhakar here on Monday that all efforts would be made to constrain the infection rate. Accordingly, the DC, who took charge recently, collected details on the availability of specialist healthcare professionals, doctors, nursing staff, PG students at the MMCRI and the availability of beds. The Minister had told the district administration to take extra precautions and strengthen testing ahead of Dasara festivities. As the tests are going to be ramped up, Ms. Sindhuri told the healthcare authorities to ensure sufficient numbers of doctors and beds were available for tackling the situation. The number of beds at the K.R. Hospital where critically-ill COVID-19 patients are treated besides the designated COVID-19 hospital here, has to be doubled with the upsurge in cases. As of now, the hospital has 178 beds for COVID-19 patients and the number should go up by another 200 beds, she directed. Oxygen supply he told the MMCRI doctors to expedite the work of equipping beds with oxygen supply at the trauma care centre on KRS Road. This centre has been lying idle since its inauguration for want of equipment and manpower. Ms. Sindhuri suggested roping in 154 PG students at the Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute for COVID-19 duties for enhancing manpower availability for combating the pandemic. She later visited the COVID-19 care ward at the hospital and inspected the facilities such as liquid oxygen tank and ventilators. The nursing staff of the hospital submitted a memorandum to her for fulfilling their demands. MMCRI Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-to-go-into-combat-mode-over-surge-in-covid-19-cases/article32788097.ece

According to sources, following directives issued by the Election Commission, auxiliary (extra) polling stations are being set up as a precautionary measure due to COVID-19. The increased number of polling stations will help reduce crowding and ensure that social distancing norms are followed. In addition to the 381 polling stations, another 297 will be set up in areas where more than 1,000 votes are expected to be cast in each station. “It is also decided to change 68 places which had earlier served as polling stations as maintaining social distancing would not be possible there due to space constraints. We have sent the new list to the Election Commission, and information regarding the same will be shared with the general public,” BBMP Commissioner and election in-charge officer N.

However, the cash-strapped civic body seems unfazed by the threat. Civic Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said that the BBMP can make payments only when its financial condition improves. K.T. Manjunath, president of the BBMP Karyanirata Guttigedarara Sangha, claimed that bills amounting to Rs. 2,500 crore are pending. “Over the past three months, no bill has been cleared. The BBMP is using the pandemic as a ruse to delay payments,” he alleged. Contractors are currently carrying out civil works, such as repair and strengthening of drains, parks, footpaths and roads, in various wards worth nearly Rs. 6,000 crore. Mr. Manjunath said, “The civic body has been able to collect nearly Rs. 2,000 crore from citizens as property tax. Why can’t the money be used to clear pending bills?” However, contractors belonging to another association said they did not support the Sangha. K. Ambikapathy, president of the BBMP Contractors’ Association, said that they have had discussions with both Administrator Gaurav Gupta and Mr. Prasad. “Both assured that bills for works taken up under the Nava Nagarothana scheme, 14th Finance Commission and State Finance Commission will be cleared from Thursday,” he said and added that some issues with regard to clearing bills were the result of violation of rules by the office of the chief accounts officer (CAO). Recently, the CAO R. Govindraj was repatriated on charges of dereliction of duty and violation of rules in clearing bills of contractors. The office of the CAO was sealed and an inquiry is under way. Mr. Prasad told The Hindu that bills for works taken up under various schemes will be cleared with funds from the State government. However, the civic body does not have funds to pay for works taken up in wards under the Programme of Works (POW). “Despite the poor finances, more payments have been made to contractors this year than last year. We spend around Rs. 187 crore every month on salaries and solid waste management,” he said. Senior officials said they would not give in to threats by contractors as many of the civil works under POW were ‘unnecessary’. “If contractors stop taking up these works, it means money saved for the civic body,” an official said. The official also said that during the recent ward committee meetings, which are being chaired by officials in the absence of elected representatives, members of several RWAs had pointed out to bills being raised for works that were not actually executed. “We will investigate such cases and cancel payments where applicable, apart from blacklisting the contractors concerned,” the official added.

This is the second instance of the police charging a drug peddler under the stringent Act, said a senior police official. According to the police, the accused, Syed Nazim, had been arrested recently in connection with six cases related to drug peddling. “However, he made bail and resumed dealing in drugs until the K.G. Halli police nabbed him again. Considering the background of the accused, the police filed a detailed report before the Police Commissioner seeking permission to book him under PIT NDPS Act. He was arrested after receiving due approval from the advisory committee of the high court,” said a police officer. In May, the Central Crime Branch had booked a foreign national, who was named in five cases regarding drug peddling, under the PIT NDPS Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/drug-peddler-booked-under-pit-ndps-act/article32787917.ece

07 October 2020||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Royalty fails to enthuse farmers||The royalty scheme for owners of cultivable paddy land in the State has seen a tepid response with only a fraction of the owners submitting applications so far. The government’s scheme offers Rs. 2,000 per hectare every year as royalty under the Rice Development scheme. It has set aside Rs. 40 crore for the project and has been receiving applications since September 11. As of Monday, the Agriculture Department received 48,881 applications, far fewer than anticipated. Of these, 21,236 were received from Palakkad and another 12,049 from Alappuzha – the two major rice-producing districts of Kerala. The department was expecting more than two lakh applications from across the State. No deadline Officials of the Agriculture Department say no deadline has been fixed for submitting the application and they hope more people would apply to avail themselves of the benefit in the coming days. “After the initial lukewarm response, the number of applications being submitted is picking up. As beneficiaries need to submit the application online, a large number of them have to go to Akshaya centres. With the COVID-19 spreading thick and fast, many of them are reluctant to go there. As there is no last date to file the application, they can do it at any time,’’ says Sapheena K.S., Deputy Director of Agriculture, Alappuzha. However, the owners, especially smallholders, seem to be less enthusiastic about the scheme. “When it comes to Kuttanad, the majority are small landowners. The royalty is Rs. 2,000 per hectare. Those who own small fields, for example, one acre, 50 cents or even less are not going to get much. The government should have announced an equal royalty to all irrespective of the area of land they possess,” says Renil Kumar K.K., secretary, Vavakkad North padasekharam in Kuttanad. Tax receipts Mr. Kumar says several paddy field owners in Kuttanad do not have tax receipts as the fields still remain under the ownership of landlords. Although current owners bought it from landlords several decades ago, titles are yet to be transferred. The applicants should provide tax receipt/possession certificate to get the royalty. The royalty has been announced as an encouragement to owners/farmers to continue paddy cultivation. According to officials, owners of fields currently under cultivation are eligible for the royalty. Those cultivating pulses, vegetables, sesame and groundnut in paddy fields as part of the crop cycle can also apply. Owners of fields that remain fallow can file the application after giving assurance that the cultivation will be revived either by them or through other farmers or agencies. The applications for the royalty should be filed online onwww.aims.kerala.gov.in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/royalty-fails-to-enthuse-farmers/article32787710.ece

Cheriyanad, Chettikulangara, and Arattuppuzha were among the 75 FHCs launched by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday through videoconferencing. Second phase The government has selected 54 PHCs, including 14 in the first phase and another 40 in the second phase, for transforming into FHCs in the district under the Aardram Mission. Of these, 16 have already been converted into FHCs. Rest are under different phases of upgradation. In the third phase of the project, eight more PHCs will be upgraded to FHCs in the district. Under Aardram Aardram is a Statewide programme aimed at creating people-friendly health delivery systems. Officials said that the conversion of PHCs to FHCs would mean that all these institutions would work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., delivering outpatient services. As part of the upgradation, additional staff, including doctors and nurses, are provided to FHCs. Lifestyle clinics, SWAAS clinics for asthma and other obstructive airway diseases, and depression clinics are part of FHCs. Besides, the FHCs have improved facilities, including consultation rooms, waiting room for patients, drinking water facility, modern laboratory, chairs, toilet for differently abled, signboards, breastfeeding room, and so on. A pre-check-up room for examining blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass have been arranged.  No ceremony As part of the inauguration, functions were organised at Arattuppuzha and Cheriyanad FHCs. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, Saji Cherian, MLA, and others attended.

The worsening COVID-19 situation has robbed them of the sheer excitement of walking into their new classroom and having a great time with their new friends. Instead, videos of their classrooms and laboratories shown online and freshers’ day being held in Google Meet or Zoom platforms have become the new normal. “It is a fact that we missed the first day in our college in the face-to-face mode. But there is no other option now in view of the pandemic. But we are getting accustomed to this new experience, where everything is happening in front of our computer or mobile screen,” said students of B.A. Economics and English, who had joined autonomous colleges in the city. Autonomous institutions had started classes for first-year students nearly two weeks ago while the admission process in government and aided arts and science colleges under the Mahatma Gandhi University is progressing. Prasant Palakkappillil, Principal of Sacred Heart College, Thevara, said that the initial online sessions for freshers were shot at various locations across the campus to familiarise them about the various facilities available on the campus. “We had organised family meetings and interactions among students aimed at making them at ease with the new normal,” he said. Lizzy Mathew, Principal of St. Teresa’s College, said that freshers’ day was celebrated online with senior students welcoming newcomers. “We have also started online sessions, where first-year students will get an opportunity to present their talents ranging from literary and culinary to arts and music,” she said. Managements are planning to opt for the blended learning mode by combining both online and offline sessions even after colleges reopen for the traditional face-to-face sessions. Some of the colleges are toying with the idea of providing lectures online and using the offline mode for discussion and interactions on the lectures aired through videoconferencing platforms. Colleges have also stepped up the infrastructure for online learning by installing state-of-the-art teaching tools and systems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/freshers-get-a-taste-of-new-normal/article32788039.ece
07 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||A glimpse into Thrikkakara’s past||As the COVID-19 pandemic continues its terrifying march across the world, people are finding solace and a means of survival in collective memory. Closer home, the popularity of blog posts titled “Thrikkakara Sketches” underscores that nostalgia can bolster survival efforts in the midst of uncertainties and anxiety. The man behind the blog, cartoonist Sudheer Nath, who is based in New Delhi, said he began posting “Thrikkakara Sketches” on Atham day (August 22 last). Having been born and brought up in Thrikkakara, he wanted to make up for his inability to travel home for Onam celebrations with a few posts on local history and the importance of the Thrikkakara temple, which is at the centre of the Onam legend. “Though I wanted to conclude after 10 posts, the overwhelming response forced me to continue as people coaxed me, giving suggestions, providing material and sharing their memories,” he said. At one time, the number of readers used to rise to 50,000 a day, he said about the 38 posts from August 22. Thrikkakara Sketches comprise a wide variety of topics ranging from the itinerant circus shows that arrived here every year, to the Onam celebrations at the Thrikkakara temple. There are also posts on the first bus that people in Thrikkakara relied on and the toddy and arrack shops frequented by the locals. Mr. Nath said that stories of ordinary people evoked a tremendous response and generated a considerable number of comments from readers. Writing about a popular barber of yesteryear as well as about the tea shops brought lots of comments, he said. “Though we’ve had movies on villages, there has not been such a variety of topics dealt with in the writings on the past life of a place,” said Pratheesh V. Vijayan, a young filmmaker in Kochi who regularly reads Thrikkakara Sketches. Senior psychiatrist Philip John said people were living through a period of anomie and anticipatory anxiety. Good, positive memories were also a survival aid, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-glimpse-into-thrikkakaras-past/article32788049.ece
07 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Stalemate over Thripunithura bypass leaves landowners in a quandary||There seems to be no end in sight to the burgeoning traffic hold-ups in and around Thripunithura and on the Kundannoor-Pettah stretch, with the three-decade-old stalemate over constructing the Thripunithura bypass set to continue. The proposal to construct the 8-km bypass dates back to 1989. The project remained in the cold storage except for four hectares of the total 16 hectares of land being acquired, after paying what landowners termed as a pittance as compensation to them. Currently, landowners are in a quandary. They are unable to sell their land, renovate houses or build new ones since the land for the alignment remains frozen. Officials of the PWD (NH wing) said that the land acquisition cost had increased manifold during the past years. “This is among the reasons why the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has not prioritised the project. Else, the State government would have to pool in 50% of the project cost. Efforts to develop the corridor in a phased manner too have not yielded results”. The proposed bypass passes through three parliamentary constituencies and as many Assembly constituencies. “I raised the demand to hasten the project in the Lok Sabha since the land owners are unable do any transaction of their properties. The bypass stretch would have worked wonders in developing the entire area. A Project Director of NHAI visited the area recently to assess the situation. Apart the long-overdue alignment, an alternative one through Puthencruz, located further away, is being looked into,” said Benny Behanan, MP. Among the people affected by the inordinate delay in implementing the project is A.T. Geevarghese. “The project was initiated when I was 10 years. Now I am 40, and little has materialised,” he said, while expressing his willingness to surrender his land for the project. Another landowner, V.G. Ambujakshan, a native of Mamala and State president of the National Federation of the Blind, said that his long wait for the bypass remained unanswered although he had surrendered over 8 cents of land and his house for the project. “I got a measly amount as compensation back then. The alignment was changed multiple times at the behest of influential people who did not want to surrender their land. This resulted in adding many curves in the alignment, despite safety hazards. Our efforts to convince PWD officials and others with the help of satellite images to carve out the alignment through alternative lands proved futile”. Landowners were unable to modify their houses even during the wedding of their children due to the uncertainty over the project. A bypass beyond Thripunithura town would also be crucial from the safety point of view since mega industrial units such as the KRL were located close-by. The existing narrow roads were too congested, he said. “I am unable to do anything on 60 cents of my 1 acre land that the PWD identified for acquisition for the project. The government must speed up land acquisition,” said T.C. Varghese, a resident of Sasthamukal. Natarajan, secretary of the Thiruvankulam Action Council for Thripunithura Bypass, said that the long pending bypass was of strategic importance too since it would link Kochi, which has the Southern Naval Command and a host of other defence establishments, with Dhanushkodi through Madurai. He cautioned against changing the alignment since it would result in motorists having to travel up to 14 km of additional distance for no reason.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stalemate-over-thripunithura-bypass-leaves-landowners-in-a-quandary/article32788051.ece

During the first half of 2020-21, the port handled a total of 12.58 million tonnes. This is a decline of more than 24% in cargo volumes as compared to the same period during 2019-20. Petroleum, oil, and lubricants throughput stood at 7.20 million tonnes, and containerised cargo movement stood at 2.85 lakh TEUs in the first half of the year. With the continuing disruption in normal movement of vehicles and suspension of air services, petroleum product movement declined nearly 34% this financial year when compared to the same period last year. Decline in container movement is around 9% when compared to the fist six months of 2019-20. However, the first half ended on a positive note for the port, with cargo movement registering nearly 10% growth in September. This is the first time during the pandemic days that cargo throughput is showing a positive trend, port sources said. Some signs of recovery were visible in the volume of containers being handled at the International Container Transshipment Terminal at Vallarpadam. The negative trend in container cargo has shown a slowdown, even as the container terminal notched up record handling of the highest volume of cargo for a single month in September this year. The terminal handled 62,472 TEUs of cargo during the month. Meanwhile, the port trust has invited expression of interest (EoI) from investors with experience in port, shipping, or logistics businesses for developing the NCB berth and back-up areas on public-private partnership basis/landlord model. The project is aimed at bringing cargo and vessel traffic to the port. The port trust said those interested were encouraged to offer innovative business suggestions for the proposed venture, contributing to an increase in business through projects like warehouses, tank farms, and bulk cargo storage silos. The port is also open to considering developing any other berths besides the NCB depending on the business potential.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/port-witnesses-24-fall-in-throughput/article32788038.ece

The gazette notification of the Ordinance issued on Monday will expire in one month. “Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act and the Statutes, made thereunder, the Syndicate may receive and consider applications for affiliation of a new course in an affiliated college for the academic year 2020-21 within one month from the date of commencement of the Ordinance,” says the amendments made to the Acts of the four universities. Innovative courses The Ordinance was promulgated as part of inviting applications from affiliated colleges for the new innovative and interdisciplinary programmes for the academic year 2020-21. The deadline for submitting applications for the new courses in 2020-21 had already expired and the universities will now get a window of one month for approving the new programmes in affiliated colleges. The government wanted to launch the new innovative programmes from November 1 onwards.   The gazette notification says the Assembly is not in session and the Governor is satisfied that circumstances exist that render it necessary for him to take immediate action. With the promulgation of the Ordinance, the universities can invite applications for the innovative and interdisciplinary undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in its affiliated colleges. The universities are likely to call for applications for launching nearly 100 to 150 new courses in this academic year.  An order issued by the Department of Higher Education on September 18 says that NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) score and NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) ranking need not be insisted for colleges having necessary infrastructure to start four- and five-year programmes. The proposals of colleges belonging to Scheduled Castes’ trusts can also be recommended, even if unaccredited, it says. The department had asked the universities to consider the recommendations of the Kerala State Higher Education Council while recommending the new innovative and interdisciplinary programmes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/varsities-will-get-to-host-new-courses/article32787657.ece

The Kochi Corporation signed a joint declaration of intent with the Ernakulam Jilla Autorickshaw Drivers’ Co-operative Society (EJADCS), an umbrella group of six trade unions of autorickshaw drivers, to run about a 100 e-autos as a pilot project. The e-autos will hit the roads of West Kochi (all 28 divisions), Elamkulam and Kadavanthra. A study by GIZ (the German Agency for International Cooperation), which is offering technical support to the corporation in implementing the project, had identified these areas as being poorly connected to and from bus stands and metro stations. Some of these areas, a few with narrow roads, including several parts of West Kochi, are not quite connected by public transport, the study had found. The project is part of the civic administration’s Integrated Sustainable Urban Transport Systems for Smart Cities (SMART-SUT) scheme detailed in the current financial year’s budget. An e-auto network would both help reduce carbon emissions, ensure better connectivity in some parts of the city and offer a pocket-friendly mode of transport, Mayor Soumini Jain said in a release. The EJADCS will purchase the vehicles and run the share e-autos along fixed routes that are not part of regular bus and metro routes. In addition to the subsidy offered by State and Union governments for purchase of electric vehicles that the cooperative society can claim, the Kochi Corporation will also be able to offer financial support through the funds the local body will receive for the project from GIZ and UN Habitat. The remaining amount will be funded through a loan taken by the society. GIZ will also fund the charging infrastructure and the auto stands that the corporation will set up. The society would rent the e-autos out to drivers, said M. B. Syamandabhadran, president, EJADCS. Depending on the success of the pilot project, the corporation is likely to scale it up to about 1000 e-autos. The team implementing the project had been waiting for the COVID-19 situation to ease up before launching the e-autos out of fear that the drivers might not find regular commuters with the pandemic, sources associated with it said. The upcoming local body elections could also delay the project and the funds the corporation is set to receive. They were, however, hopeful of implementing the project by February next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-to-have-new-fleet-of-e-autos/article32788055.ece

But then, business went off the boil and the outbreak of the pandemic sealed his fate. After nearly three decades in the field, Mr. Vidyasagar is now a non-player, dependent on the meagre income from his photostat shop at Nedumbassery that is not doing brisk business either. “I used to buy plots along with three others and then sell it in small parcels for small margins. The progressive increase in fair value over the years had already driven small players like us out of business when the pandemic erupted and hit our fortunes,” he said. K.S. Suresh Kumar, district secretary of All Kerala Document Writers and Scribes Association, lamented how the fair value of land had gone up by 50% in last five years, with 10% rise in every State budget, making property deals in general untenable. “The 10% stamp and registration duties meant that a property deal worth Rs. 10 lakh attracts a duty of Rs. 1 lakh. The demand for pegging these duties at 5% like many other States has gone unheeded,” he said. Paul T.C., another small real estate broker, said while the impact of the pandemic was temporary, the real deal-breaker for the sector was the demonetization of 2016 from which the sector never really recovered. “While the property deals have dried up, the land price, especially in urban areas never really dropped. Land largely remains with the wealthy class and they are not willing to sell it at throwaway prices,” he said. Joy Antony, who runs a website for property deals, however, claimed that there was a mini-surge for newly-built medium houses and small plots among expatriates forced to return in the wake of the pandemic. “We are receiving many such enquires, probably because expatriates have advanced their plans to buy houses and invest in land. Besides, they are no longer able to stay with their relatives or extended family on return as in the past owing to the quarantine protocol,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/small-players-lose-ground/article32788044.ece
07 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Mars lights up night sky as it comes closest to Earth||Skywatchers in Kerala are delighted that Mars will be visible to the naked eye in a rare celestial configuration that coincides with World Space Week which is observed from October 4 to 10. Mars rises by 7 p.m. and sets about 7 a.m. and can be seen in the easterly direction of the sky as a reddish spot. The red planet can easily be identified because it does not twinkle like stars. Mars can be observed in the eastern sky between 9 p. m. and 5 a. m., says GangadharanVellur, a skywatcher who runs an observatory at Payyannur. P.N. Thankachan, secretary of the State unit of the Breakthrough Science Society in Kottayam, says the iron oxide on the surface of Mars gives it a red complexion. This time, Mars's orbit came closest to Earth on October 6, at 62.07 million km. Mars will be visible for much of 2020 and early next year. In 2003, Mars made its closest approach to Earth in nearly 60,000 years. It would not be that close again until the year 2287. The red planet comes close enough for exceptional viewing only once or twice every 15 or 17 years. Next Mars Close Approach is in 2022. If Earth and Mars had perfectly circular orbits, their minimum distance would always be the same. However, they have elliptical paths. In addition, gravitational tugging by planets constantly changes the shape of their orbits a little bit. The orbits of Mars and Earth are also slightly tilted with respect to each other. While Earth only takes 365 days to complete an orbit around the Sun, Mars takes 687 days. Along with Mars, skywatchers will also be able to see Jupiter and Saturn in the western sky from 8 p.m. about five degrees above the horizon as bright balls, which do not twinkle. Saturn can be seen as an yellowish ball. This is because of a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn that occurs every 20 years. The conjunction officially occurs on December 21, 2020.

07 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Dip in revenue of Registration dept.||The pandemic has dealt a severe blow to the government’s revenue through the Registration Department in the district, with the number of registrations and the resultant income dropping significantly. The district has a total of 25 sub registrar offices and they collectively recorded 6,427 registrations accounting for Rs. 56.45 crore in March, towards the fag end of which the State went for a lockdown that lasted over two months. In February and January, the registrations and resultant revenue were pegged at 7,625 and Rs. 63.11 crore, and 7,790 and Rs. 63.92 crore respectively. With restrictions in place and registration limited to 10 a day in each office, the number of registrations in April nosedived to an unprecedented low of 479, generating revenue of Rs. 6.45 crore. Though the operations are back to normal, the registrations are yet to touch pre-lockdown levels. In May, 4,379 registrations were held netting Rs. 43 crore, whereas in June and July, the numbers were 5,292 and Rs. 44.21 crore and 5,048 and Rs. 43.62 crore. August has so far registered the biggest post-lockdown revenue of Rs. 48.88 crore from 4,931 registrations. However, it remains a far cry from Rs. 59.70 crore, Rs. 59.56 crore and Rs. 65.28 crore in the last three months respectively of 2019. During those three months 7,276, 7,356, and 7,107 registrations were done in the district. The registration of sale deeds, reflecting property transactions and the biggest revenue grosser for the Department, remains particularly dented. In March, the revenue from sale deed registration stood at Rs. 47.11 crore, a fall from Rs. 52.49 crore in February and Rs. 54.62 crore in January. In the last three months of 2019, the revenue on this count was Rs. 50.67 crore, Rs. 52.37 crore and Rs. 56.69 crore respectively. In April it plummeted to Rs. 5.70 crore, before rising to Rs. 35.37 crore in May, Rs. 37.36 crore in June, Rs. 38.06 crore in July, and Rs. 41.68 crore in August. Registration of gift deeds, settlement deeds, exchange deeds, partition, release, mortgage and lease deeds accounts for other major transactions and source of revenue.  Stamp paper shortage The shortage of stamp papers has also affected registrations. Senior Revenue Department sources attributed it to logistical problems in sourcing stamp paper from the Nashik press, owing to the proliferation of COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra. It had been dealt with and the shortage would be resolved shortly, said sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-dents-coffers-of-registration-department/article32788043.ece
07 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Traffic at Palarivattom not hit: study||Attribute it to the decline in the number of vehicles in the wake of the prohibitory orders in place or the effectiveness of the traffic re-routing arrangements, either way, the closure of the Palarivattom underpass for the demolition of the flyover seems to have hardly disrupted the traffic. In fact, traffic flow at the underpass this Monday, the first working day since the traffic restrictions kicked in, compared to the last Monday was much less as per a comparative study put out by the traffic police. The study looked at the traffic flow to the Palarivattom bypass junction from all four directions – Edappally, Kakkanad, Vyttila, and Palarivattom – through the peak morning hours between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. and evening peak hours between 4 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. During none of the time slots, the traffic through the underpass this Monday matched with that of the previous Monday. As per the study, before the closure of the underpass, the biggest surge in the traffic flow from the Edappally side to the underpass was witnessed between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. and 6.45 p.m. From the Kakkanad side, the traffic flow was almost uniformly hectic between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. and between 5.15 p.m. and 6.15 p.m. Traffic flow to the Palarivattom underpass from the Vyttila side peaked between 9.30 a.m. and 10.45 a.m. and then between 5.30 p.m. and 6.45 p.m. whereas from the Palarivattom side it peaked between 10 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. and 5.15 p.m. and 7.15 p.m. However, since the closure of the underpass, the traffic flow was uniformly sedate except for a minor surge from the Palarivattom side during the time slots of 6 p.m. and 6.15 p.m. though even that was no match to the traffic during the same time before the closure of the underpass. Signal at the Palarivattom bypass remains switched off and direct movement across the junction to Kakkanad and Palarivattom remains banned. The traffic police have knocked down the median immediately after the junction en route to both Vyttila and Edappally, opening up a wider U-turn facilitating smooth passage even for bigger vehicles headed to both Palarivattom and Kakkanad respectively. “The relatively narrower U-turns before Oberon Mall and Ernakulam Medical Centre during similar restrictions in the past used to hold up traffic. Further, cones have been intelligently used to facilitate seamless movement of oncoming vehicles and those taking the U-turns,” said a cop deployed for regulating traffic. However, indiscriminate speeding by motorists ignorant about the U-turns poses a potential threat of accidents, especially during nights, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/closure-of-palarivattom-underpass-hardly-affecting-traffic-claims-study/article32788053.ece

Several persons at the market, including traders and headload workers, had tested positive for the virus on Sunday. Following the closure of the Palayam market in Kozhikode, merchants had shifted their activities to the Vengeri market. Several shopkeepers had then warned that the Vengeri market too would have to be closed soon if the health authorities failed to take precautionary measures. Traders reportedly paid no heed to authorities asking them to wear masks and maintain physical distancing. However, the abrupt closure of the Vengeri market left many farmers from Malappuram and the rural areas of Kozhikode who arrived for the bi-weekly auction in the lurch.

As many as 685 of the infected contracted the disease through local transmission, said a release. The source of infection of 33 people is not known. There are 23 health workers among the newly infected. Three women councillors of the Kozhikode Corporation have been tested positive for the virus. Locally acquired infections continued to be high within Kozhikode Corporation limits, with 358 people testing positive. There are 35 cases in Kuruvattoor, 29 in Peruvayal, 27 in Olavanna, and 20 in Omassery. The total number of active cases in the district is now 9,933, of which 5,999 people are in home isolation.

07 October 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Will CPI(M) re-think strategy of wooing IUML dissidents?||The experiment of the CPI(M) to strengthen its relations with the Muslim community by wooing disgruntled elements of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) from time to time is viewed in the party circles as a liability for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) after the gold smuggling case hanging over the heads of some leaders. The gold smuggling case, according to CPI(M) sources, has set off debates within the party circles about the party continuing the experiment. The latest trigger for the debate is Karat Faisal, an LDF-backed councillor of Koduvally municipality, being taken into custody by the Customs Commissionerate (Preventive) in Kochi last week in connection with the gold smuggling case. The sleuths also raided and seized documents from a private hospital of which he is the executive director. Incidentally, P.T.A. Rahim, another CPI(M)-backed legislator, representing Kunnamangalam segment, is the chairman of the hospital. Already, a section of the CPI(M) cadres in north Kerala has covertly expressed reservations about the party continuing this experiment in the wake of the interrogation of the Minister of Higher Education, K.T. Jaleel, by the premier anti-terror agency, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), a week after he was questioned by another Central agency, the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Lok Sabha polls The party leadership has been wobbling around this experiment even after the LDF’s dismal performance in the Lok Sabha polls last year. The induction of the Indian National League into the LDF and the subsequent merger of the National Secular Conference (NSC) of Mr. Rahim failed to impact the community arithmetic in its favour unlike the previous Assembly polls. Incidentally, the merger of the NSC with INL was done with the approval of the CPI(M). Mr. Rahim, a former district secretary of the IUML, had left the party almost a decade ago and won from Koduvally and Kunnamangalam Assembly segments in the 2006 and 2011 polls. Mr. Rahim was in the news when his son and son- in-law were among the 19 Keralites arrested in Saudi Arabia two years ago. Karat Razak, legislator of Koduvally, was the IUML’s general secretary of the Koduvally mandalam before he won with the support of the LDF in the 2016 Assembly elections. Last year, although the Supreme Court had stayed a Kerala High Court verdict disqualifying Mr. Razak, the apex court had restrained him from taking part in voting in the Assembly and he would not receive any emoluments as an MLA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/will-cpim-re-think-strategy-of-wooing-iuml-dissidents/article32787630.ece
07 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Quota for differently abled in college posts||Four per cent of teaching and non-teaching staff posts in aided colleges affiliated to Calicut University will now be reserved for differently abled persons. Such a move is reportedly a first for any university in the State and in line with a government directive. This follows the amending of rules for the purpose at an online meeting of the Calicut University Senate held on Tuesday. Backlog vacancies The decision would be enforced with retrospective effect from April 18, 2017, according to sources, who added that backlog posts from 1996 too would be filled. The backlog posts in university departments would be filled in line with government rules and court directives, said Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj. Meanwhile, the Senate meeting also decided to include an amendment in its statutes limiting the tenure of university registrar, exam controller, and finance officer to four years or 56 years of age, whichever is earlier. Within this age limit, qualified people could get up to two terms.  Also, the Senate approved a rule that enables teachers in aided colleges to hold the position of university registrar, which was opposed by members belonging to the United Democratic Front (UDF). They pointed out that a petition had been filed in the Kerala High Court stating that only those from government colleges could hold the post through deputation and that the current registrar, C.L. Joshi, was a teacher in an aided college in Thrissur. The petition was to come up for hearing on Tuesday. The pro-UDF members questioned the legal validity of amending the rule, which had not been discussed at the Syndicate meeting. The Senate also approved 35,058 graduate degrees, 350 postgraduate degrees, one M.Phil degree, 91 Ph.D degrees, and eight diploma certificates.

07 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Dismal performance of Kerala students in Joint Entrance Exam||The performance of candidates from Kerala at the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) and (Advanced), 2020 has been dismal when compared to other States in national-level rankings. Several reasons have been attributed to the poor ranks of candidates seeking admission to National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) "A major reason is the lack of orientation and focus among middle class families on national-level engineering entrance tests. Our students have to compete with counterparts from other States who prepare for the JEE from Class VIII or IX," says K.A. Abdul Nazeer, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, and former Chairman - UG Admissions, National Institute of Technology, Calicut, (NIT-C). He says upper middle class families who are aware of the JEE show a reluctance to send their children to study outside the State. "It is neither the poor quality of teaching methodology nor the ineffective teaching methods of mathematics which is generally believed to be a factor that deprives Kerala students from competing at the national exams," he adds. Preference Arun Viswanthan, branch head of a coaching centre, says parental focus in Kerala is more on medical studies than engineering colleges. “That is why candidates from Kerala perform better in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to MBBS, BDS courses and other undergraduate medical courses in India," he says. The difficulty level of the JEE (Main) and (Advanced) could be tide over by specialised and targeted coaching methods. "Besides, the mindset of parents who want their children only to score A plus in all subjects in Plus Two exams should also change," Mr. Viswanthan says. Another reason, he says, is that parents and students feel that engineering has no scope in a State like Kerala without industrial development. "This is unlike in other southern States and north Indian cities," he adds. Had it not been for the 50 % home quota, candidates from Kerala would have to struggle for admission at the NIT-C as well. "To improve the examination skills of students, the KEAM entrance tests should be done away with and instead the allotment process at engineering colleges in the State should for done exclusively for Kerala students through the JEE (Main) ranks," Prof. Nazeer says, adding that then candidates would not have to appear for two engineering tests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dismal-performance-of-kerala-students-in-joint-entrance-exam/article32787726.ece

07 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Online training module for behavioural issues||The Kozhikode-based Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS) is launching an online training programme titled ‘Saphalam’ to help parents of children who need treatment for developmental and behavioural issues. According to IMHANS sources, the programme will be implemented by the early intervention unit in the Child Development Service (CDS) at the institute. The CDS has been working towards identifying various development and growth issues, behavioural and learning defects, and speech disabilities among children and offering scientific solutions, they said. Early stimulation, early intervention, speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, behavioural therapy, remedial training, hearing check-up, and family counselling are being provided. As many as 5,000 children are seeking treatment here every year. In the wake of the COVID-19 situation, however, children are unable to attend therapy sessions at hospitals and health centres. The online programme will train the parents of children aged up to three to identify growth and developmental issues, provide treatment or therapy, and empower them. The registered parents will be sent a link. Experts at IMHANS will call them later to group the children based on their issues. The parents will then be given directions online, including a set of guidelines titled ‘Veettiloru therapist’ (A therapist at home).

Jishnu Vijayan, a member of the Samskarika Sahiti from Shoranur, staged a Mohiniyattam performance in front of the Collectorate, inviting the attention of a lot of people. Mr. Jishnu’s protest was against the alleged caste discrimination by the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi. Recent incident R.L.V. Ramakrishnan, classical dancer and younger brother of the late actor Kalabhavan Mani, had attempted suicide a few days ago alleging caste discrimination by the office-bearers of the Sangeetha Nataka Akademi headed by actor K.P.A.C. Lalita. Mr. Jishnu said that the ignominy suffered by Mr. Ramakrishnan was an insult to Kerala’s cultural sphere. Inaugurating the programme held under the banner of the Samskara Sahiti, its district chairman Boban Mattumantha demanded that the akademi heal the wound suffered by Kerala by taking appropriate action against those responsible. “The Akademi’s alleged attempts to shoo away artistes on the basis of caste will ruin the cultural values the State achieved in recent decades. It is an indication of the beginning of the State’s return to cultural casteism,” said Mr. Mattumantha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dancing-in-protest-against-caste-discrimination/article32787637.ece

A senior police officer told The Hindu on Tuesday that investigators had collected 45 material objects from the scene of the fire for criminological examination to determine the cause of the blaze. The forensic laboratory had examined two items and submitted its preliminary finding in court in a sealed cover. It was in the process of reviewing the rest of the evidence.  The police would reach a final conclusion only after analysing the forensic results in entirety. Preliminary evidence pointed to fire caused by an electrical short circuit. The police were yet to stumble upon any evidence suggesting sabotage or arson, the officer said. Oppn. charge Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the forensic report had lent credence to the suspicion that the fire was an act of sabotage to destroy evidence in the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case. The government feared that Central law enforcement agencies would seek those files as part of their investigation in the case. Mr. Chennithala demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident. BJP State president K. Surendran said the report pointed to a deep-rooted conspiracy to destroy evidence in the case. The economic offence, which had the tacit approval of higher-ups in the government, had profound national security implications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-evidence-of-short-circuit-forensic-report/article32787656.ece
07 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Job portal proves a saving grace for many||A job portal launched by a group of Technopark employees to help those from the IT sector who have lost jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be of much help to them during this period of crisis. As many as 75 people have now found new jobs through thejobs.prathidhwani.orgportal, run by Prathidhwani, a welfare organisation of IT employees across Kerala. In May, The Hindu had reported the launch of the job portal by the employees. Since the launch, 1,500 job posts have been listed on it by 100 different employers, with 1,200 people registering for jobs, including those who are employed at present and are looking for better options. On Tuesday, Sasi Pilacheri Meethal, CEO of Technoparks and IT Parks, Kerala, launched an improved version of the portal through a videoconferencing event. “We give priority to those who have lost their jobs during the pandemic period. While registering, they have an option to mention this. Such profiles will be highlighted. Employers who are searching for candidates can filter to see just the ones whose careers were affected by COVID-19. This will be helpful for those looking for experienced hands and also want to help out those who have lost their jobs,” says Nishin T.N., a representative of Prathidhwani. Statistics The team running the portal collects statistics on the trending jobs that employers are looking for the most in the portal and plans to conduct training sessions to upskill those who were laid off, with the help of the Prathidhwani technical forum. As part of the weekly technical sessions, training will be imparted. Prathidhwani also recently carried out a drive to identify people who have lost their jobs during this period and are in dire need of financial assistance. As part of this, 31 such employees were identified and Rs. 5,000 each was provided to them, using money pooled from amongst the employees. Some IT companies in Kerala, including in Technopark and Infopark in Kochi, had laid off employees without even the necessary compensation. Although ‘performance issues’ were cited in all cases, those who have got the pink slips say that this is just a reason being made up to cut down numbers and save on employee cost. Many of them have been struggling post the job loss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/job-portal-proves-a-saving-grace-for-many/article32788219.ece
07 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Capital tests more people, reports 989 infected||The capital district recorded 989 cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday with testing picking up after a lull during the weekend. Bringing much relief, the recovery rate remained on the higher side in the district as 850 people tested negative on the day. Active cases The number of active cases stood at 12,518 in Thiruvananthapuram. The significant rise in COVID-19 caseload from 700 the previous day is attributed to the rise in the number of tests from 3,736 to 5,797. The district administration has tested 3,35,972 people so far. The death toll also continued to grow at an alarming rate with nine more people succumbing to the disease. Deaths With the deaths of the natives of Vettucaud (70-year-old), Nemom (63), Valiyathura (64), Nellivila (59), Kovalam (37), Amaravila (62), Chembazhanthy (71), Thirumala (61), and Fort (78) being attributed to COVID-19, the count rose to 258. Among those who tested positive, 892 people acquired the infection through local transmission, while the health authorities were yet to trace the source of infection in 81 other cases. Sixteen health workers have also been diagnosed with the disease. According to the official statistics, 146 people aged above 60 years and 103 children aged below 15 years are among those infected on the day. The worst-affected among local bodies in the district were Thiruvananthapuram Corporation (346 cases), Neyyattinkara Municipality (71), Balaramapuram (32), Vilavoorkkal (27) and Karakulam (26) grama panchayats. In Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, the highest number of cases were reported in Manacaud (17 cases), Thampanoor (16), and Medical College (12) wards. Eight more police officers, including four attached to the Museum police and three attached to the Nedumangad police, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the district. During his daily briefing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan pointed out that the case per million rose in Thiruvananthapuram during the last week. Doubling rate The doubling rate of COVID-19 has, however, increased in the district unlike in some other districts in the State. The district administration have declared new containment zones in RRV and Choottayil wards in Kilimanoor grama panchayat, Navaikulam ward in Navaikulam grama panchayat, Chilambara and Chemboor in Aryancode grama panchayat, Alampotta in Neyyattinkara Municipality, Gandhismarakom in Azhoor grama panchayat, and Vencode in Elakamon grama panchayat.

07 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State pandemic curve defies predictions||With the estimated effective reproduction number for COVID-19 (a measure of the disease’s transmission potential) in the State still remaining high at 1.21, it is possible that Kerala’s agony over COVID-19 could be extended over many more months, epidemiologists and public health professionals now say. On the one hand it spreads out the infection over a period, helping the State to keep the case fatality down. On the other hand, the adverse impact on economy and COVID-related psycho-social issues could be prolonged. Onam impact There is speculation that Onam celebrations and the widespread political agitations that followed soon after may have taken the pandemic curve to a new trajectory, with the result that predictions about the epidemic’s peak have become uncertain. Case estimations “Compared to the previous weeks, the doubling time has increased slightly and the case estimations, while still significantly high, have come down a notch. The new restrictions imposed by the State and the general sense of fear might bring down cases slightly in the next two weeks, it is hoped. However, the upcoming Sabarimala pilgrimage could upset all that and take the State to another peak,” says a senior public health professional. Whatever be the interventions at disease containment, the pandemic has a natural logic which cannot be defied. Case numbers will continue to go up and one can only amp up the preparedness to meet it face on, he points out. “Accuracy of projections depends on how unbiased the data are. We are not sure how unbiased the test positivity data are because testing is generally done in people who are symptomatic/high risk and the question is whether we should expect that in the general population. For projections to be accurate, we need data collected in a randomised surveillance mode,” says K.P. Aravindan, a public health professional. Sero prevalence rate “We thought that we would be peaking by October. But the results of the second round of Indian Council of Medical Research’s sero surveillance study done in three districts have now prompted a rethink that the peak is still far away. The sero prevalence rate of 0.8% in August in Kerala against the national average of 6.6 % seems way too low,” he adds. But then, ICMR’s study was not State specific and it was done only to estimate a national average. The sample size was low at 1,281 and the districts covered were Thrissur, Ernakulam, and Palakkad. Underestimation? It is possible that the ICMR sample may have given an underestimation of actual sero prevalence in the State because it does not include data from a district such as Thiruvananthapuram where disease transmission has been intense. “Which is why it is important for the State to do a well-designed sero prevalence study on its own in all districts, with the help of any scientific institution. It will help us give unbiased data, which can also help us make better case projections,” Dr. Aravindan says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-pandemic-curve-defies-predictions/article32787736.ece

At the same time, the government, on the basis of a detailed enquiry report filed by the Director of Medical Education, has recommended disciplinary action against the Unit Chief (Unit 5) of the Orthopaedics department, Thiruvananthapuram MCH, under whose care the patient had been admitted. The report has also pinned responsibility for compromising the care of the bedridden patient, on the nursing staff and the supervisory officers The DME has been directed to initiate disciplinary action against supervisory head nurses, the staff nurses, and nursing assistants on duty for the last three days. The report by DME states that maximum patient care should have been ensured with available resources by doing time structuring and proper prioritisation of patients needing assisted care, as is being done in other medical colleges. The suspension of the health-care workers had provoked the entire medical faculty into a strike across the State for the past two days. They had put the blame for the unfortunate incident on the fact that the hospital was acutely short of support staff. They had threatened to launch an indefinite strike boycotting all non-COVID duties if the suspension order was not revoked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-revokes-suspension-of-health-care-workers/article32788222.ece
07 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Chief Minister, IMA spar over COVID handling||A strongly worded statement from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) pointing out the lacunae in the State’s preparedness to face the crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and accusing the government of leaving pandemic management to bureaucrats rather than health experts seems to have got the goat of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who has in turn accused that those criticising the government have a warped mindset. The IMA issued the statement against the background of the agitation of doctors on Monday accusing the government of demoralising health-care workers and pointing out the issues in COVID-19 management. The attack on the Health Department’s COVID-19 management was not taken kindly by Mr. Vijayan, who, while inaugurating new family health centres, accused the IMA of becoming “self-styled health experts” and “trying to mislead the public about the Health Department”.  Scientific advice He claimed that the Health Department had been managing COVID-19 fully on the basis of scientific advice and with necessary caution and said that those accusing the Health Department of mismanagement had vested interests in mind. When contacted, IMA leaders maintained that they had only done some plain speak and that they had chosen not to mince words because the crisis involving COVID-19 was real and with the number of serious patients going up, the State needed to do much more than what was being done now on the critical care front. “All available ICU facilities in the State are nearly 80% full now. In the next two weeks, we fear that the situation will go out of hand. The government needs to focus better on critical care capacity building and ensuring more human resource,” IMA State secretary P. Gopikumar said. The Chief Minister, during his evening briefing, said the State government was consulting the IMA on many things and their suggestions were being taken. However, the IMA did not seem to be enjoying the same stature with the Union Health Ministry or with other State governments, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chief-minister-ima-spar-over-covid-handling/article32787737.ece

Details of 3.07 lakh elderly in the district were collected earlier in the pandemic by the government. The call centre, attached to the district cell for the elderly, was launched a month ago. So far, nearly 15,000 calls have been made and received at the call centre, which is part of the Grand Care project of the Social Justice Department. Sociology and psychology higher secondary teachers, anganwadi workers and supervisors, and volunteers handle the calls. Interventions are made with the support of the National Health Mission under the Health Department, Kerala Social Security Mission, Women and Child Development Department, Local Self-government Department, and the Kudumbashree, says District Social Justice Officer Gibson Raj. Focus of the project Focus at present is on reaching out to the elderly who live alone in the district and have no one to look after them or face financial difficulties or other such problems. So far, more than 12,103 elderly who live alone have been contacted. In one such case, an elderly man from Thirupuram who had no one to look after him developed an ulcer on his leg that then became infested with maggots. His health was assessed by a medical team and moved into the reverse quarantine centre for the elderly at Vallakkadavu where he is recovering. He is now set to be moved to an old-age home. Other such elderly may also be moved into such institutions. If the elderly are in need of medical consultation, the call centre will arrange it through telemedicine as part of the eSanjeevani project. If medical attention, including for lifestyle disorders, is deemed necessary, then one of the eight teams deployed by the Kerala Social Security Mission (KSSM) as part of Vayomithram across the district visits them at home. Medicines are arranged through primary health centres. If there is no one to pick the medicines up, these are delivered to the doorstep through ASHA workers. Medicines not available through PHCs are delivered by the KSSM teams, says Mr. Raj. The call centre is also paying attention to the mental health of the elderly who are alone. Problems Psychological problems arising from the extended reverse quarantine period are addressed through telecounselling. More interventions may also be needed. One elderly man who would rip at his clothes and whose wife refused to take care of him too has been moved to the reverse quarantine centre. The department is now mulling what other steps can be taken.  So far, more than 12,103 elderly who live alone have been contacted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/succour-thats-just-a-phone-call-away/article32787709.ece

Venkateshwarlu, Vice Chancellor, Central University of Kerala (CUK), Kasaragod, has said. Prof. Venkateshwarlu, who assumed charge two months ago, told The Hindu on Monday that the policy document identifies the lacunae that hindered the evolution of a strong research culture in higher educational institutions. “To promote a conducive environment for innovation, we will have to address our approach to integrity in research, and existing standards, protocols and policies in research organisations,” he said. Hailing the plan to establish the National Research Foundation (NRF) as a progressive move, he said the proposed agency will facilitate incentives for outstanding research, even while funding institutions such as the DST, DBT, ICAR and ICSSR will continue funding research in priority areas. In effect, the endeavour is likely to have a significant impact on research funding. The National Education Policy (NEP), which augers well for promoting research and innovation from the school level, lays emphasis on more play and discovery-based style of learning, he said.  Flexible approach “The curricula and methods of teaching and evaluation will have to be flexible to promote a research culture. Ample freedom has to be allotted to students to ask questions and to explore the problems posed to them. Kindling their curiosity and a perfect understanding of what makes them interested are very essential to build an innovative mind. We can develop curious and innovative minds among school students if we succeed in implementing the real spirit of NEP 2020. The benefit of such efforts will gradually translate to the higher education level,” the academician said. Prof. Venkateshwarlu called for urgent steps to realise the target to spend 6% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for education and earmarking a sufficient portion for research. Researchers across higher education institutions and research organisations must be encouraged to take up research on study areas including socio-economic aspects, culture and science, he said.  Kindling students’ curiosity and a perfect understanding of what makes them interested are very essential to build an innovative mind||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nep-promotes-research-culture-says-cuk-vice-chancellor/article32787632.ece

He was speaking while inaugurating a web rally organised by the Kerala Vidhyabhyasa Samithi, a platform of Left-aligned service organisations, demanding the withdrawal of the policy on Tuesday. Mr. Vijayan said formulation of the policy without incorporating the States’ views went against the spirit of the federal framework. “Federalism can thrive only when the States are empowered to fine-tune national policies in line with ground realities and diverse views. However, the Centre has chosen to centralise decision-making powers and weaken the plural nature that existed in education systems,” he said. Special education zones While the NEP 2020 calls for declaring regions with large sections of socially and economically disadvantaged groups as Special Education Zones, the Chief Minister cautioned that the concept envisaged bringing such areas under the supervision of Central agencies, further posing danger to the federal structure. According to Mr. Vijayan, the NEP that aspires to create a centralised system from the pre-primary to the research level will wipe off academic autonomy. Besides, the plan to replace the apex advisory body Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) with Rashtriya Shiksha Ayog will lead to excessive centralisation of powers. While the CABE ensured equal representation of each State, the proposed body is likely to be an exclusive panel with several States left out. He also blamed the Centre for making no attempt to address the reasons that contributed to the high drop-out rates. While around 10% of the students dropped out at the primary level, the corresponding rates increased to 21% and 43.5% before the secondary and higher secondary school levels respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nep-threatens-countrys-federal-structure-pinarayi/article32788227.ece

07 October 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Once brimming irrigation tank turns dry||More than 100 borewells dug in the past one year, a majority of them during the pandemic, have gone dry, and Pathacheruvu, a village in Kalyandurg mandal of the district, today resembles a ‘graveyard of borewells’ (a rough estimate puts their number at 1,000), where hardly a couple of them yield one-inch of water from 500 feet below the surface. Interestingly, residents had to abandon the village in 2002 because of abundance of water in the irrigation tank by the same name — Pathacheruvu or Peddacheruvu. The village, situated about a couple of km from the Anantapur - Kalyandurg State Highway, used to get cut off from the remaining areas due to the overflowing irrigation tank. With much persuasion, the TDP government had given small bits of land to the villagers close to the State Highway. The new habitation got the same name (Pathacheruvu) in the revenue records. Today, there is an eerie silence in the old habitation as it has been abandoned. Only the superstructures of houses remain. Despite the district recording 100% excess rainfall in September, there is not a drop of water in the Peddacheruvu. As a result, farmers such as Shyamanthi Eswaramma struggle to irrigate the tomato crop. With the inflows into the irrigation tank dwindling over the last 18 years, the villagers started sinking tens of borewells every year, and Eswaramma’s husband had sunk 15 boreswells. Burdened with debts and apprehending pressure from the money-lenders, he had deserted his wife and three children and left for Bengaluru. But Eswaramma stayed put, purchased a bullock and began farming. Besides farming, she had taken up rearing of country hens to make both ends meet. In the last one year, she sunk three borewells, and only one yields one-inch of water for an hour, enough for a small piece of land adjacent to the old habitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/once-brimming-irrigation-tank-turns-dry/article32788127.ece

It was during the period of the current Communist Party of India(CPI) State secretary and the then Anantapur MLA K. Ramakrishna (1994) that the Kakkalapalli tank last overflowed. Adjacent to the Anantapur Municipal Corporation Limits, the tank provides water to farmers growing tomatoes, grapes, and groundnut.

07 October 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chain-snatching gangs on the prowl in Chittoor-Tamil Nadu border areas||The Chittoor police on Tuesday alerted people in the eastern mandals bordering with Tamil Nadu to be alert about strangers moving on sports bikes on rural roads, and immediately inform the area police if they found any suspicious movements. A chain-snatching incident on the Srikalahasti-Pichatur road under the KVB Puram police station on Monday, in which an elderly woman suffered minor injuries, created a flutter. Two youth on a high-end motorcycle without a registration plate were seen moving on the isolated road, away from the Puttur-Chennai NH. The duo, suspected to be from Tami Nadu, allegedly attacked an elderly woman while she was going to her village, and decamped with a gold chain weighing 16 gm in a flash. Immediately after the attack, the residents informed the area police, who scrutinised the CCTV footage at vital junctions. “Except for one side angle at one junction, the duo’s movement was not recorded anywhere in other junctions. This shows that they made themselves thorough with the digital surveillance network and are targeting rural areas without CC cameras,” sub-inspector of KVB Puram police station D. Gopi said. It is suspected that some motorcycle-borne youth from Tamil Nadu had allegedly formed into groups to indulge in chain-snatchings. Their modus operandi is to not only target lonely women pedestrians, but also women pillion riders. The mandals of Puttur, Nagari, Nindra, Nagalapuram, Pitchatur, Varadaiahpalem and Satyavedu in the Chittoor police division, which border with Tamil Nadu are targeted by the gangs, as afaer committing a crime they can cross into Tamil Nadu within 15 minutes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chain-snatching-gangs-on-the-prowl-in-chittoor-tamil-nadu-border-areas/article32788129.ece

07 October 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||No option but to take up RLIS: Jagan||While making a strong pitch for providing water to the drought-prone Rayalaseema districts by scaling up the irrigation projects, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said the State has no option but to take up the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) to utilise 3 tmcft per day from the Srisailam Reservoir (at level below 881 feet) to supplement its projects. In a letter to Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the Chief Minister said, “Telangana, with a mutually-agreed share of 299 tmcft, has a facility to draw 3 tmcft per day at a level of 800 feet, while A.P., with an agreed allocation of 512 tmcft, does not have the capacity to draw water into Pothireddypadu at a water level below 881 feet.” “The State will take up the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme and improve the canal network, consisting of TGP, SRBC, GNSS and KC Canal. There is neither any proposal to draw water more than what is allocated to A.P. nor is there any plan to have new storage,” said Mr. Reddy. Contrary to Telangana’s claims, the combined State had projected the demands of all the projects in the three regions before the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-I, which included extension of the Tungabhadra Project Left Bank Canal, Bhima Project Left Canal and Upper Krishna Project Right Bank Canal, which was adjudicated. Consequently, 17.84 tmcft was allocated to the Jurala project on equitable distribution principle in 1976, he added. The Chief Minister said the drought-prone areas of Rayalaseema and Nellore and Prakasam districts were dependent on the Srisailam project for their drinking, industrial and irrigation needs. “In contrast, Mahabubnagar, Nalgonda and Rangareddy districts of Telangana are able to irrigate more than 30% of the command area with 142 tmcft,” he said. “Water can be drawn for the Rayalaseema LI scheme through the Pothireddypadu head regulator when the level in Srisailam is above +854 ft starting with 7,000 cusecs. The full capacity of 44,000 cusecs can be drawn only when water level is above +881 ft. The FRL is +885 ft in Srisailam, which will be available for a short period of 15-20 days in a year going by the last 10-year record,” he said. Citing the arguments of the State in the KWDT, the Chief Minister said transfer of water outside the river basin was legal within the riparian States. ‘The anomaly’ He also observed that the arrangement of keeping the right side power house of Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam with A.P. and the left side power house with Telangana as per their geographical and territorial location served no purpose as “Telangana generates power at 796 ft itself without any consideration to the basic needs of the six districts of A.P., or the drinking water needs of Chennai, which are met only at 881ft.” “On the contrary, to the advantage of Telangana, the control of Nagarjunasagar dam is with Telangana though the head regulator of NS Right Canal and right half of the dam are in the geographical territory of A.P. This is resulting in A.P. not getting its share and timely releases of water even after issue of release order by the KRMB,” he said. “To correct the anomaly, the control of NSRC head regulator should be kept under Andhra Pradesh control as NSLC head regulator is under the control of Telangana to ensure brotherly relationship between the States. Similarly, power generation in Srisailam on both sides should be undertaken only after the requirements of the six districts of Andhra Pradesh and Chennai are fully met,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rayalaseema-scheme-must-says-jagan/article32787360.ece

Or else, I would be celebrating my achievement by hosting a party,” says Landa Jitendra, who secured all-India first rank in the OBC category and 14th rank in the open category in the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced 2020, the results of which were declared on Monday. He secured a score of 318/396. Speaking to The Hindu from his native village Lavidam in Gurla mandal of Vizianagaram district, Jintendra says the lockdown, which led to the shutdown of the coaching centre, forcing him to stay at home and prepare for the exam, was a major challenge. “There was internet connectivity issue but my parents were a constant support. They would encourage me not to lose heart and be focussed on my preparation,” he said. His father is into transport business and mother a home-maker. “I dedicated 12 to 13 hours in a day for my preparation and now that I have cracked this exam, I can’t wait to join IIT Bombay, where I always wanted to be,” says the youngster who wants to be a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a multi-national company. Gangula Bhuvan Reddy, the All-India second ranker in open category (345/396 marks) is a native of Proddutur in Kadapa district. “I decided to do whatever it takes to secure a good rank in the JEE to bag a seat in IIT-Bombay, one of the premier institutes of the country, when I was in class 9,” he said, informing that he wants to pursue a course in Computer Science and set up his own company some day. “Based on the answer key, I knew that I would be among the top three. I am slightly disappointed for having missed the first position by a whisker but convinced myself thinking that the first ranker would definitely worked a tad harder than me,” he chuckles. Chirag Falor of Pune bagged the All-India first rank with a score of 352/396. Both attributed their success to constant hard work, support from people around them and a steely resolve to make it to the top. Besides the two toppers, four others from the State bagged ranks below 50 and five candidates secured ranks between 50 and 100 in the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) category.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hard-work-helped-jee-advanced-toppers/article32788152.ece

The police were endeavouring to protect the rights of the people round the clock, Mr. Pala Raju told the media at the A.P. Police Headquarters at Mangalagiri on Tuesday. He alleged that Mr. Naidu had given incorrect information on the Rajamahendravaram and Seethanagaram incidents. ‘Prompt action taken’ The police had arrested three persons in a case of teasing in Rajamahendravaram. Similarly, three persons, who included a Sub-Inspector, had been arrested in the Seethanagaram incident. In the Srikakulam incident, action had been taken against the police officer for thrashing a complainant, Mr. Pala Raju said, and asserted that the police had taken prompt action in all the incidents in accordance with the law. “Instead of talking about the police initiating action, Mr. Naidu has been writing letters criticising the DGP and demoralising the police in the State. It is not correct to generalise every incident and create panic among the people,” the DIG said. “Many police personnel are staying away from their families and have been discharging their duties against odds during the pandemic. It is not correct on the part of the Opposition leader to target the police and demoralise the force,” he said. “The police are trying to offer better services to the people, protect their rights and provide foolproof security to each and every citizen,” Mr. Pala Raju said, and appealed to Mr. Naidu not to criticise and insult the system.

07 October 2020||B. ChandrashekharHYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre agrees to refer TS, AP Krishna water issue to tribunal||In a major decision, the Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS) has agreed to look into the request of Telangana to refer the matter of deciding the share of water in the Krishna River between it and Andhra Pradesh afresh under Section 3 of the Inter State River Water Disputes Act, provided Telangana withdraws its case pending in the Supreme Court. The Centre has also agreed to consider the two States’ request to finalise the water shares in the Godavari river too. The two States have agreed to send the proposals seeking a fresh tribunal to decide the water share. As per the Inter State River Disputes Act, the Centre is empowered to take a decision handing over the matter to a tribunal even if one riparian States asks for it, within a year after getting the proposal/request. “Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has agreed to withdraw the case filed by the State in the apex court when we (MoJS) pointed that the Ministry can’t take decision on referring the matter to a tribunal as the matter is sub-judice. Accordingly, Mr. Rao has agreed to put in motion the case withdrawal process from tomorrow (Wednesday) itself to enable the Centre to take the matter of referring water shares to a tribunal,” Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said after the meeting on Tuesday. Once the Ministry receives the written commitment of Telangana that it would withdraw the case pending in the Supreme Court, the Centre would first take legal opinion on whether the matter of deciding the water share between the two States could be given to the existing Brijesh Kumar Tribunal or to constitute a new tribunal for the purpose, the Union Minister said, speaking after the meeting. Although the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal had submitted its report on the allotment of water among the riparian States Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, it is yet to come into force as AP moved the Supreme Court as it was not satisfied with the allocation of water made by the tribunal without any provision of distress sharing mechanism. Later, after AP was bifurcated into AP and Telangana in 2014, the new State too moved the Supreme Court seeking higher allotment of water highlighting the injustices heaped on it from the beginning. The Centre’s decision to consider constituting a new tribunal on Godavari water also assumes significance with AP’s objection to several projects taken up by Telangana in the basin although several of them were taken up during the combined State itself. “It’s going to be a win-win situation for Telangana as there is historical evidence of the region’s neglect in the allotment of water in the two river basins besides having more than double the catchment area compared to AP both in case of Godavari and Krishna rivers,” hoped a senior official of the Irrigation Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-agrees-to-refer-ts-ap-krishna-water-issue-to-tribunal/article32788020.ece

07 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TPCC plans to wrest Dubbak from TRS||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) has termed the ensuing by-election to Dubbak Assembly Constituency in Siddipet district not just a formality to elect a new legislator but an exercise having potential to decide the future of Telangana. In a virtual press meet held on Tuesday, several senior leaders of the party also vowed to put in best of their efforts to snatch the seat from the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) as it did in case of Narayankhed a few years back when by-election was held for the seat following the death of the then sitting legislator P. Kista Reddy. “I request every elector of Dubbak constituency to vote for Congress candidate in the bypoll,” TPCC president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said and added that it was necessary to teach a lesson to the ruling family of the State which, he alleged, was resorting to large-scale corruption and had turned the State politics into a commercial activity. He accused the ruling party of resorting to all sorts of irregularities to win every election. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy stated that he would camp at Dubbak from Wednesday till completion of the polling and would be available to party rank and file in the constituency. He said the responsibility of election to Nizamabad Local Authorities Constituency was given to senior leader and MLC T. Jeevan Reddy. Congress Legislature Party (CLP) Leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka suggested that party take up a state-wide campaign on the anti-people decisions of the State government, including the recent Land Regularisation Scheme (LRS). TPCC working president Ponnam Prabhakar said the party was required to go into people with the slogan of giving an opportunity to the voice that questions — raises problems of people at appropriate fora. Mr. Jeevan Reddy said the bye-election to Dubbak was not only prestigious for the ruling TRS but also to the Opposition Congress and it was an opportunity to expose government’s failures. Former minister J. Geetha Reddy termed the by-election as a pre-final to the 2023 Assembly elections and suggested that party should work with people displaced by Mallannasagar. Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy said party could win Dubbak provided the senior leadership put in combined efforts. Former legislator T. Narsa Reddy said people would vote for Congress if the party leaders stay put in villages during the campaigning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tpcc-plans-to-wrest-dubbak-from-trs/article32788021.ece

Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar, in a virtual press conference, lambasted the Chief Minister for not highlighting the project like the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme from Pothireddypadu during the meeting and claimed that not sending the agenda points to the Centre till a day before the scheduled meeting only reflected the ‘dubious’ stance. The BJP leader wondered why the aggressive tone which was displayed earlier on the ‘illegal’ projects being taken up by Andhra Pradesh government was not highlighted in the meeting. “KCR conveniently wanted to shift the blame on the Centre for his lackadaisical approach towards the new irrigation projects being taken up by the neighbouring State as he had a tacit understanding with the Andhra Pradesh CM,” he charged.

07 October 2020||Vadderigudem,TELANGANA||Vadderigudem Villagers seek relocation||Men, women and children at Vadderigudem, a habitation under the Tirumalagiri gram panchayat of Pedda Adiserlapalli in Nalgonda, are an exceptional category. They have no toilets, effectively. “Men squat on the roadside, women and girls go into the tall grass. It must be easier for men, since we have other issues. And there are swarms of mosquitoes always, sometimes snakes, in the grass. So we go together,” the huddled up women pour out. Vadderigudem, named as its maximum habitants belong to Vaddera caste, has been a formal settlement for decades. Once an arid place, thanks to Hyderabad’s drinking water project, the Alimineti Madhava Reddy Project at Puttamgandi, Vadderigudem has high water table for nearly 20 years. According to Orsu Venkamma, “Water is just two feet under, so leach pits or septic tanks are not possible. I don’t have an option, I am aged, overweight and have joint pains. But the place gets really dirty whenever I use the toilet,” she says. But, how did the administration construct Individual Household Latrines (IHHL) under Swacch Bharat Mission? “They said it was mandatory. They photographed the toilet pan and the door, and later released Rs. 12,000. We requested sarpanch and MLA who came for votes, and voted for them, but the actual problem was not solved,” another woman Yadamma said. Women say there are about 150 of them, who work in self-help groups, who brought pressure on the panchayat and mandal leadership during elections, for toilets. One leader had promised to buy half-acre land on the far side of the grass, to build a septic tank, so that sewage pipeline could be drawn from each house and the waste sent there. “We thought that would be a solution, but it did not work,” younger women, including newly-wed, a few nursing students and college-goers, said. Latest reports available on the State and Centre’s SBM (G) websites confirm that 151 new toilets were built, of which 45 are in Vadderigudem, in Tirumalagiri. They were photographed in the three stages, two fund transfer orders of Rs. 6,000 each were realised, and a 100% IHHL coverage was achieved. And subsequently, two years ago, Tirumalagiri, along with 560-plus villages in 31 mandals in Nalgonda was declared Open Defecation-Free. For the aggrieved women of Vadderigudem now, they see only one remedy: “The only reason to be in Vadderigudem is agriculture, but toilets are not possible. For the same reason, there are no visitors or guests. This village should be banned and we should be relocated. We wish to talk to CM KCR,” they say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vadderigudem-villagers-seek-relocation/article32788195.ece
07 October 2020||New Delhi,||Not getting MSP for produce, allege farmers||Farmers from different villages in Delhi alleged that they are not getting the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce in markets and many times, suffer losses despite the Delhi government promising higher prices than the MSP. “A week ago, I sold about 17 quintals of bajra for Rs. 1,250/quintal to a middleman in Najafgarh mandi. The MSP is more than Rs. 2,100. But we do not get that rate and there is no government control at the mandi. Also, the government does not buy from us,” said 65-year-old Ram Kumar, a farmer from Kharkhari Jatmal village in Delhi. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Delhi in-charge Virender Dagar said the Delhi government had promised them Swaminathan Committee rates for their produce, which is higher than the MSP, but they do not even get the MSP. Naresh Kumar, Chairman of Najafgarh Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), where farmers go to sell their produce, said the FCI (Food Corporation of India) under the Centre has not been procuring any produce from Delhi’s markets since 2015. He said they have written multiple letters to the FCI on the same, but in vain. “The Delhi government has no power to buy produce from farmers and it has no storage. If FCI buys from the farmer, then they will buy at MS. But now when a private person buys, farmers do not get the MSP in most cases,” Mr. Kumar said. He said the farmers are suffering losses because of this problem. On Tuesday, the BKU gave a memorandum to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the issue and he has promised to look into the matter. Panel report In February 2019, the Delhi government had said they have “conceptualised” the implementation of recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee report on farmers that “MSP should be at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production” under a scheme — Mukhya Mantri Kisan Mitra Yojna. An “Agriculture Conference on Implementation of Recommendations of Swaminathan Committee” was also held by Development Minister Gopal Rai. The proposed MSP, with 50% margin at the cost of production, was Rs. 2,616/ quintal and Rs. 2,667/quintal for wheat and paddy respectively. “The proposed MSP structure is higher than the Government of India MSP by Rs. 776/quintal for wheat and Rs. 897/quintal for paddy. It is likely to incur an additional liability of Rs. 96.38 crore, if implemented,” an official statement had said. The FCI was supposed to buy produce from the farmers at the new higher MSP and the Delhi government was to give the extra amount to the Centre. But the scheme did not work out as FCI is not buying the produce, according to Delhi government officials. Mr. Kumar and other farmers said their counterparts in Haryana were getting the MSP of Rs. 2,150/quintal for bajra. “After all my expenses in ploughing, sowing, cost of manure and cutting, I am losing money by selling it at Rs. 1,250/quintal. But what can I do?” said the farmer, who owns two acres of land. Kamal Singh, 60, from the same village said he had sold 27 quintals of wheat at Rs. 1,680/ quintal, which is less than the MSP of Rs. 1,925/quintal of 2019.Many others from the village had similar complaints and said that always middlemen buy from them. Yogesh Phalswal, 25, of Ghumman Hera village said bajra is being sold for around Rs. 1,400/quintal and they do not get MSP. He also showed a WhatsApp message of the purported rates of different produce being sold in the market and all prices in the list, expect for rice, was lower than MSP. A Delhi government spokesperson refused to respond to queries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/not-getting-msp-for-produce-allege-farmers/article32787980.ece

The solution turns the straw and stubble into manure and is seen by the government as a solution to avoid burning them. The Chief Minister made the announcement after visiting a facility in Kharkhari Nahar village, where the bio-decomposer capsule which was developed by Pusa Institute, is made into a solution through a week-long process. Creating a model Development Minister Gopal Rai said: “If Delhi can make a centralised system and do it, then other States can also do it. It depends on how serious they are. Delhi will get benefit only when Punjab and Haryana will use this”. “The entire process of creating the solution to spraying it on the fields across the entire Delhi costs only around Rs. 20 lakh,” the Chief Minister said. Meanwhile, farmers of two villages The Hindu met are wary since they can only sow wheat or mustard about 20-25 days after the government sprays the solution and said they doubt whether the time gap may affect their next crop. About a dozen farmers said that they do not burn the stubble in Delhi and also the crop is cut by labourers not using machines. Surender Singh, 45, a farmer from Kharkhari Jatmal village, said that he was ready to try the new solution on the stubble standing on the ground after selling the straw. Many other farmers had a similar opinion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/will-begin-use-of-bio-decomposer-from-oct-11/article32787983.ece
07 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘No coercive action against FB official’||The Delhi Assembly told the Supreme Court that senior Facebook official Ajit Mohan was summoned to ascertain whether the social media platform, in any way, “contributed” to the situation which culminated in the February communal riots. Further, the Assembly’s Committee on Peace and Harmony wanted to pick brains on how social media can be used to “strengthen the unity among the citizens of Delhi in the future”. “It is the inherent right of the Legislature to examine matters of public importance... This is a matter of great public importance going to the very foundation of the day-to-day functioning of the NCT of Delhi,” the Assembly, represented by advocate Shadan Farasat, explained. Live broadcast Its affidavit submitted on October 5 said the Committee had summoned Mr. Mohan as a witness. There was no coercive action against him. The committee proceedings are conducted in the “most transparent manner with live broadcast”. “A witness cannot claim his right to silence or to be let alone in response to the summons to depose before a lawful Committee of an empowered legislature,” the affidavit contended. The Assembly said Mr. Mohan had attended the proceedings of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on September 2, 2020. “The plea of the petitioners claiming right to silence and violation of other fundamental rights in the present petition is therefore, non-genuine and not in good faith, having appeared before another Legislature knowing fully well that he does not have a right to silence before a committee of a legislature,” the affidavit said. It said the right to remain silent was relevant only in a criminal investigation. “The proceedings before a committee of the Legislature are not criminal or judicial proceedings. There is no accused before a committee,” the affidavit said. “Committee on Peace and Harmony had received multiple complaints/representations addressed to its chairman Raghav Chadha, underscoring the alleged instances of inaction/inability on the part of social media platform - Facebook to enforce its policies against inflammatory and hateful contents. It was alleged in the complaints/representations that even in respect of Delhi riots in February 2020 a lackadaisical approach of Facebook was visible,” the affidavit said.  The court had asked the Assembly to not proceed further with the Facebook official. The next court hearing is on October 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/no-coercive-action-against-fb-official/article32787985.ece

07 October 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Tear gas used on farmers in Haryana||The police resorted to use of tear gas and water cannon on Tuesday to disperse the agitating farmers in Haryana’s Sirsa, as they marched to ‘gherao’ the residence of Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, against the Centre’s agriculture sector laws. Several farmers outfits under the banner of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee held a protest rally in Sirsa after which a group of farmers had ‘marched’ towards Mr. Chautala’s residence even as various routes leading to it were sealed by the police. No clash with farmers “There was no clash with farmers. We had to use water cannons and tear gas, after the agitators broke the first of the two-layer barricades on roads leading to the Dy. CM’s house. They were about to break the second layer, following which we were compelled to use water and tear gas,” Bhupender Singh, SP, Sirsa, told The Hindu . “In the entire incident there were no injuries either to any police personnel or the protesters,” he said. Agitated farmers raised slogans against the Centre and the State governments, terming the laws “anti-farmer”, and demanded Mr. Chautala to withdraw from the coalition government by resigning from his post. “The police lobbed tear gas shells, used water cannon when the farmers tried to go past the barricades to lay siege to the residence of Mr. Chautala,” said Phool Singh Sheokand, president, Haryana Kisan Sabha. Inderjit Singh, a farmer leader associated with the AIKSCC, said the resistance of the farmers will continue. “Either Dushyant Chautala should not claim the legacy of his great-grandfather former Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal or he should quit from his post,” Mr. Singh said. “We will observe October 14 as the MSP rights day and march to Delhi on November 26 and 27,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/tear-gas-used-on-farmers-in-haryana/article32787989.ece

Advocate Varun Singh, representing the sisters, appeared before a Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik. He said that the FIR was registered on September 7 and needed to be quashed as it was not maintainable. He said Sushant died on June 14 and Ms. Chakraborty had left his home on June 8. Mr. Singh said there was a news article that said Ms. Priyanka Singh along with a doctor prescribed some medicines to Sushant and then she was booked for abetment to suicide and under provisions of the Narcotics Drugs Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The petition said, “No criminality can be attributed to the petitioners when the cause of action is attributed to the doctor. The FIR has been registered based on a complaint which is wrought with material irregularities and discrepancies. The FIR has been registered after an inordinate delay of 90 days without explanation.” When advocate Satish Maneshinde, representing Ms. Chakraborty, sought some time as he was before another Bench, the court said, “There is no urgency. We don’t want to interfere at this stage.” Since there was no one to represent the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Bench directed Mr. Singh to serve the agency a notice, and adjourned the matter for October 13.

07 October 2020||Mumbai,||Sushant case: Mumbai Police to take action against fake social media accounts||Claiming they have been vindicated by the AIIMS report on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, which termed it suicide, the Maharashtra government and the Mumbai police have said they will take action against fake social media accounts that trolled and defamed the Mumbai police in this case. Maharashtra Home Minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Anil Deshmukh too demanded an apology from the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for defaming and insulting the State and its police. He asked former CM Devendra Fadnavis, party in-charge for Bihar election, whether he will campaign for Bihar’s former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, who defamed Maharashtra in the case. “Several social media account holders are trolling the Mumbai Police Commissioner on different platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook and are using abusive language against him and the force. Hence, an FIR has been registered against those account holders under Section 67 of the IT Act. Most of these accounts are fake and we will be taking action against all those fake account holders,” said Rashmi Karandikar, DCP, Cyber Crime, Mumbai police. “Another FIR has been registered against culprits who used a morphed image of the official Twitter account of the Mumbai Police Commissioner. We have started the probe in both matters,” said Ms. Karandikar. The Mumbai Commissioner of Police too had pointed to fake social media accounts being used to run propaganda against the force. According to sources, over 80,000 such accounts have been identified from foreign countries for promoting conspiracy and targeting the State government, especially the Mumbai police. Mr. Deshmukh, addressing a press conference on Wednesday, slammed the BJP for running anti-Maharashtra propaganda under the guise of seeking justice for Rajput. Citing a report from the University of Michigan, which analysed the Twitter trends and social media posts in the case, he said the report pinpointed the BJP and certain news channels for running a propaganda campaign against the State and the Mumbai police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sushant-case-mumbai-police-to-take-action-against-fake-social-media-accounts/article32787703.ece

07 October 2020||Pune,||Maharashtra to decide on reopening schools only after assessing situation||While the Union Education Ministry has issued guidelines to States on the reopening of schools and colleges from October 15, Maharashtra Minister of Higher and Technical Education Uday Samant on Tuesday said that in the current pandemic situation in the State it was not conducive to do so. The Minister hinted that Maharashtra would be reopening schools and colleges only after assessing the COVID-19 situation. “The decision to open up colleges will have to be based on the current spread of COVID-19 in the State… Maharashtra’s pandemic situation has not yet normalised. Hence, it will not be appropriate to physically conduct classes,” Mr. Samant said after a review meeting of preparations for final year exams with the authorities of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). He said that he had directed educational institutions to stop the collection of development fees from students as there had been no physical classes for the last few months. Stating that the final year examinations would be conducted while taking due care of the health of the students, Mr. Samant said that two-and-a-half lakh students would be appearing for the final year examinations under the SPPU. “Of them, two lakh students will be taking the exams online. The rest 50,000 students will be writing the exams offline,” Mr. Samant said, adding that all provisions had been made to ensure that students do not encounter any technical problems while taking their exams and that no student would be deprived of the exams. The disabled students will be get 20 extra minutes to complete their papers. “For those appearing physically at the 113 exam centres, zilla parishad and Pune civic body authorities must ensure that the facilities are properly sanitised,” he said. Mr. Samant further said that practice question papers would be given from October 8 while a grievance redressal centre would be set up to deal with any problem students might encounter. However, a number of students across the State, especially in rural areas, are apprehensive about their online exams with several complaining about technical glitches, hall tickets, and power failure among others. “About 60% of the students appearing for the final year examinations are from the rural areas. They face a range of problems from erratic electricity supply to poor range for mobile phones. Already, students appearing for Mumbai University’s final year exams have been bedevilled with poor internet connectivity and power outages with server failure and phones hanging in the middle of their examinations,” student leader Kuldeep Ambekar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-to-decide-on-reopening-schools-only-after-assessing-situation/article32787701.ece
07 October 2020||Washington,||Trump returns to White House from hospital, plays down virus||Just three nights after he was hospitalised for COVID-19, U.S. President Donald Trump, who likely is still contagious with COVID-19, left the hospital and returned to the White House. As the national death toll from the virus reached 210,000, Mr. Trump told Americans not to be “afraid” of the virus and let it “dominate” their lives. Mr. Trump, who was restless – as to a normal life through most of his stay at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, released vidoes, took a ride in his limousine and sent out a tweet storm of campaign style messages before he was discharged on Monday evening. Just before he left the hospital, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that he would be back on the campaign trail soon. The President’s treatment includes a drug that can cause temporary boosts in energy levels — the steroid dexamethasone, in addition to remdesivir and a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies. Mr. Trump — who was given special access to this experimental antibody cocktail — told other Americans, many of whom are told to recover at home if they have the disease, that they should not be scared of the disease: messaging that was criticised widely. ‘Great drugs’ “I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 pm. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!” Mr. Trump tweeted on Monday. “…Many people of privilege have options in deciding how much they worry about COVID. But the vast majority of worse-off people does not have this luxury. COVID-related unemployment, illness and death are much higher among worse-off people, and especially minorities,” Harald Schmidt, a professor of health policy and medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, told The Hindu . “Belittling peoples’ justified worries, or encouraging them to let their guard down is the last thing we need right now,” Mr. Schmidt said, citing the COVID-19 death toll. Alighting from the presidential chopper, Marine One, after his 10-minute flight back home, the President took off his mask as he posed for photos between American flags on the balcony of the White House, which has itself become a hotspot for the virus. “The scientific evidence is clear, masks save lives. The President certainly has a sense for effective photo-ops, but the signal is exactly the wrong one,” Mr. Schmidt said. In addition to First Lady Melania Trump and a number of others in Mr. Trump’s circle, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced on Monday that she had tested positive for the coronavirus. Two of her aides have also been infected, as per CNN. Three journalists of the White House Press Corps had also been infected. A number of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, including the First Lady Melania Trump, have tested positive since last week. Later on Monday evening, Mr. Trump released a video that reiterated his message about not letting the virus dominate life. “I stood out front, I led,” Mr. Trump said about his experience of the past few days. “Nobody that’s a leader would not do what I did. I know there’s a risk, there’s a danger, but that’s okay,” he said. On Sunday, while still hospitalised and infectious, Mr Trump — wearing what appeared to be a cloth mask- took a short ride in the presidential limousine with secret service agents in the vehicle and the windows up. The President was criticised by doctors as well as former secret service agents for needlessly exposing agents to the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-returns-to-white-house-from-hospital-plays-down-virus/article32787356.ece
07 October 2020||Stepanakert,||Pressure builds for ceasefire as Karabakh fighting rages||Battles raged between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region on Tuesday, with both sides vowing to pursue the conflict despite increasing international pressure for a ceasefire. Western powers are urging Turkey, a long-standing ally of Azerbaijan, to use its influence with Baku to restore calm after 10 straight days of clashes that have claimed more than 260 lives. Russia, the United States and France on Monday called for an “unconditional” halt to the fighting. The battles began on September 28 in a long-simmering territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave that broke away from Azerbaijan in the 1990s. However, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu downplayed the need for a ceasefire and called for the world to back Azerbaijan in the conflict. “To put these two countries on equal footing means rewarding the occupier,” the Minister, who is on a visit to Baku, said. “The world must be on the side of those who are right, namely on the side of Azerbaijan.” Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov told mediapersons after a meeting with Mr. Cavusoglu that there was no hope of a ceasefire until Armenian troops withdraw from Karabakh. “Armenian armed forces must leave Azerbaijan’s occupied territories,” he said. “We will be fighting until the end.” Neither side has shown any inclination to slow hostilities despite a mounting civilian death toll. Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry and Karabakh’s Foreign Ministry both said fighting was continuing on several fronts on Tuesday The conflict has expanded in the past few days with shelling on big cities, including the regional capital Stepanakert and Azerbaijan’s second-largest city, Ganja. Armenian Health Minister Arsen Torosyan told reporters near the border that he had seen a rocket landing very close to Stepanakert’s main hospital. “I’m not ruling out they are deliberately targeting medical facilities, which is a war crime,” he said. Christian-majority Armenia is in a military alliance of former Soviet states led by Russia, which has a permanent base in the country but has not shown any appetite for a military escalation of the conflict. Turkey is a loyal ally of Azerbaijan, a fellow Muslim and Turkic country, and has been accused of dispatching mercenaries from Syria and Libya. Moscow and leaders in several Western capitals have condemned the deployment of foreign fighters and instead urged Turkey’s leadership to work towards a political settlement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pressure-builds-for-ceasefire-as-karabakh-fighting-rages/article32787352.ece
07 October 2020||Seoul,||Kim orders 80-day ‘battle’ to boost economy||North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered a nationwide drive to boost the ailing economy ahead of a key party congress in January, state media reported on Tuesday. The decision was made during a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party and comes as the coronavirus pandemic and recent floods have added yet more pressure on the isolated country's flagging economy. Mandatory mass mobilisation drives, featuring extra-long work hours and additional duties, are commonplace in North Korea in the lead-up to major events. Measure of loyalty The efforts have usually been dubbed “Battles” — the North often embraces militaristic terminology and notions of struggle — but while the official KCNA news agency described it as such in Korean, in its English version it used the more diplomatic term “campaign”. “We have performed historical feats with our costly efforts, boldly overcoming unprecedentedly grave trials and difficulties this year, but we should not rest on our laurels,” it said. “We still face the challenges that cannot be overlooked and there are many goals we have to attain within this year.” Participation in the exhausting “battles” is rigorously monitored and used as a measure of loyalty to the regime, with past campaigns denounced by rights groups as exercises in forced labour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kim-orders-80-day-battle-to-boost-economy/article32787350.ece
07 October 2020||Male,||Ahmed Adeeb jailed 20 years for corruption||Maldives former Vice-President Ahmed Adeeb has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to graft, money laundering and abuse of power, court officials said on Tuesday. Adeeb was a close ally of ex-President Abdulla Yameen until Adeeb was jailed for allegedly trying to assassinate the strongman former ruler with a bomb on board his yacht in 2015. The Criminal Court in an overnight decision also imposed a fine of two million rufiyaa ($129,000) for Adeeb’s role in siphoning money from the state tourism promoter during the former administration. He was accused of causing a loss of about $260 million to the state in leasing islets for resort development and receiving kickbacks from tourism companies. Adeeb’s then boss, Yameen, is already serving a five-year prison sentence for money laundering during his tenure between 2013 and 2018. “Adeeb cooperated with the state in the investigation and entered a plea deal,” a court official said adding that the 20-year sentence was a “light punishment” for the crimes he admitted to. In July, Adeeb had been cleared of the charges by the Criminal Court, but prosecutors appealed to the High Court which ordered a fresh trial. Adeeb was initially Tourism Minister and promoted to Vice-President by Yameen, but the two later fell out. He was jailed for 15 years after being accused of trying to assassinate Yameen following a September 2015 explosion aboard the presidential yacht. However, Adeeb was cleared of the attempted assassination charge after Yameen’s defeat at the 2018 re-election bid. Adeeb left the country illegally in August last year but was arrested in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ahmed-adeeb-jailed-20-years-for-corruption/article32787346.ece
07 October 2020||Kabul,||As peace talks continue, Afghans fear return of Taliban||Almost two decades after the United States launched air strikes against Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban regime and started what would become America’s longest-ever war, the hardline group is in a stronger position than ever. The invasion that followed those October 7, 2001 strikes quickly toppled the militants, who had harboured the Al-Qaeda, the group behind the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in America just weeks earlier. Now, 19 years since the collapse of their brutal Islamist regime, the Taliban is pushing for a return to power, having signed a landmark troop withdrawal deal with Washington in February and currently holding peace talks with the Afghan government. Fearful that the Taliban has changed little since the darkest days of its regime — when it killed women accused of adultery, attacked minority religious groups and barred girls from going to school — many Afghans worry about a new era of Taliban influence. “I remember the Taliban regime like a nightmare. We are scared for our future and my daughter’s future,” said Kabul resident Katayoun Ahmadi, a 26-year-old mother. She recalled seeing severed hands and fingers on Kabul’s streets following amputations for petty crimes under the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Sharia law. Enduring improvements The 2001 invasion heralded some enduring improvements for young Afghans — particularly girls — and ushered in a Constitution guaranteeing certain freedoms, including the right to education. But so far in peace talks in Doha, which started last month, the Taliban has said little about issues such as women’s rights or freedom of expression. Ms. Ahmadi’s husband Farzad Farnood, 35, a researcher for the Afghanistan Institute for Strategic Studies, said a rise in Taliban violence since a deal was signed between the hardline group and Washington shows the militants have not changed. “Is this creating hope for Afghans? No, it is not,” he said. As a teenager, he witnessed the Taliban stoning a woman to death and public executions and floggings in Kabul’s football stadium. His family had to hide their black-and-white television’s antenna in a tree when the Taliban banned music and entertainment. “All the achievements we have made in the last 18 years did not exist in the Taliban era.”  Zia-ul-Rahman, a former insurgent, said the Taliban was pushing for “the establishment of an Islamic system”, even though the Constitution already gives primacy to the religion. “We have no problem with girls getting an education or women working, but they have to wear a hijab,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/as-peace-talks-continue-afghans-fear-return-of-taliban/article32787348.ece

The ex-Soviet nation’s Central Electoral Commission said in a statement that it had “invalidated the election results” which saw parties close to pro-Russian President Sooronbay Jeenbekov score big wins amid accusations of mass vote-buying campaigns. The results sparked a tumultuous night of protests and clashes in the capital Bishkek, with protesters seizing government buildings and freeing high-profile politicians, including ex-President Almazbek Atambayev. The clashes left dozens injured.  Opposition politicians said they had formed a “coordination council” to restore stability and “return to the rule of law”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kyrgyzstan-cancels-poll-result-after-night-of-chaos/article32787344.ece

The shooting took place in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Monday, a day after the two professors allegedly had a heated discussion over a religious matter, the police said. The assailant, Professor Farooq Maad, remains at large. He and his accomplice, opened fire on the car of Professor Naeem Khattak as he was driving to work. The arrested man, identified as Mubashar, was being questioned, the police said. Ahmadis make a tiny minority of the 220 million Muslim-majority Pakistan.

07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||The disintegration of the criminal justice system||A well-established textbook on the principles of criminal law in the United Kingdom painstakingly establishes various theoretical bases for justifying what should be a crime — that it should involve some harm, must carry a certain degree of seriousness, and so on. But then, revealingly, it undoes this edifice in a single section by telling us that at the end of the day, criminal law and crimes are whatever the state says it is. In India, this political nexus is arguably more pronounced: A majority government makes the laws and controls the investigative machinery, which means that not only does it define what a crime is but it can also selectively pursue only those crimes which it cares about and forget about the rest. In disarray across India Pursue those crimes to what end, you ask. Ultimately, the idea of “crime” is hollow without the accompanying punishment. The loss of liberty upon imprisonment we are all taught to dread. However, it is often forgotten that this punishment can only arise upon a judgment of conviction at the end of a trial. There is, then, a synergy between the crime, its pursuit by an investigation, and the calling to account of those found guilty, which is colloquially referred to as a criminal justice system. And wherever one looks across India, it is in a shambles. The morbid happenings in the State of Uttar Pradesh are but one stark example of just how bad things can get. A notorious gangster was involved in a gunfight with police, fled, and was later captured from another State. In the meanwhile, the news was awash with stories alleging corrupt links of the accused to public servants. As his entourage made its way back to Uttar Pradesh, there was an “encounter” and the accused was shot dead. There was a crime, several crimes in fact. The State police decided to pursue it. However, there was no waiting for a trial to condemn the accused and sentence him; punishment was swiftly meted out by the police itself. So much so, that an erstwhile Supreme Court Judge felt that the State’s version of events made it appear as if it did not even care whether the encounter story was believed or not. Extremes in Uttar Pradesh If the Vikas Dubey encounter death demonstrated a willingness to punish without condemning an accused through trial, Uttar Pradesh has also demonstrated a willingness to condemn without any trial. It passed a law enabling the publishing of massive hoardings with the names and personal details of persons allegedly involved in the destruction of property caused in riots following the anti-Citizenship Act protests. But, here is the thing: all of this is before a court convicted them for these acts. Rather, the power to condemn was sourced not from a judicial order, but from the power to level allegations, which is wholly executive in scope. In this fashion, the police became judge, jury, and executioner. Of course, these instances are where the State decided to pursue alleged crime. There are many cases where it turns a blind eye to incidents of violence, either indefinitely or for long enough. A young girl was brutally assaulted and left to die when she was found by her family on September 14 in the village of Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. The same family did what anyone would do — report the incident to the police while they rushed their daughter to a hospital. Only, here, despite the injuries being evident, the police did not register a case for hours, and even then did not include the serious offence of rape. Of course, where the police was not willing to register this single case of rape, it has swiftly registered at least 19 cases regarding an alleged conspiracy to use the incident for political purposes to show the State in a bad light. Govt.-judiciary disconnect There are clear, discernible tendencies which these examples from the State of Uttar Pradesh only serve to demonstrate. These are, first, the growing disconnect between the government and judiciary in matters of criminal justice; second, the bolstering of executive power as a result of this growing disconnect, and third, the unsurprising imitation of executive-mindedness by the judiciary. The result of this, I argue, is a transformation from a criminal justice system, to a problem-solving system. The Crime in India data for 2019 (https://bit.ly/34pB7VK) confirm a trend that has been on display for decades now: our police are seemingly super-efficient, but our courts are super-slow. Let us continue with Uttar Pradesh as an example. Its police have a pendency rate for cases at just above 15%, but the courts have pendency rates just above 90% (for IPC crimes). And, worryingly, these are not the worst figures. What this means is that as police forces keep adding to the docket every year, the courts are becoming ever slower in their ability to conduct trials and pass judgments. This exacerbates the natural time-gap between the incident and any potential punishment, and reduces the importance of courts in the criminal justice system. Among other things, this disconnect also reduces whatever value condemnation through trial might have had, as people move on and so does life in almost all cases. Just how severely this tendency is magnified in an era defined by the 24-hour news cycle is anyone’s guess. How does a system fill this gap between incident and eventual judgment? By slowly legitimising the idea of punishments without condemnation or any kind of being called into account. All that matters, is solving the problem, and moving on. This system where judges lose sway is where the executive gains more power. It is the arrest, and not a conviction, which becomes the seminal moment in the criminal process. Victims do not even think as far as proving anything in court, at times, and all that matters is arrest and an indefinite incarceration, or even an encounter if the allegation is heinous enough. At the same time, the executive tries to legally bolster powers of pre-trial arrest and custody, while also arrogating to itself more powers to punish without condemnation — asset forfeiture being a key power. Presumption of innocence The transformation stands complete, when judges try to regain some of their lost footing by trying to imitate the now popular branch. Courts become happy to look at facts, in detail, at the stage of bail itself. What is more, courts also become willing to help arrive at settlements through this stage by using incarceration as a bargaining tool to force errant accused persons to make reparations. In doing so, courts actively replace facts established through cross-examination of a witness with her untested allegations that the police decided to pursue, because even courts no longer have the time for the process either. The presumption of innocence be damned, so long as the problem is solved and a victim can go home satisfied. Amidst this pandemic and the spiralling chaos that it has brought, there has been a comforting background score that has steadily played on. This is the systematic disintegration of any criminal justice system worth its name across India, and its gradual replacement with a problem-solving system where initial accusations and their handling by the executive branch becomes most critical and values such as the presumption of innocence and establishing truth through trials have long ceased to exist. That certain States are at the vanguard of this progression could, perhaps, cynically be seen as yet another symptom of their development which makes many others envious.

07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Approaching the misinformation storm||Echo chambers have been a defining character of smaller towns for a number of years. When I first went to the U.S. for postgraduate study, I chose a small town in New York state. The university was considered one of the best business schools in the world. The fact that the long since diminished Bausch & Lomb, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox were headquartered in the town meant the university was well-funded. It attracted star faculty despite the town’s small size and reputation for long, cold winters. When I arrived there, however, I was horrified by the paucity of news. The local Democrat & Chronicle (derisively called the ‘Demagogue and Comical’) only covered news from the local county. There was no U.S. news to speak of, let alone global news. Having grown up on a diet of broadly focused Indian newspapers, this was anathema to me. My indulgent father gifted me a subscription to the international edition of The Hindu , which was printed weekly and took at least a further week to arrive by post. It was only six pages in a small pamphlet format that could be folded and stuffed into a regular envelope to save on postage costs. Nonetheless, it gave me a much-needed view of international, Indian, and even U.S. news. Biased ‘news’ In the 1980s, the penultimate decade of U.S. newspaper ascendancy, hundreds of news organisations existed to serve these sorts of towns, much like they still do in multilingual India today. The Internet put paid to all that. One would have thought that democratic access to a large variety of news from all corners of the globe would have opened up the echo chambers in towns and rural areas, but the hard fact is that the Internet has pulled the other way. There are far fewer news outlets now than there were some years ago. The travesty is that many of these organisations are not news outlets; they are social networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter. These have no journalistic norms. Anyone can say anything at any time about any topic with scant respect for the truth. Everything is an opinion, but not clearly labelled as such. As a result, much of the ‘news’ available on these platforms is biased. The unscrupulous sale of personal information and meddling by inimical foreign regimes can potentially even influence the outcome of an election. Worse, the spread of false and malicious news can stoke violence at short notice. We have already seen this in India, when WhatsApp came under Indian regulatory scrutiny after a doctored video that originated as an innocent advertisement in Pakistan spread on that medium and stoked violence.  A stark warning The ascendance of Jio and the response from its competition means that anywhere between 500 million and 700 million people are now newly online, almost all from towns and rural areas. The U.S.’s experience with the Internet should serve as a stark warning to India. Most Americans now get their news from dubious Internet sources. The hardening of political stances on both sides of the divide is plain to see, and the acute polarisation of the average American’s viewpoint is painful to watch. For India, the danger is that like the U.S., such extreme polarisation can happen in a few short years. Also, the echo chamber has been greatly enhanced by the highly targeted algorithms that these companies use. The algorithms were built around making users stay online longer and click through to advertisements. They are likely to bombard users with information that serves to reinforce what the algorithm thinks the searcher needs to know. For instance, if I search for a particular type of phone on an e-commerce site even once, future searches are likely to autocomplete that search by showing that phone when I next open the app. It is the same with news. If I show a preference for right-wing leaning posts, for instance, the algorithms are likely to provide me with ever more right-wing posts from people and organisations. As they familiarise themselves with the Internet, newly online Indians are bound to fall prey to the echo chamber algorithms that social network firms use, as well as other algorithms that ensure that they spend inordinate amounts of time within the bubble of one social network, therefore becoming easy marks for targeted advertising — both for products and of political viewpoints. Much can be said about how we should approach the impending Internet misinformation storm. I shall attempt to make a beginning here. Things to do First, we know that tech firms are already under fire from all quarters. Just as they are struggling to meet calls to contain the online spread of misinformation and hate speech online, they are being accused of suppressing both left-wing and right-wing views. There is no pleasing anyone on this issue. Nonetheless, we need to act. Second, unlike the U.S., which has now become unlikely to directly regulate such firms, India might need to chart its own path by keeping them under check before they proliferate. In the U.S., these issues were not sufficiently legislated for and have existed for over a decade. Existing legislation has been tested by the American court system which has held that companies like Google and Facebook clearly engage in both free speech and press activities when they display content created by third-parties. Free speech is inherent in the Constitution of many other democracies, including India’s. This means that new Indian legislation needs to preserve free speech while still applying pressure to make sure that Internet content is filtered for accuracy, and sometimes, plain decency. Let us remember that our courts do not legislate; they ensure adherence to existing legislation. The third issue is corporate responsibility. Facebook, for instance, has started to address this matter by publishing ‘transparency reports’ and setting up an ‘oversight board’ to act as a sort of Supreme Court for Facebook’s internal matters. However, for all these companies’ efforts at transparency, we cannot ignore the fact that these numbers reflect judgements that are made behind closed doors. What should be regulatory attempts to influence the transparency of information that members of the public see are instead being converted into secret corporate processes. We have no way of knowing the extent of biases that may be inherent inside each firm. The fact that their main algorithms target advertising and hyper-personalisation of content makes them further suspect as arbiters of balanced news. This means that those who use social media platforms must pull in another direction to maintain access to a range of sources and views. Whether this will be possible as the hinterland of India comes online is doubtful. We need strong intervention now. Else, in addition to the media, which has largely been the responsible fourth estate, we may well witness the creation of an unmanageable fifth estate in the form of Big Tech.

Which country’s President said he is safe because everyone who meets him at work or attends a political rally is pre-screened by virus testing? Again, the United States. Unfortunately, U.S. President Donald Trump has now been infected by the novel coronavirus despite all that testing. While wishing him a speedy recovery, we must wonder why that formidable cordon of testing did not prevent the virus from sneaking through. Also, why is the U.S. the global leader in COVID-19 deaths while testing at such high rates? The answers are relevant to other countries. The ‘test’ strategy Despite the belief that tests are the key to control of the pandemic (“Test! Test! Test!”), they are not infallible. They have inaccuracies arising from false negative and false positive results. False negatives mean that tests do not always detect the virus when present. This may be because the virus could not be picked by the swab early or late in the infection or that a defective sampling technique could not grab the virus. ‘Sensitivity’ is the ability of the test to detect the virus in persons who are truly infected. This is usually assessed in hospital cases where the diagnosis is highly probable on clinical criteria, as compared to persons who are judged to be virus free. However, such ‘technical sensitivity’ is often higher than the ‘clinical sensitivity’ observed in field conditions, as pointed out in a recent paper by McAdam and Pettengill (“Can We Test Our Way Out of the COVID -19 Pandemic?”). Molecular tests such as real time RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) have a real world sensitivity between 60-70%. The Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT), when tested against RT-PCR as the gold standard, have a sensitivity ranging from 50-90%, according to different estimates. So, if RT-PCR has a sensitivity of 70% and RAT has a sensitivity of 70% compared to it, we run the risk of missing half the infected persons with RAT. The other tests While some manufacturers have claimed higher technical sensitivity with recent improvements, the rapid tests have been widely criticised for low sensitivity in field conditions. Yet, these are the tests that were used for screening officials, visitors and rally attendees who might pose a viral threat to the U.S. President. Widespread use of tests for detection and isolation of infected cases, followed by tracing their contacts for testing and quarantine, with treatment of diagnosed cases, was promoted as the ‘Test-Trace-Treat’ formula by global and national health agencies. While this is conventional wisdom in infectious disease epidemics, the COVID-19 virus proved too tricky for this standard tackle. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic persons emerged as persons harbouring and discharging the virus. How many symptomless persons can we test in a large population, and how often? Even for guiding treatment decisions, the only drug that has emerged so far with life-saving potential in seriously-ill hospitalised patients is dexamethasone. Steroids are not specific to COVID-19 and their use is dictated mainly by clinical state and not the test result. Have we set too much in store by the testing rates in the population? When neighbouring countries are compared in any geographic zone, with similar socio-demographic and environmental conditions, there is absolutely no correlation between tests per million and deaths per million. Why is the death rate in Canada much lower than in the U.S. which has tested at a much higher rate? Across the world, the scatter is even wider. In contrast to the emphasis on testing rates, the U.S. did not fare well in contact tracing. It failed to mandate masks and faltered in persuading people to wear them, sending mixed political messages and conflicting technical advisories on their use. Mask use Some of the delay resulted from global health agencies taking time to unequivocally recommend the universal use of masks, despite the experiential wisdom of East and South East Asian countries in using masks to combat earlier respiratory virus epidemics. Would the world have been in a better place today if the World Health Organization’s call in March was “Mask! Mask! Mask!’? Perhaps, the clarion call for testing reflected the understanding at that time. We are better informed now. Yet, many in the U.S. remain impervious to evidence and advice on masks. The U.S. also paid little heed to social distancing. The fractious political environment bred contempt for public health advice and positioned opposition to masks and physical distancing as a libertarian assertion of personal freedom. The fact that ‘Super Spreader’ events promote rapid dissemination of infection from a few infected persons to many others is well known from past epidemics of respiratory viruses. This is akin to the Pareto principle, propounded by the Italian-Swiss economist Vilfredo Pareto that roughly 80% of the effects in many events come from 20% of the causes. We now know that 5-20% of the infected persons are responsible for spreading the virus to 80% of others who are infected. Since this happens mostly in crowded ‘Super Spreader’ events (where people congregate or travel together), testing is either not always possible or does not pick up the virus in asymptomatic persons. Yet, indoor crowding can form virus clouds from such persons in confined spaces, endangering many others. Here too, universal masking offers the best protection. If only we could roll the clock back and recommend universal masking in January or February 2020. If only the President of the United States had regularly worn a mask and told others to do so too.

07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||A wake-up call for the Republic||No social contract can eliminate crime in society. History has shown constant hostility between criminals who disturb the social order and those who endeavour to maintain it. Laws dealing with crimes and criminals emanate from power structures, in one form or another, charged with the responsibility of maintaining the social order which allows individuals to go about their everyday lives in the belief that they enjoy the protective cover of those wielding authority. No modern society should tolerate individual rights to be trampled upon and individual liberties to be sacrificed by the state and its machinery collaborating with or aiding those charged with offences that disturb societal peace and tranquility. Of late, our Republic has witnessed crimes, the sheer barbarity of which has shocked our collective conscience. Perpetrators of such heinous crimes have been emboldened by the manner in which the state investigating machinery has been dealing with them in the recent past. The colours of violence Since 2014, caste-based criminal targeting has increased exponentially. Dalits are often victims of upper-caste brutality. The iniquitous caste structure accompanied by unforgiving mindsets allows such crimes to be committed with impunity. The perpetrators believe that the state machinery will come to their aid because of caste affiliations embedded in the power structure. This explains the public lynching of Dalits and the forgotten episodes of their victimisation including sexual assault, with perpetrators going unpunished. Caste and poverty go hand in hand. Those at the bottom of the caste structure are also immersed in poverty. They lack the wherewithal to get justice. Then there are crimes based on religious predilections. Minorities within a majoritarian state need the protective measure of the state because the prevalent majoritarian culture seeks dominance which often expresses itself in violent retributions. Innocent victims are attacked for not following majoritarian diktats. They are targeted for what they wear and for their physical attributes. They are publicly shamed and made to pay for the perceived sins of their ancestors. The perpetrator is perceived to represent majoritarian nationalist sentiment. The third aspect is the foisting of an ideology on those who either don’t subscribe to it or are openly opposed to it. Here, the politics of violence takes over. The political class, in suppressing the voice of dissent, seeks to use violence as a weapon to instil fear so that the message of conformity percolates downstream to quell all forms of opposition. The Indian state, therefore, has to confront violence which has cultural, religious and political colour. State of the legal system For the rule of law to prevail, the legal system must equip itself to meet the expectations of the law. It must investigate fairly, remain unbiased, and punish the guilty. But the legal system seems to have distanced itself from the law by doing the bidding of dominant affiliations. Recent tragedies fuel doubts about the nature of the state and the role of investigating agencies. How then does one explain a crime recognised by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court to have been committed in public gaze culminating in the court unable to identify both the conspiracy and the conspirators? How does one explain the conduct of an investigating agency which cremates a 19-year-old victim in secrecy at 2:30 in the morning without informing the family? How do we come to terms with the opinion of that agency that the victim was not raped despite the family referring to the condition of the girl and later her dying declaration alleging gang-rape? The cases relating to lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq and the rape victim in Kathua along with the politics of dominance surrounding such crimes show the state machinery as biased and unforgiving not qua the perpetrators but qua the victims. Any investigating agency has the ability to botch an investigation: manipulate records, fail to record statements of key witnesses, wilfully choose not to collect evidence crucial to the case, and ensure that witnesses incriminating the accused are not produced in court. The court finds itself helpless and occasionally chooses not to help itself and the law. When the nexus among the state, investigating agencies and the accused becomes the norm, the victim is the rule of law. It is a wake-up call for the Republic. Some of our spineless institutions with their open biases have led to this abysmal state of affairs. The only institution that can withstand such aberrations that make the citizen lose faith in the functioning of the state is the court. Our future will depend on the court’s courage to call a spade a spade.

07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||A champion on and off court||In tennis, it is rare to see an athlete truly grow up. This ‘growing up’ is not what it often means in sport: usually, the ability of a player to be disciplined, or not throw a tantrum when things don’t go right. This is more about finding their own self, a distinct voice; navigating a relentlessly demanding sport they have been trying to perfect since childhood. It may be easy if you are a veteran: all those years of weathering the endless rigmarole of touring, raking up ranking points and navigating sponsors comes with its own lessons. But how does someone young and introverted — almost to the point of being melancholic — like Naomi Osaka manage to find herself standing, barely three years after bursting onto the scene? Osaka, 22, has often been described as ‘shy’, ‘innocent’ or ‘awkward’. Two years ago, she would tip-toe into press conferences and counter tough questions with self-deprecating humour. But when summer arrived this year, one saw in a world plagued by despair, a girl of promise become an icon of hope. Amplifying voices Osaka, who is the highest paid female athlete according toForbes, was among the first to register her support for the Black Lives Matter movement. She flew to Minneapolis and attended protests surrounding the death of George Floyd. This was a transformed Osaka, someone whose life pivoted around the practice court. Floyd’s death at the hands of a white policeman had outraged much of the U.S., and when Osaka chose to stand among those who felt anguished, she was making a clear statement. On social media, she amplified messages about organisations working for the Black Lives Matter movement and urged her fans to understand what it means to be a person of colour in America. She was, of course, met with the usual lamentations: why was an athlete commenting on issues that do not concern her sport? But Osaka remained unfazed. She became accutely aware of her reach and used the platform to facilitate change. In doing so, she made the sport relevant to issues plaguing the world today. In what was perhaps the most defining moment in her role as a leader for social advocacy, Osaka announced that she would not be playing her semi-final match at the Western & Southern Open to protest against the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a young Black man, in Wisconsin. It was discernible then that playing good tennis was only going to be a subset of what Osaka stood for. As a result of her decision, the tournament itself paused play for one day. In 2020, Osaka has redefined what it means to be a tennis player. It is not just about enthralling fans with deft shotmaking, filling up stadium seats and raking up TV views. It is also about making the sport a sanctuary where an athlete can achieve everlasting change. Masks and the message She brought seven masks into the U.S. Open with her, each emblazoned with the name of a Black person who was a victim of racially charged, law-enforcement confrontations. But wearing seven masks required playing seven matches, from the opening round to the final. Osaka did just that and more. Standing inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, named after a Black player who spent much of his life fighting prejudice, she won her third Grand Slam title, showing those who doubted her that it was possible to be a champion on and off court. At the trophy ceremony, she was asked again about what message she wanted to send. The new Osaka, now brave and assertive, responded without missing a beat: “Well, what was the message you got, is more the question.” A few hours and several thousand miles away, a Japanese TV show introduced the story behind each person on her masks. Osaka’s message had gone global. preethi.r@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-champion-on-and-off-court/article32787337.ece
07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Vanquishing viruses||At a time when the world is faced with multiple assaults from a frighteningly obscure virus, it cannot be mere coincidence that the Nobel Committee decided to anoint three scientists who peeled the layers off another virus that confounded generations of physicians — the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, to Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice, is a stout endorsement of years of work that went towards identifying one of the world’s greatest scourges. But to see it shorn of the context it is couched in would be to miss the larger point or purpose it could serve. Choosing researchers who went after a pathogen, and succeeded in unwrapping the whole puzzle at a time when others are fighting fatigue in a daily battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is also a hat tip to the virologists and geneticists burning the midnight oil, for over nine months now. The accolades went to the three for identifying the viral origin of Hepatitis C. Their work, the Nobel statement said, characterised this form of hepatitis to be a distinct clinical entity, caused by an RNA virus of the Flavivirus family, now known as HCV. In fact, it was for the discovery of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), and the development of the first-generation HBV vaccine, that Baruch Blumberg, whom the young Alter collaborated with, was awarded the 1976 Medicine Nobel. However, even the isolation of the HBV only partially eliminated the risk of contracting this severe liver disease transmitted through blood. The circle was only complete with the discovery of HCV. According to the WHO Global Hepatitis report, HBV and HCV are major causes for mortality and morbidity, with 1.34 million deaths reported in 2015, a 63% increase from 1990, mainly due to HCV. The number of deaths is also comparable to that caused by TB and higher than that caused by AIDS. The discoveries (of HBV and HCV), and the development of effective screening routines, have virtually eliminated the risk of transmission via blood products in much of the world. Also, with the development of effective drugs against HCV, it is possible that the threat of this viral infection will reduce, and hopefully, be eliminated soon. That is what makes this year’s Laureates’ achievement so tremendous. The Nobel Committee called it “among the most impactful scientific accomplishments of the 20th century”. In true lineage of other Nobel Prizes for Medicine, their identification represents “milestone achievements that have revolutionised medicine and substantially improved human health”. The triumph of humanity, over the pathogens that debilitate and kill men and women is certainly a singular achievement that is worth celebrating, and showcasing this achievement will send a deeply inspiring message at a time when another virus is holding the world to ransom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/vanquishing-viruses/article32787323.ece
07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Grapes of wrath||The registration of multiple police cases in Uttar Pradesh on charges of conspiracy and sedition is an insensitive, albeit unsurprising, response to the legitimate outrage sparked by the way in which its officials had handled the aftermath of the gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl in Hathras. The State administration is seeking to convert the outcry and political advocacy into a putative conspiracy to foment caste discord. There seems to be inadequate recognition that initial attempts to deny that any rape took place and to prevent political leaders and the media from meeting the girl’s family pointed to an administrative posture hostile to the doing of complete justice. It was only to be expected that such an attitude would create a backlash against the State government. The only way to restore its image is to display empathy for the victim and treat protests seeking justice as legitimate. Even though the suspects named by the 19-year-old before her death in a Delhi hospital have been arrested and the FIR includes the charge of gang rape, there are clear signs that the Yogi Adityanath government is adopting dubious tactics to prevent what it sees as the crystallisation of public opinion against itself. Recognising that the formation of an SIT did not help undo the damage to the government’s image, the Chief Minister recommended a CBI investigation. However, even that came across as a move to fob off any adverse order from the Allahabad High Court, which has taken suo motu cognisance of the matter. Remarks by senior police officers to the effect that there was no evidence of rape — citing the absence of semen in swabs taken for forensic analysis — indicated an official reluctance to acknowledge the gang-rape part of the offence. Latest reports suggest that a journalist on his way to Hathras and three others have been detained. They are also sought to be linked to the Popular Front of India, an organisation whose name came up in connection with recent riots and anti-government protests. This raises the suspicion of an attempt to control the narrative by resorting to a template of identifying members of a communal organisation as alleged conspirators and instigators of violence. The template includes the use of penal provisions relating to sedition and conspiracy and the projection of a theory that all protests and political activity against it constitute a plot to overthrow the government. A responsive government would have endeavoured to extend a healing touch, reassure the victims, and reserve its wrath for the offenders. Instead, the Adityanath government is focusing on blaming political leaders, pressuring the victim’s family and preventing the emergence of a united voice against sexual violence, attacks on the marginalised communities and the devastating effect an unregenerate caste hierarchy has on society.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/grapes-of-wrath/article32787324.ece

The Public Services Commission recommended that “it should no longer be the case that the civil departments should be the adjuncts of the military services.” They also recommended that “Regular Civil Medical Services should be constituted. One should be entrusted with higher duties and should be for the whole of India... The other should be formed separately in each province to carry out the duties of minor importance and should be called the Madras (Bombay, etc.) Civil Medical Services respectively.” They conceded that military medical men should also be considered eligible for such posts up to a definite proportion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/indian-medical-service-from-an-editorial/article32787334.ece

07 October 2020||MUMBAI,||RBI’s reconstituted policy panel to meet Oct. 7-9||The Reserve Bank has scheduled the next meeting of the MPC for October 7-9. This follows the appointment of three new external members to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The meeting, originally scheduled for September 29-October 1, had to be postponed as the term of the previous external members ended on September 30. The government on Monday appointed Ashima Goyal, Jayanth R. Varma and Shashanka Bhide as new external members of the panel. Nomura said in a note that Dr. Goyal and Dr. Varma were from academia and specialised in macroeconomics and the financial sector, respectively, while Dr. Bhide came from a think-tank and had worked on real economy issues, but that his policy views were not yet known. With the fresh nominations, the MPC had developed a more ‘dovish tilt’ it added. “The new external MPC members appear to be more neutral-to-dovish in their policy views. They are likely to be vocal on liquidity, credit market dynamics, and may not shy away from advocating for the RBI to look at unconventional or untested measures. They are likely to look through the current phase of elevated inflation and find space to lower rates further,” Nomura said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbis-reconstituted-policy-panel-to-meet-oct-7-9/article32787309.ece

Banks have been permitted by the Reserve Bank of India to undertake a one-time restructuring exercise of loans affected by the pandemic, which will provide relief in terms of bad loan recognition and provisioning, Fitch said. “However, the exercise could leave the sector saddled with a high bad loan burden over the next few years if restructured loans do not perform according to agreed milestones,” it added.

When leggie Shreyas Gopal struck twice in as many deliveries in the 10th over, and Archer having three overs up his sleeve, Royals would have hoped to restrict MI to a moderate total. However, despite losing captain Rohit Sharma, who was beaten in flight by a leg-spinner again, and Ishan Kishan, who went big off the first ball he faced and paid the price, Suryakumar didn’t waste the rare opportunity to bat till the end. Delicate touch Rohit had looked in the mood for a big innings, with his flicks and delicate touches piercing the gaps during PowerPlay. However, Shreyas — who bowled the second over of the innings — got the better of Rohit in his second spell, getting one to dip on the batsman who offered a regulation catch to long-on. This was the 10th time Rohit was dismissed by a leg-spinner in the IPL since 2017. Initially, Suryakumar chose to play the conventional strokes after joining Rohit in the middle once opener Quinton de Kock had perished to a short delivery by IPL debutant Kartik Tyagi. His trademark inside-out drives off Shreyas were a treat to watch. Once Archer returned at the death, Suryakumar ramped it up though the England pacer consistently bowled in the 150s (kmph). The highlight of Suryakumar’s knock came in the penultimate over when he glided a near-perfect yorker over the third-man fence for a six. What made it more special was that it came right after a short-ball from Archer had thudded into his helmet and left him shaken. Such was Suryakumar’s onslaught that despite Kieron Pollard not walking out to bat as Krunal Pandya was promoted to keep the left-right combination going after Ishan’s dismissal, the Mumbai side scored 75 in the last six overs. While Krunal couldn’t get going, younger brother Hardik was his usual self, smashing the ball to all parts of the ground and taking Mumbai to a formidable total yet again.  Royals 84 for four Royals were 84 for four in 12 overs with Buttler (59) and Tom Curran (6) at the crease. Jaiswal (0), Smith (6), Samson (0) and Lomror (11) were the batsmen out||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/suryakumar-on-song-for-mi/article32787424.ece
07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||No ambivalence here — all is fair in love and T20 cricket||We no longer use the racially offensive term ‘chinaman’ in cricket. Instead we say ‘left-arm wrist-spinner’. Perhaps it is time we found another term for ‘mankading’, the act of a bowler running out a non-striker who backs up too far and thus gains time and space. For long, the act has been considered disreputable. After Vinoo Mankad, the great Indian all-rounder, ran out Australia’s Bill Brown thus, Don Bradman defended him. So did the batsman himself. Sunil Gavaskar has suggested that a batsman dismissed in this perfectly legal manner should be said to be ‘browned’; after all, the onus is on him to ensure he does not gain an unfair advantage. And yet. And yet. Spirit of the game Every season, someone somewhere does a ‘mankad’ or a ‘brown’ (depending on your preference), and old debates are given a fresh airing. What is legal, however, need not necessarily be moral. There is something called the ‘spirit’ of the game — somewhat ambiguous and undefined, but clearly recognisable when one sees it being breached on the field. “Giving houseroom to our ambivalence is part of our human complexity,” writes the sage of the game, Mike Brearley in his new book, Spirit of Cricket. The spirit, he says, is usually spoken of in a patronising tone: “I felt it had been enlisted by snobbery.” When the MCC World Cricket Committee discussed the issue of ‘mankading’, sympathy was almost entirely with the fielding side. All the arguments in support of the bowler are valid, of course. Legally, that is. After all, bowlers, up against flat wickets, powerful bats, and shortened boundaries often struggle, despite the rule-makers’ attempts to right the balance now and then. The batsman does not need extra help. One of the charms of cricket is that it is a game played on parallel lines — within the laws and within the spirit. If everything were written out, every situation anticipated, something of its soul would be lost. Should a batsman walk when he knows he has snicked the ball or wait for the umpire’s call? Should a catch be claimed when a fielder knows the ball has touched the ground? Cricket is a team game with significant individual moments; the overall ethics a team displays might be different from an individual’s personal ethics. The Decision Review System (DRS) has taken some of the individual’s decisions out of his hands, yet players show us who they are and what they stand for in the manner in which they react when faced with a choice between being right and being ethical. Following instructions When R. Ashwin decided not to ‘mankad’ Aaron Finch in the IPL, was he following his coach Ricky Ponting’s advice? Ponting had told the bowler before the start of the tournament to desist. Had the team lost the match thanks to a big score from Finch, how would bowler and coach have reconciled ethics with pragmatism? Last year, when Ashwin ran out Jos Buttler in similar fashion, there was an element of entrapment, and that put off even supporters of the ‘it’s legal, after all’ school. Ashwin paused in his bowling action — the law doesn’t focus just on the batsman backing up, but also on ‘the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball..’ That is sometimes a close call. Brearley admits in his book after discussing many cases: “I had changed my mind. I was no longer inclined to view (‘mankading’) as unethical or against the spirit of cricket.” That pronouncement has as much authority as anything Bradman said. But it is not a stand I find easy to take. Perhaps it is because I have played just enough cricket to be starry-eyed but not enough to be sensible! When I see a bowler ‘mankading’ a batsman, I feel bad. Maybe it’s the snobbery Brearley talks about, a cousin of the kind of condescension that leads to a feeling of superiority. But there is a bridge that can be thrown across the two points of view. It stems from the conviction that T20 is not a shorter form of First Class or Test cricket, but a sport that despite being created from a rib of the longer game, is quite different. Shift in perceptions Approaches are different, techniques are different, ‘success’ means different things to the individual batsman or bowler. Morals can be different too. What is looked down upon in the longer formats need not be so in T20. Thus ‘mankading’, which might be against the spirit in a First Class match, would be not just welcome, but actually necessary in a T20 game. But what of the term ‘mankading’? As Brearley writes, “Perhaps there is something subliminally racist (in it): named after an Indian, the action was felt to be un-Christian.” Let us run it out of the lexicon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-ambivalence-here-all-is-fair-in-love-and-t20-cricket/article32787468.ece

Six players of the men’s team, including Manpreet, had tested positive for COVID-19 at the team’s training base here in August after they arrived for the national camp following a month’s break. “...we slowly started the procedures of getting back to play. The coaches have created a plan so that we gradually return to full momentum and I am happy to be back practising again,” Manpreet said in a release issued by Sports Authority of India (SAI). Skills training Reid said the emphasis is on skills training, especially individual basics, which allows the players to practice in small groups with adequate social distancing in place. “...we have been able to gradually increase the workload and intensity of the training to the point where we are able to have the majority of the squad up to pre-COVID levels by the end of the next camp,” Reid added. “This has been a slow and deliberate process designed to produce maximum output while minimising the risk of injury.” The players are also happy with the safety protocols in place at SAI’s Bengaluru centre. “It feels good that we have started training after such a long time,” Rani Rampal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/manpreet-and-reid-want-to-return-to-full-momentum-gradually/article32787472.ece
07 October 2020||Chennai,||Tendulkar’s pat for young Washington||Praise from the maestro is rare. And when it comes on the beneficiary’s birthday, it can be a spirit-lifting experience. Washington Sundar, who has been sending down his off-spinners for Royal Challengers Bangalore with control and subtle variations while conceding very little in the PowerPlay overs, received this message from Sachin Tendulkar after he completed 21 on Monday. Tendulkar wrote, ‘Wishing you a wonderful year @Sundarwashi5! Have enjoyed the way you have bowled in this IPL. Keep working hard.’ Later during RCB’s game against Delhi Capitals, Tendulkar tweeted, ‘Just shows how important @Sundarwashi5’s first spell is.He has given away just 20 runs in four overs [Washington conceded just 17 in his three Powerplay overs with the new ball while the others leaked 46]. And after his performance in the game against Mumbai Indians when Washington gave away only 12 runs in his four overs while scalping Rohit Sharma — three of them sent down in PowerPlay — Tendulkar tweeted, ‘A fantastic spell by @Sundarwashi5. His ability to watch the batsman’s feet till the last moment and adjust his line and length is a special ability.’ The maestro, indeed, has developed a liking for this talented cricketer and his quiet efficiency. And Washington needs no bigger encouragement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tendulkars-pat-for-young-washington/article32787925.ece
07 October 2020||Abu Dhabi,||KKR faces stiff test against resurgent CSK||Facing criticism for a below-par show despite a star-studded line-up, skipper Dinesh Karthik needs to find quick answers when Kolkata Knight Riders faces a resurgent Chennai Super Kings here on Wednesday. KKR has England’s World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan, but the management reposed faith in Karthik to be the leader. But a few decisions, apart from his own poor run with the bat (37 runs from four matches), have raised questions. Narine’s struggles Promoting himself ahead of the star duo of Morgan and Andre Russell, and preferring Sunil Narine in the opening slot over Big Bash sensation Tom Banton — who has been compared to Kevin Pietersen — has put the 35-year-old Karthik under the scanner. Narine has especially looked woefully out of sorts, managing only 27 runs from four matches. KKR has plenty of bowling resources but Pat Cummins’ up-and-down performances have added to the team’s woes. Karthik will need to back his bowlers, especially Indian lead spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who seems to have been under-utilised. He had bowled just nine overs before being dropped against Delhi Capitals. CSK, on the other hand, snapped its three-match losing streak with a rousing ten-wicket win over Kings XI Punjab. Not known to tweak his side much, M.S. Dhoni persisted with Shane Watson, and the Aussie veteran finally found his touch with an unbeaten 83 and, along with Faf du Plessis, stitched together a record 181-run unbeaten stand. With the top-order regaining form, CSK seems to have got just the right impetus ahead of the game against a struggling KKR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kkr-faces-stiff-test-against-resurgent-csk/article32787422.ece
07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||I-League, the promised land, beckons for FCBU||For the fledgling FC Bengaluru United (FCBU), a club formed just two years ago, I-League is the promised land. It is this prospect that will drive the outfit when the Qualifier tournament gets underway in Kolkata on Thursday. The winner of the five-team, 10-match competition will secure a place in the I-League, the second tier of Indian football. “We are all diving into something that has very high stakes,” says FCBU head coach Richard Hood. “Every team is fresh and the format is new. But it’s not just about us [the club]. Apart from the excitement of the tournament, the goal is to bring Bangalore [the city] back into the I-League.” However, building and maintaining a stable team in the lower echelons of Indian football is precarious. Between March, when COVID-19 lockdown forced the I-League second division to stop, and now, FCBU has succeeded in retaining just eight of 27 players. New signings include Trinidad and Tobago defender Robert Primus and Ghanaian midfielder William Opoku. The latter even has I-League winning experience, having triumphed with Minerva Punjab in 2018. But going into a winner-takes-all tournament with a team that has very little experience of playing competitive football together is fraught with risks. “We had good momentum in the previous segment played from January to March,” says Hood. “[But] the break also gave us a chance to reflect on where exactly we needed changes. There were very few players we wanted but couldn't secure. And in the [training] bubble we created in Bangalore, we spent the last few weeks as a family… like brothers. On the pitch we have only relied on internal practice matches. [But] with all the technology we have to track performances, we are confident.” A successful tournament can be a game-changer, Hood believes. “The club is ambitious about rising up the ranks. Securing promotion will give us a lot more stability and clarity. It will give us a chance to offer players long-term contracts. We are not getting ahead of ourselves, but a triumph will shift us up a whole new gear.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-league-the-promised-land-beckons-for-fcbu/article32787745.ece

Physical abilities A four-time Olympian, Pillay also believes hockey has come a long way, especially when it comes to stamina and physical abilities. “What hockey I played and what these players have been playing for the last 10-15 years, there is no match. The current players are playing based on their fitness abilities. Fitness has changed Indian hockey and also the players are very serious about their physique and endurance abilities.  “Today the Indian team can be compared with Australia or Netherlands or Germany.

We fought and got a good total. This experience will help in future matches.” Tripathi valued his partnership with Eoin Morgan. “The required run rate was very high, but he was calm and said ‘Let’s do it’.

07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Purpose of incarnations||An Acharya should not only have jnana, but must also follow Sastraic rules. Jnana is just one of the primary qualities an Acharya must have. In addition, he must also have anushtana. Lord Narayana came to the earth assuming various avataras because He wanted to show us how life should be lived, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. He had already given us the Sastras to guide us. But this was not enough, because we sometimes resent advice, and often ignore it. Our attention wanders the moment someone starts telling us about the higher things in life. In this respect, adults are no different from children. But there is one way to engage the attention of children, and that is by telling them stories. And at the end of a story, we can give them a message, which they will remember because they will associate it with the story. That is how the Panchatantra stories came into existence. It is believed that they were written by Vishnu Sharma. Called upon to instruct a king’s sons, he taught them using stories, each with a message at the end. And the messages are not forgotten because of the stories that precede them. The Lord gave us messages , but we did not learn from them. So, He decided to take avataras. His avataras, filled with incidents illuminating dharma, help us understand the important tenets of the Sastras better. To understand the Vedas better, we need to study the Itihasas and Puranas, which are records of the Lord’s deeds. The Lord’s dasavataras are well known, although He took more than ten avataras. Even among the ten, only the Rama and Krishna avataras are considered poorna avataras, because in both cases the Lord was born after having been in the womb of mortal women. He lived on the earth for many years during these two avataras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/purpose-of-incarnations/article32787414.ece

07 October 2020||October 07 2020 00:00 IST,||Beside the lake, beneath the trees||It is a trend, says Thane-based, aquatic gardener Somnath Pradeep Pal, discussing the increasing worldwide fascination for waterlilies. Somnath was featured as the Hybridiser of The Month in the July issue of the International Waterlily and Water Gardening Society (IWGS) Journal . With over 20 years of experience, he is now in the news for his deep purple lily called Rishi, which has a petal count of 50 and another 70-petal flower called Painted Dream. While hobbyists are aware of the possibilities in growing and propagating waterlilies, their success is roping in others, he says. The other factor, according to him, is “the idea that a garden is incomplete without aquatic plants is drawing home gardeners to have a water corner”. And the fact that the flowers pose a scope for additional income for small-scale growers. “Aquatic plants are a promising vertical segment of gardening. Their promising business scope attracts numerous small growers and high-end horticultural investors as well,” says Kochi-based JM Jacob who founded Miniature Gardening Expertise Society of India three years ago and is the administrator for several social media communities on gardening. The slowdown triggered by COVID-19 does not seem to have impacted the growing interest in aquatic gardening. In fact it has spiked it, says Varun Kumar, an engineering student who has joined his family’s waterlily venture at Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu. He, along with his father Muthu Kumar, is the administrator of Facebook group Waterlilies and Lotus India. Varun says that there are as many as 10 groups on social media dedicated to water gardening with some groups having a membership of nearly 10,000. “We were a small community but the last 18 months have seen a tremendous growth in membership,” says Jacob. His community called Aquatic Gardens on Facebook has seen 10,000 entries in the last year. He attributes the increase in numbers to awareness created through workshops, seminars and educational discussions across cities. Jacob compares this boom to people’s interest in orchids 15 years ago. Bangalore-based grower and seller Indira Shankar says that the Internet has facilitated the commercial aspect of the hobby. A licensed importer, she has been in the field for the past 30 years. “Earlier, we grew native varieties; but now, with awareness, there are almost 2,000 registered hybrids to choose from,” she says. The last five to 10 years, according to Maryland-based Kelly Billing, a water garden consultant and a member of the IWGS committee, have seen an international awakening. When she entered the field in 1986, very few companies were into hybridisation. The hybridised varieties, she points out, allow waterlilies and lotuses to be grown in small containers and bowls. She explains, “New plants are on the rise. Somnath is creating vibrant new cultivars.” Hybridisers are working on even smaller plants for small apartments says Kelly who finds growing these “is part of one’s soul.” Southern States in India that have good weather conditions and plenty of natural water bodies lead in waterlily cultivation but Maharashtra, Odisha and Gujarat also have many growers. “Out of 100 who join the Aquatic Gardens group, 30 are from Kerala. Almost 70% of the plants are bought by growers from there,” says Jacob. Aquatic Gardens held the first all India Aquatic Gardening Expertise Meet and conference at Alappuzha in 2019 in Kerala. “Every buyer is a seller of the future,” says Prasanta Kumar Das, a grower, hybridiser and aquatic venture knowledge consultant from Odisha and administrator of Aquatic Gardens. “Educating the beginners is essential for sustaining the hobby,” says Prasanta Neethu Suneesh from Muvattupuzha bought her first waterlily bulb for Rs. 100. When the native variety blossomed, she delved into the subject and learned that hybrid varieties can be grown in small tubs on balconies and terraces. She bought her first hybrid bulb for Rs. 1,000 and this provided her with tubers in the next one month, which she could multiply. “I now have 65 hybrids, all growing on my terrace,” says Neethu. Jacob explains the commercial viability of waterlily farming. “The waterlily’s propagation and rearing phase is very short compared to other ornamental plants like orchids, adenium or succulents. A grower might get up to 20 to 25 tubers from a mother plant to retail for anywhere between Rs. 1,000 to 5,000. A profit of a lakh is possible in a few months.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/beside-the-lake-beneath-the-trees/article32787670.ece
07 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC judgment today on Shaheen Bagh protests||The Supreme Court on October 7 will pronounce its judgment about balancing the right to protest against the right to public movement in the background of the marathon protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Shaheen Bagh. Shift anti-CAA protesters A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul will deliver judgment on a petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni, several months ago, for a direction to shift the anti-CAA protesters of Shaheen Bagh, mostly mothers and their children, to an alternative site as they have been “blocking” public movement and causing traffic snarls in the area. The protesters were later removed by the police on March 24 with the advent of the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown. The protesters had at the time written to Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde against the “forcible and vindictive removal of the protest site” by the Delhi Police. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued that the right to protest, like any other right, was not “absolute”. Justice Kaul had orally said in a parliamentary democracy the avenue of debate was first Parliament. In addition, peaceful protests could be held. Mr. Sahni had said though the reason for the petition — the blockage of the main road by Shaheen Bagh protesters — had become infructuous, the court should still pass specific orders that “in future, protests should not hinder public movement”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sc-judgment-today-on-shaheen-bagh-protests/article32787978.ece
07 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Call for sacking Adityanath gets louder||National Federation of Indian Women, along with Pragatisheel Mahila Sangathan and ANHAD demanded the sacking of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath after visiting Hathras on Monday. A delegation comprising NFIW’s national general secretary Annie Raja, PMS’ general secretary Poonam Kaushik and activist Shabnam Hashmi met the rape victim’s family and doctors and other staff in Aligarh, where the victim underwent treatment before being shifted to Delhi. The team demanded that Mr. Adityanath be sacked from the CM’s post “for deteriorating condition of constitutional bodies and growing violence against women, especially Dalits”. They also demanded enquiry into the diversionary narrative propaganda, suspension of the District Magistrate, safety security and livelihood of the family. “We demand that NHRC should investigate why all the dissent is being criminalised,” they said in a statement. Talking about the “narrative” being propagated claiming that the victim was not raped, the team said that an offence has been committed by revealing the girl’s identity by the head of BJP IT cell who shared a video of the victim. “In the video, when the victim was asked why they strangulated her, she says because she was resisting ‘zabardasti’. ‘Zabardasti’ is used for sexual assault and this video is of the police station in Hathras. Such efforts of the government and the BJP in trying to shield the perpetrators are highly condemnable,” they said. Voice of dissent The team also condemned filing of cases against protesters and said that all acts of dissent is now being termed as conspiracy to malign “the BJP and its State governments”. “They have forgotten that it is every citizen’s right under the Constitution to raise his/her voice against injustice,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/womens-organisations-call-for-up-cms-sacking/article32787975.ece

07 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Narco analysis facility to start after pandemic’||The Delhi government has informed the High Court that a narco analysis test facility is being set up at Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital here but cannot be put to use in view of the pandemic. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar had earlier asked the Delhi government to file a status report disclosing as to whether any steps have been taken to set up the facility in Delhi, considering the fact that a large number of such tests are required to be conducted in respect of the cases registered here. Delhi government said the process to start the narco analysis examination here will begin as soon as the pandemic situation comes under control.The issue cropped up while the court was hearing a plea by a man, who has been running around in search of his 19-year-old son who is missing since September 17, 2018. The petition said the missing boy wanted to become a wrestler and his father had told the police that he suspected the owner of a gymnasium and four others behind the disappearance of his son but the officials have not taken any action after which he approached the court. Delhi Police’s counsel had stated that polygraph test of two of the suspects have been conducted and of the other three suspects is yet to be conducted. “The same could not be conducted on account of the lockdown,” the counsel had said. The court has posted the case for hearing on November 25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/narco-analysis-facility-to-start-after-pandemic-govt/article32787972.ece

07 October 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Rahul’s tractor rally enters Haryana amid high drama||After his three-day rally spree in Punjab, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday took the party’s ‘tractor rally’ to neighbouring Haryana to extend support to farmers agitating against the Centre’s agriculture sector legislations. High-voltage drama was witnessed at Haryana’s border with Punjab when the ‘tractor rally’ was stopped for a while with Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja accusing the Haryana police of not allowing Congress leaders and workers to enter the State. The police, however, dismissed the charges. “Our jurisdiction starts from halfway through the Markandey bridge from where we were supposed to provide a carcade to Mr. Gandhi as per norms of the Z plus security. Our carcade was ready on the bridge on our side of the border... Mr. Gandhi was on a tractor and people who were with him had surrounded it and didn’t let it proceed. Whatever chaos happened occurred on the other side of the border in Punjab,” Rajesh Duggal, Superintendent of Police, Kurukshetra, told The Hindu . “They had due permission from the District Magistrate and there was no reason why we would stop him,” he added. After wrapping his public rally at Sanaur in Patiala district, Mr. Gandhi along with party leaders and workers from the Punjab Congress moved towards Haryana. Barricades laid by the Haryana police were thrown by Congress workers who were ahead of the tractor rally, led by Mr. Gandhi. They shouted slogans against the Centre and the State government. As the procession stopped at the border, Mr. Gandhi tweeted, “They have stopped us on a bridge on the Haryana border. I’m not moving and am happy to wait here. 1 hour, 5 hours, 24 hours, 100 hours, 1000 hours or 5000 hours.” Later, Mr. Gandhi addressed two public rallies, one in Pehowa and the other in Kurukshetra, where he hit out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre for bringing the three agriculture sector laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rahuls-tractor-rally-enters-haryana-amid-high-drama/article32787681.ece
07 October 2020||Guwahati,||Rhino horn piece puts Nagaland politicians ill at ease||A piece of rhino horn has triggered anxiety among the members of an association of former lawmakers in Nagaland. The Ex-Parliamentarians’ Association of Nagaland (EPAN) has been “disturbed” ever since an arrested contractor from Assam’s Karbi Anglong district disclosed that he had sold a piece of a rhino horn to a former Nagaland legislator. The horn had been sawn off a rhino shot in the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve months ago. “Manshing Terang, the contractor from Diphu (headquarters of Karbi Anglong district), confessed to us that he sold a broken piece of the rhino horn to a former Nagaland MLA in August,” Piraisoodan B., Kaziranga’s Assistant Conservator of Forest told journalists on October 2. He said the contractor, well-known for his socio-cultural activities, claimed to have also met the wife of the former MLA. On October 5, the EPAN sought the disclosure of the rhino horn piece buyer’s name as the “suspense” over not naming the person concerned has “tarnished the image” of Nagaland’s former legislators. “Our association stands for the preservation of flora and fauna,” EPAN president Joshua Sumi said, requesting Assam’s forest authorities to disclose the name of the MLA who allegedly bought the piece. Kaziranga Director P. Sivakumar said the name of the buyer would be revealed after all evidences are collected. “We know who he is,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rhino-horn-piece-puts-nagaland-politicians-ill-at-ease/article32787682.ece
