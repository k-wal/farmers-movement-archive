03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||India loses jurisdiction over Italian marines case||The Government of India said it was studying an international tribunal’s ruling that the Italian marines accused of killing two fishermen in the waters off the Kerala coast on February 15, 2012, held “immunity” and would face a trial in Italy, not India. While the tribunal held in Italy’s favour the main submission, of jurisdiction, it found merit in India’s counter-claim that the marines on board “Enrica Lexie” had violated the freedom of navigation rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) by shooting at fishing boat “St. Antony” and should pay compensation to the victims’ families, the boat owner and crew members. Marines’ claim In their defence, the marines claimed they mistook the fishermen for “pirates” and that the shooting occurred in international waters. In its submissions, India had called on the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) UNCLOS tribunal to “adjudge and declare that it [PCA] has no jurisdiction with respect to the case submitted to it by Italy”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-loses-jurisdiction-over-italian-marines-case/article31975706.ece
03 July 2020||CHENNAI,||3.5 lakh acres to be under paddy cultivation in Delta||With farmers of the Cauvery delta engaging themselves in raising paddy over about 2.2 lakh acres during the ongoing Kuruvai cultivation season, the authorities are hopeful that the target of 3.5 lakh acres will be met within this month. As the nursery has been done for 2,263 acres, this will take care of transplanting the crop over around 1.14 lakh acres. Steps are on to cover the balance of 16,000 acres too, says a senior official of the Agriculture Department, adding that this year, the rice production during the kuruvai season is expected to be around 6 lakh tonnes. If the plan in coverage fructifies, this will be around 60,000 acres more than what the delta achieved last year. The availability of water at the Mettur dam, which is the lifeline for the Cauvery delta, is an important reason behind the optimism of the authorities. On Wednesday, the dam had a storage of 52.86 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) against the capacity of 93.47 tmc ft. As of now, the discharge into the river was 10,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs). There have been demands from the farmers and political parties for stepping up the discharge and the government is expected to take a decision shortly. Even though June saw a realisation of 6.2 tmc ft at the Biligundlu measuring site on the border of Karnataka-Tamil Nadu, there is an expectation that the inflow will pick up momentum in the weeks to come when the Southwest monsoon becomes vigorous over catchment of the Cauvery in the neighbouring State and Kerala. The realisation during June was about three tmc ft short of Tamil Nadu’s quota for the month. In July, the State is expected to get 31.24 tmc ft. With regard to inputs, the situation is quite comfortable, points out the official. Apart from distributing about 3,800 tonnes of seeds, nearly 2,130 tonnes are available. Likewise, in respect of fertilizer, the delta region has a stock of about 1 lakh tonnes, which is three times the requirement. Farmers in the tail of the Cauvery system have been advised to go for salt tolerant and shorter duration varieties than normal, the official adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/35-lakh-acres-to-be-under-paddy-cultivation-in-delta/article31975847.ece

Sudhakar,||Three policemen held in T.N. custodial deaths case||In a pre-dawn operation on Thursday, the Tamil Nadu Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) arrested Sridhar, suspended inspector and Station House Officer of the Sattankulam station, in the case relating to the custodial murder of trader P. Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks. Sub-inspector Balakrishnan and constable Murugan, both suspended, were also arrested by special teams. On Wednesday night, another accused, sub-inspector Raghu Ganesh, had been arrested. The duo died at the Kovilpatti Government Hospital after they were allegedly tortured in police custody on June 19 after being picked up on a trivial charge. A CB-CID officer said a special team intercepted a car at the Gangaikondan checkpost on the Tirunelveli-Madurai National Highway, in which Mr. Sridhar was found fleeing towards Theni district, and arrested him. “Sridhar, who came to Tirunelveli with the help of a ruling party functionary, proceeded towards Theni in the early hours of Thursday,” a police source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/three-policemen-held-in-tn-custodial-deaths-case/article31975684.ece
03 July 2020||Kolkata,||Protests over Amphan relief irregularities continue||Protests over irregularities in distribution of Amphan relief continued in West Bengal even 40 days after the cyclone made a landfall in south Bengal. The protests were spread from Singur to Nandigram with videos of a Trinamool Congress worker in Singur, who was publicly shamed by holding his ears, going viral on social media. The local Trinamool Congress leadership said BJP supporters were responsible for this, an allegation denied by that party. BJP said angry villagers had forced the Trinamool functionary to hold his ears and apologise for alleged irregularities in the cyclone relief distribution. Earlier in June, a similar incident was recorded at Mathurapur in South 24 Parganas district. At Nandigram, in Purba Medinipur district, locals blocked the road alleging that family members of local panchayat functionaries, whose houses were not damaged in the cyclone, were behind irregularities in relief distribution. The police had to intervene to lift the blockade. At Kultali in South 24 Parganas, there was a stampede-like situation when a large number of people gathered to submit relief forms at the Block Development Office. Two women sustained injuries in the milieu. The past weeks have seen protests from various districts over irregularities in distribution of relief work following Cyclone Amphan. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said that no irregularities will be tolerated in relief distribution, and directed the officials to make a list of beneficiaries public at every block level. The TMC leadership has taken action against several leaders for their alleged role in corruption over relief distribution. The Centre has released Rs. 1,000 crore and the State Rs. 6,500 crore for relief and restoration work for those affected by the cyclone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/protests-over-amphan-relief-irregularities-continue/article31976088.ece
03 July 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||LDF waiting for clearer picture||Amidst intense speculations over the future course of the Kerala Congress (M) faction led by Jose K. Mani, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) is biding its time for a clearer picture to emerge. CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s article in the party organ Desabhimani on Thursday dwelt on the United Democratic Front’s (UDF) current crisis and said the defection of the KC(M), one of the allies with a mass base, would destabilise the front. LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan’s observation that the front would discuss the issue lent grist to the rumours mill of the front opening a vestibule for parleys with the KC(M) in haste. But Mr. Balakrishnan told The Hindu that it is too early to draw conclusions on the LDF striking a chord with Mr. Jose. The KC(M) is still a UDF ally and it has not been expelled. The KC(M) should first quit the front, adopt a political stance against the UDF and then the LDF would consider the issue, Mr. Balakrishnan said and refused to respond to rumours over the front expediting steps to lure the party to its fold. Mani’s stance But Mr. Mani has chosen to cold-shoulder the truce attempts of the UDF and even the Indian Union Muslim League’s offer to negotiate. The uncertainty over his political position and the statement that the party would not forge any alliance for the local body elections to prove its clout have made the UDF jittery, forcing it to leave its door open for further negotiations. Voice of dissent The lone voice of dissent from the CPI in having a new ally in the 10-party front is perhaps the only irritant for the KC(M)’s entry to the LDF at present. The Nationalist Congress Party and other allies would toe the CPI(M) line and ironing out a consensus with the CPI on having KC(M) on board, once it formally quits the UDF, would not be a tough task, sources said. The CPI(M) State secretariat is expected to discuss the issue on Friday and that would set the tone of the talks in the weeks ahead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ldf-waiting-for-clearer-picture/article31976024.ece

While the home isolation would be with the knowledge of family members, neighbours, and local authorities, the local authority will decide the suitability for home isolation. The comprehensive guidelines on implementation of home isolation seeks treatment of patients on telemedicine through a government or a private hospital chosen by the patient. Availability of a caregiver 24x7 is another criterion, and a regular communication link between the caregiver and hospital is a pre-requisite for home isolation during the entire period. Oxygen saturation should be above 95%. While home isolation is not applicable for pregnant women, lactating mothers will be allowed home isolation after assessment. Those with co-morbid conditions such as kidney disease, including those on dialysis, heart disease, stroke, TB, cancer, people living with HIV, immune compromised, those on steroids and immune suppressants, are not eligible to seek home isolation. However, those with other co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and thyroid should be well managed and under good clinical control as assessed by health authorities could be in home isolation. The COVID-19 patient will be allowed to resume duty only after satisfactory completion of home isolation and the entire house will have to be disinfected after the completion of the isolation period. To monitor the movement of COVID-19 positive patient, an e-tag on the left wrist of the patient is mandatory. If the person is found to be violating the norms, an FIR will be filed against him and the patient will be shifted to the COVID-19 care centre.

03 July 2020||Mumbai,||MVA: United against COVID-19, divided over fresh lockdown||The imposition of the complete lockdown, yet again, for the next 10 days within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has led to some friction among the three ruling parties of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. According to sources from the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), both are unhappy over the haphazard manner in which the decision to extend the lockdown for over one month across the State, and later the 10-day strict restrictions in seven of the nine municipal corporations within the MMR was taken. The two parties are disappointed that they were not consulted before going ahead with the decision in the MMR. “No, we were not asked or informed. We are not against any measure to control COVID-19. But this is a coalition government, and it is expected that decisions are shared or informed before announcing to the public,” a Cabinet minister from the Congress said. Congress leaders Balasaheb Thorat and Ashok Chavan, as well as NCP chief Sharad Pawar have, in the past, met Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to air grievances over attempts by the administration to sideline ministers and what they called the CM’s overdependence on bureaucracy. The leaders have conveyed to Mr. Thackeray that it is creating problems in the functioning of the government and the issue needs to be addressed with due seriousness. A Cabinet minister from the NCP too expressed his displeasure over the manner in which decisions are being taken and the over-dependence on bureaucracy. “A collective decision in a coalition government will give better results than the one based only on inputs from the administration. The political class is directly in touch with the public and might be in a better position to give ground reports,” he said. The NCP minister also said the lockdown imposed by the seven municipal corporations has created confusion among the general public as many engaged in essential services travel to Mumbai. “The MMR is different than any other district or region in the State, as it is inter-connected. There has to be a uniform policy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mva-united-against-covid-19-divided-over-fresh-lockdown/article31976144.ece

Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh on Thursday announced that such task forces will be set up, following the directives given by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Mr. Deshmukh said each task force will consist of doctors, experts, and senior officials from the district. “The task force will coordinate with different authorities working to control the spread of novel coronavirus and also supervise the treatments used to cure patients.” The Medical Education Department secretary has been directed to convey to all district collectors in this regard. “We formed a task force in Mumbai and it turned out to be extremely useful. Now, every district and division is required to have a similar task force, since the number of COVID-19 patients is growing,” Mr. Thackeray had said at a meeting of divisional commissioners, municipal commissioners, and collectors, last month. Mr. Thackeray, at the meeting, had also said, “We regularly issue guidelines regarding medicines and treatments. Sometimes, these change as well. Therefore, it is important to have senior medical professionals on board. It has been proved in several cases that proper medical treatment ensures cure.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-to-follow-mumbai-model-every-district-will-have-a-doctors-task-force/article31976143.ece

The patient died hours after his samples were taken on Monday. A relative said the doctor did not issue a death certificate and asked the family to wait for the test report. “The doctor said he possibly died of cardiac arrest but since his COVID-19 test report was pending, he would not issue a death certificate. He asked us to preserve the body until the report came in,” the relative said. The family, which resides in an apartment on Amherst Street in north Kolkata, said it approached the police and civic officials, but no one helped. The family then got a freezer to preserve the body.

03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||No repatriation if cases are pending, says SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday orally observed that there was “no question” of deporting “foreign Tablighi Jamaat members” if there were criminal proceedings against them. The court was responding to pleas by the foreign nationals to deport them, saying they had not harmed national security by taking part in a Tablighi Jamaat gathering amid the lockdown on account of the COVID-19 pandemic in the national capital. Deportation was the normal action taken by any government for visa violations, they said. “But if there are criminal cases pending, there is no question of deportation. It is the Union of India’s discretion,” Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, speaking for the three-judge Bench, remarked at a virtual court hearing. The court’s oral observations came soon after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) clarified in an affidavit that visas of 2,679 foreigners had been cancelled on a “case-to-case basis”. “If individual orders have been passed, then these orders should be made available to the petitioners [foreign nationals].

03 July 2020||HUBBALLI,||Junior doctors continue agitation||The indefinite agitation by post-graduate medical students of JJM Medical College, Davangere, seeking stipend which has not been paid for the last 16 months entered the fourth day on Thursday and attempts by elected representatives to convince them to withdraw the agitation failed. All these post-graduate students have been serving COVID-19 patients in the designated hospital (Chigateri Hospital) and at the Women and Child Hospital and are participating in the agitation in shifts after completing their duties. They have not been paid their stipend from March 2019. This is because of a technical issue which needs to be sorted out among the management of JJM Medcial College, the Directorate of Medical Education and Department of Health and Family Welfare. On Thursday, MP G.M. Siddeshwar and MLC Narayanaswamy met the junior doctors at Jayadeva Circle in Davangere and requested them to withdraw their agitation, while assuring them of taking up the issue with the Chief Minister and get the issue sorted out within a week. Mr. Siddeshwar told the junior doctors that they had served like soldiers against COVID-19 and they should not indulge in an agitation during a time of crisis. He promised them that he would get the stipend released within a week. Mr. Narayanaswamy too appealed to them to believe their words of getting stipend released within a week and withdraw the agitation. However, the junior doctors refused to withdraw their protest saying that they have been given such oral assurances before. Speaking on their behalf, a doctor Harish said that they had been trying for the last 16 months to get the issue resolved and barring assurances they had not received anything else.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/junior-doctors-continue-agitation/article31975938.ece

While the tribunal held in Italy’s favour the main submission, of jurisdiction, it found merit in India’s counter-claim that the marines on board “Enrica Lexie” had violated the freedom of navigation rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) by shooting at fishing boat “St. Antony” and should pay compensation to the victims’ families, the boat owner and crew members. In their defence, the marines had claimed they mistook the fishermen for “pirates” and that the shooting occurred in international waters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-loses-jurisdiction-over-italian-marines-case/article31975689.ece

03 July 2020||GUWAHATI,||Over 16 lakh affected in Assam floods||The flood situation in Assam worsened after two successive days of improvement, affecting 16.03 lakh on Thursday. The number of affected people stood at 14.95 lakh on Wednesday. One person drowned in western Assam’s Goalpara district, taking the death toll due to the floods and landslips to 58 since May 22. A spokesperson of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said the number of flood-affected districts had come down to 22 from 25 a week ago. “More than 2,500 people have left the relief camps, leaving 12,597 inmates in 93 shelters,” she said. The Brahmaputra and three of its tributaries, officials said, were flowing above the danger mark, but at fewer stretches than 24 hours ago. The floodwaters have breached embankments and damaged roads and bridges, cutting off many areas. Barpeta continued to be the worst-hit district with 8.6 lakh people affected, followed by South Salmara (1.95 lakh), Goalpara, (94,610), Nalbari, (85,716) and Morigaon (62,530). The water level at the Kaziranga National Park receded over the past 24 hours. An update from the park said 73 of the total 223 anti-poaching camps were inundated, 34 fewer than on Tuesday. But the number of animals killed owing to the flooding increased to 25 from 18 on July 1. While four animals drowned, eight hog deer escaping the flooded park were run over by vehicles, despite speed restrictions. Four died under treatment at a rescue centre and the rest owing to “other reasons”.  Fleeing animals killed Animals fleeing a flooded Kaziranga, which has a core area of 430 sq km, have to cross the highway for the relative safety of the hills in Karbi Anglong district. The park authorities had a week ago made it mandatory for vehicles to cross the stretch along the park at 40 kmph. The “other” reasons include hunting. In June, the park authorities and the police arrested three persons in five incidents of hunting deer trying to escape the flooded park. Two of them were caught in the Behali area with half kg of cooked venison and three hog deer skins. They were charged with hunting and illegal possession of cooked and fresh deer meat under the Wildlife Protection (Assam Amendment) Act, 2009. A live deer was recovered from another person in Biswanath Ghat a couple of days ago. Both Behali and Biswanath are on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra. Kaziranga officials said some people take advantage of the floods when the animals, mostly the hog deer, come out of the park for shelter on higher grounds in the fringe areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-16-lakh-affected-in-assam-floods/article31975908.ece
03 July 2020||Bhopal,||Madhya Pradesh gets 28 new Ministers||Madhya Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel on Thursday administered the oath of office to 28 Ministers, including nine supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia, who switched over to the BJP from the Congress, to join the Council of Ministers of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government. Over three months after the fall of the Congress government in March, the 20 Cabinet and eight Ministers of State were appointed at the Raj Bhavan here. Five Cabinet Ministers were appointed on April 21, after Mr. Chouhan ran a single-man Cabinet for nearly a month. The strength of the Council of Ministers now stands at 34, including Mr. Chouhan. Of the nine newly appointed Ministers — former Congress MLAs who support Rajya Sabha member Mr. Scindia — Mahendra Singh Sisodiya, Prabhuram Choudhary, Pradhuman Singh Tomar and Imarti Devi were Ministers in the Kamal Nath government as well. Similarly, Mr. Scindia’s supporters, Govind Singh Rajput and Tulsiram Silawat, appointed Ministers earlier, held portfolios in the Congress regime. Former Congress leaders Hardeep Singh Dang, Bisahulal Singh and Aidal Singh Kansana, who rode on the string of resignations and defections among Mr. Scindia loyalists, that later unseated the Congress government, took oath as Cabinet Ministers. Amid the political turmoil in March, 22 Congress MLAs, including 19 supporters of Mr. Scindia, resigned, precipitating the fall of the Nath government and paving the way for Mr. Chouhan’s return to power after 15 months. Of them, 14 are now Ministers, including 10 Cabinet Ministers, who will have to win byelection. Among Mr. Scindia’s supporters, seven Ministers had won on Congress ticket in the 2018 Vidhan Sabha polls from the Gwalior-Chambal region, the stronghold of the Scindias, where 16 seats lie vacant. As for BJP legislators, seven MLAs who were Ministers in the previous Chouhan regime, such as former Leader of the Opposition Gopal Bhargava, Vishvas Sarang and Yashodhara Raje Scindia, aunt of Mr. Jyotiraditya, took oath. Nine new faces were inducted in the Council of Ministers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/madhya-pradesh-gets-28-new-ministers/article31975644.ece

States/UTs have also been directed to facilitate testing in a big way by adoption of ‘campaign mode’ by organising testing camps, using mobile vans etc. “This shall effectively take COVID-19 tests to the people’s doorsteps in high incidence areas to collect samples of all symptomatic individuals as well as their contacts,” the Ministry said. WHO on mental health Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (South-East Asia Region) on Thursday said mental health and suicide prevention needed greater attention during the pandemic. “Social distancing, isolation and coping with perpetually evolving and changing information about the virus has both triggered and aggravated existing and pre-existing mental health conditions,” said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region. Early identification of mental health conditions and recognition of suicidal behaviours is important, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ramp-up-covid-19-testing-says-centre/article31975653.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Private trains will benefit travellers’||With private trains expected to begin operations by April 2023, the Railways on Thursday said the move would only benefit travellers by way of confirmed tickets and faster trains. It also allayed fears of higher fares and job losses. “Among the major objectives of this project are induction of modern technology and reduction in transit time and the demand-supply deficit. We are eyeing a quantum jump in technology,” Railway Board Chairman V.K. Yadav said. The Railways on Wednesday invited Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for operation of passenger trains by private operators on 109 routes with 151 modern trains. This project is expected to attract Rs. 30,000 crore in private investment. Mr. Yadav said the Railways was running 2,800 mail and express trains, and 151 modern trains — for which the RFQ was invited — accounted for only 5% of them. “95% of trains will still be run by Indian Railways,” he said. The statement comes amid concerns raised by Opposition parties over the privatisation. “More than 70 years after Independence, we have not been able to develop our railway infrastructure to provide travel services to all our passengers. That has been our focus — to provide trains on demand...this project is also in continuation to that,” he said. According to the data shared by Mr. Yadav, though the Railways ferried 8.4 billion (840 crore) passengers in 2019-20, about five crore passengers could not be accommodated, meaning their wait-listed tickets were dropped. “In fact, further analysis shows that during the busy seasons/summer season nearly 13.3% passengers were not able to get confirmed reservation,” he said. To a question on the possibility of higher fares in these trains, Mr. Yadav said that due to the competition in the market, he did not expect the fares to be very high. “When they will fix prices, they will have to compete with AC bus fares and air travel fares. I don’t think it will be viable for private operators to run with very high tariffs.” He added that since 95% of the trains would be run by the Railways, fares of these trains would not go up. “At the same time, we will work to better facilities and upgrade coaches. So it will benefit the common man who will get better facilities at the same price.” Mr. Yadav said the allegations that the move would lead to job losses in the Railways were baseless. He added that these private trains would be run in addition to the currently available trains run by the Railways. In addition, the Railways would have to introduce more trains to cater for an estimated 13 billion passengers by 2030. The Railways expected to open financial bids for the project by February-March 2021 and finalise them by April 2021. “We are expecting that by April 2023; within two years, the trains will start operating,” Mr. Yadav said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/private-trains-will-benefit-travellers/article31975677.ece
03 July 2020||Hyderabad,||Inter supplementary exams unlikely in Telangana||Intermediate students are getting lucky this time after the 10th class students with the government likely to pass all the students with minimum marks without conducting the supplementary exams. A senior official said three recommendations have been made to the government by the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has to take the final decision. Going by the mood of the Education department officials, the CM seem to be agreeing to their suggestions. The BIE officials have a sent report saying several State governments have already promoted the students and the same can be adopted by the Telangana government. In the present circumstances taking a chance with lakhs of students was risky.  It also suggested that either all students be added certain number of marks to what they scored in the annual exams or just pass all the students with minimum score needed. They would anyway be recorded as ‘compartmental pass’ and just above 3 lakh students will benefit with this decision. A major factor that is forcing the government to consider the BIE suggestions is the High Court’s observations on the Common Entrance Tests (CETs) where students and parents’ fear of the pandemic was found to be paramount. If such crucial entrance exams, considered mandatory for entry into higher classes, can be postponed due to the prevailing situation, Court might favour cancelling the supplementary exams, the marks of which don’t impact much in admissions to higher courses, is the argument of the BIE officials. Meritorious students “All Intermediate students from MPC and BiPC streams have to write some entrance for entry into professional courses. So only a pass in Intermediate is sufficient,” an official said. For the Humanities stream admissions are based on Intermediate scores. The meritorious students will not lose much as their marks would remain much above those attempting the supplementary exams, and their merit will be automatically protected in the admissions process. In the annual exams this year 4,80,555 first year students appeared of which 2,88,383 students passed. Similarly, in the second year 4,11,631 students took the exams and 2,83,462 students cleared all the papers. Now, 1,92,172 students from first year and 1,28,169 students from second year applied for the supplementary exams. Apart from these some students also applied for improvement of their scores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/inter-supplementary-exams-unlikely-in-telangana/article31975619.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Banning of Chinese apps is a digital strike’||Union Minister for Communication and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday termed the banning of 59 Chinese apps by the government earlier this week a “digital strike.” He said India wanted peace but was capable of giving a befitting reply to anyone casting an evil eye on it. He was addressing a virtual rally attended by members and leaders of the West Bengal BJP unit in the ongoing “Jan Samvad” series of virtual rallies by the party. Hailing the “strong” leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Prasad asserted that “if India lost 20 soldiers in the Galwan Valley border clash, the toll is double on the Chinese side” and that was probably the reason the Chinese government had not made any public declaration of casualty figures. “When people from China tried to create pressure on LAC [Line of Actual Control], our soldiers gave them a befitting reply ... if our 20 jawans have sacrificed their lives, the toll is double on the Chinese side. You all must have noticed that they have not come out with any figure,” Mr. Prasad said. He added that “nowadays we only hear of two ‘Cs’, coronavirus and China.” ‘Will to deliver’ “When our Prime Minister is saying that the sacrifice of our jawans won’t go in vain, it has a meaning in terms of national security. Our government has the will to deliver. All of us are aware of the courage of our Prime Minister,” he added. “It’s not the India of 1962,” he said. Insisting that India carried out a “digital strike” to protect the data of countrymen, Mr. Prasad sought to know why the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) was opposing the ban on Chinese apps. “For us, the privacy and protection of data of our countrymen are supreme. As IT Minister, we decided to ban 59 apps to protect data. We won’t compromise on the issue of data security and national integration. India knows how to protect its borders and also knows how to carry out a digital strike,” he asserted. “We are witnessing a strange trend in Bengal. The ruling TMC had earlier asked why we were not banning the apps. Now they want to know why we are banning the apps. This is strange, why can’t they stand with the government at the time of crisis,” he said. Trinamool Congress MP Nusrat Jahan had on Wednesday criticised the banning of TikTok as an “eyewash” and a superficial decision. Slams CPI(M) Mr. Prasad also attacked the CPI(M) over its “silence” on the Sino-India border confrontation. “I am surprised why the CPI(M) has not criticised China. We saw an article in CPI(M) mouthpiece where it said India had angered China by removing Article 370 from Kashmir. Is it the same CPI(M) that it was in 1962? Is it still speaking the same language of 1962 in 2020?” he said. Indicating that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act would be a major electoral plank in the West Bengal Assembly polls due next year, Mr. Prasad wondered why the anti-CAA protesters had gone silent on the issue of China. “This law was brought in to help the refugees, what is the harm in it? In Bengal, we used to witness a lot of protests in some universities, our Union Ministers and the State Governor were not allowed to enter. I wonder where are those anti-CAA protesters, why have they gone silent on China issue?” he said. Mr. Prasad also attacked the Mamata Banerjee government over what he termed its reluctance to facilitate the return of its people during the COVID-19 lockdown. “Uttar Pradesh brought back its 25 lakh migrant workers, Bihar brought back 20 lakh workers. I want to ask how many Shramik Special trains were allowed in Bengal. She [Mamata] had said that these special migrant trains were bringing more COVID-19 positive people into the State. Such statements are unacceptable,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/banning-of-chinese-apps-is-a-digital-strike/article31975640.ece
03 July 2020||New Delhi,||Chargesheet details Delhi killings||Nine Muslim young men, who were killed and their bodies thrown in a drain during the February communal riots in northeast Delhi, were forced to shout ‘Jai Shri Ram’ before they were stripped, thrashed and bludgeoned to death, says a copy of the chargesheet seen by The Hindu . More than 750 cases have been filed in connection with the riots and the murders, it said. The nine victims were identified as Mursalin, Aas Mohd, Aamin, Bhure Ali, Hamza, Musharraf, Akil Ahmed, and Hashim Ali and his brother Aamir Khan. In their chargesheet, the Delhi Police have mentioned that these nine Muslim men were murdered in the period from the evening of February 25 till late night on February 26. Their bodies were recovered over a period of several days from the Bhagirathi Vihar drain. The police arrested Lokesh Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Ankit Chaudhary, Sumit Chaudhary, Prince, Jatin Sharma, Himanshu Thakur, Vivek Panchal and Rishabh Chaudhary. WhatsApp group They were part of a WhatsApp group “Kattar Hindut Ekta” that was created on February 25 to take “revenge” on Muslims. The creator of the WhatsApp group is still absconding. One of the accused, Lokesh Solanki, on February 25, messaged in the “Kattar Hindut Ekta” group: “Brother Lokesh Solanki this side from Ganga Vihar area if any Hindu need any back up then do contact. We have men, arms and ammunitions. I have just killed two Muslims at Bhagirathi Vihar and thrown them in drain with the help of my team.” “Their [attackers] modus operandi was, they used to catch the people passing through the area and ascertain their religion by asking name, address and by their document i.e. Identity Card and they were forcing them to call ‘Jai Shri Ram’ many times. The person who was not calling ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and carrying the identity of Muslim identity, they were bluntly attacked and thrown into the Main Ganda Nala [dirty drain], Bhagirathi Vihar, Delhi,” the chargesheet said. A caller to the Police Control Room (PCR) on February 25 at Gokalpuri Police Station mentioned: “Here Muslims are being killed and their vehicles are being burned.” The caller, who was a Hindu, and an eyewitness in the case, was traced during the investigation. WhatsApp chat transcripts are part of the chargesheet where rioters were talking about how many Muslims they had killed, offers for reinforcements were made, and requests for arms and ammunition were placed. The chat transcripts between the “Kattar Hindut Ekta” group members clearly fell in the category of extra-judicial confessions and had been done voluntarily, the chargesheet added. Some more co-accused/suspects — Monty Nagar, Avdesh Mishra @ Sardar, Monu, Sahil @ Babu, Shekhar, Mongli, Baba and Tinku — were identified but are yet to be arrested since their addresses could not be ascertained. After their arrests, a supplementary charge sheet will be filed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chargesheet-details-delhi-killings/article31975672.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘FIRs filed against Jamaat members’||The Ministry of Home Affairs said in the Supreme Court on Thursday that 2,765 “foreign Tablighi Jamaat members” were blacklisted. These foreign nationals were now “spread” across the country. Hence, 205 First Information Reports (FIRs) had been registered against the foreigners by 11 States. It said 1,906 look-out circulars had so far been issued and 227 foreigners left the country before their issuance. It said nobody had been deported so far because criminal proceedings were on against them. “Please ask the government to deport us. Blacklisting comes into the picture only if we try to come back to India; we want to leave,” said senior advocate Chander Uday Singh, appearing for the foreign nationals who have petitioned the court. The court responded that they would have to make the necessary representation in this regard with the authorities concerned. Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta countered that visa matters were “plenary sovereign functions” and not justiciable. “Blacklisting is a sovereign function. These people face criminal proceedings. There are summary trials. There more than 900 cases from Delhi itself,” he said. The court scheduled further hearing for July 9, giving time to the petitioners to file their rejoinders to the Ministry’s affidavit. It directed the government to send the individual orders of visa cancellation to the foreign nationals in question. At the previous hearing, the court asked the government to clarify whether the blacklisting and cancellation of visas of the foreign nationals was a blanket directive or care was taken to decide the merits of each case. “If individual orders have been passed, these orders should be made available to the petitioners [foreign nationals]. They [the petitioners] will have to challenge the orders in the High Courts,” Justice A.M. Khanwilkar told Mr. Mehta. But Mr. Singh said the government had still not answered a “basic question”. “The basic question here is why was a show-cause notice not issued to anyone before these orders were supposedly passed? We received emails only yesterday about the cancellation of visas,” Mr. Singh said. Decision challenged Four petitions, including one by a Thai national who is seven months pregnant, have challenged the Centre’s decision of April 2 to blacklist foreign nationals from travelling to India for the next 10 years. The decision by its very unilateral nature, infringed the principle of natural justice, particularly audi alteram partem (hear the other side) by blacklisting foreigners present in India without giving them a hearing or notice, and resultantly depriving the aggrieved foreign nationals of their right of locomotion and travelling back to the country of their citizenship, the petition filed by the Thai woman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/firs-filed-against-jamaat-members/article31975655.ece
03 July 2020||Bengaluru,||Woman in labour denied admission by 5 hospitals||It is not just COVID-19 positive patients, who are refused treatment in hospitals. Others too are finding it difficult to get admitted even for deliveries and heart ailments. On Thursday, a 22-year-old pregnant woman, in an advanced stage of labour, was refused admission in at least five hospitals. Already in pain, Mamta Arun spent 12 hours in an autorickshaw as her family went from one hospital to another seeking admission. She was finally admitted to K.C. General Hospital around 12 p.m. on Thursday. A resident of Bheemanakuppe on Mysuru Road, Ms. Mamta was undergoing ante-natal follow up at Gleneagles Global Hospital in Kengeri. “Due on Thursday, she went into pain late on Wednesday night. We rushed her to Gleneagles hospital in an autorickshaw. However, she was refused admission on the pretext that the hospital was now treating COVID-19 patients. They told us she may be at risk of getting the infection if admitted there,” said Gowri Arunkumar, a family friend who accompanied her. Ms. Mamta’s ordeal began from there. “We then took her to Vani Vilas but were told there were no beds. Then we went to Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences and subsequently to two BBMP hospitals in Govindarajnagar and Moodalpalya but in vain. Finally, she was admitted in K.C. General,” said Ms. Gowri. Medical Superintendent of Vani Vilas, Geeta Shivamurthy, said the hospital was fully occupied. “After every delivery, we need a few hours to fumigate the labour room and operation theatre as we get patients from all over the city, including containment zones,” she said. Confirming that the patient had been admitted in K.C. General after she was sent away by five hospitals, hospital medical superintendent B.R. Venkateshaiah said doctors were attending to her. “As the family did not have a hard copy of the COVID-19 negative report, the doctors have been told to take all precautions and help her give birth,” he said. Despite repeated attempts, Gleneagles hosiptal authorities did not comment. In another tragic incident, a 36-year-old resident of Tannery Road, Asadulla Farhana, died after he was refused admission in at least five hospitals. Tanveer Ahmed, JD(S) spokesperson and a friend of the deceased, said the patient developed breathlessness and his family members took him to several hospitals, including Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain, Bowring and Lady Curzon, Victoria hospital, Vikram hospital, and Ambedkar Medical College Hospital. He was finally admitted in The Pulse Multi-Speciality Hospital in Girinagar, where he died on Thursday morning. Guru Prasad, MD of The Pulse hospital, said he died of viral pneumonia. “He was in critical condition when he was brought to our hospital. His COVID-19 result is awaited,” he said. Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the government was working on streamlining allocation of beds to COVID-19 patients, while also ensuring that other patients are taken care. A new set of guidelines should be ready by Friday, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/woman-in-labour-denied-admission-by-5-hospitals/article31975617.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||BJP leadership’s hand visible in M.P. Cabinet expansion||The expansion of the Madhya Pradesh Cabinet on Thursday came more than three months after Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took the oath and demonstrated the rather long shadow that the BJP’s central leadership has cast on the State unit. Of the 28 Ministers who took the oath (20 as Cabinet Ministers and eight as Ministers of State), the lion’s share went to former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia’s camp. Nine Ministers, all loyalists of Mr. Scindia, were sworn in, as were three other former Congressmen not allied to Mr. Scindia but who defected to the BJP in the same cohort group in February. Mr. Chouhan, who camped in Delhi for more than two days this week to finalise the list, inducted five of his known loyalists (out of nine who had served under him earlier), while scoring a point against BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya by inducting Usha Thakur instead of Ramesh Mendola from Indore who was being pushed by Mr. Vijayvargiya. The whole exercise was undertaken under the shadow of the leadership in Delhi and its stamp on the Cabinet is visible. Mr. Chouhan had tried to get his people in, but came up against two impediments.  According to those involved at the meetings in Delhi to finalise the list, Mr. Scindia was quite firm that his loyalists should be accommodated in large numbers, since that was the main reason he walked out of the Congress in March. The second was the BJP’s central leadership, which saw Mr. Chouhan’s return as Chief Minister as the result of its strategising rather than the Chief Minister’s efforts and therefore felt it was within its authority to have a big say on who got into the Cabinet. Chouhan’s grip As the BJP’s central leadership and Mr. Scindia stood firm at the meetings, the new Cabinet is a mixed bag for Mr. Chouhan. According to those in the know, it reflects what has been on for some time. “Delhi’s hand is quite visible in the appointment of BJP State unit chief V.D. Sharma, a first-term MP, and the inclusion of Narottam Mishra in the first set of Ministers to be sworn in a couple of months ago,” a source said. For 15 years, Mr. Chouhan held the reins of the State unit; with this Cabinet expansion, it is clear that his grip has loosened.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-leaderships-hand-visible-in-mp-cabinet-expansion/article31975638.ece
03 July 2020||Colombo,||No final decision on India’s involvement in Colombo terminal: Rajapaksa||A year after the previous government signed an agreement with India and Japan to jointly develop the East Container Terminal (ECT) in Colombo, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has said “there is no final agreement” on the project. Addressing Tamil media editors on Wednesday, Mr. Rajapaksa said: “It was an agreement between former President Maithripala Sirisena and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But we have not taken a decision on it as yet.” The statement indicates that the project at the strategic port, coveted by India for years and discussed bilaterally at the highest levels, is still far from certain. Development of the ECT has remained contentious in Sri Lanka, with nationalist groups objecting to any “foreign involvement” in running “national assets”. Following much deliberation, Sri Lanka, Japan and India entered a memorandum of cooperation in May 2019, agreeing to jointly develop the terminal at an estimated cost of $700 million. While the Sri Lanka Ports Authority was to retain 100% ownership, a jointly-owned Terminal Operations Company — 51% stake with Sri Lanka, and 49% with India and Japan — was to run the terminal. Over 70% of the transhipment business at the strategically located ECT comes from India. Further, the Colombo-based weekend newspaper Sunday Times recently reported that the Adani group is in talks with John Keells Holdings, one of Sri Lanka’s largest conglomerates, exploring a possible partnership in the project. Controversy around the ECT is not new. The development of the terminal was a major flash point between former President Sirisena and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Mr. Wickremesinghe took the position that developing the terminal would help Sri Lanka emerge a shipping hub in the region, while Mr. Sirisena resisted any “foreign involvement” in managing “national assets”. The ECT is adjacent to the Colombo International Container Terminal, which is a joint venture between China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited and the Ports Authority, with the Chinese company holding 85% stake. India and China’s competing geopolitical interests in the island are well known, but India-backed projects have often seen more vocal protest. Over the last few days, port workers protested against “Indian pressure” preventing Sri Lanka from developing its deep-sea container terminal. On Thursday, they called off the protest, after PM Rajapaksa promised to hold discussions. The leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna too has voiced strong opposition of Indian involvement. “They say it’s only the operations that will be shared. Have we come to a point where we can’t operate our ports?” party general secretary Tilvin Silva asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-final-decision-on-indias-involvement-in-colombo-terminal-rajapaksa/article31975648.ece
03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,||Faith is no bar for some in performing last rites||With cases of the kin of deceased COVID patients or those who died with coronavirus-like symptoms, facing stigma and difficulties in performing their last rites coming to light, members of the civil society have come forward to liaise with the authorities concerned and facilitate burials or cremations. Humanity calls What is heartening is that this is being done irrespective of the faith to which the deceased belong. For instance, Youth Welfare Telangana, an NGO led by businessman Syed Jalaluddin Zafar has helped in burials and cremations of several bodies over the past few weeks. A resident of Chandrayangutta, the 38-year-old says, “Most of the bodies were taken for burials to the Faqeer Mullah graveyard, a large portion of which has been earmarked for coronavirus patients. Others have been cremated in Santosh Nagar and Ameerpet.” It was a little over a fortnight ago, Mr. Zafar says, that his friend’s father, who was COVID positive, passed away. The stigma associated with the virus is such that it frightened the patient’s son and he kept away from the funeral. “It was an unfortunate incident and that is when we decided to facilitate burials after getting in touch with the management of Faqeer Mullah graveyard. We ensure that PPE kits are worn and all precautions are taken as per government guidelines, and the namaz-e-janaza is offered. We had met Health Minister Eatala Rajender, nearly a week ago, with other organisations and informed him of our work. The biggest challenge is getting ambulances to transport the bodies. There is waiting time of two or three hours,” he says. Service in hand It was due to similar reasons that Sai Teja and a group of techies embarked on ‘Serve the Needy’, a project launched to perform the last rites of COVID patients. “My friend’s mother, who was tested positive, died at a private hospital a week ago. His family was quarantined. The family was not allowed to leave the house and we decided to take it up,” Mr. Teja says. As a pilot project, ‘Serve the Needy’ will now focus on the Cyberabad area and last rites of the deceased, irrespective of which faith they belong, will be facilitated. Much like Mr. Zafar, Mr. Teja too notes that arranging an ambulance remains a pressing issue. “We had to pay Rs. 20,000 for the ambulance and were not given any bill. At such a time, there is a need for empathy. Unfortunately, this was missing,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/faith-is-no-bar-for-some-in-performing-last-rites/article31975719.ece
03 July 2020||Hyderabad,||Man kills friend’s daughter, slits own throat in Telangana||A five-year-old girl was killed by her mother’s friend at Vihar Colony of Pocharam in Ghatkesar here on Thursday. After slitting the girl’s throat, Karunakar, an unemployed youth, attempted to kill himself in the same manner, police said. The accused and the victim’s mother Anusha had been known to each other’s family for a long time. Common friend According to the Ghatkesar police, the offence took place around 12.30 p.m. When Karunakar went to Anusha’s house, he saw their common friend Rajashekar there and lost his temper. He suspected her fidelity and picked up an argument with Anusha and Rajashekar, before attacking them. “In defence, Anusha tried to push him into a room where the girl Aadhya was sitting. Soon, he picked a sharp object and slit her throat. Karunakar attacked Rajashekar with the same weapon,” the investigators said. Anusha rushed Aadhya to a hospital where she was declared brought dead. Karunakar alleged that Anusha had an extra-marital affair with him. However, her husband Kalyan, panchayat secretary to Atmakur mandal, said the accused was levelling false allegations. “The mother is not able to validate anything and the accused is in the hospital. The husband does not suspect anything,” said Malkajgiri DCP Rakshitha K. Murthy. Kalyan came to know about the offence only after police informed him.

03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Priyanka may shift base to Lucknow||The Union government’s decision to ask Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to vacate her Lodhi Road bungalow in New Delhi has “speeded” the process of the Congress general secretary shifting her base to Lucknow, party sources said on Thursday. A senior leader told The Hindu that Ms. Vadra would be “spending more time” in Lucknow as the party’s in-charge for Uttar Pradesh, but declined to comment on reports of her “permanently shifting base”. Uttar Pradesh Congress leaders, however, insisted that the move was planned before the Centre’s notice, but the COVID-19 pandemic halted it. They said the vacant house of former Union Minister and Indira Gandhi’s maternal aunt, late Sheila Kaul, in Lucknow was being readied. “ Priyankaji is already spending time in Uttar Pradesh, but now she will be spending more time as the [Assembly] election is not too far away,” the senior leader said. At an official briefing, senior spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi avoided a direct answer, but accused the Centre of resorting to “trickery” to take away her bungalow. Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal said the decision reflected the government’s “deep hatred for the Nehru-Gandhi family”. “The path for a national revival of the @INCIndia is via Uttar Pradesh,” Karti Chidambaram, MP, tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/priyanka-may-shift-base-to-lucknow/article31975642.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Efforts on to start international flights||Consensus building is on between India and other countries to create travel bubbles for resumption of international flight operations, Airports Authority of India (AAI) Chairman Arvind Singh said on Thursday. “The Civil Aviation Ministry is in constant touch with different countries and is working on a consensus to start international flights. These are going to be bubbles between India and the U.S., Canada, Europe as well as Gulf countries so that flights can be mutually started,” Mr. Singh said at a webinar. He said there was a possibility that flights might start in July and therefore, Indian airports needed to be ready. “The earlier we unlock the quicker we will be able to start our journey to normalisation of aviation. While VB [Vande Bharat] has helped to bring stranded Indians back, if we can start normalisation of outbound international flights, it will help those Indians who need to leave to rejoin their jobs in different countries,” said IATA’s Country Director for India, Amitabh Khosla.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/efforts-on-to-start-international-flights/article31975659.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||ICAI tells SC that it will assess feasibility of holding CA exams||The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) on Thursday said certain “operational problems” have cropped up in the conduct of the exams in July and August owing to the huge increase in COVID-19 cases, especially in Maharashtra. Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, heading a three-judge Bench, reminded senior advocate Ramji Srinivasan, for the ICAI, of the court’s premonition that the ground situation was constantly changing. “We had said the situation was dynamic than static,” he said. Mr. Srinivasan said, “If it is possible to hold the exam, we will do it.” He urged the court for more time to assess the situation. The court adjourned the hearing to July 10. On June 29, the court asked the ICAI to come up with a fresh draft notification allowing students to opt out of the exam without running the risk of being marked as having failed in the papers they missed out owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The court also asked the institute to permit students to change their exam centres “till the end”. The court gave these directives because of the changing situation, with more containment zones declared nationwide. The court also asked the ICAI to follow the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs for the safe conduct of the exams. Mr. Srinivasan said there were 500 examination centres. He said 3.46 lakh students were taking the exams scheduled between July 29 and August 16. Of these, 2.89 lakh had opted in and 52,000 opted out.

03 July 2020||New Delhi,||ED again records Patel’s statement||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday recorded the statement of senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel at his residence for the third time in the Sterling Biotech Limited case. Denying any link between Mr. Patel and the case, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said: “Frustration and political vendetta is writ large. Its links are traceable from the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Gujarat connection to Mr. Ahmed Patel.” Mr. Singhvi said: “They [the BJP] have not been able to digest the fact that they have not been able to browbeat Mr. Patel or other Congress functionaries. The rules and instruments of oppression available with the government are being blatantly misused to harass.” The ED had first questioned Mr. Patel on June 27. The investigation is based on one of the two FIRs registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation against Sterling Biotech and others in October 2017. One case alleges routing of undeclared funds belonging to unknown Income-Tax Department officials, while the second case pertains to alleged bank loan defaults to the tune of Rs. 8,100 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-again-records-patels-statement/article31975680.ece
03 July 2020||Ghaziabad,||Bid to turn Shivalik forest into tiger reserve||The Saharanpur Divisional Commissioner has sent a proposal to the Uttar Pradesh government to declare the Shivalik forest in the Saharanpur circle a tiger reserve. The State government is actively considering the proposal and would push it forward to the Centre to take a call, sources said. If accepted, it would be the fourth tiger reserve in Uttar Pradesh after Amangarh in Bijnor, Pilibhit and Dudhwa in Lakhimpur-Kheri. Safe movement Chief conservator of forests, Saharanpur division, V.K. Jain told The Hindu, “The move would not only reduce the increasing man-animal conflict but also help nurture the rich biodiversity of the region. The forest constitutes the northern tip of the State and the 33,220-hectare-long corridor, located at the foothills of the Shivalik range, connects four States — Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. It will facilitate safe movement of tigers,” he said. With the rising tiger population, there is an increase in the number of clashes between tigers to protect their territory, he said. “The weaker ones often move into sugarcane fields where they can easily hide. But it increases the chances of human-animal conflict. In such a scenario, it is necessary to increase the area for movement of tigers.” As the Uttarakhand government is proposing to relocate tigers from Corbett to Motichur range of the Rajaji National Park, the Shivalik forests in Saharanpur would be suitable for their movement, said Mr. Jain. “The topography of the forests is similar to that of the Rajaji National Park. In fact, the area is rich in biodiversity and could be turned into a hub for eco-tourism. No tiger has been sighted in the region for the last 10 years, but we have counted at least 50 leopards in the forests.” It was during one such camera-trap survey to count the leopard and deer population that Mr. Jain and a team of the World Wide Fund for Nature came across a piece of fossil of Stegodon in a sandstone rock. “We took it to the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) where the scientists confirmed that it belonged to the predecessor of the modern-day elephant,” claimed Mr. Jain. WIHG scientist R.K. Sehgal, who inspected the piece of the fossil, described it as the first of its kind found in the region. “What we have found is mandibular ramus of Stegodon from the Middle Shiwalik sediments. In simple terms, it is the molar of the lower jaw of an extinct elephant. Pieces of fossil of Stegodon have been found in Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh. It is around 5-6 million years old.” Dr. Sehgal said, “It suggested that the area was a dense forest with prominent riverine systems.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bid-to-turn-shivalik-forest-into-tiger-reserve/article31975910.ece
03 July 2020||Bengaluru,||Shivakumar takes charge as PCC chief||Congress leader and seven-time MLA D.K. Shivakumar on Thursday took charge as president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee and pledged to bring about a ‘BJP-mukt Karnataka’. Addressing party workers after receiving the party’s flag from immediate past-president and MLA Dinesh Gundu Rao, Mr. Shivakumar said his and the party’s goal is to bring the Congress to power on its own in the State. Mr. Shivakumar, who administered the party “Pratijna” to the party workers, said “Pratijna Dina is aimed at strengthening the Congress organisation and empowering karyakartas in the State. A step towards ensuring that the voice of the worker is the voice of the party.” He said the party under his leadership would take several steps to transform it from a mass-based party to a cadre-based one. A model adopted by the Kerala Congress would be adopted here to develop the party’s strong roots at the booth level, he said, while remarking that: “even the biggest leaders should represent the booth.” The Congress leader recalled the days he had spent in Tihar jail and said “many felt that my political career had ended after the BJP targeted me. But Sonia Gandhi came to the jail and spoke to me for an hour and assured that she was with me. She has now made me stand here as a party worker and I take this role as my duty,” Mr. Shivakumar said. In his 30-minute address, he said: “Joining together is the beginning, thinking together is the progress and working together is the success. I strongly believe in collective leadership.” A short documentary on Mr. Shivakumar’s political growth till becoming the KPCC president was screened on the occasion. The event began with homage being paid to 20 Indian soldiers, who were killed in a face-off with the Chinese troops in Galwan valley in Ladakh last month. Lakhs of party workers took part in the mega virtual event and former Union Minister K. Rahman Khan read out the Preamble of the Indian Constitution to party leaders and workers. AICC general secretary in-charge of Karnataka K.C. Venugopal, veteran leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah spoke and lashed out at the Narendra Modi government for the alleged poor handling of economic, health, and job issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shivakumar-takes-charge-as-pcc-chief/article31975614.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Give custodial death details: NHRC to J&K||The National Human Rights Commission on Thursday said it had asked the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to inform it of any custodial death within 24 hours, and any encounter death within 48 hours, a requirement for all States and Union Territories. The erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir had been exempted from this rule. In a statement, the NHRC said its Secretary General Jaideep Govind had written to the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Secretary and Ladakh Commissioner Secretary on Tuesday requesting them to issue suitable orders. The Union Territories were asked to send all post-mortem reports, videography, magisterial enquiry reports etc. to the NHRC in all cases of custodial and encounter deaths. Mr. Govind said the State of Jammu and Kashmir, whose special status was withdrawn and split into two Union Territories in August 2019, was “not under statutory obligation to follow the mandate of the commission by sending intimations.” But after the amendment of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, last year, “there is no prohibition of exercising jurisdiction by the commission like in all other States and Union Territories,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/give-custodial-death-details-nhrc-to-jk/article31975663.ece

With 18,570 cases, Telangana stood eighth in terms of the number of cases across the country. Attendants of COVID-19 suspects admitted at Osmania General Hospital complained that swab samples were not collected from the patients in the past 24 hours. Family member of a suspect admitted at the government hospital on Wednesday night said the samples were not collected till Thursday night. Sources in the hospital confirmed that there was delay in the process as the existing lab technicians were overburdened. “Two of the existing technicians tested positive. Efforts were on to draw staff from other labs. The process will resume from Friday morning,” the sources said. As more suspects are referred from corporate hospitals to OGH, the number of samples are set to increase. Meanwhile, around 350 beds with oxygen ports facility will be added to District Hospital, King Koti.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/telangana-records-new-high-in-covid-19-cases/article31975962.ece
03 July 2020||KOTTAYAM,||Will prefer to stay alone, says Jose K. Mani faction||Amidst Left Democratic Front (LDF) feelers and United Democratic Front (UDF) peace efforts, the Kerala Congress (M) faction led by Jose K. Mani on Thursday sought to dispel all speculation about any plans to switch sides and reiterated that the party would rather stand on its own. Addressing mediapersons here, Mr. Mani expressed gratitude over the remarks made by CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan acknowledging the Mani faction of the KC(M) as a party with a mass base. “We, however, are yet to initiate discussions on whether to align with any side or not,” he said. Earlier in the day, P.J. Joseph, who heads the other KC(M) faction, accused Mr. Mani of deliberately moving out of the UDF with an eye on some other aim. Joseph’s charge “To say that they were expelled from the coalition is not right. They have left on their own and nobody is sure about the direction they are heading. The UDF, however, is ready to accept the party if they fall in line and facilitate a change of guard in the Kottayam district panchayat,” he said. To a query on whether the coalition would move a no-confidence motion in the local body, he replied in the affirmative and described the delay in moving the motion as a strategy. At the same time, he claimed that workers, including elected representatives, from the Mani group were abandoning the faction to join his side. “Their base is fast eroding and more people are set to come out of it in the coming days,” Mr. Joseph said, in an oblique reference to the remark made by the CPI(M) State secretary. Party base Amidst speculation about more leaders leaving the faction, the Mani group has commenced all-out attempts to keep the party base intact by holding meetings at the grassroots level to convey the party’s stance. ‘ The move comes at a time when the praise heaped by the CPI(M) leaders on the Mani group appears to have left its rank and file confused about the faction’s future course of action. According to sources, several of the party workers in UDF bastions across Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Idukki districts prefer to stay away from the LDF.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-prefer-to-stay-alone-says-jose-k-mani-faction/article31975621.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||India loses jurisdiction over Italian marines case||However, a majority of the court’s five-member bench ruled 4-1 that the marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, rejected the Indian plea, finding that they held immunity. According to the Italian government, the marines were “State officials exercising official functions”. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, “The tribunal observed that India and Italy had concurrent jurisdiction over the incident and a valid legal basis to institute criminal proceedings against the marines. However, it found that the immunities enjoyed by the marines as State officials operate as an exception to the jurisdiction of the Indian courts and, hence, preclude them to judge the marines. India has taken note of the award and will be in touch with relevant entities on the matter.” The Italian government, which was the plaintiff, said it would carry out the decision of the arbitration court “in a spirit of cooperation” with India. As a result, Italy will resume its criminal investigation into the ‘Enrica Lexie’ case, while India “is required” to cease exercising its jurisdiction on the marines. The tribunal also held that India was entitled to compensation “in connection with loss of life, physical harm, material damage to property [including to “St. Antony”] and moral harm suffered by the captain and other crew members, as Italy had breached India’s freedom of navigation rights. It also struck down Italy’s claim that the marines, who had been kept mostly at the Italian Embassy in New Delhi before being repatriated by the government in September 2014 and 28 May 2016, were entitled to any compensation at all. ‘A cold-blooded murder’ “What happened was a cold-blooded murder, and the marines were given 7-star treatment [in India]”, said senior advocate K.N. Balagopal, who appeared for Kerala in the case before the Supreme Court in the matter. “Compensation is anyway granted in such cases; the marines should have stood trial in our courts for the crime committed”, he added. He called the verdict less than a victory “though there is some vindication to an extent”.

However, the CB-CID police team, which was following him, intercepted the vehicle minutes later and arrested him. “Even though he claimed to the CB-CID team that he was close to an AIADMK Minister, he was detained and taken to Thoothukudi around 4 a.m.,” police sources said. Chief judicial magistrate Hema remanded inspector Sridhar, sub-inspector Balakrishnan and head-constable Murugan in judicial custody till July 16. Another CB-CID team nabbed Mr. Balakrishnan and Mr. Murugan. Though constable Muthuraj has also been cited as an accused in this case, he is yet to be arrested. He is expected to become an “approver”, according to police sources. Mr. Raghu Ganesh, who was presented before the chief judicial magistrate past midnight, was remanded in judicial custody till July 16. He was then lodged in the Peroorani sub-jail, near Thoothukudi.

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Nod for 33 fighter jets in deals worth Rs. 38,900 cr.||“While the MiG-29 procurement and upgrade from Russia is estimated to cost Rs. 7,418 crore, the Su-30 MKI will be procured from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) at an estimated cost of Rs. 10,730 crore,” the Defence Ministry said in a statement. This would shore up the squadron strength of the IAF’s fighter fleet, it added. The 21 MiG-29s had been partially manufactured by Russia for an unfulfilled order and would now be upgraded and delivered to India. These would add to the three of their squadrons in service that were undergoing an upgrade. The 12 Su-30 MKIs were meant to replace the aircraft that had crashed over the years. India has in different batches contracted 272 Su-30 from Russia, a majority of which have been licence-manufactured by HAL. The IAF currently has 30 fighter squadrons against a sanctioned strength of 42. It will start adding the first batch of Rafale multi-role jets this month-end. Another deal for 83 Light Combat Aircraft Mk-1A, estimated to cost Rs. 38,000 crore, is expected to be signed in the next two months. Both leaders discussed Mr. Putin’s upcoming trip to India, expected in October, and the strategic partnership, according to releases from the Ministry of External Affairs and the Kremlin. The announcement of the clearance for Russian hardware and conversation between the leaders came amid indications that New Delhi and Moscow are cooperating more closely on strategic ties as a result of the tension with China along the LAC. According to sources, Russia has “assured” India of all its requirements of defence supplies in the near future. The Defence Ministry said the acquisition of the Pinaka missile systems would help to raise additional regiments over and above those inducted by the Army. Addition of LRLAMS to the existing arsenal would bolster the attack capabilities of the Navy and the IAF, it added. The Nirbhay, a sub-sonic long-range land attack cruise missile, with a range of over 1,000 km, had been under development by the Defence Research and Development Organisation for sometime. The LRLACM will be an upgraded derivative of the Nirbhay, defence sources said. The Ministry said deals other than fighters would be made in India involving indigenous industry, with several Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises as prime-tier vendors for a large number of the projects involving transfer of technology by the DRDO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nod-for-33-fighter-jets-in-deals-worth-rs-38900-cr/article31975629.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||CBI conducts searches in case against G.V.K. Reddy||The CBI has conducted searches in Mumbai and Hyderabad in connection with an alleged corruption case against G.V.K. Reddy, promoter of the GVK Group and whole-time director of the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), and others. “The searches were carried out on the office premises. No one has been questioned so far,” said a CBI official. According to the FIR, the accused persons caused a loss of about Rs. 705 crore to the exchequer. Unknown officials of the Airport Authority of India (AAI) are also under the scanner for ignoring the alleged financial irregularities committed from 2012 to 2018. The MIAL, its MD and Mr. Reddy’s son Venkata Sanjay Reddy, the GVK Airport Holdings Limited and some other private companies have been named in the FIR. The AAI had, as part of the public private partnership, set up a joint venture by the name of MIAL for the modernisation, upgradation and maintenance of the airport. While 50.5% of the shareholding was with the GVK Airport Holdings Limited, 26% was with the AAI and the rest was with foreign entities. The AAI entered into an agreement with the MIAL on April 4, 2006, for the development work at the airport. The FIR alleges that funds were siphoned off by showing the execution of bogus work contracts related to the development of about 200 acres around the airport, which was meant to ensure revenue generation. The work contracts shown to have been given to several private firms were never executed, as alleged. The reserve or surplus funds to the tune of Rs. 395 crore were also allegedly diverted for financing group companies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-conducts-searches-in-case-against-gvk-reddy/article31975646.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan made the suggestion while hearing a petition by the Distress Management Collective, which claimed that many private nursing homes, which total around 1,100 in the capital, were not giving adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits to the healthcare workers. Advocate Manoj V. George, appearing for the Collective, highlighted that there was a need for urgent direction to protect the ‘corona warriors’ against health hazards “due to utter disregard and callousness by the administration”. A helpline could be set up where healthcare workers could anonymously complain if they were not getting the protective equipment, the Bench said. The High Court posted the case for further hearing next week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-suggests-helpline-for-covid-19-health-workers/article31975657.ece

After recording her statement, Ms. Bharti told presspersons she considered the Indian law as good as the Vedas, the court as a temple and the judge sitting in it a Bhagwan ka roop (form of God). Ms. Bharti, a former Chief Minister, however, did not comment on a question on her alleged role in the demolition, citing legal procedure. “I will not comment on what happened there (in court),” she said. The special court is in the process of recording the statements of the accused in the demolition case, which includes many senior members of the BJP and VHP, after the closing of the evidence by the prosecution. Ms. Bharti's lawyer Mankeshwar Tripathi told presspersons that she pleaded innocent and dismissed the charges against her. “When she had no role, when there was a conspiracy against her, she had to reject (the charges),” he said.

He said such “dubious” agencies threatened to usurp the administrative process. The Transport Secretary had initiated the move to allow the consultancy into the halls of power. He had penned a report in 2019 that the Secretariat staff lacked creativity and were unfit to meet deadlines. The Finance Department had approved the proposal. Mr. Chennithala said the government had also sanctioned the appointment of three company officials as project manager expert, functional consultant, and technology consultant at a minimum monthly salary of Rs. 3.35 lakhs. Their pay was higher than that of the Chief Secretary. The officials operating from the Secretariat would have unbridled access to government files, he said. ‘Flouting norms’ The government had enlisted the private firm to steer mega projects ignoring cautionary reports from watchdog agencies and legal luminaries. Mr. Chennithala said the government hired consultancies to write tailor-made reports to suit the product and service specifications of global majors they wished to contract for critical infrastructure projects, including the e-mobility scheme. The government had used the pandemic as a cover to nudge contracts in the direction of companies favoured by the political executive by circumventing the process of calling for global tenders and expression of interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/doors-open-for-blacklisted-firms-says-chennithala/article31976026.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Virtue of patience||Patience is a virtue few people have. Being hasty is second nature to most of us. But patience has its rewards, and haste its undesirable consequences. We cannot anticipate the consequences of our actions, and when we do not pay attention to the instructions given by wise men, we end up suffering, said V.S. Karunakarachariar in a discourse. This is what happened to Vinata. Kadru and Vinata were sisters, married to sage Kasyapa. Kadru told the sage that she wanted many sons who would be feared by the world. Vinata said that she wanted two sons who would be more powerful than Kadru’s sons. The sage granted them their wishes. Kadru’s many eggs hatched, and out came venomous snakes. Vinata, as per her wish, had only two eggs, but they took a long time to hatch. Impatient with the delay, Vinata broke one of them and out came a half formed bird. The lower part of its body was underdeveloped, and the child was without thighs. This child was angry at having been brought into the world before it was time for it to emerge. It cursed Vinata, saying she would be Kadru’s slave until the other egg hatched. The son who would emerge out of the other egg would save her from slavery. Vinata became Kadru’s slave and was treated badly. It was something she had brought upon herself through her impatience. Gandhari is another example of an impatient mother. She had a boon to beget 100 sons. When she heard that Kunti had given birth to a son, she was so jealous that she punched her stomach, causing the embryo to drop out. Sorrowful over the loss of her child, Gandhari wept. Vyasa then divided the embryo into 100 pieces and put them in separate vats of ghee. Gandhari wanted a daughter too, so Vyasa made one more division, so that there were 101 pieces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/virtue-of-patience/article31975645.ece

03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,||CCMB to speed up COVID test results||The agonising wait for more than a day for COVID-19 test results is likely to come to an end soon with the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) coming up with an alternative method of testing, where the results would be quicker and more samples could be tested in one go. ICMR permission sought “We have sought permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to allow us to test dry throat swabs in place of the existing ones that are transported in Viral Transfer Medium (VTM) liquid. This will require less packing and can be safely transported. In addition, we suggested skipping RNA isolation step so that the sample can go straight to RT-PCR equipment to get results within hours. Our director general Shekhar Mande, too is pursuing with the regulatory authorities concerned to get this cleared,” disclosed CCMB director Rakesh Mishra. “We have noticed that currently the samples are being sent in several layers of packing for abundant caution with several tapes that is taking a few hours of our precious time to unpack and catalogue before they can be processed further,” he pointed out, in an exclusive interaction. “While delays in declaring the results of swab test samples could be multi-fold, including shortage of trained manpower, the test usually takes 12-14 hours and a maximum of 18 hours. So, normally, the test results should be out within a day. CCMB has been testing around 500 samples sent to its lab by government authorities and this can be scaled up to 1,500 if the ICMR nod comes and results can be given in 5-10 hours,” the director explained. “Time has to come to adopt testing of dry swab samples to increase testing of samples for detection of COVID-19, both by public and private labs. We had earlier advocated pool sample testing where five samples could be tested in one go but we have gone past that stage as it is effective only when the virus positive ratio is less than 5% of samples being tested,” Dr. Mishra said. There is “nothing to be alarmed” about ‘social transmission’ and “we should be taking it in our stride and go for more testing so that we can trace and contain the virus”. There is also nothing wrong about private labs coming into the picture as it only enhances the testing abilities which is the need of the hour. But, qualitative training and following strict protocols should be ensured, he observed. Any planned lockdowns can be pinned down to specific localities with restrictions on movement of people based on the spread of virus which can be known only by largescale testing, affirmed the director.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ccmb-to-speed-up-covid-test-results/article31975966.ece

CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Nilotpal Basu has shot off another letter to the EC, saying the CPI(M) was aware of a meeting called by the Chief Electoral Officer of Bihar where this was one among the many issues that was raised. “In any case, a meeting of the Chief Electoral Officer of a State with State-level political parties is no substitute for dispensing with national-level consultations on a procedure applicable to the entire country,” Mr. Basu wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/larger-parleys-must-on-postal-votes-cpim/article31975674.ece

The patient died hours after his samples were taken on Monday. A relative said the doctor asked the family to wait for the test report. “The doctor said he possibly died of cardiac arrest but since his COVID-19 test report was pending, he would not issue a death certificate. He asked us to preserve the body until the report came in,” the relative said. The family said it approached officials, but no one helped. Hence, it got a freezer to preserve the body.

03 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Highest single-day spike with 4,343 cases||After reporting 3,000-plus COVID-19 cases daily for the past week, Tamil Nadu, for the first time, recorded over 4,000 cases on Thursday. A total of 4,343 persons tested positive for COVID-19, taking the State’s tally to 98,392*. Noting that the State’s recovery rate was 57%, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said that a total of 56,021 persons had been discharged after treatment till now. This included 3,095 persons discharged on Thursday. Another 57 persons died, taking the State’s toll to 1,321. Of the fresh cases, Chennai accounted for 2,027 cases. With this, the city’s tally rose to 62,598. However, of the total 4,270 indigenous cases, the rest of the State reported more cases than the city. The number of cases continued to stay high in Madurai. The district recorded 273 cases, taking its tally to 3,133. Eight other districts — Chengalpattu, Kallakurichi, Kancheepuram, Ramanathapuram, Ranipet, Tiruvallur, Tiruvannamalai and Vellore — saw over 100 cases each. Replying to suggestions and questions put forth by Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin, the Minister said that there was no community transmission in Tamil Nadu. “It is the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that should declare whether there is community transmission or not. The ICMR has already taken up various studies and has said that there is no community transmission in Tamil Nadu till now,” he said. He added that the government had already made arrangements to provide reusable masks through ration shops. A tender was floated by the Revenue Department and supply would start soon, he added. “An order to supply 50 lakh masks to residents of slums in Chennai has already been issued. Of this, 46 lakh masks have been distributed,” he said. Special pay Work to issue an order granting a special one-month pay for doctors and nurses was under way, he added. The Minister said that 75,000 beds were ready across the State, while Chennai alone has 17,500 beds. Government medical college hospitals had 5,000 beds and their capacity was being increased. He added that 93% of testing kits were purchased through State funds. Of the 57 persons who died, 12 had no co-morbidites. Apart from the indigenous cases, 73 persons who returned from other States and countries tested positive for COVID-19. This included 35 people from Karnataka. Except Ariyalur and Namakkal, the remaining 35 districts reported new cases. In the last 24 hours, 33,488 samples were tested in the State. This took the total number of samples tested so far to 12,35,692. Till now, a total of 11,79,649 individuals have been tested in the State.

Vijayabaskar said. The institute, located on the campus of King Institute of Preventive Medicine, will be fully equipped with CT scan, ultra sonogram and digital X-rays, both static and mobile units, he told reporters on Thursday. Mr. Vijayabaskar added that doctors and staff nurses were appointed to manage the facility, while work to install an oxygen tank was in progress. Simultaneously, a 500-bed facility for people who test positive for COVID-19 is getting ready at the Government Hospital for Thoracic Medicine (GHTM), Tambaram. The Minister, along with Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, visited the hospital. More facilities “Infrastructure facilities are being increased in Chennai and neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chengalpattu. A total of 2,827 beds have been readied in Chengalpattu district. A COVID-19 triage centre has been set up at Tambaram so that people need not travel to Chennai or Chengalpattu for screening,” Mr. Vijayabaskar said. Chennai already has 11 COVID-19 screening centres. “We have arranged for 500 beds at GHTM. Of this, 300 beds have oxygen lines.

03 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||People avoiding tests despite scans suggesting infection||Dozens of patients, including some doctors, whose Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealed acute lung involvement, suggestive of viral pneumonia, have refused to undergo COVID-19 tests. Doctors cite fear of being tracked by health workers, contact tracing by the police and the stigma of isolation in neighbourhoods as reasons. Despite having associated symptoms like dry cough, sore throat and fever these patients have chosen not to undergo RT-PCR tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and instead, have decided to quarantine themselves at home. By not undergoing the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-recommended treatment protocol, these patients have not just risked their lives, but have also exposed their families to the infection. A worrying trend “The trend is worrying because we will be missing out on testing their family members, friends and contacts, which is crucial in containing the spread of the virus. If CT-Chest reports reveal lung involvement, the patient must undergo a test for COVID-19. This should be made mandatory and not optional. The State Health Department should send an advisory to all scan centres that if CT-Chest reports indicate viral pneumonia, the authorities concerned must be alerted,” said senior interventional cardiologist D. Prabhakar. Since the Tamil Nadu government allows asymptomatic patients testing positive for COVID-19 to remain under home quarantine, there is no need for anybody to think that they will be hospitalised or isolated in a government facility, he said. “By not disclosing facts and refusing to undergo tests for COVID-19, people who know they have the virus will only be doing more harm to themselves and society,” he said. False negatives While patients with symptoms refusing to undergo COVID-19 tests and walking away from private hospitals or nursing homes is one issue, there is another dimension to pandemic management that has turned a challenge for healthcare professionals — the case of patients getting negative RT-PCR test results. This when their CT scans suggest the infection. According to senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, V. Ramasubramanian, there have been many cases where CT scans and other health parameters have indicated the presence of COVID-19, but RT-PCR test results have returned negative. In such cases, patients have to be convinced that they were infected, so that isolation and treatment protocols can be commenced. “I saw at least two cases in March where RT-PCR tests came out negative but clinically I was fully convinced that the patients had COVID-19. In a more recent case, a patient who underwent a renal transplant tested negative, but the CT scan suggested otherwise. I had to explain to the patients how their clinical diagnosis clearly suggested the presence of the virus. There is no universal standard for COVID-19, there will always be an exception. RT-PCR is only 70% sensitive…we have to consider other health parameters to diagnose,” Dr. Ramasubramanian said. P. Balaji, dean, Government Stanley Medical College Hospital (GSMCH), Chennai, said that when patients presented symptoms of COVID-19, doctors convinced them to undergo an RT-PCR test. “If patients do not cooperate, we contact their family members and explain the necessity for conducting the test for COVID-19. In case they too are not convinced, we involve Chennai Corporation health officials to ensure that the patient undergoes the test. There is no question of allowing a person suspected to be carrying the virus to go untested,” he said. C. Sridhar, head of the Department of Medicine, GSMCH, said that patients who tested negative in RT-PCR tests, but had strong symptoms of COVID-19 like lung involvement or other classic symptoms suggestive of the virus were being admitted to the triage ward until confirmation. “Patients whose RT-PCR test results come out negative, but who have symptoms, are less likely to transmit the virus. However, we take all due precautions to separate them from the others…a follow up is also conducted after their discharge from the hospital,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-avoiding-tests-despite-scans-suggesting-infection/article31975832.ece

Jayaraj, 58, and his son J. Benicks, 31, in Sattankulam. Deny rumours The FoP was founded by Director General of Police (Crime Branch CID) Prateep V. Philip, 25 years ago. FoP State administrator G. Lourduswami said,“There have been a few news reports alleging the involvement of FoP volunteers in the Sattankulam case. We vehemently deny these rumours. We understand that the local police station had enlisted ‘volunteers’ for Corona-related work. They were not members of FoP.” Fake ID cards Referring to media reports about some unauthorised persons infiltrating into FoP with fake identity cards, he said appropriate legal action would be initiated against such suspects who were tarnishing the “fair name” of the organisation. “The law shall take its own course and truth shall come out,” he said in a statement. FoPs were attached at the police station level and there was no evidence that any registered volunteer of the force was part of the Sattankulam police station in Thoothukudi district, he claimed. There was no centralised system of monitoring the activities of FoP volunteers since there are a few thousands of them spread across the State. “The concept is to administer them locally. Now that this incident has happened, we are in the process of having a system where their profile will be stored and updated regularly,” a senior police officer said.

03 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Restore Kadapperi Lake to its original position: NGT||The southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed a joint committee to inspect the Kadapperi Lake in West Tambaram and the Tambaram Municipality to take necessary steps to maintain it so that the water storage capacity of the lake can be increased before monsoon. The bench of Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta took suo motu notice of a report about the lake being polluted. Encroachment The bench noted that the lake, also known as Potheri Lake, originally spanned 65 acres but was reduced to 40 acres due to encroachment. The bench, quoting the report, said the water in the lake has turned green due to the mixing of sewage and plastic waste. With PWD turning a blind eye towards the lake’s restoration, permission was granted to repair it, the bench noted. A proposal submitted by the Tambaram Municipality for desilting the lake at a cost of Rs. 3.50 crore is pending. The bench further said that based on the report that sewage from the Tambaram Municipal area, Tambaram Railway Colony and MTC Workshop gets mixed into the lake, it led to foul and pungent smell resembling the Cooum. Based on this, the bench appointed a joint committee to inspect the lake and if any violation was found, including unauthorised trespassing, untreated sewage being discharged into the lake as per the report, trace the violators and take steps to prevent such discharge. “The committee is also directed to assess the environmental compensation for the damage caused on account of any such illegal activities and fix the responsibility on the persons responsible for the same,” the bench said, adding that the committee should prepare an action-plan for short and long term to protect the water body.”  The committee should prepare an action-plan for short term as well as long term to protect the water body against trespass, pollution and restore the water body to its original position||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restore-kadapperi-lake-to-its-original-position-ngt/article31975807.ece

03 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Class 10 marksheet prep from next week||A majority of schools from Chennai, Chengalpettu, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts are expected to start submitting answer scripts, attendance records and other necessary documents of students for the preparation of Class 10 marksheets from next week, once the lockdown restrictions are lifted. “We will begin submitting the students’ answer scripts and their attendance records once we are able to get to school. Both attendance and mark records have already been entered, through the year, on the EMIS portal, and the data just needs to be verified,” said a government school headmaster. In other districts, both government and private schools are in the process of submitting student attendance records and marks from their quarterly and half-yearly exams. The Directorate of Government Examinations has sent circulars with formats as well as necessary top-sheets that need to be affixed on the answer scripts that are being submitted. Following the cancellation of the Class 10 public exams, the State government had announced that marksheets would be prepared, taking into consideration half-yearly and quarterly marks and attendance records of students. Several teachers’ associations have, however, appealed to the School Education Department that a grading system be used, instead of mentioning marks on the final marksheet. “A grading system will ensure that there is some sort of moderation. There is generally a marked improvement in a student’s performance in the board exams when compared to the quarterly and half-yearly exams, and we feel that mentioning their grades will be more appropriate,” said P.K.

03 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Dealers ask oil company to stop scheme||Petroleum dealers in the State have written to the State-level oil industry coordinator, complaining of an oil company’s customer loyalty programme, called ‘Corona Warriors Xtra Rewards’, where fuel outlet owners and pump attendants were allegedly asked to canvass customers for the scheme, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The programme involves registering basic details of customers, including their e-mail IDs, on an app and linking their phone numbers so that they can earn redeemable points. “In the process, attendants have to stand close to the customer to get an OTP and enter their phone number. The attendant gets Rs. 10 for every customer who agrees to register. The SOP issued by oil companies to be followed during the pandemic said no such schemes should be run. But the company is going against its own orders,” said K.P. Murali, president, Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers’ Association. Association secretary Hyder Ali said that dealers were being threatened and told to meet daily targets, especially in the Coimbatore region. “If targets are not met, we are not given usual privileges like the credit facility to make payments. We are already struggling due to lack of business. We do not mind loyalty programmes, but this puts the lives of attendants at risk, unnecessarily. We want the company to withdraw it,” he said. The scheme has been in operation from June and has been extended for July. Company sources said that it was a pan-India scheme being monitored and implemented from Mumbai. The phrase ‘Corona Warriors’ was being dropped, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dealers-ask-oil-company-to-stop-scheme/article31975837.ece
03 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘We have borrowed heavily to pay salaries to staff’||The State government on Thursday told the Madras High Court that it had received representations from the Consortium of Self-Financing Professional, Arts and Science Colleges in Tamil Nadu as well as the All-India Private Educational Institutions’ Association on the issue of determining the fees that could be collected by them from school and college students. Justices R. Subbiah and Krishnan Ramasamy were told by Advocate General (A-G) Vijay Narayan that representations had been received on the basis of orders passed by Justice R. Mahadevan early this week to find a solution to the issue by balancing the interests of parents who could not pay and institutions which had to disburse salaries to their staff. The submission was made during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition which sought strict implementation of a government order (G.O.) passed in April this year, directing private educational institutions not to indulge in forcible collection of fees during the lockdown. The A-G told the court that colleges and schools had challenged the same G.O. before a single judge. Viable solution During the hearing of those cases, Justice Mahadevan had directed the government to hear their grievances and come up with a viable solution such as permitting the institutions to collect fees in instalments. Accordingly, the associations had made their representations and the government would take a final call on the issue by Monday or Tuesday, he said. In its representation, the consortium of self-financing colleges stated that its members had borrowed money heavily to pay salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff for the months of March, April, May and June. It said that colleges would be put to insurmountable difficulties if they were not allowed to collect fees now for the academic years 2019-20 and 2020-21. It suggested that the government could allow self-financing schools to collect fees in three instalments and the self-financing colleges to collect fees in two instalments semester wise. “Only the tuition fees fixed by the fees fixation committee will be collected by the institutions affiliated to the petitioner association,” the consortium said. On its part, the All Indian Private Educational Institutions’ Association sought permission to collect fees for the academic year 2020-21 in three equated instalments in the months of August, December and April. “Last year’s pending tuition fees can be collected from the parents without any hue and cry from the parents,” it added. It also wanted the government to help them obtain a moratorium till December for the loans availed by them from banks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/we-have-borrowed-heavily-to-pay-salaries-to-staff/article31975839.ece

03 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||More local workers get jobs on Metro site||With a large number of migrant workers leaving the city after the lockdown was enforced, Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL), depends more on local workers. The work on phase I extension project in north Chennai has been on but with a minimal workforce owing to the lockdown. Sources working on the project said for the past few weeks now, they had become more dependent on local labourers near the project as a majority of migrant workers had gone home. “We can’t stop those who wanted to return home. So we decided to employ local labourers here. In the place of nearly 300-400 workers now, we have 100-120 now in our site. Of this, nearly 50% are local labourers in our site,” an official engaged in the project said. Another issue is that although some migrant workers are still available, it is a challenge to bring them from their camp to the work site owing to the lockdown and to get an e-pass for the same. “We have got some local labourers who are doing a fine job so far. Going forth, for a while, we may have to depend on them. It is not clear when the migrant workers would come back,” another official said. Safety norms Meanwhile, sources said they had been trying to get migrant workers from a few States such as Odisha but getting permission and arranging transportation were posing a challenge. Workers had been given masks and sanitisers on the sites and they check the temperature of workers every day. According to officials of CMRL, they had been trying to keep the work going with the existing labour force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-local-workers-get-jobs-on-metro-site/article31975796.ece

03 July 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Death registration delayed as more frontline workers test positive||With a rise in the number of COVID-19 positive frontline workers, including sanitary inspectors, Greater Chennai Corporation has been unable to carry out death registration on time. According to Corporation officials, at least five workers in each of the 15 zones have started testing positive for COVID-19 every day. Many of the positive civic workers are sanitary inspectors who have the statutory authority for death registration after accepting the mortal remains from hospital authorities in the presence of relatives, officials said and added that work has been disrupted in the past few days owing to a rise in the number of COVID-19 positive employees. Residents, whose family members have died of COVID-19, said the civic body was delaying the process of death registration, claiming that there was inadequate manpower. The mortal remains of the those who passed away in hospitals have been handed over to the families after a delay in many areas, sources said. Meanwhile, civic workers have requested the Corporation to provide PPE kits. Counselling Also, a few civic workers who have been in COVID-19 squads have required counselling. For instance, an employee posted in a COVID-19 squad had experienced sleep deprivation for seven days. He started to show unusual behaviour at work, persistently shouting at residents to wear masks and maintain physical distancing, displaying aggression. His condition improved only after he was given rest, counselled and provided medication, sources said. On Thursday, the Corporation reported an increase in COVID-19 positive cases with a case fatality rate of 1.53%. The case fatality rate in zones such as Tiruvottiyur and Teynampet has crossed 2%. Senior officials said alternative arrangements to post civic workers and volunteers have been made. “Many sanitary inspectors are recovering. They will join duty shortly,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/death-registration-delayed-as-more-frontline-workers-test-positive/article31975809.ece

In a statement, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said that the State government would provide financial assistance of Rs. 3,000 a month for each of these young advocates for two years. Every law student, who completed education from his/her college had to appear in a national-level exam before registering in the Bar Council, he pointed out. These young advocates had to train under a senior counsel for two to three years. Those from rural and economically weak background needed at least three to four years to complete education and to practice. “While some are under severe economic stress during this period, some tend to look for other occupations unable to sustain themselves," Mr. Palaniswami contended. He recalled that former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran had launched a scheme to assist children of deceased advocates in 1987.

03 July 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Elephant shot dead near Mettupalayam||A female wild elephant, aged around 35, was gunned down by two siblings, who are farmers, near Mettupalayam in the Coimbatore Forest Division limits on Wednesday night. A bullet fired from a country-made rifle pierced through the left ear of the elephant and was retrieved from its brain during the post-mortem. Autopsy findings suggested that the jumbo could have been shot in the past as it had an old wound on its shoulder, from which two steel pellets were removed. It is suspected that the elephant was the mother of a calf aged under one year. The calf was seen in the forest periphery along with a few other elephants when the carcass was found on land belonging to the Public Works Department (PWD) at Kandiyoor on Thursday morning. District Forest Officer D. Venkatesh said that G. Ramasamy, 55, and his brother G. Krishnasamy, 66, of Thekkampatty, both farmers, shot the elephant at Kandiyoor. “Their motive was not poaching as it was a female elephant. The country-made rifle which they used to shoot the animal has been recovered,” he said. The two reportedly confessed to Forest Department officials that they shot the elephant to protect their crops raised on leased land. According to Forest Department sources, four female elephants, a male elephant and a calf strayed on to the PWD land at Kandiyoor late on Wednesday. Second death On Thursday, another female elephant, aged about 20, was found dead within the limits of the Sirumugai forest range. The elephant was ailing for about a week before it died. With the deaths of the two elephants, the number of elephants that died in Coimbatore Forest Division since January this year rose to 14, of which seven were from the Sirumugai range. N.I. Jalaludheen of Nature Conservation Society, a Coimbatore-based non-governmental organisation, said that an expert committee should be formed to study the reasons for elephant deaths in places along the migratory path that ranges between Wayanad in Kerala and Hasanur in Erode district during mating season this year.  Tusker electrocuted Meanwhile, a tusker was electrocuted on the premises of a private resort at Masinagudi in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) on Thursday. L.C.S. Srikanth, Deputy Director of MTR, said the tusker, aged 16-18, had ventured into the resort, Bamboo Banks, and was eating bamboo shoots inside the property when a power cable snapped and fell on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elephant-shot-dead-near-mettupalayam/article31975842.ece

An official in the department said some mails were still sent through trains that were operated on alternate days. However, there were six vehicles that go to Udhagamandalam, Pollachi, Tiruppur and Chennai on a daily basis. Registered goods and Speed Posts were given priority to be transported through these vehicles. Earlier, all mails and parcels to Tiruppur were sent through train. Similarly, the vehicle that used to go to Madurai catered to Pollachi. Now, there were dedicated vehicles to Madurai, Pollachi and Tiruppur. There was a proposal to have a vehicle to Bengaluru regularly. Some mails were “forward mails” that need not be processed here. These came from other cities and were to be moved to another location from Coimbatore. So these were kept at the Railway junction front yard and sent by trucks or vans. The mails and parcels booked here were processed and transported by both, train and vehicles, the official added. “The lockdown has not impacted the Department’s parcel or mail service because of the introduction of the Road Transport Network. With dedicated vehicles that operate on a daily basis, it is easy to move goods and mails from here and bring them from other places to Coimbatore too,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/india-post-uses-road-network-more-to-move-parcels-mails/article31975869.ece
03 July 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Wind energy producers facing challenges||For the wind energy producers in Tamil Nadu, low capacity utilisation at industries and reduced consumption of energy is posing challenges this windy season. Winds pick up in the State usually in May and go on for four months or so. K. Kasthurirangaian, chairman of the Indian Wind Power Association, said winds were good this year. With economic slowdown and COVID-19 spread, the industries were seeing a fall in demand. Hence, industries were unable to consume the energy generated fully. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy had issued guidelines for roll over of last year’s renewable energy generation to this year and this year’s to next year. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission should confirm this for the State. Some industries used the wind energy generated completely for captive use and some sold the surplus energy to other industries. There were also wind energy producers who sold all the energy generated. “We have no option now, but have roll over. We expect the TNERC to grant approval for it and Tangedco to follow it,” he said. Further, evacuation now was at about 85 %. “We give wind energy generation forecast. There should be load forecast too for better evacuation,” he said. A.D. Thirumoorthy, State-level Renewable Energy Committee Member, said energy consumption by industries and commercial establishments had reduced drastically. Industries were operating at just about 50 % capacity. So, all the wind energy producers had excess energy generated with them. “If the roll over is not implemented, the energy generated will be lost,” he said. Mr. Kasthurirangaian urged the wind energy producers to share details on dues pending and wind energy generated on the PRAAPTI website that was launched by the Central Government recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wind-energy-producers-facing-challenges/article31975871.ece

A few bad apples here and there should not be a reason to condemn the entire force of around 1.25 lakh police personnel in the State, who were already in the forefront battling the COVID-19 pandemic, it added. The wellness programme should continue because public security can be ensured only if the police force is physically, mentally and morally strong. The judges took note of the arrest of four Sattankulam police personnel by the CB-CID and the submission by Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian that Head Constable Revathy, a key witness in the case, was granted paid leave for a month and four constables were deployed at her house for security. CB-CID Investigating Officer Anil Kumar submitted that the state had provided sufficient infrastructure to conduct the investigation. The court permitted him to collect and examine forensic documents in the case. Taking note of the fact that the Thoothukudi Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) had nomiated the Judicial Magistrate-I, Kovilpatti, for handling CB-CID cases in the district, the judges said taht a case of this gravity has to be dealt with by a judicial officer of the rank of a Subordinate Judge. “We are of the view that the CJM should exercise the powers of the Judicial Magistrate-I Kovilpatti, in this case,” it said. The CJM is the head of Magistracy in the district and there is absolutely no bar for him to exercise the powers of a Judicial Magistrate functioning within his jurisdiction. Consequently, the High Court under Section 407 Cr.P.C. directed the transfer of the custodial death case from the file of the Judicial Magistrate-I, Kovilpatti, to the file of the CJM. The Judicial Magistrate shall complete the enquiry and send the original enquiry report with all the connected records to the CJM, who, in turn, shall furnish copies of the same to the Investigating Officer. The court directed the Deputy Director of Prosecution, Tirunelveli Range, to provide legal guidance to the investigating team and also to appear for the CB-CID in the enquiries before the CJM and in the proceedings before the Court of Session, Thoothukudi, to deal with bail applications and the like. During the course of the hearing, it was submitted that atleast 5 % of the police personnel were under extreme stress and suicidal thought would be identified and arrested through the NIMHANS programme. The training programme has yielded positive results and it was the women police personnel who had shown more interest in the specialised training programmes. Dr. C. Ramasubramaniam, the State Nodal Officer for the Wellenss Programme submitted that the stress levels of the police personnel was enormous. Another case The court noted that it had earlier directed the CJM, Thoothukudi, to conduct an enquiry with regard to the injuries sustained by one Raja Singh, an inmate of the Sub Jail, Kovilpatti. After completing the enquiry, if the CJM is of the opinion that a full-fledged police investigation is required into the matter, she may direct the jurisdictional Station House Officer, to conduct the investigation. On such directions, the police shall register an F.I.R. Immediately thereafter, the Superintendent of Police, Thoothukudi, shall transfer the investigation of the case to the DSP, Thoothukudi. The judges then adjourned the case till July 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-asks-tn-to-continue-police-wellness-programme-for-5-years/article31975818.ece
03 July 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Disease burden maximum in city||With 82.6% of active cases in corporation limits, Madurai district’s COVID-19 disease burden is predominantly in urban areas. According to data obtained from the district administration, 1,424 out of 1,725 cases as on June 30 are in corporation limits. Though a majority of the cases are concentrated in densely-populated areas within the corporation, officials say it is a relief that the exponential growth of cases in the last couple of weeks have largely remained within the city and not spilled over to rural pockets. The number of active cases in Madurai’s rural areas is only 301 till June 30. When the first few cases of COVID-19 were reported in Madurai district in March, clusters were seen emerging in areas such as Melur and Kottampatti. However, the disease burden shifted to areas in the corporation. Now, wards like Ellis Nagar, Alwarpuram, Uthangudi, Kannanendhal, Reserve Line, Sundararajapuram and Jadamuni Koil area have all recorded over 20 cases each. In rural Madurai, the maximum concentration of active cases are in areas bordering the city. Madurai West block has 56 cases, Tirupparankundram 48 cases and Madurai East 46 cases. Blocks with lower than 10 cases include Sedapatti (5), T. Kallupatti (7), Alanganallur (8) and Kottampatti (9). No case has been registered in Kallikudi block. Areas like Usilampatti which received a large number of returnees from Dharavi cluster in Mumbai has recorded 29 cases. Collector T. G. Vinay says the high number in Madurai West block can be attributed to the positive cases in Samayanallur and Paravai pockets. “Most were contacts of positive cases and some emerged from the Paravai wholesale vegetable market,” he says. To ensure that blocks with lower than 10 cases maintained the status quo, the district administration has tightened its reins on containment. “Monitoring revenue officers will not permit movement in and out of containment zones. We are trying to prevent a surge in rural areas,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/disease-burden-maximum-in-city/article31976119.ece

Contact tracing, especially in crowded areas of the city, is difficult, but we are doing it with utmost care,” he said. On Thursday morning, however, rumours spread that 50 vendors of the Madhuram ground market tested positive, causing much distress among vendors. “A news channel flashed the information and since then, we have had no customers,” a vendor said. “So far none of the vendors have tested positive. Because of these rumours, their business is hit during these difficult times,” a senior official of the City Corporation said. Meanwhile, health officials lifted a total of 50 samples from the Fort Law & Order and All-Women Police Stations after a policeman from the L&O station tested positive on Wednesday. “There has been a sudden increase in cases in Srirangam zone. To ensure that we are safe, a test was taken on Thursday and the results are awaited,” a police official said. The inspector at the All-Women Police Station said that once all 50 people, including office assistants and other personnel, were tested, Zinc and Vitamin tablets were given to boost immunity. “The stations were disinfected and sanitisers have been kept at various locations,” she said. Meanwhile, Collector S. Sivarasu in a letter to the Commissioner of Revenue Administration and Disaster Management and Mitigation said that as on Thursday, there were 12 containment zones in Tiruchi. The letter encloses details of the containment zones, including total number of houses in each zone and its population.

03 July 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||We expect a good yield, say kuruvai farmers||The area under kuruvai paddy cultivation is expected to go up in canal-irrigated areas in Tiruchi district this year, thanks to timely release of water for irrigation from Mettur Dam. Farmers in Lalgudi, Manachanallur, Musiri and neighouring areas are gearing up for cultivation. While farmers in some filter point areas have already transplanted nurseries, those in other places are busy preparing their fields and raising nurseries. The Agriculture Department expects kuruvai paddy to be raised on about 4,800 hectares in canal-irrigated delta areas of the district this year against last year’s coverage of 3,300 ha. Last year, kuruvai paddy was raised only in filter point areas. “Since water has been released from Mettur Dam as per schedule, we expect the area of coverage to go up. Once water is released fully in irrigation canals, the transplantation is expected to pick up over the next week or so and completed by the end of this month,” a senior officer of the department told The Hindu . Already, transplantation of nurseries has been completed in about 1,200 acres in filter point areas. Officials of Public Works Department say water release will be stepped up to full capacity of irrigation canals in another three days. “The quantum of water from Mettur Dam has been stepped up to 15,000 cusecs on Wednesday and release will be stepped up in canals once water realisation increases here,” said a senior officer of the Public Works Department. Water has been released in all canals except Kattalai High Level Canal (KHLC), New Kattalai High Level Canal and Pullampadi canal. Water release in KHLC has been delayed due to major renovation project taken up on the canal. Water will be released in the other two canals once government orders are issued. Farmers dependent on KHLC are likely to take up samba paddy cultivation only. Sharing the optimism of agricultural officials, N.Veerasekaran, convenor, Ayyan Vaical Pasanatharar Sangam, says farmers are expecting a good kuruvai season this year. “So far, there has not been too many issues and we are expecting a good crop.” The normal average of kuruvai paddy coverage in the district in recent years has been around 4,000 ha. In recent years, the samba paddy season has become the mainstay for the district farmers as the water release from the Mettur Dam. The dam was opened for irrigation in June after a gap of nine years, farmers point out. Āgriculture Department officials also plan to promote the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) technique in about 80% of the targetted area. Officials say adequate quantities of seeds and fertilizers are available in the district to meet the demand.  Kuruvai paddy is expected to raised on another 500 ha in the non delta areas of the district, including in Uppilliyapuram block, the officials add.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/we-expect-a-good-yield-say-kuruvai-farmers/article31976173.ece

03 July 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Free textbooks distributed to all panchayat union schools||The School Education Department has almost completed the process of distribution of free textbooks to schools. The responsibility of delivering the books to panchayat union middle schools was vested with Block Education Officers. Based on the indent obtained earlier from the schools, the textbooks were packed separately for each school and transported in lorries. Monitoring Monitored by Block Education Officers, ministerial staff saw through the delivery of the book packages to every school. Likewise, Distict Education Officers were entrusted with the responsibility of delivering free textbooks to government high and higher secondary schools. The department was on its toes all through the second fortnight of June as the textbooks had to be delivered to all schools before month-end as per agovernment instruction. Unlike a few years ago, when school heads had to assume responsibility for transporting the books from common collection centres to their institutions, the school education department bore the transport expenses. As per the directive, chief educational officers could burden the school heads with the transport expenses, school heads said. There were, however, instances of heads of government aided schools collecting the free textbooks on their own initiative. According to officials, the expenses incurred by the institutions would be reimbursed. Meanwhile, teachers said they were anxious to know the chapters that would be deducted from the textbooks for the first trimester of the new academic year in view of the COVID-19 lockdown. Committee set up The school education ministry had formed a committee to suggest reduction and the initial indications were that 30% to 40 % of the content would be reduced. Acknowledging the delivery of free textbooks, a headmaster of a panchayat union high school in Tiruverumbur Panchayat Union said there was no directive as yet from the school education department on the time schedule for distribution of books to the students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/free-textbooks-distributed-to-all-panchayat-union-schools/article31976164.ece

03 July 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||YouTube helps channel their talent amid lockdown||Students of Holy Cross College have joined hands to become content creators amid the lockdown. The initiative, spearheaded by the students of the Department of Visual Communication is through a YouTube channel named ‘HC Flamingo.’ The idea, as thought out by Principal Sister Christina Bridget, is to educate, empower and inspire, said Shirley Deepak, staff coordinator of the initiative. “We recognise that at this time, all learning is online. So, for our students, and for the public, we wanted to provide education and entertainment through this channel,” she said. The channel was launched on July 1 and within a day, had a total of 3,000 subscribers and 6,000 views on promo videos. A team of 10 students, including three video editors, was formed for this purpose. The team alternates between working from home and from the fully-equipped studio on the college campus, depending on the need. M. Aravind, a second-year postgraduate student in Visual Communication, who is part of the editing team said that the initiative has kept them occupied during the lockdown. “When the Principal introduced the idea, we were all excited and began planning and scheduling video shoots. Then came the lockdown which stalled all our plans,” he said. The channel is going to be a platform for all our students, staff members, and even alumni to showcase their talents, Ms. Deepak said. “We already have a radio show, and now, through the YouTube channel, video content can be shared too,” she said. A congratulatory message from notable personalities was released, as the channel’s first video, on July 1. In the video, Tiruchi MP Su.Thirunavukkarasar, Rajya Sabha MP N. Siva, former Tiruchi Deputy Inspector General V. Balakrishnan, music director James Vasanthan, journalists, doctors and professors can be seen appreciating the new initiative. “COVID-19 cannot be ignored as it has changed all our lives, and so, our first set of videos will revolve around it, as an underlying theme”, Mr. Aravind said. “We have shot interviews with experts, those who recovered from the infection and even those who are severely affected by it,” he said. These videos will be released in a routine manner. The team also plans on releasing short films shot by the students, “do-it-yourself” videos to spend time productively while staying at home and even some educational videos from teachers. “Some students have been making good use of the time at home, cooking, learning arts and crafts and other skills. We will also be encouraging student-reporters, if they want to shoot and send us videos of events in their locality,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/youtube-helps-channel-their-talent-amid-lockdown/article31976181.ece

Revathy, who had testified before the Kovilpatti judicial magistrate, about the custodial torture of trader P. Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks at the Sattankulam police station, and assured her of safety. Revathy’s testimony was among the key factors that prompted the judges to observe two days ago that there was prima facie material to book the accused police personnel for murder. Unprecedented “This is unprecedented in the annals of the judiciary. When the judges spoke to her over phone, they showed much concern and assured her that everyone in her family would get utmost protection. What else would a witness need? It is a great gesture that will encourage everyone to come forward to tell the truth to the world about anything happening against the rights of every human being,” said advocate Henry Tiphagne, executive director of People’s Watch, a human rights group. Revathy was on duty at the police station on the night of June 19 when the father and son were allegedly tortured by other police personnel.  Protection Earlier, Revathy had said: “I told the judicial magistrate the truth and what I actually heard and saw. Though I wanted that what I recorded with the judicial magistrate should not be made public, it has appeared in the media. And, I never thought it would create such an insecure situation for me and my family. I feel that my higher-ups should not disturb me for having deposed and my family should get due protection.” Muster the courage It required a lot of persuasion from various quarters including her children, for her to muster the courage to tell the truth to the magistrate. It was against this backdrop, that the High Court judges spoke to her over phone for about four minutes to instill confidence in her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-judges-speak-to-revathy/article31975821.ece

L.C.S. Srikanth, Deputy Director of MTR, said that the tusker, aged between 16-18, had ventured into the resort, Bamboo Banks, and was eating bamboo shoots inside the property. A power line was passing over the thicket, from the main building to other rooms on the property. It is believed the animal had pulled down the bamboo shoot, which got entangled in the power line and that led to it getting snapped and falling onto the animal, said Mr. Srikanth. Postmortem conducted The Forest Department staff were informed about the death of the animal and they came to the area, where a postmortem was performed on the carcass. Mr. Srikanth said that the carcass would be buried and the tusks removed. He added that staff from Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) had also come to the resort to check on the legality of the power line and also to ascertain if all the rules had been followed with regard to the height of the power line from the ground and other facets. “After verifying the circumstances surrounding the death, it seems that it was purely accidental,” said Mr. Srikanth. Forest officials also said that the resort was not among the facilities that were ordered to be closed down by the Supreme Court located along the elephant corridor in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tusker-electrocuted-inside-resort-at-masinagudi/article31975858.ece

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Elephant gunned down near Mettupalayam, two farmers held||A female wild elephant, aged around 35, was gunned down by two siblings, who are farmers, near Mettupalayam within the limits of Coimbatore Forest Division on Wednesday night. A bullet fired from a country-made rifle pierced through the left ear of the elephant and was retrieved from its brain in the post-mortem examination. Autopsy findings also suggested that the elephant could have been shot before as it had an old wound in its shoulder from which two steel balls (the ones used in ball bearings) were removed. PWD land It is suspected that the elephant was the mother of a calf aged between six months and one year that was stationed in the forest peripheries along with a few other elephants when the carcass was found in a PWD land at Kandiyoor on Thursday morning. District Forest Officer D. Venkatesh said that two farmers - G. Ramasamy (55) and his brother G. Krishnasamy (66) of Thekkampatty - shot the elephant at Kandiyoor. “Their motive was not poaching as it was a female elephant. The country-made rifle which they used to shoot the animal was recovered,” he said. To protect crops The two allegedly confessed to forest officials that they shot the elephant to protect their crops cultivated on a leased land. According to Forest Department sources, four female elephants, a male elephant and a calf strayed from forest into the PWD land at Kandiyoor late on Wednesday. With one female elephant shot, the remaining elephants stationed themselves along the forest boundary. “A team has been assigned to check the movement of the calf to ascertain whether it is the calf of other female elephants in the herd or that of the deceased one,” added Mr. Venkatesh. On Thursday, another female elephant, aged around 20, was found dead within the limits of Sirumugai forest range. The elephant was ailing for about a week before it died. With the deaths of the two elephants, the total number of elephants died in Coimbatore Forest Division since January this year rose to 14, of which seven were from Sirumugai range. N.I. Jalaludheen of Coimbatore-based non-governmental organisation Nature Conservation Society said that an expert committee should be formed to study reasons for increased number of elephant deaths getting reported from places along the migratory path of elephants that ranges between Wayanad in Kerala and Hasanur in Erode district during this year’s mating season. “The committee should study the ecosystem of the landscapes where elephants died and the biology of elephants,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elephant-gunned-down-near-mettupalayam-two-farmers-held/article31975864.ece

N. Sathish Babu, secretary of Pryme Neo Flat Owners’ Association at Surveyor Colony, says people are allowed inside the apartment complex only after their body temperature is checked through thermal scanners. A foot-operated sanitiser dispenser has also been placed at the entrance. “Since it is important to avoid physical contact, we have asked milk suppliers, newspaper delivery and food delivery persons to deliver the products at the entrance. The residents will collect them by following safety precautions,” he said. M. Balaguru, secretary of Shanthi Sadan Owners’ Welfare Association at Kochadai, which has around 550 houses, says their association has formed a separate team of volunteers to buy and deliver products at the doorstep of the elderly, who are a vulnerable population. “We also urge residents to avoid travelling unnecessarily. Even if they travel, we ask them to wear face masks, maintain personal distance and wash their hands frequently,” he says. Members of the associations say they regularly disinfect their premises, including lifts and staircases. Temporary vegetable and grocery shops have been set up inside the complex. “When any positive case is reported, the surrounding area is disinfected frequently. We also ensure that all contacts are tested and remained under home isolation,” says Perrys Mahendra Vel, president of the association at Visthara Residential Enclave at Vilangudi, which has around 750 houses. He says residents are asked to discourage visitors to enter the apartments. “If people from other districts and States enter the premises, we immediately inform the Corporation officials, so that they can be screened. We also recommend them to home quarantine themselves,” he adds. Despite repeated awareness, there are many who do not wear face masks and do not maintain physical distancing when they are outside, says Mr. Balaguru. “One of the main challenges is that residents do not segregate their household waste. Many dump used face masks along with other waste,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/safety-measures-high-at-flats/article31976115.ece

According to an official, the junction sees a lot of accidents regularly and hence, it was decided to take up a project to minimise accidents. A bus bay will be constructed at the junction. And, the existing road will be strengthened. The works will be completed in three months. If a side road joins a national highway, in order to reduce accidents, vehicles should not have direct access to the junction.

Further, the department is doing two flyover works at Koundampalayam and GN Mills on Mettupalayam Rroad. For the last six months it has been doing pile loading tests. About 1200 tonnes of load is tested. The testing was completed successfully at Koundampalayam and at GN Mills the base test is over. The test results will be approved by the Department in Chennai and construction works will take off faster, the official added. On Trichy Road, nearly 55 % of the flyover work has been completed. Of the 113 pillars that will come up as part of the project, works are on for 103. Eight more pillars will come up at Sungam area for the down ramp.

The lockdown has reduced traffic to the reading spot in recent months, but 87-year-old Mr. Subburaj is happy to be at work as one of the three guards who take care of the public library through the day. “My shift starts at 6 a.m. and goes on until 6 p.m., when two other staff come in for the night. We keep an eye on these books, and also see that that the premises is kept clean,” Mr. Subburaj toldThe Hindu. Inaugurated in December 2018 by Tiruchi Corporation at a cost of Rs. 20 lakh, the facility includes covered reading areas with concrete benches and a few chairs for visitors. Approximately 500 books on various topics in English and Tamil are available for on-the-spot reading at the library. Visitors are also welcome to exchange their own reading material with those in the library. Mr. Subburaj and his colleagues are employed by Star Security Force, a private company that is in charge of the library’s daily upkeep. “The visitor numbers have dropped during the lockdown, but we hope they will improve as the situation eases over the next few months,” said R. Selvaraj, proprietor of Star Security Force. “The city needs more open libraries, as they will encourage the reading habit among children,” he said. A former mill worker and tea stall owner, Mr. Subburaj, who lives in Periya Milaguparai area, gets a lift to and from work from his relatives every day. He also helps to guide the people queuing up for free breakfast and lunch at the daily camp run by a social service organisation adjoining the library premises. “Lunchtime can be a bit crowded, and since people are hungry, they tend to get impatient. I tell them to maintain social distance, and also wear their masks so that they can stay healthy,” said Mr. Subburaj. The job gives this senior worker a chance to interact with people. “One must always be usefully occupied, no matter what one’s age,” he said, flashing a gap-toothed smile.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-duty-guarding-the-books/article31976166.ece

A Division Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash and B. Pugalendhi directed the Tahsildar after hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by the parent-teacher association of the school. The association complained that influential people were trying to encroach upon 12 acres of land owned by the school. They requested the Tahsildar to conduct survey and measure the land to fix the boundaries. However, it was not carried out. Besides, representations to remove encroachments did not yield any result, it said. Initially, huts came up on the land. Later, people started putting up concrete structures and even applied for electricity connection, the association said and sought a direction to the State to remove encroachments from the land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-remove-encroachments/article31976130.ece

03 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Civic body mulling over closure of all markets, but not everyone is on board||In the last fortnight, many traders in major markets and commercial hubs have been voluntarily shutting their shops or reducing the number of working days. With COVID-19 cases showing no sign of easing, the civic body is also contemplating taking stronger measures. “We appreciate the voluntary closure of markets and crowded places by traders. With the cases rising, the civic body is contemplating closure of all markets in the city. A decision will be taken soon,” said BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar. While K.R. Market and Old Pete area, including Chickpet and Avenue Road, have been marked containment zones and shut down by the BBMP, Malleswaram Commercial Association and a section of fruit-sellers at Singena Agrahara in Electronics City announced voluntary closure of their businesses. A section of traders at APMC Yard, Yeshwantpur have decided to work only three days a week, every alternate day. “There has been a surge in the number of the COVID-19 cases in Malleswaram. We are seeing a bigger crowd than usual, especially after Chickpet was shut down. We are worried that our area will become the next hotspot. We thought it is best to shut down for a week to break the chain,” said Arun Kumar, secretary, Malleswaram Commercial Association. The market will be closed from July 1 - 6. However, not all markets are seeing a consensus among traders. Of the 320 fruit and vegetable stalls in Singena Agrahara, nearly 120 shops have voluntarily shut down. “To date, seven cases have been reported from the market. A section of fruit-sellers have shut shop. Others are carrying on, but taking all precautionary measures,” said Anand Kumar, a fruit-seller who has chosen to work. While Vidyarthi Bhavan shut its dine-in services and a section of traders on the busy DVG Road have downed shutters, T.A. Saravana, president, Basavanagudi Traders Association, said the association was not in favour of shutting down. At APMC Yard, Yeshwantpur, too, traders are divided. “Traders of foodgrains and all other non-perishables have decided to trade only on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from next week. We hope those trading in onions and other perishables trade during the other three days to prevent crowding,” said senior trader Ramesh Chandra Lahoti. However, onion merchants, who had shut shop for most part of the lockdown, are not ready to restrict their trade. Idrees Chowdhary, general secretary, Russell Market Traders Association, said the market was partially closed and he had not opened his shop since March last week. “The number of cases being reported from Shivajinagar is rising and is a cause for concern. Most of us have shut shop. We are still trying to convince the rest to do so,” he said. However, many feel that stopping business is not a sustainable solution. “We have already suffered huge losses during the lockdown. Shutting down again will disrupt the business,” said Mohammed Nazim, director, Bangalore Commercial Association, an association of traders of Commercial Street. Suhail Yusuf, secretary, Federation of Bangalore Traders' Associations, pointed out that the lockdown did little to prevent a surge in cases. “There is also no clarity on how long we need to be closed if we have to overcome this spike now. We have decided to take all precautions and do business, unless the government advises otherwise,” he said The civic body is expected to take a call on the closure of markets in the city in the coming week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/civic-body-mulling-over-closure-of-all-markets-but-not-everyone-is-on-board/article31975731.ece
03 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NLSIU to raise student intake and recruit permanent faculty||The National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru, has enhanced its student intake for the 2020-21 academic year. The intake for its flagship B.A. LLB Honours programme will now be 120, up from 80 in the previous academic year. However, there will be no change in the LLM programme and the intake will remain 50. Sources said the decision was approved at the university’s executive council meeting held last week. This decision was made in the backdrop of the State government reserving 25% of the seats for students from Karnataka. According to the National Law School of India (Amendment) Act, 2020, a student who has studied in the State for 10 years will be eligible for reservation. The move to enhance seats is also likely to help the university generate more revenue by way of fees, as the State government had reduced grants by 75% for this academic year. Another key decision taken by the executive council is to recruit permanent teaching faculty members after more than a decade. Offers have been made to nine candidates to join the university from 2020-21. This will help NLSIU increase student intake, which has been on the agenda since Sudhir Krishnaswamy took over as Vice-Chancellor in September 2019. Although the university had invited applications for teaching posts in February 2020, the executive council meeting was postponed multiple times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The meeting was convened online and decisions related to faculty appointment received a formal approval. The last permanent teaching faculty member was recruited in 2006. Since then, the university has only appointed teachers on a full-time contract basis,” a source said. NLSIU had called for approval of 13 posts in February. While one position was challenged in court, the university made nine offers after scrutinising all the applications received.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nlsiu-to-raise-student-intake-and-recruit-permanent-faculty/article31975783.ece
03 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Class X students pop supplements||The SSLC examination will conclude on July 4, but Class X students, teachers and even staff involved in conducting it are leaving nothing to chance. In an attempt, which doctors warn is often misguided, they are popping supplements in the hope that they will boost their immunity. Vitamin C, multivitamins and zinc are some of the more popular choices. Rakesh S., a student, who is appearing for the SSLC examination, said that his teacher had recommended that all students take Vitamin C tablets till the examinations are completed. “We have been told to take several other measures so that we are healthy,” he said. However, experts say that consuming these supplements on a short-term basis is unlikely to provide any benefits. Manjunath H.K., president of Karnataka State High School Assistant Head Masters’ Association said that the teachers are using social media platforms to share the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH)’s guidelines which lists several measures such as drinking turmeric milk. “We know that this will not prevent COVID-19, but we want to take measures to boost our immunity. Like the general public, our teachers who are involved in conducting the examination are afraid as the cases are rising. But we have to do our jobs so we decided to spread awareness among teachers.” Nutritionist Manjari Chandra, however, said that it was completely futile to take vitamin supplements a week before the examination. “There is a need to work on a holistic diet, one that is healthy and balanced. Although we do recommend micronutrients to some of our patients, it is done after detailed investigation,” she said. All the staff involved in the conduct of the exam at the Karnataka State Secondary Education Examination Board (KSEEB) have been provided medical kits provided by the AYUSH department. “The entire building is disinfected once a day and restrooms are washed five times a day. There are sanitisers kept in each section in the board and officials are asked to maintain distance,” a source in the board said. The source also said that precautionary measures were taken so that no positive case is reported in the board. “We have been told that if we report any symptoms, we should not come to office. Even if one person is reported positive, conducting the examination will be a huge challenge for us,” said an official of the board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/class-x-students-pop-supplements/article31975734.ece
03 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||26 cases in central prison||A total of 26 people — 20 undertrials and six staffers — have tested positive for COVID-19 in Parappana Agrahara Central Prison. These are the first cases being reported from the jail and is a cause for concern as it is the most overcrowded prison in the State with over 5,000 inmates. A senior prison official said that all 26 cases were reported from isolated barracks that house nearly 400 undertrials who had been admitted into the prison in the last one month and among guards. Of them, only 137 undertrials and guards have been tested to date. Others will be tested soon, sources said. All those who tested positive are asymptomatic and have been shifted to the COVID-19 Care Centre at Haj Bhavan, said officials. Prison officials downplayed the threat of the disease breaking out in the prison. “All new undertrials have been kept in separate barracks and we have ensured that they do not come into contact with other inmates. So the situation is under control and there is very low probability of a breakout in the prison,” said a senior official from Parappana Agrahara Central Prison. There have been several cases of suspects and accused who have been arrested testing positive, resulting in police personnel going into quarantine and stations sealed. “Other suspects who may have been with them but whose tests came back negative at the time, were lodged in the prison as undertrials. They are now testing positive for COVID-19. We have decided to be careful before taking in those who are contacts of COVID-19 positive suspects as well,” the official added. A strict quarantine system is likely to be put in place for all new undertrials in the prison, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/26-cases-in-central-prison/article31975733.ece

The city, he pointed out, had more than 40 burial grounds for different communities and 12 electric crematoriums. “Yet, there is a shortage, which is why we had sought land from the department,” he said.

Donated under CSR funds by a private company to the government, the ICU telecart facility helps protect the entire medical team dealing with the infected. Doctors treating positive patients do not have to be in isolation wards and COVID ICUs. The proposed solution helps patients in quarantine get emotional support from counsellors and stay in touch with their families through videoconferencing. Also, the family can be part of the doctor consultations. Launching the facility, Health Minister B. Sriramulu said it will initially be installed at Victoria and K.C. General Hospitals. Addressing complaints of non-release of dead bodies without COVID testing, Mr. Sriramulu said that the delay was owing to the increased load of COVID-19 testing in the State. Experts have discussed the same in a meeting with the Chief Minister who has ordered for an increase in the number of testing labs. This should resolve the issue, he said. “We are also contemplating the conduct of plasma therapy in all districts. The government has also decided to reserve two ambulances for every ward to address the issue of non-availability and will procure more ambulances on rent if the existing ones are insufficient,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/health-minister-launches-icu-telecart-for-safety-of-doctors/article31975772.ece

The UAS-B experts will have to find out whether the translocation has been done in a proper and scientific manner, and whether any of the 59 more trees, identified for uprooting, can be saved while continuing with the existing alignment of the metro project. While 55 trees have been marked for translocation after uprooting, the remaining four trees are required to be cut. If no identified trees can be saved, then the experts will have to suggest the manner and place for scientific translocation of these trees, the court said. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Nataraj Rangaswamy passed the order during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Dattaraya T. Devare and Bangalore Environment Trust. The issue has been referred to experts in the UAS-B as the High Court was not satisfied with the work done by a committee of experts, constituted by the State government last year on the directions of the court, to examine whether any trees identified for felling, can be saved. The Bench said that the experts from the UAS-B will have to examine the findings of the committee of experts as well and the objections raised by the petitioners. The Bench issued notice to the KRDCL and adjourned further hearing to July 27, by which time the experts from the UAS-B will have to submit their report to the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-asks-uas-b-experts-to-examine-status-of-translocated-trees/article31975728.ece

Shankar from the Forum for People’s Collective Efforts, Karnataka chapter, welcomed the move and said it would help the interests of home buyers and protect them from getting into litigation upon modification of sanctioned plans by builders. “At present, there are rampant modifications being made by builders, which lead to massive changes in UDS (undivided share of land), amenities, facilities, and non-issuance of occupancy certificate for the project, and ultimately litigation. The relationship between the builder, land owner and allottees will see a new dimension now as the consent of the land owner and two-thirds of the buyers is mandatory,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/krera-issues-guidelines-on-altering-project-plans/article31975778.ece

Deputy Commissioner of Chamarajanagar M.R. Ravi said the district administration had decided to close down the inter-State checkposts at Naalroad and Palar from Thursday. The remaining four inter-State checkposts, including the three across Tamil Nadu border viz. Punajanur (Satyamangalam gate), Chikkahole (Talawadi), and Bandipur besides the one across Kerala border - Moolehole (Sulthan Batheri checkpost) will, however, remain open and inter-State travellers will be permitted to cross them as per the existing conditions that include mandatory registration on Seva Sindhu portal. Mr. Ravi attributed the closure of Naalroad and Palar checkposts to increasing number of COVID-19 cases reported on the other side of the inter-State border. Also, all the places of tourist interest in the district, including the Bandipur National Park, BRT Wildlife sanctuary, BRT wildlife sanctuary, Bharachukki waterfalls in Shivanasamudram and Gopalaswami Betta among others, will remain out of bounds for visitors from Thursday. Numbers rise The southern-most district in Karnataka, Chamarajanagar, despite sharing a border with Tamil Nadu and Kerala, maintained a clean slate with no cases of COVID-19 for a long time till the first positive case was reported three weeks ago on June 9. But, the numbers have gradually increased since then and have reached 54 after a sudden spurt on Wednesday when 21 cases were recorded. Attributing a majority of the cases to inter-State and inter-district travel, Mr. Ravi said the district administration has not only revived all the inter-district checkposts, where people will be denied permission to pass without a strong genuine reason, but has also decided to make three days of facility quarantine compulsory for Chamarajanagar residents particularly drivers of vehicles and merchants involved in inter-State goods transport returning from a visit to Tamil Nadu or Kerala. The other precautionary measures taken by the district administration include imposition of prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC across the district from 4 p.m. to 6 a.m. every day in a bid to prevent unnecessary movement of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/chamarajanagar-district-closes-two-inter-state-checkposts-as-cases-spurt/article31975771.ece

Kurma Rao has issued show-cause notices to officers and staff of the Health Department for not following COVID-19 protocol while carrying out the last rites of such patients and sought an explanation from them in 48 hours. In a release here on Thursday, Mr. Kurma Rao said that a 48-year-old man from Honagera village conducted the marriage of his daughter in Sirwar in Raichur district on June 28 and the very next day, he was complained of breathing problems and died on his way to RIMS in Raichur. Since, he died of breathing problems, medical officers at RIMS conducted Truenat test in which he was confirmed positive for COVID-19. Thereafter, as per a request from brothers of the dead, the body was brought to Honagera village. But, a video of the last rites showed the failure of officers to adhere to COVID-19 protocol during funeral. Thus, show-cause notices were issued to all those responsible in connection with this incident. The District Health Officer will inquire into the incident and submit a report, Mr Kurma Rao said. District Health Officer M.S. Patil has confirmed that show-cause notices have been issued to six officials, including Taluk Health Officer Hanumanth Reddy, who is also secretary of body management team for this purpose. “I am conducting an inquiry into the episode and will submit a report in a three-four days,” he told The Hindu .

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||BBMP organising 6,000 volunteers||With the increase in COVID-19 cases, contact tracing is proving to be a nightmare for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). On Thursday, Bengaluru recorded 889 cases. To undertake the mammoth task of tracking down each and every primary and secondary contact of patients, the civic body has deployed 26 probationary tahsildars, who will monitor the situation in Assembly constituencies in the city. The BBMP is also trying to organise a small army of 6,000 volunteers who will assist in contact tracing. V. Anbu Kumar, BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Administration) who is overseeing this task, told The Hindu that the first batch of 143 volunteers was inducted on Thursday. “The list of 6,000 volunteers has been submitted by the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences and includes nurses, paramedical staff and medical students,” he said, and added that the civic body was looking to induct at least 2,000 volunteers on the field soon. They will be deputed to assist doctors and medical professionals in public health centres to identify contacts. The surge in cases is threatening to overwhelm the city’s resources. In June, 4,904 positive cases were reported. Of these, the total active cases stood at 4,476 as per the July 1 war room report. The report also stated that officials had been able to identify 2,245 primary contacts and 6,350 secondary contacts. Of the primary contacts, 902 are under quarantine while 1,343 had completed quarantine. Among the secondary contacts, 1,273 were in quarantine while 5,077 had completed quarantine. Mr. Anbu Kumar said that once a person tests positive, it is imperative that contact tracing begins immediately. “The key to checking the spread is to identify contacts and immediately place them under home quarantine. We need experienced officials to identify possible contacts, stamp their hands with the seal, put up posters outside their residence or shift them to quarantine facilities,” he said and added that the information of these contacts is then shared with the Home Quarantine task force, who will monitor them and ensure that they follow the norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-organising-6000-volunteers/article31975726.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||We called BBMP for two days in vain: Deceased man’s son||“An ambulance sent on time could have saved my father’s life. We kept calling the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for two days; only empty assurances were made,” said Prakash (name changed on request). Prakash’s father, a resident of Magadi Toll Gate, died outside the gate of Victoria Hospital. A tailor by profession, he had tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday. “After getting to know that he was positive, he was immediately shifted to a room on the first floor of our house. When we tried to get him admitted to a hospital, we were told that we had to submit the BBMP report. BBMP officials claimed they would send an ambulance to pick my father up,” said Prakash, a 21-year-old college student. When his father developed breathing difficulty, the family, out of desperation, hailed a cab and rushed him to Victoria Hospital on Tuesday night. However, his father breathed his last. Following the incident, the BBMP sealed the road where their house is located. “After my father passed away, the BBMP sent an ambulance and picked up my 74-year-old grandmother. She has diabetes and hypertension. She has been admitted in ESI hospital now,” he said, adding that the BBMP said that all members of the family would be tested for COVID-19. “This should not happen to anyone. No hospital should turn away patients. They should first provide treatment and then check for paperwork or reports,” he cried. Kusuma (name changed), Prakash’s sister, is contemplating legal action against the authorities concerned. “I have consulted two lawyers and we are waiting for hear from them,” she said. She also complained that the BBMP was yet to sanitise their house. Several attempts to contact BBMP officials went in vain. BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar claimed to have no details of the case. Meanwhile, BBMP is set to file FIRs against nine hospitals for allegedly refusing treatment to a 52-year-old garment trader. The State government, on Wednesday, had issued show-cause notices to the nine hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/we-called-bbmp-for-two-days-in-vain-deceased-mans-son/article31975737.ece

They included three workers from West Bengal and Tamil Nadu employed at the shop owned by the 66-year-old resident of Thoppumpady who tested positive on Wednesday. A relative of the girl in Amballur, tested positive on June 25, also got the infection through contact. The 13-year-old, who tested positive on Thursday, is a resident of Edakkattuvayal. The remaining five who tested positive included a 42-year-old resident of Choornikkara; a 17-year-old in Ernakulam; a 35-year-old in Kothamangalam; and a 51-year-old resident of Aikkaranad. The health condition of the 51-year-old resident of Thuruthi, who arrived from Kuwait on June 19, continued to be critical, according to a bulletin issued by the Govt. Medical College, Ernakulam. ‘Situation under control’ V.S. Sunil Kumar, Minister for Agriculture, who reviewed the situation said that stringent action would be taken against persons venturing out without wearing masks and found crowding at commercial establishments. The situation in Ernakulam was under control, but there should be increased vigil to check the spread of the disease, he said. Health Department officials said that it was too early to consider the increase in number of positive cases acquired through local transmission as a cluster formation. Cluster refers to an aggregation of cases. There had been no large concentration of infections presently, they said. Tracing contacts The contact tracing of the trader with a godown near Ernakulam market and three of his family members residing at Thoppumpady is progressing. No new case has been reported from Nayarambalam where a person was confirmed positive on June 21. His wife and son were among the 12 positive cases reported on Wednesday. There was no new case in Chowara also, where a health worker tested positive on June 23. Her husband and child were also tested positive, according to health officials. Kunjachan K.K, councillor, Thoppumpady, said that no one tested positive from the containment zone on Thursday. “The local population is cooperating with the measures taken by the authorities,” he said. Business hit N.H. Shameed, general secretary of the Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association, said that only a few among the nearly 211 vegetable stall owners had offered services on Thursday. But they had collected loads from Aluva and Maradu markets as the Ernakulam market had been declared a containment zone from Wednesday. The chances of a rise in price of vegetables were high as majority of the stall owners might not be functioning until the situation improved, he said. Bus service Bus services from Angamaly depot of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation resumed on Thursday. The depot was shut down after a conductor, who had been on duty on routes passing through Angamaly, tested positive on June 30. Four services were operated from the depot on Friday. Besides Angamaly depot, disinfection of the Ernakulam depot was also carried out to ensure the safety of staff and passengers. Drivers and conductors had been told to stick to the guidelines prescribed by the Health Department, said V.M.

This will start with a special drive on Friday against crowding and gatherings in violation of COVID-19 protocol in small shops and establishments. “The time for mere awareness is over as we had given people enough and more time to become aware of the state of things. Now, they will have to pay the price for being casual. They need to understand that life is far from normal and the threat posed by the virus remains real,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). Vigil at market The Rural police have set up a picket at Aluva market. “We have already disinfected the market and guards have been placed to ensure that the protocol, including wearing of masks and physical-distancing norms, is strictly complied with. In fact, we are keeping a close tab not just on market but all shops and establishments and such other places where people are likely to assemble,” said Mr. Karthik. The police have made it the responsibility of shop owners to ensure that COVID-19 protocol is maintained in their shops. “Apart from slapping cases against them, we will contact the departments concerned asking them to revoke the licences of shop owners at fault. The same fate will befall motorists found not wearing masks as we will ask the Motor Vehicles Department to suspend their licences and permits,” said Mr. Karthik. With the spectre of local transmission raised by the infected cases in the Ernakulam market in the heart of the city, the Kochi city police have also tightened measures with those found either not wearing the mask or not wearing it properly set to end up with cases. The police are invoking provisions of the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, sections of IPC and even the Disaster Management Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gathering-at-shops-to-land-people-in-trouble/article31976044.ece

A member of the Ernakulam range bomb squad, Mr. Vivek developed, for his office, an automatic touch-free hand sanitiser dispenser, which has won many admirers. He has already been asked to deliver one each to the District Police Chief’s office at Kottayam, the treasury at Thripunithura and a local mosque. The infrared sensor-driven sanitiser dispenser can store up to 1.5 litres of sanitising liquid and is rechargeable, with a single charge lasting for about two days. Extremely lightweight, the device is portable and waterproof. Viable alternative “A standard automatic hand sanitiser dispenser is being sold on e-commerce portals for anywhere between Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 5,000. That prompted me to think of a more viable alternative,” said Mr. Vivek. The one developed by him cost just Rs. 1,000 and can be made for even less with some fine-tuning. Making it takes around three hours, and the increased interest in the product leaves Mr. Vivek with little spare time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-sanitiser-dispenser-to-defuse-covid-19-situation/article31976047.ece

03 July 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Plea for monthly power bill rejected||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday dismissed a public interest litigation seeking a directive to the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) to introduce monthly bill system for all domestic consumers in view of the exorbitant bimonthly bills issued for the lockdown period. The petition was filed by Vinay Kumar M.C. of Muvattupuzha. According to him, if the billing periodicity was made monthly, the consumers would be spared of the burden of paying huge amounts as electricity charges. KSEB stance The KSEB submitted that the bimonthly pattern of billing was beneficial to the consumers. In fact, the periodicity of issuing bills to domestic consumers with connected loads below 20 kilo Watts and monthly consumption below 500 units was bimonthly. The periodicity in the case of all other consumers in the domestic category was monthly. Besides, more than 75% of the total consumers, which come to almost 97 lakh, were now being billed in the bimonthly cycle. Doubling of labour Converting them to the monthly cycle would lead to doubling of the labour. The KSEB pointed out that the increase in the consumption of domestic consumers during the months of March, April and May this year was considerable because they had stayed indoors owing to the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plea-for-monthly-power-bill-rejected/article31976068.ece

03 July 2020||KOLLAM,KERALA||Planting fruit trees to keep wildlife in forest||With recurring wild boar raids and elephant incursions, Achencoil is one forest stretch that witnesses human-wildlife conflict regularly. Animals often enter the forest fringes and human habitats in search of food, ripping apart the farms. Animal troops usually stray due to inadequate food sources and the Achencoil Forest Division has now come up with a plan to tackle the issue. Adavikkoru Madhuram, an intensive drive to plant over 2,50,000 fruit-bearing trees in the interior forest, aims at minimising human-wildlife conflict by addressing the fodder crisis. “Human-wildlife conflict is the Forest Department’s biggest challenge. Though we cannot put an end to this, we can control the conflict to a great extent. By cultivating fruit-bearing trees inside the forests, we can try to solve the problem of food scarcity and control wildlife incursions into human habitats. It is also an attempt to protect the wild animals from getting hurt,” says Arun C.R., Forest Range Officer. Other uses Another objective is to maximise the green canopy and prevent soil erosion. Since chances are high for animals to destroy the seedlings, regular monitoring to ensure their safe growth is also part of the programme. Every three months their condition will be checked and missing plants will be immediately replaced. The week-long drive being implemented in connection with Vanamaholsvam, the annual afforestation programme of the Forests and Wildlife Department, has been conceived as an initiative with local participation. Local bodies, Vana Samrakshana Samitis, Kudumbashree, educational institutions, and voluntary organisations will be involved in the execution of the programme. Only indigenous ones While planting the seedlings, care will be taken not to change the natural forest ecosystem. “Exotic varieties and hybrids will be avoided and indigenous trees will be given priority,” he says. Trees suitable for different forest types will be picked from a list including Anjili ( Artocarpus hirsutus ), Njaval ( Syzyginium cumini ), Thondy ( Sterculia balanghas ), Elanji ( Mimusops elengi ) and Mullatha ( Annona muricata ) along with mango, jackfruit, gooseberry, tamarind, custard apple, and guava. Saplings of fruits preferred by elephants, deer, monkeys, bears, and squirrels will be planted in plenty, along with some species of fodder grass which is to the liking of elephants. “The Social Forestry Division will provide the majority of the seedlings. We have also sourced some from the residents of tribal settlements in the area,” adds Mr. Arun.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/planting-fruit-trees-to-keep-wildlife-in-forest/article31976106.ece

The trade will close after price matching and digitally signed contracts will be generated and shared among both parties. It also encompasses a payment gateway. Further, plans are also afoot to set up personalised trade pages for manufacturers whose rubber procurement is done only through their registered vendors and factories. “System for quality certification will also be instituted as part of the e-trade to cater to the impending demand of non-tyre sector,” officials added.

Having analysed the pandemic’s impact on all aspects of life, the college authorities had an inkling about the tectonic shift it would bring in the sphere of learning. A little more than a month later, the institution here is now helping several fellow institutions to integrate technology into learning and help deliver content to students at low cost. What began as a COVID 19–induced push to the boundaries of teaching innovation has transformed the college into a manufacturer of one of the most sought after digital learning equipment -- the learning glasses. It is a new technology for recording lectures that allows instructors to write lecture notes while maintaining face-to-face contact with students. At present, it has orders from six educational institutions for delivering the equipment, which is usually imported from abroad. Big demand According to Varghese C Joshua, Principal, the institution has been receiving inquiries on the learning glass from several schools and colleges across the region. “Since the objective of the project is to make online learning more flexible and effective, we have limited the service to educational institutions. But prior to its installation, we demand assurances from our customers that the glass will be backed up with a studio unit including a good quality camera, lighting and video editing tools,” he said. A peer team constituted by the college authority took into the making of learning glass after their attempt to import one from abroad got stuck in the lockdown and the financial constraints that ensued. Midhun R.Mohan, college’s website administrator who heads the manufacturing unit, said the product was of great demand among schools as it let the teachers to draw sketches and equations as they lecture. “Since it is an open source, we keep on updating the product from time to time to suit our way of teaching,” he said. Besides learning glasses, the COVID cell in the college has been into the manufacturing of hand sanitisers and even installed a solar-powered sanitiser dispenser on the campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/helping-institutions-to-integrate-technology-into-learning/article31976064.ece

03 July 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Police enforcing stringent physical distancing norms||The police have started adopting stringent measures to ensure physical distancing in Kozhikode city and rural areas of the district during their daily enforcement drive. This follows a recent incident in which a security guard who was found dead in his house near Vellayi tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. There will also be restrictions on transporting people in police vehicles in order to shut all possible chances of disease spread. Henceforth, only ambulances will be used to attend to medical requirements of street dwellers. The places where rough sleepers are temporarily accommodated will now be open only to those who have undergone the mandatory medical examination. It was also decided to make use of the district-level COVID-19 cells to ensure police personnel’s safety. The decision to strictly implement the physical distancing protocol was taken after seven police officers, including a Circle Inspector, who had conducted the inquest on the security guard’s body were advised to go into quarantine. Though the officers had followed all safety norms, they were totally unaware that the man had contracted the disease. Preventive measures will be strictly followed in containment zones like Vellayil. People will be allowed entry into police stations after assessing the nature of complaints. There will also be restrictions on taking individuals suspected of involvement in petty cases directly to police stations. In containment zones, police personnel will attend only to emergency cases in order to minimise interaction with the public. Demand for ambulances Meanwhile, a few Station House Officers have sought the allotment of sufficient number of ambulances in the city and rural areas to meet emergency requirements. This is in view of restrictions on use of police vehicles. According to them, people with suspicious health conditions can be offered support in time only with the spot availability of ambulances. Considering the situational challenge, enforcement activities on roads in containment zones too have been rearranged in such a way to ensure the safety of police personnel. Also, special focus will be given to tracking traffic rule violations. Control room vehicles will be stationed in such a way to handle emergency situations without depending much on the services of local police stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-enforcing-stringent-physical-distancing-norms/article31976032.ece
03 July 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||IUML overtures to Welfare Party irk Samastha||The stable but at times strained relationship between the Samastha faction of Sunnis and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is yet to show any signs of a serious trouble though the recent overtures of the IUML to the Welfare Party of India (WPI) of the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) for a tactical alliance for the coming local body election in the State have apparently irked the faction. The friction follows IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty’s mid-June statement about a plan for having an electoral understanding with organisations and parties outside the United Democratic Front (UDF). Muslim Youth League leader P.K. Firoz aired his dissent against any kind of alliance with organisations such as the WPI and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) or the Popular Front of India. CPI(M) flays move CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and other leaders were quick to flay the IUML for its reported move to have an alliance with the ‘extremist organisations’. IUML State general secretary K.P.A. Majeed later clarified that there was no disagreement in the party over an alliance that had not been discussed. The latest to lash out at the IUML is Umar Faizi Mukkam, mushavara (supreme body) member of the Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama, known as the Samastha Sunni faction. In an article in its mouthpiece Suprabhaatham on June 1, he wrote that any ‘unethical’ deals with organisations holding extremist political views will endanger the State’s equilibrium. Terming the WPI as a political pawn of the JeI, he said any political understanding with it is equal to self-destruction. Any alliance with it would make it easier for the BJP to emerge as a prominent force in the State’s politics. IUML motives The IUML leadership’s awareness that new political formations such as the WPI and the SDPI are making inroads in Malabar, especially Malappuram, may have forced the leadership to think on these lines. The reported meeting of party leaders Mr. Kunhalikutty and E.T. Muhammed Basheer with SDPI State president Abdul Majeed Faisi at Kondotty in Malappuram before the Lok Sabha election had drawn criticism that the IUML was joining hands with communal forces. Support for IUML The Samastha faction has always supported the IUML, while the rival Markaz faction led by Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliyar is known for its tilt towards the Left Democratic Front. Like the former, the latter also keeps the JeI at arm’s length as it also believes that the ideology of political Islam shaped by Islamist thinkers like the JeI's founder Abul Ala Maududi inspired outfits like the Islamic State. It is early days yet to predict whether the IUML can afford to ignore the warning message from the Samastha faction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/iuml-overtures-to-welfare-party-irk-samastha/article31976067.ece

03 July 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Poor patronage hits hotels, restaurants||Hotels and restaurants here are on the verge of closure as people are yet to venture out against the backdrop of COVID-19. The lockdown that began on March 24 resulted in the shutdown of business establishments and took a toll on the hotel and restaurant industry. “Though the government had permitted normal functioning of hotels and restaurants adhering to COVID protocol since June 8, our business is yet to pick up for want of customers,” says Sasi Isaac, working president of the Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association district unit. “People appear to be scared of entering hotels and restaurants, though we have made all arrangements to ensure physical distancing of customers, and sanitising,” he said. “Initially, we started with the sale of food packets. But, in Pathanamthitta there are few takers for food packets sold at hotels. The few hotels that offered food packets on an experimental basis too downed shutters for want of customers,” Mr. Isaac, who runs a hotel in the town, said. Now, many hoteliers are planning to keep their establishments closed for a few weeks in the wake of the rise in number of cases. At Thiruvalla Janardhanan Ramamurthy, who runs vegetarian hotels at Thiruvalla and Alappuzha, said business at both the eateries had come down by 60% to 70% after the lockdown. He cited the absence of floating customers due to restricted people’s movement as another factor for the poor patronage. Mr. Ramamurthy said the number of seats at his Thiruvalla hotel had been reduced to 25, from the usual 55, to adhere to physical distancing. However, the building owner was magnanimous enough to reduce the rent, besides waiving the rent for April and May, he added. Mr. Isaac said labour shortage was another issue as a good number of Assamese and Bengali workers had left for their home villages. He said hotels with lodging facility faced another predicament with the administration identifying them as paid quarantine centres for Non-Resident Keralites. The hoteliers were not supposed to rent out rooms at these hotels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poor-patronage-hits-hotels-restaurants/article31976108.ece

03 July 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Tests in Malappuram from today||The Health Department, as part of its strategy to do aggressive surveillance in areas with intense disease transmission, will start utilising the new rapid point-of-care viral antigen test kits in Ponnani taluk in Malappuram from Friday for diagnosing active cases of infection in the community. The standard operating procedures and guidelines for using the kit have already been despatched to Malappuram. First lot Senior health officials said that the State had received the first lot of 50,000 Standard Q COVID-19 Ag detection kit, developed by SD Biosensor, a South Korea-based company, which has been approved for large-scale diagnosis of active infection in the community by the Indian Council of Medical Research. While 10,000 test kits have been given to Malappuram, the rest would be distributed among districts. Once the next lot of 50,000 kits are received, viral antigen testing would be used widely in all districts for testing. While PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests look for evidence of viral genetic material, antigen tests look for fragments of viral surface proteins as a marker for active infection. The ICMR, after evaluation, had found that the test kit had very high specificity of 99.3 to 100 % and a sensitivity of 50.6 % to 84%, depending on the patient’s viral load. A point-of-care test, the test results will be available within 15 minutes and can be read easily on a test strip. The test uses a nasopharyngeal swab. The cost is Rs. 504 per test kit. According to the ICMR’s advisory, while a negative result obtained through this test should be reconfirmed using PCR, a positive test can be considered as a true positive and needs no reconfirmation. In Malappuram district, 24 persons were tested positive on Thursday. All of them were returnees from abroad and other States. When 22 of them had come back from abroad, two had returned from other States. Eighteen of them were admitted to Government Medical College Hospital, Manjeri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tests-in-malappuram-from-today/article31976055.ece

Though the number of flights had come down due to the nationwide lockdown since March 24, work has doubled for the stakeholders in Thiruvananthapuram, Cochin, Kozhikode, and Kannur airports due to mandatory protocols and time-consuming screening procedures. Expense is on the higher side as aircraft interiors have to be sanitised at every stop. Surfaces frequently touched at airport check-in counters and luggage too have to be sanitised. Physical-distancing norms are a challenge, especially for groundhandling agencies. Initially, flights ferried in Non-Resident Keralites from abroad, till domestic services resumed in a calibrated manner on May 25. Though Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel and crew of the Air India Express (AIE) tested positive for the virus, the services offered at the airport did not suffer.

The MoHFW has said the mandatory requirement of a prescription from a government doctor for an individual to undergo testing could be an impediment and lead to unnecessary delays.

03 July 2020||Thrissur,KERALA||Biodiversity exploration unearths spider species||A research team of the Centre for Animal Taxonomy and Ecology (CATE), Christ College, Irinjalakuda, has discovered three new spider species from Wayanad and two from Muriyad during biodiversity exploration. Two of the species found in the Wayanad stretch of the Western Ghats come under the genus Marengo — Marengo zebra and Marengo batheryensis — are small-sized jumping spiders. The species characterised by white and black lines on its body like zebra has been named Marengo zebra . The other species is endemic to the Bathery locality and has been named Marengo batheryensis . They live in tree barks and feed on small insects. Discovery significant “Discovery of the two species from the Western Ghats region is zoogeographically important because of the presence of another species under this genus in the Himalayan valley. This supports Satpura Hypothesis, a theory dealing with the migration of biotic (fauna) elements from the Himalayan region to the Western Ghats through the Satpura ranges,” said A.V. Sudhikumar, Senior Assistant Professor & Research Supervisor, CATE.  Asemoneacristata is the other spider species discovered from Wayanad. This jumping spider species is characterised by dark males and white females that construct small retreat with silk threads under green leaves.  Piranthusplanolancis , a member of the jumping spider family, a new report from the paddy fields of the Muriyad region, is an important biological control agent that feeds mainly on insect pests of paddy. Another new species from the Muriyad kole fields is Phoroncidiaseptemaculeata , a member of the orb web spider family. This nocturnal species is characterised by thorny projections from the sides of abdomen. The study was headed by Sudhikumar A.V. and accompanied by Wyne P. Maddison from the University of British Columbia, Canada; Suresh P. Benjamin from the National Institute of Fundamental Science, Colombo; John Caleb, Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata; and research scholars Sudhin P.P, Nafin K.S., and Sumesh N.V. from CATE. The findings were published in international scientific journals Zootaxa, Arthropoda Selecta , and Peckhamia .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/biodiversity-exploration-unearths-spider-species/article31976074.ece

03 July 2020||G.V.R. Subba RaoVIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kanakadurga temple decked up for Shakambari fest. beginning today||Shakambari Devi festival is a special occasion for transforming the presiding deity goddess Kanaka Durga at the Indrakeeladri into goddess Shakambari Devi in Ashada masam of Telugu calendar. The annual Shakambari Devi festival, which is celebrated for three days, will commence at Kanaka Durga temple on Friday. The event, however, will be a low- key affair this year in view of the COVID-19 guidelines. Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanam has spruced up the temple precincts with vegetables of all kinds, including brinjal, cucumber, green chillies, carrot, and leafy vegetables. The presiding deity is being decked up before throwing open the temple for darshan on Friday. COVID guidelines Temple Executive Officer M.V. Suresh Babu said that the devotees, who booked slots for darshan through online, would have to follow the COVID-19 guidelines like social distancing, wearing of masks and use of sanitisers. Devotees would be allowed for darshan from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. The festival begins with Ganapati pooja and poornahuti of Chandi homam on July 5, he said. Traders, devotees and farmers have donated vegetables weighing four tonnes this year. The devotees believe that Shakambari festival is an occasion to propitiate her for bountiful rain and good harvest of food, grains, and vegetables. What started on a modest note in 2007 at Kanaka Durga temple has turned into a grand affair after more than a decade. The donations were fewer than 10 tonnes when the new tradition was introduced. As the ritual gained acceptance, devotees and traders began flooding the Indrakeeladri with vegetables and fruits. The ritual slowly spread to other temples. A new trend of propitiating the gods has set in. Now, about 90 temples across the Krishna district are adopting the practices and these traditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kanakadurga-temple-decked-up-for-shakambari-fest-beginning-today/article31975695.ece

03 July 2020||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Markfed enters tobacco market||In keeping with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s assurance to the lockdown-hit tobacco growers, the Markfed has begun purchasing tobacco directly from them to create buoyancy in the market. “The farmer-friendly government will stay in the market till the last tobacco bale is sold,” Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu asserted while overseeing, along with his Cabinet colleagues Balineni Srinivasa Reddy and A. Suresh, the market intervention by Markfed in the Ongole II auction platform on Thursday. The Markfed entered the market to arrest the fall in prices of various grades of tobacco in the wake of COVID-induced global economic downturn. From now onwards, the State government would actively participate in the auctions, which had been severely hit during the lockdown period, to ensure the farmers did not suffer at the hands of the traders, Mr. Kannababu told a group of farmers. Prices fixed A minimum price of Rs. 130 to Rs. 140 per kg was fixed for F3; Rs. 100 per kg for F4; and Rs. 85 per kg for the low grade varieties of F5 and F8. “If the traders do not come forward to purchase at these rates, the government marketing agency will lift the stock as promised by the Chief Minister,” he said, and assured the farmers that the prices for various grades would go up. Tobacco Board Chairman Y. Raghunatha Babu said the State government’s decision augured well for the farmers who could now expect the market to go northwards. Farmers’ plea Farmers, led by former Tobacco Board member P. Bhadri Reddy, demanded that the government ensured a minimum price of Rs. 100 per kg for the low grade varieties and an average price of Rs. 150 per kg for them to at least break even this year. “They will have no option but to incur a loss of up to Rs. 3 lakh per barn if the market remains depressed,” farmers’ leader V.V. Prasad said. “The Markfed will be active in all the auction floors in the traditional tobacco growing areas from Monday and ensure that the growers do not resort to distress sale,” Markfed Managing Director P.S. Pradyumna said. On a suggestion from Ongole MP Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy for floating a separate trading body to explore markets abroad, Mr. Kannababu said he would take up the matter with the Chief Minister and work out the modalities during the next marketing season. Mr. Srinivasa Reddy said, in keeping with the poll promise, the government ensured nine-hour power supply to the farmers during day time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/markfed-enters-tobacco-market-in-ap/article31975720.ece

Appala NaiduKAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Andhra coast witnesses occurrence of waterspout off Kakinada coast||A waterspout occurred off the Kakinada coast and it was recorded by a group of fisherfolk near Byravapalem in East Godavari district on June 4. The videos of the occurrence surfaced in various groups on Thursday. Kammadi Veerababu and his group recorded the waterspout on the sea nearly four km from the land. It is a rare phenomenon on the East Coast, particularly the Andhra Pradesh coast, while a waterspout was reported off Thiruvananthapuram coast early this year, according to the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS-Hyderabad). “What occurred off the Kakinada coast is a waterspout. Once precipitation occurs, the spout slowly collapses. Whenever Cumulonimbus cloud descends downward due to heavy weight, waterspout develops and the tail part of the cloud reaches toward the sea surface. Around the spout winds swirl. It is a phenomenon over the seas and occurs commonly,” observed V.S.N. Murthy, Chief Scientist (Retired), National Institute of Oceanography (Regional Centre-Visakhapatnam).  Mix of air, water According to locals, with whom the fisherfolk on the sea shared the details on the sighting of the waterspout, it had further moved towards the deep seaside and gradually disappeared after a few minutes. The phenomenon was record at around 11 a.m. on June 4. R. Harikumar, Scientist and In-Charge, Ocean State Forecast Services, INCOIS, told The Hindu : “The waterspout recorded off Kakinada coast is small in size (spreads in a few metres diametre). It is a mix of wind and water. It can be considered as a ‘short scale phenomenon’. It can not travel much distance on the sea. “The fisherfolk, particularly those fishing in the sea, should not attempt to venture close to the waterspout as surroundings of the sea do not support for smooth sailing. It is advisable for them to escape from it soon after it is noticed”, said Mr. Harikumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/andhra-coast-witnesses-occurrence-of-waterspout-off-kakinada-coast/article31976231.ece
03 July 2020||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘TDP silent on irregularities committed by Atchannaidu’||The TDP leaders should come out openly about the alleged irregularities in the ESI scam instead of playing the BC card to divert the attention of people, former Minister Mopidevi Venkataramana, who was recently elected to the Rajya Sabha, said on Thursday. Mr. Venkataramana wondered as to why TDP MLA K. Atchannaidu and his party leaders were silent over the charges against him. “Is it not true that tenders were awarded to Mr. Atchannaidu’s acquaintances in his capacity as Labour Minister? Why is he not denying the charges against him? Mr. Venkataramana questioned. “It is pathetic that the TDP has chosen to play the BC card for its political gains instead of talking about the discrepancies committed during its tenure,” Mr. Venkataramana said while addressing the media here. The government never resorted to political vendetta, he said, and brushed aside the allegation that individuals were being targeted. “All are equal before law, and the culprits, despite their stature, have to pay for their deeds,” he observed. The government was committed to the uplift of the backward communities and had launched several schemes to strength them financially, socially and economically, Mr. Venkataramana said. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has provided them ministerial berths and Rajya Sabha seats,” he said. Earlier, he offered prayers at the temple of Lord Venkateswara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-silent-on-irregularities-committed-by-atchannaidu/article31976006.ece
03 July 2020||Tirumala/Chittoor,ANDHRA PRADESH||This is not the time for petty politics: Speaker||Assembly Speaker Thammineni Seetharam on Thursday appealed to the opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) to play a constructive role in the legislature instead of disrupting the proceedings for scoring political points. Speaking to the media, Mr. Seetharam maintained that the Opposition should rise above political differences when it comes to issues pertaining to people’s welfare. On the current financial crisis gripping the State, which led to a delay in the payment of salaries and pensions this month, he said the situation arose because of the “negative line” taken by the TDP in the Legislative Council. As the Appropriation Bill could not be passed in the Council, funds could not be released for developmental and welfare schemes. Though the government, with a great concern for people’s health, revived the ‘108’ ambulance service and ‘104’ mobile medical units, the Opposition was bent on criticising the initiative, he said. Earlier, the Speaker offered prayers at the temple along with his wife and other family members, and exuded confidence that the country would overcome the COVID-19 crisis with the blessings of Lord Venkateswara. He had a word of praise for the temple authorities for taking all precautions while allowing the pilgrims for darshan. Mr. Seetharam also offered prayers at the temple of Varasiddhi Vinayaka at Kanipakkam. “We will overcome the crisis soon with divine blessings,” he said. Puthalapattu MLA M.S.

03 July 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tirumala devotees not to blame for spike in cases: Collector||Chittoor Collector Bharat Narayan Gupta on Thursday said that no direct correlation was found between the steady flow of devotees to Tirumala and the spurt in coronavirus cases in the district. Referring to the allegations that opening the city to pilgrims had led to the spike in cases, the Collector said that the district administration had been testing samples collected randomly from 100 devotees from outside the State visiting the Lord Venkateswara temple. “We did not find a single positive case in the last 20 days,” he said, adding that the TTD’s staff including a priest, a vigilance employee and a percussion instrumentalist, however, were among those who were tested positive. “Now, efforts are being made to collect samples of 400 employees for testing,” he said. Home isolation Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the launching of ‘108’ ambulances on Thursday, Mr. Gupta announced that home isolation could be allowed in certain specific conditions for COVID-19 cases. In response to a query, he said people having spacious houses with separate bedrooms and toilets would be permitted for home isolation. This will be allowed, only if no children below 10 years of age or elders above sixty years are living in the house,” the Collector said. He asserted that sufficient beds were available in the district. “Around 2,800 institutional beds are available in eight hospitals. This apart, Sri Padmavathi COVID Care Centre in Tirupati has 3,000 beds, where already 400 asymptomatic or cases with mild infection are being accommodated,” Mr. Gupta said. Similarly, the TTD’s Srinivasam pilgrim accommodation complex would also be roped in, if necessary. He said the idea of inducting more centres would be considered only in case of a spike resulting in 50% of the beds in a given centre getting occupied.   “There were 8,000 cases initially, which we have brought down to 5,000 now, as the samples are being tested in Ruia, SVIMS and a private lab. The sudden increase in the release of results gave an impression of a spike,” he clarified. The TTD’s BIRRD orthopaedic super specialty hospital would continue to remain a designated COVID hospital, but its services would be utilised only after saturating infrastructural requirement in SVR Ruia (Tirupati) and District Hospital in Chittoor, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tirumala-devotees-not-to-blame-for-spike-in-cases-collector/article31976234.ece
03 July 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Technology comes in handy to beat lockdown blues||The restrictions imposed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is pushing people to rely on technology to go about their business while staying indoors. Be it education, healthcare or other services, technology-driven solutions are coming handy to beat the lockdown blues. The use of technology is catching up fast among the educational institutions. Considered as an education hub, Tirupati has many institutions of national repute such as the IIT and the IISER, apart from half a dozen of universities. The trend face-to-face lessons is losing ground as all educational institutions have been closed since months, and the online education has taken it place. No only the big institutions, even schools have taken to the technology route to continue classes. Many schools are using digital platforms in both offline and online mode—live classes or recorded lessons which help the students to learn from the comforts of their homes. The schools are opting for online or offline modes, depending on various factors such as mobility of teachers and internet bandwidth at students’ location. However, the online education has its own challenges. “Even as online education is inevitable amid the pandemic, concentrating on lessons in this format is difficult for primary level students. The methodology needs to be reinvented to suit the need of the students,” says N. Satyanarayana Raju, Director of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Sri Venkateswara Vidyalaya. Parental support, he says, would go a long way in retaining children’s attention on classes in online mode. Even some organisations offering private tuition have started online classes. The colleges and universities are preferring webinars to seminars. Treatment and awareness The healthcare sector is also relying on technology more than before. As the denizens are hesitant to see doctors in the out-patient wings owing to the fears of contracting the infection, doctors are reaching out to patients in the ‘virtual’ mode. The technology is playing a vital role in creating awareness on various ailments and precautionary measures. Senior physician P.

Narayanaswamy, while flagging off the vehicles allocated to the respective mandals at Tirupati on Thursday.

At a meeting attended by the Joint Collectors of the 13 districts in the State and officials of the agriculture and allied departments, the Minister said the RBKs were being developed to cater to the needs of farmers. The concept had caught on really fast and other States had been enquiring about it, he said, adding that the subject was discussed in a recent national-level seminar. He said besides farmers’ welfare, initiatives like Janata Bazars were aimed at protecting the interests of consumers. The idea was to rid the farmers of their problems by ensuring remunerative price to their produce. Inputs The RBKs would facilitate supply of seeds, fertilizers and other material required by farmers at village-level. They would also double up as marketing centres by enabling farmers to sell at least 30% of their farm output. The plan also included grading and sorting units. He said under the supervision of the Joint Collectors at the district-level, the officials of agriculture, revenue and other allied sectors would be involved to evolve a hassle-free mechanism that would be implemented from July 13. Special Chief Secretary, Agriculture, Poonam Malakondaiah, Principal Secretary, Department of Revenue, Usha Rani and other officials were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rbks-will-change-face-of-farm-sector-says-minister/article31975697.ece

Chandrababu Naidu was repeating allegations against the government only to confuse the public. Mr. Naidu’s charge that there was corruption to the tune of Rs. 300 crore in the procurement of ‘108’ and ‘104’ ambulances was one such attempt, he said, adding people, however, would not be carried away by the ‘false campaign.’ Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy disputed the former Chief Minister’s claim that he had introduced 1,800 ambulances during his rule. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said the TDP president should know that the present State government was known for transparency and corruption-free governance. People saw through his game and rejected him at the hustings. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said despite the State’s economy taking a hit due the COVID-19 pandemic, the government spent over Rs. 28,000 crore towards welfare schemes. The beneficiaries directly received the amount.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sajjala-tears-into-tdp-chief/article31976235.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed officials of the Industries Department to focus on promotion of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and revival of the sick units in formulating the New Industrial Policy (NIP) for 2020–2023. “Emphasis has to be laid on controlling pollution caused by the industries while holding them accountable for the incentives being given by the government,” Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said during a review meeting on the NIP at his camp office near here on Thursday. Approvals should be given to the industries within the stipulated time so that the projects could be launched as per the committed schedules. He said that skill development was a key area the departments should concentrate on, he said, and revealed the government’s plan to establish a high-end Information Technology (IT) skills university in Visakhapatnam. He ordered that the curriculum and other modalities be worked out in consultation with the experts who pioneered the IT revolution. Foreign investment The Chief Minister also stressed the need to strike a balance between the different regions in promoting the industries and helping the existing ones improve their efficiencies. Besides, a concerted effort should be made to attract foreign investments, he added. Industries and Commerce and IT Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy, Principal Adviser to CM Ajeya Kallam and Special Chief Secretary R.

Chandrababu Naidu has demanded that the State government clear the air on Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement that the Centre has extended Rs. 8,000-crore assistance to Andhra Pradesh. The State government owes an explanation to the people how those funds were spent. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Naidu said the Centre says that it had supplied rice and red gram in view of the lockdown imposed due to COVID-19. The onus lies on the government to spell out what it had done for the people in comparison with other States, he added. ‘Exaggerated claims’ Mr. Naidu said the funds released by the Centre were misused, leaving the people in the State to their fate. It seems there is no end to corruption in the State under YSR Congress rule, he added. While the government took credit for launching tens of ambulances at one go, the fact remains that it came one year late. People had suffered in the absence of health services all these days and a body had to be carried in an earthmover for the last rites as ambulance was not available, he pointed out. The government should immediately announce Rs. 5,000 assistance for the families of migrant workers, daily wagers, hawkers and others to alleviate their plight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/clear-air-on-centres-aid-naidu/article31975624.ece
03 July 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. to help cold storages adopt energy-saving technology||As a first step towards upgrading energy-efficiency technologies in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), the State government has decided to implement Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled technology in cold storages to improve their efficiency and competitiveness through effective utilisation of energy. In this connection, the Industries and Energy Departments jointly conducted a webinar on Thursday with the managements of cold storage units to involve them in the project. Addressing the participants, Energy Secretary N. Srikant said the government was encouraging judicious use of electricity and cost-effective procurement of energy. In the backdrop of the COVID pandemic, the government laid special focus on strengthening MSMEs which play a pivotal role in employment generation. The government concentrated on improving the energy efficiency of MSMEs by accelerating adoption of energy-efficient technologies such as IoT-enabled power monitoring systems. Mr. Srikant further said the Industries Department came forward to implement the system in cold storages and extend the same to other MSMEs. Heavy consumption Cold storage units consume substantial energy in general due to a complex thermal system that was required to preserve perishable commodities. The number of cold storages in the State was around 272 with a contracted load of 34,000 KVA with an average consumption of 11 MU per month and there was a considerable scope for energy savings. Special Chief Secretary (Industries and Commerce) R. Karikal Valaven said enterprises engaged in energy-intensive operations incurred disproportionately higher costs. In view of this, the MSME sector held immense potential in fostering energy efficiency and upgrading of the technologies in routine processes. State Energy Conservation Mission (SECM) CEO A. Chandra Sekhar Reddy stated in a press release that the Industries Department had come forward to work with SECM in extending IoT-enabled energy-efficiency technology. AP Cold Storages Association secretary P. Surendra Babu welcomed the initiative and requested the Industries and Energy Departments to facilitate it’s implementation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-to-help-cold-storages-adopt-energy-saving-technology/article31975692.ece

According to a statement issued by the corporation, the app will facilitate social distancing and other COVID-19 guidelines and it will be implemented from August 1. After that, it will be replicated zone-wise within three months. For the first time, the public transport giant plans to bring ‘Palle Velugu’ buses also in the realm of online services. From June, the APSRTC has been running buses without conductors to avoid the risk of the latter becoming ‘super spreaders’ of the virus. In terms of revenue, the corporation has been incurring losses due to reduced number of seats to maintain social distancing but it has been operating buses to cater to the transport needs of the common man. The corporation officials have claimed good response to their online ticketing services. From June 25 to July 1, the APSRTC sold 3.7 lakh tickets in online mode, against 25,000 tickets by Karnataka and 9,000 by the neighbouring Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apsrtc-to-go-cashless-from-august-1/article31976236.ece

Raghu Ramakrishna Raju for allegedly indulging in anti-party activities. Party Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy recently issued a show-cause notice to Mr. Ramakrishna Raju seeking his explanation for differing from the party’s stand on Amaravati and other significant matters, and for claiming to have won the elections on his own strength. In his reply, Mr. Ramakrishna Raju questioned the legality of the notice, and sought to know in what capacity did Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy initiate the proceedings against him. Mr. Ramakrishna Raju insisted that he would give a detailed explanation only if Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy established that the YSRCP had a proper disciplinary committee as per the Election Commission of India norms. The issue turned into a major controversy as Mr. Ramakrishna Raju virtually dared the party to take action against him, while claiming to be loyal to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, and that he was targeted because he was exposing the “irregularities” in the implementation of various schemes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-mps-to-meet-ls-speaker-today/article31976225.ece

The missing man in his early sixties, Tadepalli Vasantha Rao, along with his wife Tadepalli Dhanalakshmi visited the COVID hospital complaining of the symptoms on June 24.

The district reported 79 fresh cases and two deaths in the last 24 hours alone, taking the total casualties from five to seven. With the new cases, the total number of positive cases recorded so far has jumped from 976 to 1,055. The number of active cases rose to 646, with 31 people being discharged on Thursday. The total number of discharges rose from 371 as of Wednesday to 402. Unlock impact Both persons who died on Thursday were from Visakhapatnam city limits, officials said. One of the deceased owns a medical shop in the city, according to sources. Officials opine that opening up the city post the lockdown has led to the sharp spike in cases. Statistics support this claim, going by the eight-fold or roughly 600% rise in COVID-19 cases beginning from June 1 till date. “On June 6, the number of coronavirus cases in the district stood at only 143, lower than what we had feared. However, our worst fears came true as cases began spiking sharply ever since the lockdown ended, with the total count now going up to 1,055 in a span of only 25 days,” officials said. In the last two days (June 1 and 2), the district has recorded over 150 cases. On average, we are reporting 50 cases a day on a daily basis for the last 10 to 12 days, an official from the health department said. Violations galore According to District COVID-19 Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar, there is bound to be a spike primarily due to the increased movement of people and many not adhering to the basic protocols such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. “More cases are coming to light because of increased focus on testing. So far, we have conducted close to 79,000 cases. Of them, over 77,000 tested negative,” he said. The ‘very active clusters’ rose from 78 to 92 in a day, while active ones rose from 89 to 92. Fifty-two are dormant clusters while 28 have been de-notified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-tally-races-past-1000-in-district/article31976257.ece

After Unlock 1.0, Anakapalle (Town) has started to emerge as a COVID-19 hotspot in the district, registering 73 positive cases in the last four weeks. There are 21 cluster containment zones in the town. However, there seems to be no sense of caution among locals who are thronging public places in large numbers, and that too without wearing masks, say police. This has prompted them to use aerial surveillance in cluster containment zones in order to identify violators. “COVID-19 cases have been increasing since the last one month. Moreover, two of our police constables who were on COVID-19 duty have tested positive. There are reports of violations in several containment zones. To keep a check on such violations, we have started to use drones. The response is encouraging,” said Inspector of Anakapalle (Town) police station L. Bhaskar Rao. Many booked Police are identifying violators with the help of the drone camera footage and are booking them for going out of the containment zones on flimsy grounds and ignoring social distancing norms. On July 1, the Anakapalle police booked COVID-19 violation cases against 13 persons from containment zones caught manually and also using drone cameras. Police say that they have been deploying auto-rickshaws to make announcements and arranging banners appealing to the public to take precautions and control spread of coronavirus. “The main intention behind all our initiatives is to create awareness regarding the gravity of COVID-19 and make sure that everyone follows norms,” Mr. Bhaskar Rao said. Apart from Anakapalle, the district police have started using drones to monitor the movement of people in containment zones at Narsipatnam region as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/drones-to-help-police-keep-an-eye-on-covid-violators/article31976251.ece

High Court, on the Petroleum University lands at Vangali village of Sabbavaram mandal in the district. In a letter to the Collector on Wednesday, CPI(M) district committee secretary K. Lokanadham said that the High Court had issued multiple interim orders on January 3, 2017, January 4, 2019 and again on January 22, 2019, directing officials concerned not to acquire 740.38 acres of land belonging to farmers in Survey no.s 109, 135, 240, 241 and 242. However, the Sabbavaram Tehsildar allegedly issued a notice to the farmers on Wednesday (July 1) and started levelling of the lands despite objection from farmers who protested that the move was in violation of the HC orders. Mr. Lokanadham appealed to the Collector to intervene in the matter and put an end to the works. He said that an attempt was made to acquire lands forcibly from the farmers in 2016 for the Petroleum University without any gram sabhas or consultations being held with the farmers. The farmers approached the High Court, which said in 2017 that status quo be followed. “The farmers are ready to part with their lands if they are paid compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, 2013, provided employment and rehabilitation. Justice has to be done to the farmers, labourers and petty traders who are dependent on the land for their livelihood,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/collectors-intervention-sought-to-protect-ryots/article31976249.ece
03 July 2020||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Independent probe into Sainor mishap sought||The accident at Sainor Life Sciences, which claimed the lives of two workers and left four others ill, was the second such incident at the plant. A reactor blast at the same plant had claimed two lives in 2015, which indicates the callousness of the enforcement officials concerned, CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy has said. Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Mr. Murthy found fault with the authorities for including the Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories and the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) as members of the committee appointed to inquire into the mishap. Holding the Factories Department and the APPCB indirectly responsible for the mishap, Mr. Murthy demanded an inquiry by an independent team under the auspices of a sitting High Court judge and action against the company management as well as enforcement officials concerned for failing to discharge their duties. The CPI leader attributed the frequent industrial accidents to the proliferation of pharma companies in north Andhra. “After 2010, accidents have been occurring every year resulting in the death of workers. Failure of the enforcement authorities to review the safety norms at regular intervals is also responsible for the recurring accidents. The APPCB is failing to initiate any action against the erring industries for releasing chemical waste into the atmosphere without proper treatment,” he alleged.

The government has declared Garjularega, Kalighat, Ayyannapeta and three other areas as containment zones. The restrictions on the movement of people from Gajularega has drastically impacted the markets in the town since a majority of the employees and workers come from the village, which has turned into a satellite township over the last decade. “Many workers have already quit their jobs fearing coronavirus and late payment of wages. More would follow suit affecting the businesses on GT Road, Balaji Market, PW Market and other areas. It is very difficult for shop owners to run the business without staff,” says J. Ramkumar, who has a shop on GT Road.

03 July 2020||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. urged to bail out north Andhra advocates||The Indian Association of Lawyers, Andhra Pradesh, has urged the State government to bail out to the advocates affected by the extended holidays of the courts in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. “More than 9,000 advocates in North Andhra region have lost their sources of income with the extended holidays. The suspension of court proceedings has delivered a blow on the advocates whose make their ends meet from the fees paid by their clients during the hearings,” said Indian Association of Lawyers (AP) working president K.S. Suresh Kumar. Many advocates who otherwise earn around Rs. 25, 000 to Rs. 1 lakh per month in the form of fees are enduring financial crisis as their income have reduced to almost zero owing to either closure of courts or virtual hearings from March 24. Stipend stopped Usually, the advocates’ income plummets during the summer holidays. The hopes of earning a decent amount after the summer holidays this year sank in the wake of pandemic and the crisis may continue as the courts are taking up the emergency cases only, Mr. Suresh Kumar pointed out. “The government had assured to allocate Rs. 100 crore to the welfare of advocates, but the funds are yet to be release. The payment of a stipend of Rs. 5,000 to junior advocates has also been stopped for the last four months,” Suresh Kumar said. Vizianagaram Bar Association former president Kantubhukta Srinivasa Rao urged the judicial authority to resume the court works with a strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocols including social distancing and wearing of masks.

03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC sets aside single judge order on Kukatpally land||The Telangana High Court on Thursday set aside a single judge order prohibiting the Kukatpally Sub-Registrar from registering 119 acres of land in Kukatpally by M/s Prime Properties to others. The verdict said that the Sub-Registrar should process the registration application of M/s Prime Properties subject to compliance with provisions of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 and Indian Stamps Act, 1899. Delivering the judgment, the bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy said the Sub-Registrar, however, can refuse or receive the document presented before him if he finds any objections. ‘Explain reasons’ The Sub-Registrar should explain the reasons for refusing the registration and communicate the same to the applicants, the verdict said. “It is made clear that mere registration of document does not confer title to the property and does not prevent any other party to assert its title in any pending suits or otherwise,” the judgement said. The bench observed that the Bhagyanagar Co-operative Housing Society Limited moved the High Court even before the Registration authorities processed the application of Prime Properties for registration of land in favour of two others. There was no cause of action for the society and its petition was premature, the bench said in its order. The Society, claiming rights over the land through Mir Fazilath Hussain, cannot question the document which was executed in the year in 1952 in favour of Hashim Ali, according to the judgment. The bench said the Society on one hand said the disputed lands in 119 acres are agricultural lands but in an affidavit it maintained that the lands are divided into 2,000 plots with roads, flyovers and drainage pipes. “Obviously, the nature of the land cannot change according to the whims and fancies of the party,” the verdict said. Therefore, the provisions of the Agricultural Ceiling Act will not apply to these lands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-sets-aside-single-judge-order-on-kukatpally-land/article31976003.ece
03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Public health cadre need of the hour||COVID-19 has shown that states which set up a public health experts’ group to steer the response, or those with either a public health cadre or public health oriented professionals were able to respond much more effectively. Hence, the need of the hour is to initiate a public health cadre with dedicated function of tackling outbreaks effectively and improve the health status of the population, asserts Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH)-Hyderabad Director G.V.S. Murthy. With the country nearing the 5-lakh infections mark, it is time to stress the importance of public health professionals because of the pivotal role played in the earlier communicable disease outbreaks, be it influenza, small pox, plague or polio, he says. Public health professionals are concerned with ‘protecting’ the health of populations and improving their quality of life. Combination A combination of infectious disease physicians, paediatricians, pathologists, microbiologists, pharmacologists and public health professionals working in tandem were able to find answers to stop these diseases in their tracks, he says. This is by providing evidence-based guidelines, recommending policies based on the available scientific evidence after conducting relevant community-based research, implementing services to screen and protect large numbers, educating and advising people, identifying high risk populations needing additional care and support, monitor disease trends and changing patterns and study risk factors that increase risk of disease, the IIPH director explains. “Public health professionals work on disease models and estimate the health system needs like resources, infrastructure, personnel and skills required, among others. Their work is, therefore, very different from clinicians like ophthalmologists, cardiologists, neuro surgeons, internal medicine specialists, gynaecologists and others, whose focus is primarily on treating persons when they become sick,” says Dr. Murthy. People’s behaviour Public health professionals study people’s behaviour and lifestyle which increases the risk of diseases, natural course of different diseases, prevention methods, screening protocols, assessing which interventions work, monitoring mechanisms, and trend analysis. “These skills are not routinely taught to clinicians. Therefore, clinicians cannot do what public health professionals can do and public health professionals cannot do what clinicians can do. Both need to supplement each other’s skills,” he observes. The issue is public health professionals’ work is rarely noticed because there is no “immediate gratification” unlike, say, the “immediate benefit” of a successful cataract surgery or a normal delivery! “We deal with populations where the success is measured by indicators like percentage of people recovering from COVID-19, percentage of people living on premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites, percentage of mothers having anaemia or percentage of immunised children and so on. Changes in these parameters are then monitored over time to see how effective interventions are,” maintains Dr. Murthy. The IIPH director warns, “If even after COVID-19 the need for a dedicated public health cadre is not perceived, never will we be in the driver’s seat but will always play a catching up game with disastrous consequences.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/public-health-cadre-need-of-the-hour/article31975963.ece

03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||RUB, storm water drain works apace in Hitec City||Major portion of work for the railway under bridge (RUB) and storm water drain near Hitec City MMTS Railway Station has been completed during the lockdown between March 20 and May-end. Narrow underpass The existing railway underpass is very narrow, as it was built as a pipe culvert for storm water drainage. Over the time, it has come to be used by vehicles during dry season, and, during rainy season, vehicles are getting stranded on both sides of the underpass owing to heavy flow of water. The four-lane RUB coupled with RCC box drain under construction is expected to address issues of both flooding and traffic jam, a statement by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation said on Thursday. Already, the pipe capacity of the existing culvert has been enhanced by laying four rows of 1200mm dia RCC pipes in addition to the two existing rows of 450 mm dia pipes, thereby increasing the carrying capacity of the culvert five times, the note said. In addition, construction of RCC box drain for a length of 250 metres was completed, it said. Construction of RCC retaining walls and remodelling of the existing pipe culvert too have been completed during the lockdown, thanks to the road being free from traffic. Pertaining to the construction of RUB, excavation of approaches, major portion of foundation work and part of the sub-structures have been completed on the Hitec City side. On the Kukatpally side, integrated structures comprising drain and underpass wall have been completed, and 60% work of excavation has been completed, the note said. A total of Rs. 59.09 crore has been released under Strategic Road Development Project for both structures, of which Rs. 24.09 crore has been allocated for RUB works and Rs. 35 crore for approach roads on both sides, storm water drain and culvert expansion works. Officials of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Projects wing officials were working in coordination with Railway Engineering wing for the project, the statement said. Recently, Minister for Municipal Administration & Urban Development K. T. Rama Rao met the officials of the South Central Railway and discussed the speeding up of RUB and ROB works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rub-storm-water-drain-works-apace-in-hitec-city/article31975981.ece
03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State may opt for Rs. 10,000 cr. open market borrowings||With slow pace at which the economic activities are picking up post lockdown, the State government has decided to go for open market borrowings to the tune of Rs. 10,000 crore during the second quarter of the current financial year from July to September. In view of the significant drop in the State’s own tax and non-tax revenues during the first quarter on account of coronavirus (COVID-19), the government borrowed Rs. 12,500 crore during the first quarter ending June 30 in different tranches. The government has decided to borrow the proposed Rs. 10,000 crore in six tranches of varying amounts of Rs. 2,000 crore and Rs. 1,000 crore in each tranche during the current quarter. Indicative calendar According to the indicative calendar of market borrowings for the quarter released by the Reserve Bank of India, the government is expected to borrow Rs. 2,000 crore during the auction to be held on July 7 and this would be followed by raising another Rs. 1,000 crore on July 28. An amount of Rs. 4,000 crore would be raised in two instalments of Rs. 2,000 crore in August (August 11 and 25) and another Rs. 3,000 crore – Rs. 2,000 crore and Rs. 1,000 crore during the auctions slated on September 8 and 29 respectively, the calendar said. The RBI said that the quantum of the market borrowings had been announced in consultation with the respective State governments and accordingly released the schedule with the names of the States that confirmed participation and the tentative amounts indicated by them. The apex bank said the actual amount of borrowings would depend on the requirement of the State governments, the approval of the Central government under Article 293 (3) of the Constitution as well as the market conditions and other relevant factors. It may be recalled that the Department of Expenditure of the Union Finance Ministry had fixed the ceiling of open market borrowings of the State at Rs. 15,051 crore for the first nine months of the current financial year, and the State had already borrowed Rs. 12,500 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-may-opt-for-rs-10000-cr-open-market-borrowings/article31975990.ece

Reiterating the demand the Youth Congress led by its president, Anil Kumar Yadav, staged a dharna at the Secretariat on Thursday. Scores of Youth Congress workers raised slogans urging Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao think wisely and turn them into COVID centres. Mr. Anil Yadav said the buildings were centrally located with adequate space for light and air apart from at a singular place where patients, doctors and support medical staff can be stationed together without any issues. Telangana has already earned notoriety for higher cases and fewer tests and this can be countered by using the Secretariat buildings. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy in a separate statement said the demolition of present structures and construction of a new Secretariat at a cost of nearly Rs. 1,000 crore would be a criminal waste of public money, especially in the present circumstances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/turn-state-secretariat-into-covid-19-hospital-anil-yadav/article31975993.ece
03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCR expedites infra works||South Central Railway (SCR) has announced that a new railway line between 46 km of New Piduguralla – Savalyapuram has been completed and commissioned for train operations. This new line is a part of Nadikudi – Srikalahasti project in Andhra Pradesh. Maximum permissible speed for trains on this new non-electrified railway line is 80 kmph. The new line will facilitate direct traffic movement from Secunderabad to Dhone direction via New Piduguralla, bypassing Nallapadu junction, reducing the distance by 96 km for the rail travel. The entire Rs. 2,289 crore 309-km project was sanctioned in 2011-12 under 50 % cost sharing basis with the State along with provision of land free of cost. It is being executed in five phases : Phase-I: Piduguralla – Savalyapuram (47 km), phase-II: Gundlakamma – Darsi (27 km), phase-III: Darsi – Kanigiri (52 km) & Venkatagiri - Alturipadu (15 km), Phase-IV: Kanigiri – Pamuru (35 km) & Atluripadu - Venkatapuram (43 km) and Phase-V: Pamuru – Obulayapalle – Venkatapuram (90 km), informed senior railway officials. The project has been conceptualised as an alternate route to the present Coastal Railway line between Vijayawada and Chennai which is not only highly saturated but also prone to be disrupted during floods and cyclones. Once completed, it will also serve as the shortest route between Guntur and Tirupati. In another key work, the zone has carried out an extensive modification of Akola station yard of building a new loop line in addition to the existing three lines at the station. This is to facilitate connection to the new broad gauge railway line under construction between Akola and Akot stations, part of Akola - Khandwa gauge conversion project. The present metre-gauge line which connects Akola and Khandwa directly passing through a thick forest is under gauge conversion. The entire stretch comes under Akola - Khandwa Gauge conversion project sanctioned in 2008-09 for 174 km at Rs. 2,067 crore. Work is being taken up in 3 phases: While Akola - Akot - 43 km work is in progress, work is to be commenced between Akot - Amlakhurd (77 km) and Amlakhurd - Khandwa (54 km).

03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Youth brings education to tribal hamlet||Lockdown period has helped a student from the Osmania University to envision education and development for children of an Adivasi tribe living in utter deprivation in Mulugu district. The result is a pre-primary school for children of Gutti Koya tribals, which prepares them for enrolment into regular school. Santhosh Esram is a Cyber Law student from the university, hailing from Narlapur village of Tadwai mandal. After lockdown was announced, he left the university for his village, and started voluntary work to distribute groceries for the Gutti Koya hamlets buried deep inside the forest. “I had already been familiar with the tribe and organised a photo exhibition too depicting their lives. With two more friends from an NGO, I took a provisions-laden tractor to four-five hamlets. This particular hamlet Neelam Thogu was nestled at five kilometres distance inside the forest near Bayyakkapet village, to traverse which it took us a whole hour, owing to the sandy terrain and four-five rivulets,” Mr. Esram shared. Volunteers pitch in There, what he saw set him thinking. Extremely malnourished children of seven or eight years of age with bodies full of sores moved him to action. With assistance from local volunteers, he started interacting with the 34 Adivasi families about their lives and needs. To gain their confidence, he began bringing in food, and sponsored eggs for children and pregnant women, with funds garnered from university friends and others. He distributed chocolates, biscuits and toys to children. After gaining enough trust, he broached the topic of setting up a school with the village elder, who in turn showed him a small shack of his which they can use. “We wasted no time in getting the hut repaired, started a school and named it Bheem Children Happiness Centre after B.R. Ambedkar and Kumram Bheem. The children are being taught English, Telugu and Hindi alphabet, and rhymes. So far, we have deployed only local volunteers to teach them, as interaction with us could make them vulnerable to COVID-19 and other infections,” Mr. Esram said. About 40 children presently attend the school, where they can learn as well as play. Mr. Esram has also interacted with the district forest officials about the tribe’s habit of clearing large tracts of forests, and vowed that he will bring about change in them. “They clear forests for outsiders, for meagre sums of Rs. 300 to Rs. 400. I told them to protect forests instead, and plant them with trees such as Amla and Jamun, which could earn them long term benefits. I am sure they will understand eventually,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/youth-brings-education-to-tribal-hamlet/article31976011.ece

This was announced by District Collector S. Venkata Rao at a meeting held in Mahabubnagar on the implementation of ‘Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao’ programme. He complimented the officials of Women and Child Welfare, Police, Medical & Health and Revenue Departments for the remarkable achievement. Asking the officials to work for even better gender ratio in the district, Mr. Venkata Rao said it would be possible with better protection of girl children and education facilities to them. He enquired about field-level steps being taken by officials of the line departments. The officials of Women and Child Welfare Department explained that the implementation of KCR kits has helped improved the gender ratio and the Kalyana Laxmi and Shaadi Mubarak programmes have brought down the incidence of child marriages. Rythu vedikas At another meeting, the District Collector said the construction of Rythu Vedika buildings would begin from July 1 and procurement of material and tying up of labourers was in the process. Stating that the engineers of Panchayat Raj and Rural Water Supply Department would supervise the construction of Rythu Vedikas without any role for contractors, he said the government had released Rs. 13.5 crore for building 88 vedikas in the district. Each Rythu Vedika to be constructed with a cost of Rs. 22 lakh would have a labour component of Rs. 10 lakh under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and another Rs. 12 lakh would be spent on the material. The funds meant for construction would be deposited in the joint account to be held by Rythu Bandhu Samithi coordinator and Agriculture Extension Officer of the cluster concerned. He suggested that the engineers procure all the material required for 88 vedikas together for better price and there was no shortage of sand for the purpose. He asked the officials concerned to take the work of Rythu Vedikas seriously as their confidential record for the year would be based on their performance in the implementation of Rythu Vedikas and Haritha Haram programmes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/gender-ratio-improved-in-palamuru-in-two-years-collector/article31976013.ece

District Collector S. Venkata Rao instructed the eight task force teams formed to enforce the mask week.  He directed the officials to collect fine of Rs. 1,000 each from traders, shop owners, vendors, car and auto drivers, passengers in cars, autos and buses for their failure to wear mask. Surprise checks The task force teams have been told to focus on enforcement in three municipalities in the district – Mahabubnagar, Jadcharla and Bhoothpur. Stating that wearing mask has been made mandatory when people come out of their homes in rural areas too, the Collector said the task force team would conduct surprise checks in rural areas too to enforce the policy. The District Collector however suggested the task force teams not to resort to any kind of pressure on people found not wearing masks but only collect the fine/penalty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-mask-no-sale-policy-in-palamuru/article31975989.ece
03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Huge slump in non-tax revenue in 2018-19||The non-tax revenue of Telangana was a mere 46.37% of budget proposals in 2019-20 against 111.52% in the previous year of 2018-19. This was revealed in the accounts at a glance at the end of March 2020 as presented by the Comptroller and Auditor General in its latest report for the State on Wednesday. The report said the non-tax revenue was a mere Rs. 7,361 crore against the budget estimate of Rs. 15,875 crore. Sources said the slump was mainly due to failure of the government to sell lands which was expected to fetch Rs. 10,000 crore. The tax revenue, on the other hand, was far better in 2019-20 at 90.67% of budget estimates while the same was 77.43% in the previous year. Except State’s share of Union taxes, all other heads of tax revenue had positive growth. They included Goods and Service Tax, stamps and registration, land revenue, sales tax, State excise duties and other taxes and duties. The State’s share of Union taxes was, however, down from 108.78% in 2018-19 to 79.80%. The share was only Rs. 11,450 crore against Rs. 14,348 crore in the previous year. The total expenditure was 23% more than 2018-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/huge-slump-in-non-tax-revenue-in-2018-19/article31975991.ece

03 July 2020||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Now, action against tree guard thieves||District Collector Prashant Jeevan Patil has instructed officials to take strict action against persons found stealing tree guards, an emerging trend in Nalgonda as the sixth phase of Haritha Haram is gaining momentum. The District Collector who went on field visits to inspect plantation progress and maintenance on Thursday was greeted by unguarded saplings in several mandals. And the common reply given by several sarpanches and mandal praja parishad members was: “Scrap collectors are stealing the tree guards.” Mr. Patil was on a whirlwind inspection visit to Kanagal, Gurrampode, Kondamalepalli and Chintapalli mandals along with officials when he found that the newly erected tree guards were missing. He instructed police officials to book cases against persons stealing public property. And he told officials to hold awareness meetings with scrap collectors and dealers in respective mandals and gram panchayats and tell them that criminal cases would be booked against those responsible. Nalgonda as part of the current Haritha Haram has a target to plant 85 lakh saplings. And within the programme, setting up Palle Pragathi vanalu or village parks, avenue plantation, tall trees at Vaikunta Dhamam and dumping yards, are compulsory tasks. One acre open land in every village would be converted into Palle Pragathi Vanam, which would have at least 3000 plants, a walking track and fence. Mr. Patil said the deadline for avenue plantation drive, to plant saplings along village approach roads and its main roads, was July 5, and completion of village crematoriums and dumping yards was July 31.  Suspended Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Patil placed a panchayat secretary of Junuthala gram panchayat of Gurrampode mandal M. Venkat Reddy under suspension, for dereliction of duty in the ongoing plantation drive. Disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the official. “He showed negligence and also failed to fill the pits dug for Haritha Haram saplings,” the order read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/now-action-against-tree-guard-thieves/article31975995.ece
03 July 2020||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Production cost main hurdle for biofuel acceptance||A model developed by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad (IITH), using computational methods like Machine Learning techniques to understand the factors and impediments to incorporating biofuels into the fuel sector in India, has found production cost to be the main hindrance to acceptance and use of biofuels. The research, led by associate professor of the Department of Chemical Engineering Kishalay Mitra with his research scholar Kapil Gumte, has been spurred by the increasing need to replace fossil fuels by bio-derived fuels, which, in turn, is driven by the dwindling fossil fuel reserves all over the world, and pollution issues associated with the use of fossil fuels. The results of this work were recently published in the prestigious peer-reviewed Journal of Cleaner Production . The model developed by the IIT-H team has shown that in the area of bioethanol integration into mainstream fuel use, the production cost is the highest (43 %) followed by import (25 %), transport (17 %), infrastructure (15 %) and inventory (0.43 %) costs. The model has also shown that feed availability to the tune of at least 40 % of the capacity is needed to meet the projected demands. A unique feature of this work is that the framework considers revenue generation not only as an outcome of sales of the biofuel but also in terms of carbon credits via greenhouse gas emission savings throughout the project lifecycle. This research paper also won the ‘Best Paper Award’ during the Sixth International Conference on Advances in Control and Optimization of Dynamical Systems held at IIT Madras earlier this year. Highlighting the need for such research, Mr. Kishalay Mitra said: “In India, biofuels generated from non-food sources is the most promising source of carbon-neutral renewable energy. These second-generation sources include agricultural waste products such as straw, hay and wood, among others, that do not intrude upon food sources.” Biofuel technologies are evolving in India. The design and implementation of technological, regulatory and policy approaches and pricing strategy of biofuels depend on a deep understanding of the supply chain network. Models such as those developed at IIT Hyderabad allow society to understand the effects of uncertainty in the network parameters on the demand-supply dynamics and can help policymakers devise and revise strategies to meet the future demands of biofuels, Mr. Mitra explained. Elaborating on this research, Mr. Kapil Gumte said: “We use Machine Learning techniques to understand the supply chain network. Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence in which, the computer learns patterns from available data and updates automatically to produce an understanding of the system and make forecasts of the future.” “The analysis on country-wide multi-layered supply chain network and the use of Machine Learning techniques helped us capture the uncertainty in forecasting demands and other supply chain parameters and their effects on operational and design decisions,” Mr. Mitra added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/production-cost-main-hurdle-for-biofuel-acceptance/article31976015.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||A charming, mature romance||Last week’s direct OTT Telugu film Krishna and his Leela and this week’s Bhanumathi & Ramakrishna feel like different sides of a coin. Both are contemporary, urban romances and while the first is about the young, indecisive love of the male protagonist, Krishna, this story is about Bhanumathi who’s pushing 30 and wondering if she would finally find true love. First-time writer-director Srikanth Nagothi’s slice-of-life romance Bhanumathi & Ramakrishna (streaming on Aha) feels like a breath of fresh air, with characters that ring true to real life. It’s a film that understands its female protagonist so well, as though the writer could read her mind. The Telugu films that scored on this aspect in recent years were Pelli Choopulu and Chi La Sow . Bhanumati (Salony Luthra) is 30 and single. Ideally, it shouldn’t be a big deal. Some of us may have been through that phase or know friends who are in their 30s, yet to find true love and haven’t submitted themselves to arranged marriages. A single woman at 30 doesn’t have it easy. Time and again she’s reminded that it’s already late and she has to hurry up and choose a partner, and be less picky. Srikanth writes Bhanumathi’s predicament with empathy, also bringing to fore her complexities and vulnerabilities. Bhanu goes through a clumsy break-up. The guy (Raja Chembolu is good in his brief part) has found someone else who he says is more polite, understanding, and she’s just 24! Never mind that he himself is 30, Bhanu’s age. At work, Bhanu is a woman of steel. But there’s a void and she wants to be loved for who she is. Salony enacts Bhanu with tenacity and vulnerability and is unafraid to let go of vanity where required. Three cheers to her for taking up an atypical heroine’s role in her debut Telugu film. Srikanth pits the very urban Bhanu against Ramakrishna (Naveen Chandra), from Tenali. At 33, he too is at the receiving end of the arranged marriage spectrum. Ramakrishna is a simple small town guy who always tries to be positive, and has no vices. It would have been more interesting if this part too had some complexities.

So far, 150 bodies have been buried here. Yesterday there were six, and today we buried five. We have received information that three others from private hospitals in Hi-Tec City and other areas are on the way,” said Asif Habeeb, who has been supervising burials at the graveyard. While it was in 2018 that the Telangana State Waqf Board was allotted the land on the recommendation of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, later 10 acres of the graveyard have been earmarked for burial of COVID victims. Mr. Habeeb said the number of burials reached a dozen, but in the last two days have seen half-a-dozen burials each with bodies coming from areas such as Hafeezpet and S R Nagar. “Everything is done according to government guidelines. As per rules, grave is dug much deeper (eight feet), very few family members are allowed to see the burial and the area is disinfected. Initially, there were some problems, but now procedures are in place,” he says. A team of gravediggers is always at standby. Every burial is photographed or recorded, and a record of the number of burials per day is maintained by the authorities. Naseer Gayas, a journalist who is one of those in-charge of the graveyard along with MIM member Ahmed Saadi and the local corporator, opines that the number of burials at the graveyard could have tapered as other graveyards are gradually permitting burials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/faqeer-mullah-graveyard-sees-150-burials/article31975968.ece

With this, Mr. Nafees became the third person to have his property sealed by the Uttar Pradesh government as part of its drive to recover damages to public and private property during last December’s protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The administration said it would auction the properties on July 16, adding that four recovery cerificates had been issued so far. Confirming the administrative action, Lucknow Tehsildar Shambhu Sharan said the shop was sealed as part of the recovery certificate issued by the ADM East. Mr. Nafees is an accused in the Hazratganj violence case that involved vandalism and arson at the Parivartan Chowk on December 19, 2019. The administration had on Tuesday sealed a scrap shop owned by Mahenoor Chaudhary and a garment store whose assistant manager Dharamvir Singh is among the accused. Both were asked to pay fines of Rs. 21.76 lakh as per the notices issued to them. The Lucknow administration had earlier this year issued notices to 57 persons, spread over four police stations, amounting to Rs. 1.56 crore, including Rs. 64.37 lakh in Hazratganj alone. The names, photos and addresses of the accused were also displayed on hoardings erected across the city in a bid to “name and shame” them. According to an order issued by ADM East in February, Mr. Nafees was judged to have been a part of the violent protest after he did not respond to the recovery notice despite getting "sufficient time and opportunity". He could not be reached for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/another-lucknow-shop-sealed-in-recovery-drive/article31975934.ece

The FIR was lodged at Santacruz police station on Wednesday after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) ordered an inquiry into the matter. The hospital has been charged under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 34 (when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons shall be liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone) of the Indian Penal Code.

03 July 2020||Navi Mumbai,||Boy reunited with family after 4 years||A teenage boy, who went missing four years ago, was recently reunited with his family in Taloja owing to the efforts of the Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of the Navi Mumbai Police. A child with special needs, Dhanush Pawar (name changed) was 10 years old when he went missing from Pendhar village on July 8, 2016. His parents had left for work leaving Dhanush at home with his three siblings and found him missing when they returned. On failing to find him, they had filed a case of kidnapping with the Taloja police on July 14 that year. Senior police inspector Arjun Garad, AHTU, said, “Our teams were in touch with children’s homes in all States and a month ago, we learnt about a boy who has been in a children’s home in Udupi since July 2016. We exchanged photos and the parents identified him.” However, the police could not reunite Dhanush with his family owing to the lockdown. “Due to travel restrictions, we could not take the boy to his family, but they kept in touch over phone. Fortunately, the boy was able to remember his family members,” Mr. Garad said. On June 29, the police reached the children’s home along with the parents and brought Dhanush back home. The police said that Dhanush might have accidentally boarded a train from Panvel railway station, which is the nearest one to Taloja, and reached Udupi. Volunteers at the children’s home said that they found Dhanush wandering on the streets on July 9, 2016. On April 29 this year, a 17-year-old girl from Taloja went missing and was found in Taloja phase II along with 23-year-old Ajay Pandey on June 30. Mr. Pandey was arrested by AHTU and handed over to the Taloja police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/boy-reunited-with-family-after-4-years/article31975930.ece

03 July 2020||Pune,||Pune records 878 new cases||Pune district recorded 878 new COVID-19 cases till Thursday evening, taking its tally to 24,558. With two more deaths, the district’s toll has now touched 790. Pune Divisional Commissioner Dr. Deepak Mhaisekar said, “Today’s massive spike comes after the district recorded its highest single-day surge of 1,251 cases on Wednesday. Of the total cases, 9,274 are active cases and there have been 14,494 recoveries so far. Of the active cases, 405 patients are critical.” Since June 20, the district has been witnessing a surge of over 700 cases every day. With 40% of cases in Pune city being recorded outside ‘containment zones’, civic authorities have decided to take stock of the situation every week to redraw containment areas. Pune now has 105 micro-containment clusters. At least 30% of cases in the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation have emerged from outside containment zones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pune-records-878-new-cases/article31976095.ece
03 July 2020||Sonam Saigal Mumbai,||Refer inmates for testing: HC to prison authorities||The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed the State’s prison authorities to refer for testing any inmate displaying signs of physical discomfort, cough or cold, and also strictly follow all guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to contain the spread of COVID-19 in jails. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M.S. Karnik also asked authorities to notify details of 37 temporary prisons on official prison websites, and immediately inform family members/close relatives of inmates about their health. In a 40-page judgment, the Bench said, “Every possible endeavour shall be made by the prison authorities to scrupulously follow the guidelines issued from time to time by the ICMR, Central government as well as the State government and its authorities regarding the safety measures to be undertaken in correctional homes/temporary prisons for inmates.” ‘Extra security in jails’ The State government assured the court that random testing will be done of inmates across jail/barracks and it shall endeavour to deploy sufficient/staff at correctional homes, temporary jails and quarantine centres or COVID-19 care centres. Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, representing the State government, said the standard operating procedure for the well-being and safety of inmates, as well as precautionary steps, will be revised at regular intervals after seeking domain experts’ inputs. He said it may not be currently possible to test all inmates in jails across the State. Temporary prisons are located in schools and other municipal buildings which may lack the full security features of a regular jail. Therefore, from the point of view of security, it may not be possible to strictly follow the ICMR guidelines, he added. The court noted that the guidelines issued by the Public Health Department need to be scrupulously followed by the correctional homes and temporary prison facilities. These guidelines include measures for maintaining hygiene, physical distancing, medical examination of inmates at regular intervals, and sending suspected cases for testing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/refer-inmates-for-testing-hc-to-prison-authorities/article31975933.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||George W. Bush’s supporters launch PAC to back Biden||A group of officials from the George W. Bush presidency have joined forces to form a new Super PAC (Political Action Committee) to gather support from the Republicans for presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The group, ‘43 Alumni for Biden’, whose mission is to restore “decency, honour, dignity” to the White House, has been formed months before the crucial November 3 presidential election. “We know what is normal and what is abnormal and what we are seeing is highly abnormal. The President is a danger,” Jennifer Millikin, one of the PAC organisers and a former campaign staff for Mr. Bush, told Reuters, which had first reported the story. President Donald Trump is under fire from critics, including some Republicans, for his handling of the pandemic as well as race relations. ‘Principles matter’ The Super PAC, which describes itself as a group of ‘alumni’ who served Mr. Bush and other Republican Presidents, Members of Congress and Governors, believes “Principles matter more than politics,” as per its website. Super PACs are allowed to receive unlimited funds from individuals, companies, unions and PACs and can make independent expenditures. However, they cannot contribute directly or in-kind to federal candidates, nor can they coordinate expenditures with campaigns. “Join us and our former Republican colleagues in casting your vote for Joe Biden on Election Day, November 3, 2020. Together, we can help restore decency, honour, dignity and true leadership to the White House,” the website says. The organisers acknowledge policy differences with Democrats but call for “civil, honest and robust” debate. One of the FAQs on the PAC’s website asks if joining the PAC is equivalent to abandoning the Republican party. Greater obligation “We endorse Vice-President Biden not necessarily in opposition to any political affiliations, but rather in service to our country which requires a greater obligation than partisan politics or party,” the PAC says. Last month, a group of Republicans had launched the “Right Side PAC” to gather support for Mr. Biden from disgruntled Trump supporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/george-w-bushs-supporters-launch-pac-to-back-biden/article31975601.ece
03 July 2020||Gaborone,||Over 350 elephants found dead in Botswana||Hundreds of elephants have died mysteriously in Botswana’s famed Okavango Delta, the head of the wildlife department said on Thursday, ruling out poaching as the tusks were found intact. The landlocked southern African country has the world’s largest elephant population, estimated to be around 130,000. “We have had a report of 356 dead elephants in the area north of the Okavango Delta and we have confirmed 275 so far,” Cyril Taolo, the acting director of the department of Wildlife and National Parks, told AFP in a text message. He said the cause of the deaths was yet to be established with anthrax having been ruled out. “We do not suspect poaching since (the) animals were found with tusks,” he said. Samples have been collected and sent to South Africa, Zimbabwe and Canada for testing. Similar deaths Similar deaths were first reported in May when authorities found 12 carcasses in just a week in two villages in the northwest of the country. The latest discoveries were flagged by a wildlife conservation charity, Elephants Without Borders (EWB), whose confidential report referring to the 356 dead elephants, was leaked to the media on Wednesday. EWB suspects the elephants have been dying in the area for about three months. According to the report dated June 19, 2020, “70% of elephant carcasses were considered recent, having died about a month ago, and 30 percent of the carcasses appeared fresh, ranging from one day to two weeks old”. “There was good evidence to show elephants of all ages and sex appear to be dying,” said the report penned by EWB director Mike Chase. Several live elephants appeared to have been weak, lethargic and emaciated, with some showing signs of disorientation, difficulty in walking or limping, EWB said. “One elephant was observed walking in circles, unable to change direction although being encouraged by other herd members,” said the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/over-350-elephants-found-dead-in-botswana/article31975598.ece
03 July 2020||London,||China opposes U.K.’s citizenship offer||China warned Britain on Thursday it could retaliate with “corresponding measures” for London’s decision to extend a broader path to citizenship for the residents of Hong Kong. Britain’s offer came in response to a sweeping new security law that China unveiled for the former British territory this week. Hong Kong was under U.K. jurisdiction until it was handed over to China in 1997 with a guarantee that Beijing would preserve the city’s judicial and legislative autonomy for 50 years. The Chinese Embassy in London stressed that “all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals”. ‘Breach of basic norms’ The British plan covers almost three million Hong Kongers who either have a British National Overseas (BNO) passports or are eligible to apply for one. The Embassy said these people were Chinese nationals as well. “If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations,” it said in a statement. “We oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures,” it said. Beijing has never publicly raised the possibility of offering Britons either Chinese citizenship or broader residence rights.  Britain had sought closer relations with China after ending its decades-long membership in the European Union this year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government also irritated the U.S in January by allowing private Chinese company Huawei to unroll Britain’s speedy new data network. But Britain is now studying ways to cut Huawei out of its system entirely and build up an alliance of European and Asian providers that reduces China’s dominance in the field.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-opposes-uks-citizenship-offer/article31975600.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||With referendum win, Vladimir Putin tightens grip on power||With Russians overwhelmingly backing a set of constitutional amendments in a referendum, Vladimir Putin can potentially stay in power for two more six-year terms after his term expires in 2024. After a week-long vote came to an end on Wednesday, preliminary results released by the Election Commission showed that almost 78% of voters endorsed the amendments, while 21% voted against them. Some 65% voters had turned up to cast their ballots. In the vote, Russians were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the changes to the Constitution. The changes included a reorganisation of the government, introducing a higher minimum pension and wages, a ban on gay marriage, restricting top officials from holding dual citizenship, enshrining “faith in God” as a core value and emphasising the primacy of the Constitution over international treaties and rulings. The most controversial change, however, was underplayed by the Kremlin during the campaign — resetting President Putin’s term limits.  The centre of power  The Russian Constitution bars more than two consecutive presidential terms. Mr. Putin, who became President for the first time in 2000, swapped the presidency with his confident Dmitry Medvedv after his first two terms. He remained the centre of power during this time as Prime Minister. Mr. Medvedv served one term and stepped aside for Mr. Putin to assume the presidency again. He is now into the second term of his second stint as President, which will expire in 2024. The new Constitution doesn’t change the two-term limit in theory, but in practice, it resets the clock on Mr. Putin’s terms so that in the first election under the new Constitution, to be held in 2024, Mr. Putin can start afresh. Mr. Putin has said he hasn’t decided on running again. But if he chooses so, given the hegemony of his reign over Russia’s political landscape, he could remain in office for two more terms until 2036 when he will be 83 years old. The amendments have also enhanced the powers of the State Council, an advisory body until now, which Mr. Putin heads. Overall, the changes allows him to tighten his grip over Russia.  In pursuit of legitimacy  The proposed changes had already been approved by Parliament and the Supreme Court. But the Kremlin chose to put it on vote for legitimacy and popular approval. The vote was originally planned for April but was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Since April, the virus has spread fast in Russia. The country has recorded 6,60,230 COVID-19 infections so far, the third worst hit after the U.S. and Brazil. It has also seen over 9,600 virus-related deaths. But despite the outbreak, the Kremlin decided to go ahead with the vote this month may be because Mr. Putin wanted to get it done before the economic situation turns worse. Now that the amendments got popular mandate, the ball is in Mr. Putin’s court. If he stays in power for two more terms, he will be the longest serving Russian leader since Peter the Great. The Tsar, who built the Russian Empire, was in power for 43 years until his death in 1725. While the constitutional impediments for Mr. Putin’s continued rule are now removed, the road ahead for him may not be smooth. It has never been smooth for Mr. Putin. He inherited a Russia that was in an economic free fall and strategic retreat in 2000 after the troublesome Boris Yeltsin years. Much of the support Mr. Putin enjoys now derives from his efforts to rebuild the state and the economy and restore some of the country’s lost global clout. After 20 years in power, Mr. Putin again faces daunting challenges.  Challenges ahead  According to the IMF, the economy hasn’t expanded in dollar terms for a decade. The Fund estimates the GDP to shrink by 6.6% this year. With the pandemic affecting local businesses and the oil price fall eating into exports revenue, the Kremlin finds it difficult to fix the economy in the near term. In foreign policy, Russia’s relationship with the West remains troublesome. The sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 are still in place. While Russia managed to prevent the collapse of the Syrian regime after its intervention in the civil war, the Syrian crisis is far from resolved. Worse, Russia faces allegations of interference in the elections of other countries. Domestically, Opposition politician Alexei Navalny and his supporters continue to protest against the Kremlin despite crackdowns. Mr. Navalny has already rejected the referendum results. For Mr. Putin, there’s a crucial difference between the challenges he faced in 2000 and now. Back then, he inherited a weak state and his job was to fix it. Now, he is the state that is facing a fresh set of political, economic and foreign policy challenges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/with-referendum-win-vladimir-putin-tightens-grip-on-power/article31975610.ece
03 July 2020||Washington,||New York judge lifts ban on ‘tell-all’ book by Trump’s niece||An appeals court judge in New York has lifted a temporary ban on the publication of a potentially explosive “tell-all” book by President Donald Trump’s niece, court documents showed. The ruling issued on Wednesday allows publisher Simon & Schuster to print and distribute the 240-page book, titled “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man”, by Mary Trump. It would be the latest bombshell memoir to dish dirt on the leader after former aide John Bolton’s book, which described Mr. Trump as corrupt and incompetent, was cleared for publication last week. The President’s brother Robert Trump had asked for the restraining order, arguing that Ms. Mary was violating a non-disclosure agreement signed in 2001. In the book, Ms. Mary, a clinical psychologist, recounts what she witnessed of the “toxic family” in the home of her grandparents, according to her publisher. “According to the plaintiff, Ms. Trump has stated that (the) book contains an ‘insider’s perspective’ of ‘countless holiday meals,’ ‘family interactions,’ and ‘family events,’” Judge Alan Scheinkman said in the ruling. The Daily Beast website has reported the book will reveal that Ms. Mary was the crucial source for explosive The New York Times reporting on Mr. Trump’s finances, which suggested the billionaire paid little in tax for decades.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/new-york-judge-lifts-ban-on-tell-all-book-by-trumps-niece/article31975606.ece

On June 23, in a huge blow to Indian IT professionals eyeing the U.S. job market, President Donald Trump’s administration suspended the H-1B visas along with other types of foreign work visas until the end of 2020 to protect American workers in a crucial election year. Mr. Biden, in a digital town hall meeting on Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) issues organised by NBC News, praised the contribution of H-1B visa holders. “He (U.S. President Donald Trump) just ended H-1B visas for the rest of this year. That will not be in my administration,” Mr. Biden, 77, said. The people on the company visa have built this country, Mr. Biden said when asked what his administration will do in the first 100 days of his presidency. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. “On day one, I’m going to send the legislative immigration reform Bill to Congress to provide a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants who contribute so much to this country, including 1.7 million from the Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) community,” he said. Mr. Biden also said he will make it easier for qualified Green Card holders to move through this backlog.

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||India’s torture culture needs to end now||By now, everyone has heard of the tragic deaths of P. Jayaraj and J. Benicks, a father-son duo in a small town in Thoothukudi. Jayaraj, 58, was arrested by the police following an altercation with them on keeping his son’s mobile phone shop open in violation of lockdown rules. After Benicks was also taken into custody, the two were mercilessly thrashed to death. Being found guilty of the ‘offence’ of keeping a shop open during the lockdown would have ordinarily granted Jayaraj and Benicks a maximum of only three months of imprisonment. The story, sadly, does not end with the police alone. Before the two men died, the police sought their remand, which a judge sitting in a court complex mechanically seems to have granted, without ever seeing the two men, or seeming to question the rationale for their remand. The series of events, starting with the cruel lockdown enforcement methods and concluding with the utterly gruesome and entirely avoidable deaths, is a sign that we are living with a completely broken system of law enforcement. Endemic to police culture The Tamil Nadu police has acquired notoriety over the decades for employing torturous methods for law enforcement. During my tenure as Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, several cases in this regard were brought to the court. But this issue is not restricted to Tamil Nadu alone. Torture is, in fact, an integral part of police culture all over the country. Indeed, it would not be amiss to argue that this culture in India today is reminiscent of the brutality of the colonial police forces that we are so keen to forget. Official data also accept that police torture is a reality, but the quality of such data is always suspect. The pervasiveness of police torture is best understood in the compelling case found in reports made by NGOs and observers over the years, including by the Asian Centre for Human Rights, Amnesty International and People’s Union for Democratic Rights. The data on torture show that it is not only an integral part of India’s policing culture; in some investigations (such as terror cases), it is treated as the centrepiece. The fact is that the current laws facilitate such torture, such as through the admissibility of confessions as evidence under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which continues refurbished as the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act. Unfortunately, policing has also not mainstreamed the upgrade to newer technologies, like DNA analysis, which can directly impact law enforcement practices. What some have labelled as India’s “public secret” is tiptoed around in the international arena. The official position on state-sponsored or state-endorsed torture can be seen in a 2017 quote by India’s then Attorney-General. In his opening speech in Geneva at the country’s universal periodic review at the United Nations Human Rights Council, the Attorney-General invoked Gandhi and Buddha, stating that “India…believe[s] in peace, non-violence and upholding human dignity. As such, the concept of torture is completely alien to our culture and it has no place in the governance of the nation.” This would be a textbook example of hypocrisy, if ever. Undoubtedly, the offending officers in the Thoothukudi case are being prosecuted, and some compensation will also be paid to the victims’ families. But such piecemeal action is not what is needed. What we really need is a recognition that torture is endemic and a systemic problem, and the only answer lies in stringent legal framework that is aligned with and committed to the principles of international law under the UN Convention Against Torture (UNCAT) to which India has been a signatory since 1997, and a watertight enforcement mechanism that deters such practices. Supreme Court on torture Even before India signed the UNCAT, our Supreme Court had brought about glorious jurisprudence highlighting the many problems with the country’s torture culture. In Raghbir Singh v. State of Haryana (1980), the Court was “deeply disturbed by the diabolical recurrence of police torture resulting in a terrible scare  in the minds of common citizens that their lives and liberty are under a new peril when the guardians of the law gore human rights to death.” These sentiments were revisited in Francis Coralie Mullin v. Union Territory of Delhi (1981) and Sheela Barse v. State of Maharashtra (1987),  where the Court condemned cruelty and torture as violative of Article 21. This interpretation of Article 21 is consistent with the principles contained in the UNCAT. The UNCAT aims to prevent torture and other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment around the world. Although India signed the UNCAT in 1997, it is yet to ratify it. In 2010, a weak Prevention of Torture Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha, and the Rajya Sabha later sent it to a Select Committee for review in alignment with the UNCAT. (I, too, appeared before this committee in 2010 after retirement from judicial office). But the Committee’s recommended law, submitted in 2012, never fructified, as the then UPA government allowed the Bill to lapse. In 2016, Ashwani Kumar, a senior advocate and former Union Minister of Law, sought the enactment of a torture law via a Supreme Court petition. By 2017, the Law Commission had submitted its 273rd report and an accompanying draft torture law. But the Supreme Court dismissed the petition on grounds that the government cannot be compelled to make a law by mandamus; treaty ratification was a political decision; and that it was a policy matter. A second petition on the issue filed by Mr. Kumar also met the same fate as the first one. This rejection was a sign of the Supreme Court turning its back on its own glorious jurisprudence, and its efforts to aid law-making in the past, whether in using the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women to reform the law around workplace sexual harassment; or customary international law in environmental cases; or the right to privacy — this long and varied list is revelatory of a proactive Court that sees itself as responsible for nudging Parliament into legislative action. Even with failings, the Commission’s draft Bill is better than not having one at all. A version based on this draft was circulated to State governments for views, but nothing has come of it, and nothing is likely to, either. This reluctance is arguably because all governments appear to collectively agree that police brutality is a necessary evil to maintain law and order. #EndTortureToday Neither the Home Ministry nor this government is likely to take up the torture law. Indeed, the manner in which the torture bill has been treated reveals a betrayal of the people of India by successive governments. There have been opportunities for 23 years to enact a law on torture, but they have been studiously avoided. State consultation also has no meaning. It is evident that all governments enjoy the status quo, where the police are used as a tool for self-preservation. Any disequilibrium is not politically desirable. As disheartening as this may seem, all is not lost. There is much inspiration around us. Days after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis in the U.S., when a policeman held him in an 8-minute-46-second-chokehold, the #BlackLivesMatter movement emerged, with many Indians joining in too. The movement, led by the people, started a national debate in the U.S. on policing, including radical reforms such as defunding and disarming the police. Arguably we need a people’s movement at home too that will bring about the necessary legislative changes that the Law Commission has suggested, and that encourages institutions to #EndTortureToday. Only the people can rise up against these practices, just as they are doing in other parts of the world. And by people, I include important stakeholders like the Bar, the media, civil society and student groups. Each of these have relevant roles to play in bringing about the change we want to see. It is merely a matter of who decides to pick up the mantle first.

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Can alternative medicine be subject to modern rigour?||Patanjali Ayurveda’s claimed cure for COVID-19 has been criticised for making unsubstantiated claims of efficacy. However, can ayurveda, or alternative medicine in general, be evaluated in the same way as modern medicine? Jacob Koshy   discusses the question with Dr. S.P. Kalantri and Dr. Bhavana Prasher. Edited excerpts:  Dr. Prasher, could you begin by explaining what really is the process of testing a new investigational drug in ayurveda? Does it follow the phased system of clinical trials as in modern medicine? Bhavana Prasher (BP):There are two aspects to the use of ayurvedic drugs for clinical use. Some are those described in classical text and listed in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of India. These have formulations that prescribe use in certain [conditions]. These are classical medicines that have been used for several hundreds of years in our country as well as in many parts of the world. If these drugs are to be used for a new condition, as we are seeing in the case of COVID-19, and there is some textual evidence to suggest that they could be useful, then they can straight away progress to human trials. We don’t need studies on toxicity or pre-clinical aspects as these are already well-understood. However, if the drug is an entirely new formula, for a new set of conditions, then it has to follow the same path of toxicity, pre-clinical efficacy and subsequent clinical trials. In a typical drug trial, an investigational drug is tested on various groups. There’s phase one, phase two... all the way up to multicentre phase three, etc. Then, it is medical statistics that decides whether the drug is actually safe and measurably improves outcomes. You also have to separate out the placebo effect. Do those same standards also apply to ayurveda? BP:For evaluating safety and efficacy, there is no difference in testing standards. But when it comes to trial design, what is an effective placebo for COVID-19? Right now, I don’t think there’s any medicine, or standard of care, that we can reliably compare a new drug with. However, as far as the trial design is concerned, what is more important is the outcome measures that you decide. In the context of disease management, it is not the case that one drug would work for the entire population and a single one would be useful for that patient’s lifetime. Drugs are evaluated based on what specific endpoint is expected. There is a very clear-cut flowchart or diagram given by the CCRS (Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences) guidelines. They say that the drug must not ignore the parameters on which it is judged by modern medicine. Dr. Kalantri, In the case of COVID-19, several drugs are being re-purposed by pharmaceutical companies. Many times, drugs are hyped as potential antivirals, and they edge through the appraisal process by the expected outcomes being changed. We saw that in the case of remdesivir. So, don’t you think that in some sense, you know, the pharmaceutical drugs, have it slightly easier, and a higher burden of proof is applied on alternative medicine? S.P. Kalantri (SPK):Well, a science is a science is a science. I have great respect for ayurveda and its basic philosophy gels well with the Eastern approach of health and disease, in sharp contrast to the Western approach. But my point is that any drug or any intervention must figure out if the drug is safe and effective. For that, you need to follow certain rules. By merely drawing from experience in the past, quoting literature for which the drug might have worked in the past, does it mean that this drug will be as simple, as effective for a new disease? Ebola would be a great example. We thought that certain drugs worked well in Ebola and then we tried to extrapolate the results of those drugs to COVID-19, but they did not work. So often, what works in petri dishes might not work so far as actually human beings are concerned. My point is that no matter what branch you are practising, whether it is modern medicine or alternative medicine, comprising unani, siddha or homeopathy, there are certain scientific principles that absolutely must be followed. These scientific principles are basically aimed at making sure that you are minimising the bias as much as you can. In the pharmaceutical world, normally what happens is, results of a trial are peer-reviewed and published in a journal. Independent experts can then evaluate the drug’s benefits or non-efficacy. How often does that happen in alternative medicine? Are negative results reported? BP:There is a problem in that ayurvedic research publications don’t appear as frequently in high-impact journals. However, I think that in general there is a paucity of negative outcomes being published and is not really a problem of ayurveda alone. Ayurvedic knowledge does not just come from experience but also relies on extensive documentation. There are several universities and research counsellors who keep doing clinical trials that appear in ayurveda journals and thesis reports of research students. There is definitely the case that this reporting needs to be upgraded and the quality of journals improved. It is now well-understood that when disease reaches a certain level, you need technological interventions like, in the case of COVID-19, ventilators and pulse oximeters. However, ayurveda and other branches of alternative medicine mostly rely on natural concoctions. So, how do you integrate devices that are known to be life-saving into an ayurvedic framework? BP:They are absolutely integrated into the ayurvedic framework. I would recommend you to visit any of the modern ayurvedic institutes where the examination of the patient with respect to all these objective methods is very much adopted. There is no allergy to modern technological devices being integrated in the clinical protocols of ayurveda. Nevertheless, ayurveda also retains the methodology of assessment of disease in ayurvedic style, which is not only about focusing on the virus, but also looks at the baseline health parameters like diet and sleep. These are the immediate indicators of whether treatment is working. Dr. Kalantri, is there a way in which these two systems of medicines can be integrated? Or are they two different schools that cannot really exist under one roof but can only run parallel paths? SPK:I guess an integrated approach would be a win-win situation for both disciplines because modern medicine approaches treatment from a ‘left-brain’ perspective — it is more rational, more analytic, more structured. Ayurveda has a holistic, more intuitive approach. It takes into consideration the person as a whole. So, while modern medicine is obsessed with a cell, or an organ, or a disease, which is a part of a body, ayurveda considers the person as a whole and believes that the whole is more important than some of the parts that it is composed of. I completely agree with this. But when we are integrating them, we should not forget the principles of science and ethics. The way the Patanjali trial was publicised, the results were shared with the media without getting published. The most meaningful outcome we are looking at from a drug is that it should be able to save lives. A strength of modern medicine is that it looks very strongly at these endpoints (saving lives and recovery). We need to look at the large trials conducted in the last two months, the ‘solidarity trial’ and the ‘recovery trial’. Both not only produced some positive results, but [the researchers] also had the humility and transparency to say that hydroxychloroquine does not work, remdesivir does not reduce mortality, the dual combination of antiviral drugs does not work. Dr. Prasher, would you agree that the benefits of Patanjali’s drug were hyped? And didn’t it do more harm to ayurveda in the process? BP:In the case of this particular trial, I would agree that their claims were disproportionate to what was clinically proved. However, I would disagree with Dr. Kalantri in that if we are indeed looking purely at how many lives are saved, I do not know if, anywhere, ayurvedic medicine has even had a chance of [being tested] in ICUs. So, the Patanjali trial was only restricted to mild and moderate cases; all asymptomatic cases were only mildly positive, so as an endpoint, they could only test viral clearance. There aren’t tests allowed anywhere where ayurveda can be tested in severe or critically ill situations which could improve outcomes. A confidence has to be built in the modern medical world as well as in society that these things can be tested in those conditions as well. Ayurveda is said to be a highly personalised system of medicine. So, by definition, can treatments so customised to an individual be sold to a general population? Modern medicine, on the other hand, recommends a drug for anyone who presents a certain set of conditions. BP:Personalisation refers to the disease type or the stage of severity. If, for a given presentation, a certain drug has been useful and tested, then it can be given to others. But the clinical indication has to be very clear. However the one-drug-fits-all notion in modern medicine is itself getting challenged everyday. Both ayurveda and modern medicine are systems of medicine. However, their products are frequently in the hands of commercial pharmaceutical companies, who deploy similar means to sell more and extol benefits over harm. So, does that undermine medicine in both systems? SPK:I completely agree. In the case of a drug called Favipiravir, that has now been approved, the company charges Rs. 13,000 for a 14-day therapy for a drug that only addresses fever and cough. Most people in our country can never afford such a drug. We must, at this time, de-link this nexus between pharmaceutical companies and medicine. BP:In the desperation for a panacea, drugs that are given over the counter compromise with the principles of treatment in Ayurveda too. This does create a lot of problems and sometimes can bring more harm than benefit.

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||In an uncertain world, a seat at the global high table||India will be back in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for a two-year term beginning January 1, 2021 at a critical time in the history of the UN. It is hoped that by then COVID-19 will have subsided, a U.S. President will have been elected, and the contours of a new world order may have emerged. India is serving for the eighth time and has a record of contributing to some of the seminal resolutions of the UNSC. As a consequence of the long debate on the expansion of the UNSC, many countries which have never served on the Council have begun to claim their turn. Earlier, India, Japan, Pakistan and some others used to get elected more frequently. Compared to the retiring members, the newly elected members are more politically significant. India’s reputation for taking balanced positions and consensus building will be welcomed by the other members. All about the contest The basic contest for the non-permanent seats takes place in the respective regional groups and their sub-groups. Voting in the General Assembly is to fulfil the requirement of countries having to secure a two-thirds majority of the member states. If there is regional endorsement, all countries, except those with any grievance against the candidates, vote for them and they sail through easily. But regional endorsement is becoming difficult as countries inscribe their names years in advance and those squatting countries have to be persuaded to vacate the place through various means. Last time, it was Kazakhstan which vacated the place for India; this time, it was Afghanistan.  India could not have got the endorsement without such gestures from friendly countries. It must have taken some deft activity by our mission to accomplish these feats. Voting in the General Assembly is not without its own excitement. The two-thirds majority is assured, but the competition is to secure all the votes cast. But no one gets that as the ballot is secret and adversaries may vote against the candidates. For instance, out of the 192 votes cast, India got 184 and no one will ever know the eight countries that did not vote for India. But it is a matter of concern that there are so many countries with grievances against India. In the order of the number of votes received by each one, the countries elected were Mexico, India, Norway, Ireland and Kenya. Since there was no endorsement in the African Group, Kenya had to go for a second round against Djibouti. Kenya was the favourite of the West and Djibouti was supported by China and the Islamic states. In the Western European and Others Group, Canada lost to Ireland in a contentious contest. One special feature this year was the COVID-19 effect. Ambassadors were allowed to enter the General Assembly Hall one by one to cast their ballots instead of the simultaneous voting that usually takes place. The campaign was also unconventional — it took place through Zoom conversations and the sharing of brochures and pamphlets rather than through meetings at bars and restaurants serving haute cuisine around the UN. The candidates may also have saved money as this is normally an occasion for splurging. Though India’s success was assured, the new Permanent Representative of India, T.S. Tirumurti, who has a formidable reputation for multilateral skills, produced an impressive multimedia presentation with memories of India’s sterling role in the annals of the UN. Asked for his reaction to the victory, he said, “In the COVID and the post-COVID world, India will continue to provide leadership and a new orientation for a reformed multilateral system.” How far the UN will be able to reform itself in the new situation remains uncertain. The expected changes after 9/11 never materialised because of vested interests and traditional positions. The UN did not succeed in either defining terrorism or in adopting the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. Counter-terrorism will be one of the highest priorities for India at the UNSC. Permanent membership India’s election as a non-permanent member has understandably ignited the hope that its quest for permanent membership of the Council may succeed. Nothing is farther from the truth. Operating within the provisions of the Charter is one thing and seeking to amend the Charter to add new permanent members is quite another. The debate has thrown up many ideas, but till today, none of the proposals has the possibility of securing two-thirds majority of the General Assembly and the votes of the five permanent members. It is fairly certain that no expansion of the permanent members will take place under the existing provisions of the Charter. We may blame the permanent members for being adamant about protecting their privileged positions, but the fact is that a majority of the UN members are against the privileges of the permanent members, particularly the veto. India’s performance in the Council may earn it respect, but it will not lead to its elevation to permanent membership as the opposition to any expansion is not India-specific. India will have a higher profile at the UN for the next two years as the non-permanent members have a collective veto over every resolution in the Council. Permanent members can prevent adoption of resolutions by themselves, but they need at least nine votes to get a resolution passed. India will also have a rare peep into the consultations chamber of the UNSC, which is closed to non-members of the Council. It is there that hard negotiations take place without any public record, characterised by arm-twisting and threats of veto. The pressure of work of the mission will also increase because India will get involved in many issues in which it may not have any direct interest. Since India does not have a veto, it shall have to proceed cautiously not to offend anyone, lest they should go against it when a matter of vital interest for the country comes up in the Council. India’s mission in New York has earned a reputation that it is next only to the permanent members in influence. But whether it will be able to deal with traditional challenges in novel ways will depend on the turns and twists in an uncertain world. T.P. Sreenivasan has served at the ambassadorial level at India’s missions to the UN in New York, Nairobi and Vienna. He was also the head of the UN Division in the Ministry of External Affairs||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-an-uncertain-world-a-seat-at-the-global-high-table/article31975583.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||The precarious condition of hospital cleaning staff||Early on in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, Indians were encouraged to applaud the work done by doctors, nurses, and ‘other health workers.’ However, among these ‘other workers’, hospital cleaners, who face elevated risks of exposure to infection, are rarely spoken of. While the essentialness of their work has never been clearer, the stigma attached to the work they do means that it remains precarious and devalued. The poor working conditions and caste prejudice that cleaners face puts at risk not only the workers themselves, but also their families and neighbours, and the patients and doctors the cleaners come in contact with. Accorded low social status In our research about cleaning and infection control practices in public hospitals, we interviewed cleaners and other hospital staff in 22 health facilities in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh in 2016 and 2017. Even before the pandemic, cleaners did not have sufficient protective equipment or training to safeguard themselves and patients. Most cleaners we met were Dalits who belonged to ‘sweeper castes.’ Their ‘low’ social status, and the fact that most of them are contract workers, meant that they were often afraid to ask for what they needed, including the protective equipment they were legally entitled to receive. Unfortunately, many cleaners did not even have gloves as they swept and mopped floors, cleaned latrines, and wiped delivery tables. One cleaner explained that she only used one glove per delivery because the contractor did not provide gloves, and because it was difficult to ask nurses for supplies. Another said that they were once given protective equipment, including rubber boots and masks, but these supplies were soon stolen. They wanted to ask for replacements, but were afraid to speak up for fear of being fired. Most cleaners we spoke to were afraid of contracting infections at the hospital and of taking them home to their families. However, to earn a living, they continued to work even without protective gear. In this time of COVID-19, without protective equipment, these workers are at risk and could also put patients and staff at risk. We hope they are not afraid to ask for what they need to keep themselves and others safe. COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of closely following infection control protocols, but cleaners also suffer due to lack of training. Most cleaners we met had received none. There seemed to be several reasons for this. First, cleaning jobs were not considered important enough to warrant special training. Second, as a cleaner explained, anyone of a sweeper caste who took the job of a cleaner was assumed to already know what to do: “We are of a low caste, and from childhood we have been doing this work… what better training than this could there be?” And third, hospital staff who received infection control training often did not communicate procedures and guidelines in detail to cleaners because they assumed that they were not intelligent enough to understand. Thus, in the rapidly changing environment of a pandemic, cleaners may be the last to learn about important new protocols. But, given the nature of the work they do — directly handling bio-waste and body fluids that may be infectious, and coming in close contact with patients as they assist hospital staff — equipping cleaners with knowledge and protection should be of utmost importance. Much attention has been given to the alarming personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages that doctors and nurses face, for good reason. But hospital cleaners are as essential to ensuring patient survival and the functioning of hospitals. We must not allow caste prejudices to exacerbate the dangers of COVID-19. Rather, we should take advantage of this moment as an opportunity to train, protect, and improve the working conditions of these essential workers as they do the indispensable work of ensuring the survival of the sick.

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Core’s contraction||Ouput in the eight core industries suffered an overall contraction for a third straight month in May, shrinking 23.4%, as the pandemic-induced lockdown kept large parts of the economy shuttered, the Commerce Ministry’s provisional figures show. Of the eight, all but one posted declines in production compared with a year earlier, with six sectors witnessing double-digit drops. Steel and cement were the worst hit, slumping 48.4% and 22.2%, respectively, as construction activity and infrastructure projects remained mostly stalled. Refinery products, with the largest weight in the index contributing 28%, contracted 21.3% as the curbs on vehicular movement stymied demand for automobile fuels. And crude oil and natural gas continued their slide adding to the problems dogging India’s hydrocarbon exploration and production industry. Coal production also fell for a second straight month, declining 14%, as the lack of demand for electricity from the nation’s factories depressed power production as well as the need for the key thermal plant fuel. Output of electricity fell 15.6%, a slight improvement from April’s 23% slump, aided by the partial easing of restrictions and peak summer consumption by households. The only silver lining came from the fertilizer industry, as production rose 7.5% reversing the slump seen in the preceding two months and signalling robust activity in the agricultural sector at the start of the kharif season. The Finance Ministry had on June 23 cited a near doubling in fertilizer sales in May as indicative of “early green shoots of economic revival”. A promising and early start to this year’s monsoon bodes well for the crucial farm income-dependent rural economy. The above average quantity and improved spatial distribution of rainfall in June have spurred a sharp jump in kharif sowing, with the area sown as on June 26 more than doubling compared with a year earlier to 315.6 lakh hectares. With the pandemic and the lockdown having sent lakhs of people back to their rural homes from jobs in the cities, a strong uptick in economic activity across the hinterland is significant. Still, much will depend on the monsoon staying its course. Also, there is a danger to the farm sector, especially in western, central and northern India this year from locust swarms. The Food and Agriculture Organization had in its June 27 update warned that India would need to remain on high alert through July for the possible arrival of swarms from northern Africa. The latest PMI data from researcher IHS Markit also paints a less than promising outlook for manufacturing, which contracted again in June albeit at a softer pace. The June survey showed sharp reductions in output, new orders and employment. Policymakers must not only contain COVID-19’s tearaway spread but also simultaneously keep economic momentum from sliding further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cores-contraction/article31975584.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Staying alert||The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), the backbone of India’s disease monitoring network, is responsible for alerting the Centre and the wider world, on a weekly basis, about the emergence of disease outbreaks, a surge in novel pathogens, the rate of spread and remedial action taken. On average, there are 30-40 such alerts. However, the advent of COVID-19 appears to have veiled the country from any other disease. For one, the latest weekly report available on the IDSP website is from Week 12 (March 16-22). It records a mere six outbreaks/disease alerts across the country. In the same week last year, there were 17 alerts; in 2018, there were 28; and in 2017, there were 45. In Week 11 this year, there were 28 alerts, 12 of which were for COVID-19 and these corresponded to the 110 cases of the disease that were reported in that week of March from when the disease escalated. One way to understand this situation is that once COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and a lockdown imposed, the IDSP too went into a ‘new normal’. With movement at a standstill, hospitals shut, and only testing and treatment for COVID-19 available at government healthcare facilities, the reporting of other diseases suffered. The neglect of other diseases has been independently borne out, for instance, by a reduction in the notifications of fresh tuberculosis infections and a general decline in claims under the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. The other explanation is that akin to a decline in deaths from accidents, the lockdown has contributed to a decline in transmission of contagious diseases. Many of the outbreaks that are routinely reported involve pathogens contracted from contaminated water or those airborne that spread through social interaction. While the reasons for the decline could be deliberated upon, what is unacceptable is the lack of public updates since March 12. The pandemic has taught the world that no modelling can quite forecast the spread of disease and an affliction that may seem under control one week can quickly be threatening the next week. If the country has, as a policy, decided to ‘unlock’ and restore pre-pandemic routines, then this should also apply to routine surveillance for other diseases. The IDSP also faces a manpower crunch and, mirroring the experience of public health facilities in other countries, is trying to recruit in the middle of a pandemic. It’s debatable how useful this would be to improve COVID-19 surveillance, but it is essential in improving overall surveillance as well as providing timely updates to the public and international health agencies. The pandemic needs serious focus, but India cannot afford to ignore other killers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/staying-alert/article31975585.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Interrupted by a virus, in medias res||It is perhaps a rare thing to live through a rather prolonged cataclysm, and have it turn things on their head. And yet, here we are, with none of the exhilaration of a peasant who had just stormed the Bastille, or the extraordinary relief of the man who clung on to a coconut tree for hours while the tsunami swept everything around him out. As we lived out the first half of 2020 through the epidemic, there’s neither exhilaration or relief yet, just the overwhelming recognition that life as we know it has changed. It has not only challenged norms as we know it, and altered them, but also taken with it some well-entrenched practices. One of the things we have had to unlearn is solid, good, old-fashioned journalism. “There’s no replacement for legwork,” our professor at journalism school exhorted us, with the fastidiousness of a ballet teacher. Ground work, field work, going to the spot, was everything a good reporter had to do. Everything else was ‘armchair’, and subject to a full measure of derision. Being present ‘at the spot’ to verify facts has been paramount, for a vintage of journalists. Picking up the phone and calling just would not cut it. Having been groomed on a rich diet of ‘legwork’ , it naturally became a guiding principle. Besides, what’s journalism about but gadding about in the sunshine and rain, fresh air, and writing the stories of people, first listening to them and then telling the tales? The phone call became a buddy over the years, but would be reserved for when it became inevitable. Ravages of the virus Today, though, teams of reporters who’ve been hounded about visiting the spot are being told repeatedly to ‘be careful’, even — ‘if you can get it on the phone, do so!’ With the still mysterious virus holding court, journalists have learnt to do what they’ve seldom done before — tread with caution. Throwing danger to the winds during an investigative story or feeling the thrill of gaining access to forbidden hospital corridors and documents are paling in comparison to the ravages of an inscrutable virus. Scores of journalists have tested positive, some of them have died of the infection. Were they felled by reporting from the field? We will not know for sure. But it is clear that there are inherent risks, there are precautions to be taken even as we skirt around transmission risks, in pursuing a passion/profession the way we know best. Data is a boon, and so is TV feed, in some instances. The same information is available without the inherent risks that crowded press conferences entail. Additional queries can be addressed over the phone to sources who have been cultivated through years of face-to-face contact. But there are instances where this is insufficient; if it won’t tell the story, and the actual presence of journalists is a must, then reporters are being told to gear up, keep distance and file the report without coming into office, thereby setting a limit on exposure. Teams work on alternate days, trying to avoid meeting each other, so it is possible to restore business as usual in case one team is to be quarantined due to exposure. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures, and even if it has caught us in medias res , we’ll just have to ride this one out with our feet on the ground, even if not always ‘at the spot’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/interrupted-by-a-virus-in-medias-res/article31975591.ece

The intention is to encourage farmers to grow commercial crops in the place of paddy in the second crop season commencing from January next year. According to Government’s assessment, the irrigated area under the second crop in the entire State would increase by two and a half times by this step because commercial crops utilise less water than paddy and more farmers would benefit with an additional crop. The State Government hopes that this step would be welcomed by farmers because the return from commercial crops is always larger than from paddy. The scheme would be implemented in the areas under the Krishna, the Godavari, the Tungabhadra and the Nagarjunasagar delta systems. Though the State Government has taken this step ostensibly to increase the irrigated area, it is obvious that it was afraid of a bumper paddy crop resulting in a glut in rice production and falling prices. It is, however, too early to predict how the farmers in the delta districts accustomed to cultivating paddy would react to suggestions to change the cropping patterns and grow commercial crops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ap-to-cut-area-under-paddy/article31975590.ece

Cognizant employees who had been put in a “forced resignation” mode at facilities in Bengaluru, Chennai and other cities had reached out to KITU with multiple employment woes, the IT workers’ body said on Thursday. “Several victimised employees approached KITU, and the Union has initiated legal action against Cognizant and its management for this illegal action,” said KITU Secretary Sooraj Nidiyanga. “Performance management is a normal process across the IT industry, including Cognizant... we would like to clarify that recent third-party allegations regarding a specific number of job actions are not accurate, not based on facts, and were not announced by Cognizant,” a Cognizant spokesperson said. Companies that employ more than 100 people need prior approval from the Labour Department to execute layoffs as per labour rules, Mr. Nidiyanga asserted. “Rebranding a layoff by arguing that employees voluntarily resigned when they were, in fact, forced to resign, is also against the law. We urge all affected employees to refuse to resign if asked to do so,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cognizant-faces-action-from-it-workers-union-over-layoffs/article31975563.ece

The mobile application will contain all the data pertaining to the MSMEs such as the names of enterprises, turnover, number of employees, plant location and the like. “The financial stimulus package announced by the Centre for the MSMEs has been a damp squib.

The worst is yet to come,” he said, adding indirect tax collections “should have been Rs. 1.75 lakh crore for 65 days of invoicing.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/lack-of-data-impeding-revival-of-msmes/article31975571.ece

03 July 2020||Spielberg (Austria),||F-1 all set to roar again||Red Bull’s Max Verstappen will seek a hat-trick of home wins for the team and an early lead in the drivers’ championship at this weekend’s delayed season-opening Austrian Grand Prix. There is expected to be a synchronised ‘taking the knee’ by the drivers on the grid, to support Black Lives Matter, ahead of Sunday’s race. Afterwards, there will be no podium ceremony. Longest gap When the race begins, it will end the longest gap between races in the sport since 1962, but with two successive races in Austria and then one in Hungary, the pressure will be immediate and intense. Verstappen, who bullied his way past Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc to triumph in front of a mass of his “orange army” of fans last year, says he is unfazed by high expectations or the absence of spectators at the Red Bull Ring, a remote and compact circuit in the Styrian Alps. “I am not thinking about a hat-trick,” said Verstappen.  “I don’t expect an easy win — I think Mercedes will be very strong again and they are the ones to beat.” Meanwhile, Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton will be seeking an unprecedented seventh constructors’ and drivers’ double in succession. Hamilton will also be campaigning passionately for greater diversity, and against racism, in the sport. Hamilton has said “now is not the time to be silent” and explained why he criticised Formula One. In a video he made clear that his comments were not directed at any rival drivers.  Meanwhile, in a move to prevent costly damage to cars, the yellow kerbs at the final two corners have been removed. Teams had expressed worries about the cost of damage and a shortage of spare parts following the closure of their factories during the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/f-1-all-set-to-roar-again/article31975761.ece
03 July 2020||Chennai,||Daruvala primed for F2 debut||India’s motorsport community has waited long for its next top-flight driver. Finally, there are promising signs: this weekend, Jehan Daruvala will take another crucial step on the ladder to Formula One when he makes his Formula 2 debut at the Austrian GP. The 21-year-old, who was identified by the Sahara Force India team for its young driver programme, got a boost this year when he was signed by F1 giant Red Bull Racing for its prestigious junior driver programme. Not ideal In pre-season testing in Bahrain, Daruvala, driving for Carlin Racing, topped the timesheets twice and showed consistent long-run pace before the coronavirus pandemic delayed the start of the season. “This is not an ideal situation because we were not even sure whether the season would start. So I am as prepared as one could be but it is the same for everyone,” Daruvala told The Hindu . He finished third in the F3 championships last year and was in the title hunt until the last race, a performance which helped him land the Red Bull opportunity. “It is quite a nice position to be in because it is not easy to be a part of it,” said Daruvala, asked about the pressure at Red Bull, known for its ruthlessness in chopping drivers. “So I am just going to focus on getting the best result and hopefully realise my eventual dream of getting to F1.” Validation Daruvala’s mentor Rayomand Banajee said, “Being part of Red Bull brings additional pressure but Jehan is unfazed by external pressures. It was crucial to get this deal especially after the Force India door closed and this is an even better validation of his credentials.” Daruvala spent two and half months at home in Mumbai before leaving for the U.K. in May to be prepared for the eventuality of the season starting in Europe. “I took the right call in coming back early and have been able to practise at both the Red Bull and Carlin simulators. It has helped and I was able to do a test with an F3 car in Silverstone just to get back in the groove,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/daruvala-primed-for-f2-debut/article31975750.ece
03 July 2020||HYDERABAD,||The perennial runner-up||A perennial runner-up, Hyderabad’s M. Prabhakara Rao had the misfortune of his career running parallel to that of some of the greats of steeplechase, like Olympian Gopal Saini. So, not surprisingly, Rao, barring a couple of inter-Railway golds, had to inevitably settle for silver or bronze at inter-State championships between 1975 and ’82. And, at his peak and close to making it to the 1982 Delhi Asian Games, he came down with dengue. “Somehow, though the top two were to represent India at Asian-level championships and the Asiads, despite being No. 2 for long I was never considered,” says 68-year-old Rao in a chat with The Hindu . “To be frank, those days, long and middle-distance runners from the South, however good they were, didn’t get their due as athletes from the North were preferred,” he said. Now an advanced marathon coach for Striders (Mumbai), some of the high-points of Rao’s career include outpacing the likes of Asian gold medallists Suresh Yadav and Doswanda Singh at inter-Railway meets. He had completed 50 years, covering more than three lakh km, sometimes even running barefoot, said Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-perennial-runner-up/article31975957.ece
03 July 2020||BRIDGETOWN,||Players across generations pay tributes to a ‘great batsman’||Cricket’s biggest names, most of whom could hear only stories of Sir Everton Weekes’ exploits from the bygone era, on Thursday remembered the “great” batsman and a “greater human being” in glowing tributes after he died aged 95.  ICC: As one of the remarkable ‘Three Ws’, along with Sir Clyde Walcott and Sir Frank Worrell, who together struck 39 Test centuries, he played an important hand in a period that marked the rising dominance of West Indies cricket.   Viv Richards: One of the greatest cricketers from the country. A true icon. Rest In Peace, legend!   Sachin Tendulkar: Had heard many stories about his batting along with the other Legendary 2Ws. You will be missed Sir.  Anil Kumble: I had met him during the ICC conference in Barbados. He remembered a conversation we had during his time as match referee.”  V.V.S Laxman: He was one of the greats of the game.  Mike Atherton: A humble man who wore his greatness lightly.  Ian Bishop: Never once did I leave his presence without feeling a sense (of) warmth, cheerfulness & having learnt something rich & endearing each time. A truly great human being.  Ravi Shastri: A true humble great of the game. RIP Sir Folded hands.  Darren Sammy: We lost a legend today. Sir Everton Weekes is part West Indies cricket’s great history and legacy.

03 July 2020||Bridgetown,||WI legend Weekes passes away||Legendary batsman Everton Weekes, the last of the famed 'Three Ws' of West Indies cricket, passed away on Wednesday at the age of 95. “Our hearts are heavy as we mourn the loss of an icon. A legend, our hero, Sir Everton Weekes,” tweeted Cricket West Indies. Barbadian Weekes was part of a feared post-World War II West Indies team which also featured Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott. Worrell passed away in 1967 and Walcott in 2006. All three had been born within a mile-and-a-half of each other over an 18-month period. Today, the national stadium in Bridgetown is named the Three Ws Oval. Weekes played 48 Tests between 1948 and 1958, scoring 4,455 runs at an average of 58.61. His highest Test score was 207. “A most amazing pioneer in West Indies cricket,” said CWI president Ricky Skerritt. On the tour of India in 1948, he produced successive innings of 128 in Delhi, 194 in Bombay and 162 and 101 in Calcutta. He would have had another consecutive hundred but was run out for 90 in Madras, a decision that Walcott described as “rather doubtful”. In 1950 he played a key supporting role to spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine in West Indies' 3-1 series win in England. He made three half-centuries and then 129 at Trent Bridge. In 1957 in England, partnering Garry Sobers with the West Indies on 80 for four, Weekes took a blow to the hand which cracked a finger but, in a three-hour stay at the crease, hit 16 boundaries before being dismissed for 90. It was that spirit and stylish devastation that fans still remember. CAB to honour Weekes Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) on Thursday announced that Everton Weekes would be featured in its proposed museum at the Eden Gardens. In 1949, Weekes hit 162 and 101, becoming the first to reach the three-figure mark at the fabled venue after India’s independence. The CAB is also planning a small feature on that Test during its annual awards ceremony later this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wi-legend-weekes-passes-away/article31975753.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Mumbai legends seek continuity||With Hockey India’s one State-one association policy coming into effect from July 1, several Olympians and former players from Mumbai have written to Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju and the IOA seeking continuation of a separate identity. Maharashtra had three associations — Maharashtra (based in Pune), and Mumbai and Vidarbha as associate units. Under the new rule, Hockey Maharashtra will be the sole HI-affiliated unit and can field a team at the National championships. “As a result of the new ruling, only one team will be sent from the State under the banner of Maharashtra XI. Many business houses and PSUs in the city have provided employment to hockey players and maintain their own teams, including Western Railway, Navy, Central Bank, Mumbai Customs & Excise, Mumbai Port Trust. The opportunity for employment has shaped a robust process of talent identification from schools and colleges to a three-division club level participation. “In the present situation, there will be a substantial reduction in the number of players from Mumbai and these organisations would be reluctant to recruit players and may not want to maintain teams. This would have a cascading effect on the entire chain,” read the letter written by M.M. Somaya and signed by several players, including Dhanraj Pillay, Mervyn Fernandes, Viren Rasquinha and Joaquim Carvalho.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mumbai-legends-seek-continuity/article31976140.ece
03 July 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||KSL postponed to 2021-22 season||Kerala Football Association’s (KFA) proposed franchisee based league, Kerala Super League (KSL), has been postponed due to COVID-19. KFA was expecting to start the eight-team league this season in November and had held preliminary round of discussions with the stakeholders early this year. However, the pandemic and the grim economic situation put paid to itsr hopes. The KSL was modelled on the likes of ISL and was set to replace the Kerala Premier league (KPL) this season. “We had been thinking of starting a franchisee based professional league for quite sometime. Things started falling in place when some business houses and individuals showed interest and approached us. We had planned to start KSL initially with eight teams,” said P. Anil Kumar, the KFA secretary. “Preliminary discussions with stakeholders were held in January. We had fixed the next round of discussion in April but the lockdown and the grim economic situation accompanying it has left us with no choice but to postpone the start of the league to 2021-22 season,’’ he added. As per the terms of the contract, the KSL clubs will have to pay a franchisee fee to KFA. The clubs can then recruit foreign players and coaches, and other support staff. The franchisees will also have to promote football at the grassroot level. “The winner of KSL will get an automatic entry to the second division I-League. Since we got proposals mostly from north Kerala, we had decided to have six franchisees from that region. Gokulam FC and Kerala Blasters were also supposed to play in the first edition,” said Anil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ksl-postponed-to-2021-22-season/article31976018.ece

Three units But, besides Hockey Karnataka, the State has Hockey Coorg — one of the nerve-centres of the game in the country — and Bengaluru Hockey Association as associate members of Hockey India. Until now, the three bodies from the State have been fielding separate teams in various categories and divisions at the National level. It remains to be seen what fate befalls them. The situation is similar to the one in Maharashtra which has three associations — Maharashtra (based in Pune), and Mumbai and Vidarbha as associate units. On Thursday, several Olympians and former players from Mumbai wrote to Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju and the IOA seeking continuation of the separate identity.

03 July 2020||Ghaziabad,||Khadi footwear could comfort its makers and users||As “vocal for local” gains currency, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is pushing Agra’s shoe manufacturers to try khadi as an alternative to natural and synthetic leather. “You can’t completely replace leather but in a world which is increasingly becoming conscious of ethical shopping, khadi is a functional option we can work with,” said Puran Dawar, chairman, Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Chamber. “Right now, many creative people stay away because we are dealing with leather,” he said. “It is breathable, provides variety and can be used in the mass market as well as in the fashion industry. We have seen designers often don’t give enough focus to shoes when they create their collections,” said Mr. Dawar, whose Dawar Group, along with the Trishuli Group, have made some samples of footwear that features khadi. Designer Shruti Kaul of the Trishuli Group said she has been exporting jute shoes for some time. “Khadi shoes could be an ideal eye-catching option for bridalwear. Girls look for matching shoes with every dress at an affordable price and khadi shoes provide that option,” she said. The use of fabric in shoes, particularly for the summer months, is not new. Mr. Dawar pointed out how Vietnam has been a centre for canvas shoes and how major sports shoe brands use woven textiles for uppers. To provide strength, Mr. Dawar said the soles were being made of polyurethane systems, and expanded and other types of rubber. Ms. Kaul said the KVIC had provided them the fabric with batik, tie and dye, and Madhubani prints, and they used embroidery to embellish them. Supplies from China Mr. Dawar said the lockdown and the clash with China had impacted the shoe industry in Agra. He added, “We get most of our export orders for winter between March 15 and July 15. We have already lost 50% of the orders. Now, we are trying to salvage the rest. The good thing is that our labour is local and has already returned to work.” The industry uses buckles, zippers, and other embellishments that come from China. “It is like in a shoe of Rs. 1,000, a part of Rs. 50 is from China. In future, these could be procured locally as well but the government should ensure that the delivery of these Chinese parts, for which payment has already been made and are lying at different ports, should reach us,” Mr. Dawar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/khadi-footwear-could-comfort-its-makers-and-users/article31975744.ece

Kadru becomes the mother of a thousand snakes and a jealous Vinata opens one of her eggs. A half-formed child emerges and curses her for her impatience. Vinata is tricked into becoming Kadru’s slave.  Vinata began to serve Kadru and her children and waited patiently for her second son to be born. One day, Garuda emerged from the second egg. He had the body of a human but an eagle’s wings, talons and beak. Endowed with superhuman powers, Garuda grew to a massive size within a few minutes. Since his mother was a slave, Garuda too had to serve Kadru and her serpent sons. When he asked his mother about it, Vinata told him how she had been cheated. A request to the snakes Once, when Kadru and her sons wanted to visit an island, Vinata had to carry Kadru on her shoulders and swim across the waters while Garuda had to carry the snakes. Deliberately, he flew close to the sun and the snakes were scorched by the heat. Hearing their screams, Kadru prayed to Indra, who sent cooling rains to save the snakes. Garuda then decided to strike a deal with the snakes. “Set my mother and me free,” he said, “and I will give you whatever you ask for.” The snakes knew how powerful Garuda was and decided to ask for what they thought was unattainable. “If you can bring us the nectar of immortality or amrit, we will set you both free.” Garuda knew this was a risky proposition but agreed. He told Vinata, who blessed him and sent him on his way. Garuda flew first to the Himalayas, where he met Sage Kashyapa. He told his father about his mother’s enslavement and the price of freedom set by the serpents. Sage Kashyapa advised Garuda to catch a gigantic elephant and a colossal tortoise that had been fighting each other for many years. “Eat them both, it will give you the strength you need,” said the sage, while blessing him. Garuda flew in the direction indicated. The two monstrous animals were so busy fighting that they didn’t even notice when Garuda picked them both up, one in each claw, and settled on a tree to eat. But the branch broke under his weight. As it fell, a horrified Garuda noticed that there were some rishis hanging from it. Quickly he swooped under it and caught it with his beak. These were the Valakhila sages who were responsible for his birth. Advised by them, he set the branch down on a mountain top. When the rishis departed after blessing him, he ate the elephant and the tortoise. Now he had to get to Amaravati for the nectar. To be continued...  When Garuda asked for his mother’s freedom, the snakes wanted him to bring them amrit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/garuda-is-born/article31976297.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Like a champ||“I can’t do this,” muttered Tej as he stood on the steps and looked at Maxi, short for Maximus, the family’s new German Shepherd puppy. “Why are Mom and Dad so blind to what I feel?” His mind went back to the many times Sheena had known what he was thinking and comforted him when he was upset. Sheena just knew. And since he had not needed to express himself, he had not learnt how to do so. So, he couldn’t go to his parents now and say, “Why did you bring Maxi here? No one can take Sheena’s place!” Because, there was no way he could talk about Sheena without losing his ability to speak. So, he watched Maxi investigate their small front garden and wondered what Sheena had been like as a puppy. Sheena had been fully grown when Tej was born and, according to Mom and Dad, she had decided from Day One that he belonged to her. She followed him everywhere and she let him do anything with her: even let him ride her like a horse! “She’s a dog, she doesn’t understand, don’t try her patience,” Mom would say, as she tried to get Tej away from Sheena. But it seemed that she did understand. Because she never retaliated. Sheena’s unwavering affection for him made her patient and long suffering when he was small and then an excellent companion when he grew older. Now, it was already three months since Sheena had died, but Tej would still wake up at night and reach out for her hoping that, by some miracle, her death had been a bad dream. But his hands would touch nothing but air and reality would strike. ‘Mom and Dad must have thought if they got another German Shepherd into the house, I would forget Sheena!’ Tej thought. ‘As if anyone else can take her place!’ In reality Suddenly, Tej realised that the sound of Maxi’s activity was missing. He looked from side to side. Maxi was not in the front garden. “Maxi! Come here, boy!” he called, but there was no whine in reply. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Tej saw movement on the road. It was Maxi! He must have squeezed through the gap in the bars of the gate and gone out to explore. As Tej opened the gate to retrieve Maxi, a pack of dogs turned the corner and his heart stopped. What if they attacked Maxi? Maxi moved forward and so did the three dogs. They went down into a crouch and growled and Maxi seemed to realise that they had no friendly intentions. He froze and began to tremble — and then suddenly, a huge dog leapt out of nowhere and stood over Maxi and snarled at the advancing dogs. They stopped in their tracks and whined. Maxi lost his cowering stance and stood up straight within the protective fortress of the big dog’s legs. He looked up at the dog and some kind of message seemed to pass between the two because Maxi turned and ran back and jumped into the safety of Tej’s outstretched arms. Tej looked down at Maxi and, for a moment, he was confused. He did not recall opening his arms to the puppy. In fact, he had forgotten all about Maxi when the big dog had arrived — he had been reaching out for her, because even with her back to him he would have recognised Sheena anywhere. He moved towards her in a half-trance as she held her ground against the three attackers. He squatted and put Maxi down and the puppy rubbed himself against Sheena’s legs. Tej didn’t notice that the three dogs had turned tail and fled. He was concentrating completely on Sheena in the circle of his arms. And then he felt Maxi climbing onto his knee and, in the same moment, he realised that his arms were empty. Sheena was no longer there. But he could feel her breath, he could hear her soft half-sigh, half-snort and, as Maxi stood on his thigh and reached up and licked one cheek, he felt Sheena do the same on the other cheek. “Don’t go,” he whispered. But Sheena was gone. And yet, she was still there. Telling him without words that she would watch over him. And Maxi.  She followed him everywhere and she let him do anything with her: even let him ride her like a horse!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/like-a-champ/article31976316.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Uninvited guests||We were watching TV when something caught my eye. I turned to look but there wasn’t anything there. The drawing room led into the dining room. The table was set for dinner and the butler was hovering around. Outside, the grey swirling mist had crept up from the valley and enveloped the house in its woolly blanket. It was twilight. The perfect way to begin our holiday and relax after a long gruelling drive. The home stay was picturesque, set as it was atop a mountain. It had a large garden with trees in the periphery. The butler came in and announced that dinner was ready and disappeared. We took some time getting to the dining room — dragging ourselves out of the comfortable sofas, stretching, yawning and finally switching off the television. We walked into the dining room and were amazed to see that every plate around the table had hot piping food on it and it was fast disappearing. We could hear the soft clunk of cutlery, the sound of water being poured into glasses as soft whispers of polite conversation floated in the air. But there was no one sitting on the chairs. It was uncanny. Unseen diners “What’s happening?” I asked. My father shrugged. “Obviously, the party started without us,” said my sister in her usual sarcastic, nonchalant way. “I am not sitting on any of these chairs…oh…not chairs’ laps…” My parents looked rather green and we thought it best to leave. We went up to our rooms to see what snacks we had left over from our car ride. After a measly dinner of crumpled egg sandwiches, powdered biscuits and a squished orange that the three of us fought over, we tumbled into bed. The good thing was each of had a room to ourselves. I heard the sound of a motorcycle coming up the driveway. The sound of the engine died away and there was a silence. Suddenly, all hell broke loose as the sound of gunshots, fired in quick succession, filled the air. A door banged shut somewhere. We charged into our parents’ bedroom. After a while, we crept downstairs. Imagine our shock when we saw the state of the room. The plates were broken, the table cloth was slipping off and there was food all over…on the walls, the floor, the mantel…on every possible surface. But what troubled us the most was the fast spreading red stain on the carpet. There was no sign of the butler. We called out to him but he was nowhere to be found. The house was quiet and let out no secrets.  To be continued...   The grey swirling mist had crept up from the valley and enveloped the house. It was twilight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/uninvited-guests/article31976320.ece

If, by any chance, you come upon a caterpillar in your vegetables or among your balcony plants, you can transplant it along with its food plant into a box with holes. Watch the caterpillar grow, keep feeding it with the same plant leaves or vegetables you found it on and make sure you brush out the droppings and clean the box daily. It will give you great joy to watch the caterpillar metamorphose into a pupa and then a butterfly. Release the butterfly and give it back its freedom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/six-and-crawling/article31976333.ece

Benson, a young bee who lives in a hive with his family and friends, is about to join the hive’s Honex Industries honey-making workforce after graduating from college. When Barry realises that he will not be able to change careers, he grabs an opportunity to join a group of Pollen Jocks to collect pollen from flowers outside the hive. While on the expedition, he gets lost in the rain and is stranded on the balcony of a human florist named Vanessa, who ends up saving his life. Soon, Barry and Vanessa become friends, breaking the sacred rule that bees are not supposed to communicate with humans. While on an outing with Vanessa, he is shocked to discover that humans have been stealing and eating honey for centuries. He also learns about the poor treatment of the bees in the bee farms, including the use of bee smokers to subdue the colony. Enraged, Barry decides to sue the human race. Just as it begins to look like justice is restored, with the shift in nature’s balance, the world’s plant life is on its way towards extinction. Will it? Will Barry find a new balance among humans and bees? And will he be able to take up a job he loves? Beeswax  The animators spent thousands of hours observing bees to learn how to animate them and then drastically cartoonified them. In the real world, male bees don’t contribute to the honey-making process. It is done entirely by females. Two teaser trailers were released for the film that featured Seinfeld dressed in a bee costume, trying to shoot the film in live-action and failing miserably. The character Barry B. Benson was the presenter for Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film on the 80th Academy Awards for 2008.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/sweet-revenge/article31976339.ece

They had put Floppy on the machine and pretendied to scan his abdomen when disaster struck.  Mad Malini was holding a cup of coffee and a samosa when she entered the sonography room. “What are you doing here?” she asked when she saw Rani operating the machine. I tried to block her from seeing Floppy. She was about to sip her coffee when Floppy yelped. Mad Malini pushed me away from the gurney. Floppy jumped and tried to paw her face, spilling the coffee over her sari. “Get out!” she screamed. Floppy tried to eat the samosa which had fallen. We made a quick exit. We skidded to a halt only when we spotted Mrs. Charumathi. She was still thanking us for being good children by rewarding us with a candy each when Mad Malini stormed into Ma’s room. Awaiting punishment Dreading trouble, we headed home. Rani quickly wrote an apology letter and made me sign it too. Pa and Ma were in a good mood. There was no mention of Floppy or Mad Malini when dinner was served. Restless, Rani handed over the letter to Pa. “Turns out something good happened due to your mischief,” said Pa. “Is Mad Malini quitting?” I asked. “No,” said Ma. “Floppy is going to have an operation.” “Why? What’s wrong with him?” I asked. “Floppy has been chewing a lot of plastic bottles. There are a few bottle caps lodged in his stomach,” said Pa. “Sister Rosie is going to town with Floppy next week for the operation," he added and went on to answer Rani’s queries about operations on animals. Pa didn’t believe me when I said it was all Rani’s idea. As with all other punishments, it didn’t matter whose idea it was. Both of us were punished. Luckily for us, our cycles weren’t taken away. We were barred from the clinic indefinitely. On the plus side, we got to play with Floppy whenever we wanted. “Why do you mess with Dr Malini?” asked Pa. Rani had no answer. But I had one. It was fun to tease her; she reacted to everything we did. But we couldn’t tell Pa this. A week later, Floppy underwent a tummy operation. For two weeks, he wore a silly-looking white lampshade around his head to stop him from scratching and pulling out the stitches.  To be continued...   It was fun to tease Mad Malini because she reacted to everything we did.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/floppy-gets-a-scan/article31976291.ece

Instituted in 1991–1992, it is awarded annually to those who excel at the international level with performances over a period of four years taken into consideration. The recipients get a medallion, a certificate, and a cash prize of Rs. 7.5 lakh. The Arjuna Award is also given to athletes in recognition of their achievements in sports. It was instituted in 1961 and the winners take home a cash prize of Rs. 5,00,000 along with a bronze statue of Arjuna and a scroll. This year, the deadline to submit nominations for these honours was extended from June 3 to June 22, to accommodate any difficulties in getting recommendations from relevant authorities or former athletes due to the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19. Sportspersons were allowed to nominate themselves. Among the nominees this year, one name that stands out is that of weightlifter Saikhom Mirabai Chanu. The Indian Weightlifting Federation has nominated the former World Champion and Rajiv Gandhu Khel Ratna awardee for the Arjuna Award this year. This makes Mirabai one of the rare athletes who have bagged the Khel Ratna Award even before getting the Arjuna Award.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/the-nations-best/article31976274.ece

Your parents tell you to wash your hands or sanitise them as often as possible, especially if you have been outside, or to wear a face mask even! What does all this mean? What is the coronavirus? How do you catch the coronavirus? You must have plenty of questions running through your mind about this popular word. Call for answers An answer to these questions and more can be found in the illustrated digital book Coronavirus: A Book for Children. It also answers questions such as What happens if you touch the coronavirus? Why are people worried about catching the coronavirus? Is there a cure for the coronavirus?

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Let the world know how curious you are||How do we get rain?  Water from the oceans, seas, rivers, lakes and ponds is heated by the sun’s rays and turns into water vapour through a process called evaporation. This vapour rises into the atmosphere and there forms tiny droplets through another process called condensation. These droplets then collect into clouds. As they collect, the cloud becomes bigger and heavier and finally come back to earth as rain. The amount of rain that falls over a period of time is measured using a rain gauge. The village of Mawsynram, in the East Khasi hills of Meghalya, receives the highest amount of rainfall in India.  What purpose do tears serve?  Apart from clearing your eyes of dust and bacteria and keeping them moist, tears also help soothe people when they are upset. Crying releases certain chemicals in the body and not only makes your mood better, but also helps relieve pain and lets you sleep better. Tears also act as a signal to others that you are in pain, not feeling well or in some kind of distress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article31976285.ece

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||The singer who had a unique voice||Geographical distance is no challenge in this era of technological advances. Actors, singers, directors and composers shared their memories of Malaysia Vasudevan, who had that unique resonant voice, which produced hundreds of hits. The occasion was Vasudevan’s 75th birth anniversary and an online tribute was organised by his son, Yugendran, who is stationed in Auckland, New Zealand.  Maestro Ilaiyaraja , under whose baton, Malaysia Vasudevan sang the most number of songs, recalled the numerous recording sessions the two of them had. “A good singer, he was a loveable friend to,” he said. Director Bharathiraja highlighted Vasudevan’s Tamil diction and clear pronunciation. “Before I became a director he took me to a producer and introduced me to him as a good story writer. The producer wanted a thriller and I finished a script in three days. That was Sigappu Rojakkal . He sang many songs for my films of which I would mention ‘Poongatru Thirumbuma...’ Ilaiyaraja and Vasudevan gave many hits. We often went out and when I didn’t have the money, he would spend for both of us. When I got my first film, 16 Vayathinile , we decided to record the songs first. SPB was supposed to sing the two songs — ‘Sevvanthi Poomudicha Chinnaka’ and ‘Attukutti Mutaittu’ —but he was not well. On Ilaiyaraja’s recommendation, Vasudevan was roped in and he never looked back. I cannot forget the role he played in Oru Kaithiyin Dairy . “All the songs he sang for me were super duper hits,” said Rajinikanth and went on to mention “Pothuvaga En Manasu Thangam,” ‘Oru Thanga Rathathil’ and ‘Pokkirikku Pokiriraja.’ When he was in his last days (I had no idea at that time) he wanted to meet me. We met in my house. To my query, ‘What can I do for you?’ his reply was that he just wanted to see me. When I pressed on he said, ‘I’m counting my days. Wanted to see my best friends and you are one of them.’ I couldn’t control my tears. He took leave and in a few days passed away. Only a few can feel their end approaching. He was one of them. I know his son Yugendran and his family well. I’m sure they all have their father’s blessings.” “His 75th birthday would have been celebrated in a grand manner had Malaysia Vasudevan been among us today,” observed Kamal Hassan , for whom Vasudevan had sung many hit songs. A simple man, his speciality was he could sing in different voices, like TMS, SPB and so on. “He lives on in his music,” said Kamal. “Our connection goes back many years, so I’m certainly the right person to talk about him,” said actor Sivakumar , who traced Malaysia Vasudevan’s early days, his Kerala origin, the parents’ migration to Malaysia for work and then Vasudevan’s return to Chennai to explore his prospects as a singer. He would sing like ‘Chidambaram’ Jayaraman in light music troupes and it was music director V. Kumar, who found his unique talent and offered him a song in Delhi to Madras, a film produced by Sivakumar’s uncle Rathnam. MSV gave him a chance to sing in the film, Bharata Vilas (for Major Sundarrajan in the song, ‘Inthiyanadu En Vedu’). “Vasu sang the song, ‘Kalam Seiyum Vilaiyattu,’ in Gumasthavin Magal , in which I acted with Kannada actor Aarthi. It was A.P. Nagarajan, who called him ‘Malaysia’ Vasudevan,” informed Sivakumar. “In 30 years, he has sung some 8,000 songs, folk being his speciality. He was the music director for Samandipoo , in which Shobha acted with me. He has acted in 85 films with all the top heroes. His son Yugendran is also a fine singer and actor. He produced and directed Naan Sirithal Deepavali , in which I was the hero,” he concluded. Ennamma Kannu... Calling Vasudevan his dear friend, Sathyaraj recalled the days of Mudhal Vasantham in which Vasudevan was Vettaikkara Gounder and himself Kungumapottu Gounder. “How can one forget, ‘Ennamma Kannu...’ punch line of Mr. Bharath, which Vaali used as the opening phrase of the super hit song, tuned by Ilaiyaraja,” asked Sathyaraj, who said Vasudevan was always with him in the form of his songs. “My father was a great inspiration for Malaysia Vasudevan,” revealed Radha Ravi , who underlined many of his talents. “I want Yugendran, also a singer-actor, to preserve his father’s legacy,” he said. “That hit song, ‘Koil Mani Osai’ was rendered by him in my debut film, Kizhakke Pogum Rail ,” reminded Radhika Sarath Kumar, whose favourite, however, is ‘Poongatru thirumbuma...’ Radhika said she shared screen space with him in many films, including Uzhavan Magan  Malaysia Vasudevan lent his voice for many of the commercials, produced by S.V. Ramanan . “I was there at some of the happy moments of his life. He took my blessings when he got married and when Yugendran was born. When he bought a new car, he took me on a pleasant drive. When his son Yugendran wanted to enter tinsel world, he wanted it to happen through my film. I was directing the teleserial “Savithri” at that time and gave Yugendran a role. Vasudevan was simple man with great talent,” said Ramanan.  A.R. Rahman said he owed it to Malaysia Vasudevan. “I entered the field as a keyboard player and ‘Malaysia’ Vasudevan recommended my name to CBS, a music company. That changed my life and I started to compose and make music. I made my music album, “Disco Disco” there. The kind face of Malaysia Vasudevan is etched in my mind, where it will stay forever,” he said. “He began by singing for new heroes and rose to sing for the thespian Sivaji Ganesan,” observed Vidhya Sagar , who had assisted Vasudevan, when he composed music for films. “I cannot forget his warmth and kindness,” he said. Calling Vasudevan a versatile singer, Yuvan Shankar Raja said that his favourite was ‘Allithantha bhoomi annai allava...’ “He could sing any type of song — both soft melody and fast paced songs like ‘Aasai 100 Vagai, Vazhvil 100 Suvai.’ I miss him very much,” he said.  S.P. Balasubramaniam recalled how Malaysia Vasudevan joined his troupe as a singer. He was introduced by Ilaiyaraja, whose Pavalar Brothers was also part of this group. Vasudevan sang songs rendered by Chidambaram Jayaraman and Tiruchi Loganathaan. This association endured for 10 years. “He was different — in looks and thinking. Well-built, he had a heart of a child. When he passed away I was not in the country and couldn’t pay my respects, something I regret till today. I always thought he did not get the due recognition for his immense talent. He was a good singer, a fine actor and a fine human being,” said SPB.  S.P. Sailaja sang ‘Aayiram Malargalae...’ as her tribute. K.S. Chitra rendered a few lines of ‘Malaiyoram mayilae...’ Mano remembered all those concert tours they made together, for 20 years. Shrinivas , who was a college student when Vasudevan made his entry, was floored by the throw of his voice in ‘Muthu Mutha’ and ‘Agaya Gangai.’ “I would call him Kishore Kumar of Tamil cinema,” he said. Sujatha’s first duet was with Vasudevan. Unni Menon only could associate the words, gambeeram and karunyam with Vasudevan’s voice. “He was humble and it showed in his speech and manners,” said K.J. Yesudas. “I have sung songs in both Malayalam and Tamil with him. He stands tall in the music field,” he added.  Gangai Amaren married his sweetheart, thanks to Malaysia Vasudevan and SPB. “He occupied an important place in my life. There are certain songs, which nobody can sing. A good actor and wonderful singer, he was a great friend,” said Amaren.    Singers Alap Raju, Anuradha Sriram, T.L. Thyagarajan, Abdul Hameed, music directors Sathya, Devi Sri Prasad also paid encomiums to Malaysia Vasudevan. Then followed a marathon segment, which comprised a session with RJs from nine countries — India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Dubai, and London — sharing their favourite and the most popular songs of Malaysia Vasudevan on their radio channels. In a three-hour live session, playback singers SPB Charan, Vijay Yesudas, Devan Ekambaram, Bhavatharini, T.L. Maharajan, Haricharan, Mukesh, Surmukhi, Rajaganapathi, Roshini, Nikhil Mathew, Hariharasudhan, Ranjith and Venkat Prabhu sang the songs of Malaysia Vasudevan as a tribute. The event was hosted by Dhivyadharshini.  Malaysia Vasudevan (1944-2011) was active for fifty years, singing playback for all the actors, in many styles||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-singer-who-had-a-unique-voice/article31975515.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Another feather in Bharatanatyam’s cap||“It is a matter of great pride not only for all of us at Apsaras Arts, but also for the Indian dance community that the Indian classical dance is among the first six inaugural recipients of ‘Stewards of Singapore’s Intangible Cultural Heritage Award.’ Instituted by the National Heritage board of Singapore, this award is given to individuals or groups dedicated to the promotion and transmission of intangible cultural heritage in Singapore. This award recognises our founder’s vision to celebrate local traditions and arts, nurturing young talents to be showcased internationally,” says Aravinth Kumarasamy, artistic director of Apsaras Arts, Singapore. The institution in a way is an offshoot of Kalakshetra, where Neila and Satyalingam spent nearly 20 years, initially as students and later, as faculty besides being a part of Rukmini Devi’s Ramayana series. When they moved to Singapore, they established Apsaras Arts in 1977 to teach and promote Indian classical dance in Singapore. They achieved great success in this pioneering effort and their contributions were recognised by the Government of Singapore and Neila Satyalingam was honoured with the highest civilian award, the Culture Medallion. In 2005, the founders inducted Aravinth Kumarasamy, who was working with them, as artistic and managing director of the institute. Aravinth, a native of Sri Lanka, is a multi-dimensional artiste with a strong foundation. He is trained in vocal music, veena, dance and nattuvangam, having learnt from many stalwarts both in Singapore and India. He gained vast experience by working with various cultural institutions such as the Temple of Fine Arts, Nrithyalaya Aesthetics Society and Apsaras Arts. “My desire, when I took over Apsaras Arts, was to build a dance repertory with full time artistes and create dance productions of international standards. Since there are many dance institutions to impart training here, I decided to focus more on the repertory. With the blessings of our founders, I have managed to establish this Indian performing arts company on a firm footing. We have eight dancers working full time and 12 part-time. My role as artistic director needed me to move away from performing so that I could focus on various departments such as conceptualising, composing music, research and writing scripts, choreographic design, raising funds and marketing. “I wanted to create a space for artistes to meet, discuss and share ideas, upgrade their skills. My experience of many years in the IT sector helped me adopt a global perspective, imbibe marketing and management skills and apply them to the arts. The award comes as a recognition of our efforts and reiterates the faith that we have reposed in our path,” says Aravinth. Exploring new ideas Apsaras Arts has created over 10 original dance productions in the past decade and a half. Some of the noteworthy productions are ‘Angkor – Untold Story,’ ‘Nirmanika — Beauty of Architecture,’ ‘Agadhi’ on the plight of refugees, ‘Heroines of Raja Ravi Varma,’ ‘Alapadma – The Lotus Unfolds’ and the more recent magnum opus ‘Anjaneyam - Hanuman’s Ramayana.’ They have constantly explored new ideas like ‘Kannagi’ — the first live musical in Singapore with O.S. Arun singing live as Kovalan and Anita Ratnam and Anandavalli as Kannagi and Madhavi respectively. “At any given point of time, we work on four or five concepts, researching material for nearly three years, before narrowing down to one or two that will lend themselves to dance-theatre,” says Aravinth about the methodology. “Once the theme is finalised, I go through a mapping process and choreographic design. Then we sit down to write the script, compose music, choreograph, train the dancers, work on costume, lighting and sound design, production, publicity and marketing. If it is a small production, choreography is handled by Mohanapriyan Thavarajah with me composing music. For large scale works, we have two or three choreographers, a guest musician as composer and renowned dancers from all over the world to play important roles,” he elaborates. “In most of our ensemble works, we look at cross-cultural productions, collaborating with other dance forms such as Cambodian, Javanese and Balinese art forms. Our repertory company has been collaborating with Esplanade on the Bay since 2006 and as a part of their annual Kala Utsavam festival we premiered ‘Anjaneyam...’ in 2017. We invited Rajkumar Bharathi to score the music, Sai Shravan for soundscape, Gyan Dev Singh for lighting design and dancers, V. P. Dhananjayan, Balagopal, Haripadman and Lavanya Ananth to collaborate with Javanese artistes. We had Abhishek Raghuram and Savita Narasimhan sing live with Javanese musicians. Conceived over a four-year period with 18 months of rehearsals, this show was a huge success, getting rave reviews. This work was also chosen as one of the inaugural performances, screened by the newly launched ‘SISTIC LIVE,’ a digital platform by SISTIC LIVE, Singapore.” Aravinth feels the need to look at the vast unexplored art forms of South-East Asia. Inspired by his manaseeka guru Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam, he wants to look at the Natya Sastra connections in places such as Thailand and Bali, where Bharatamuni is venerated. He describes his experience: “Once, when we visited Cambodia, we were invited to a dance school in Phnom Penh. When we reached, they suggested we wait and watch their prayers. All the dancers, teachers, musicians came out and displayed the instruments and costumes. It was Thursday (Guruvaar), and they were offering prayers to Brothrishi Bharata. I was stunned because even in India, we offer prayers to preceptors only on Vijayadasami and here they were praying to Bharatamuni every Thursday. I now had no misgivings about working more with South-East Asia.” Also, he cannot forget their dance tour of India, when they travelled across the country performing in many small towns and villages. Carrying their instruments and costumes they used every form of transport — trains, vans and cars to bullock carts, cycle rickshaws and even boats to reach the venues. Aravinth is proud of the fact that his ensemble is managing to sustain itself professionally. “We have nearly four shows every month and we present only our productions. All our works are based only on Bharatanatyam because we need to work with what the dancer’s body is trained for. There is no need to look beyond, for Bharatanatyam gives us enough scope for creative explorations.” Inspired by Milapfest, he started a decade ago, ‘Dance India Asia Pacific,’ in collaboration with the Singapore National Arts Council, Milapest and Esplanade Theatres on the Bay. A development initiative combining dance training programme, conferences, talks, book readings and film screenings, it attracts more than 2,000 participants from Singapore, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Australia, and other countries. He has received many awards and is a member of the advisory board of National Arts Council, Singapore. “My dream is to see our ensemble gain greater recognition as a world class Bharatanatyam repertory company,” says Aravinth Kumarasamy.  The couple’s contributions were recognised by the Government of Singapore and Neila Satyalingam was honoured with the highest civilian award, the Culture Medallion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/another-feather-in-bharatanatyams-cap/article31975532.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||The lawyer who revered Tiruppugazh||The first half of the last century was a time when lawyers of the High Court of Madras were known for their multifarious interests. Apart from being deeply involved in their profession, they left their mark in areas such as social uplift, culture, education and of course the freedom struggle. One among them was T.M. Krishnaswami Iyer, who combined a highly successful career in law with a passion — the propagation of Tiruppugazh. It is no wonder that Mahaperiyava of Kanchi made a word play out of his initials and conferred on him the title ‘Tiruppugazh Mani.’ Krishnaswami Iyer was born in 1885 into a culturally rich family of Tiruvaiyaru and the T in his name stood for that hallowed village’s other name — Tiruvadi. His ancestors were from neighbouring Akhilandapuram and proudly bore the suffix of Rayar, a title that had been given for services to the East India Company. Having studied at the Pachayappa’s School, Kanchipuram, Krishnaswami Iyer joined the Pachayappa’s College, Madras, for his intermediate. He then graduated from the Madras Christian College with a B.A. degree before qualifying in law in 1905. He enrolled in the High Court of Madras in 1907, which was the year when two others, Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer and K.V. Krishnaswami Iyer also joined. Within a decade or two, this trio had cornered practice in the Court to such an extent that it was said that you had to be named Krishnaswami in order to succeed at the Madras Bar. T.M. Krishnaswami Iyer’s career graph was reflected in the way he moved residences — from various places in Mylapore to the palatial Bala Vilas he built in a cul de sac off Royapettah High Road. His illustrious neighbours were members of the legal Vembakkam clan and also Sir S. Varadachariar. Between 1943 and 1947, at the invitation of Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer, he served as Chief Justice of Travancore State and after Independence reverted to practice in Madras. He passed away in 1967. Today he is better remembered as the maternal uncle of Rukmini Devi Arundale — her mother Seshammal being his sister. But what made him a legend in his lifetime was his passionate renditions of Tiruppugazh. In keeping with the humorist SVV’s parody of Mylapore lawyers — their days are filled with court cases and in the evenings they wear sacred ash and rudraksham and participate in bhajans — Krishnaswami Iyer became an active participant in congregational singing. He was blessed with a powerful voice that aided him in Court and also in his hobby. A lifelong devotee of Lord Murugan, who to him was an ever-present companion, two occurrences furthered his passion for Tiruppugazh. The first was his devotion to Vallimalai Swamigal who was himself an exponent of these verses. The second was the gifting by P.N. Appuswami, the pioneering writer on science in Tamil, of two volumes of Tiruppugazh. Perusing them, Krishnaswami Iyer became a lifelong devotee of the work. The early bhajan sessions were around the four Mada Veethis of Mylapore during the month of Margazhi. He soon began commanding a vast following not just in Madras but in practically every nook and cranny of what was then Madras Presidency and later Madras State. He was invited to perform at various cultural forums and temple festivals, all of which he accepted, chiefly because of the love he had for Tiruppugazh. At times cases had to be adjourned to facilitate his travels and yet, the Court officials, and his clients, were most understanding. It is interesting to note here that one of the cases he successfully conducted was for the defending of copyright to print a picture of Lord Muruga, by a Madras company! In his time, it was customary for lawyers to call on Judges on New Year’s Day. Krishnaswami Iyer changed that culture. To him Murugan was the supreme arbiter and he encouraged people to spend New Year Eve at Tiruttani instead. The Tiruppugazh Padi Vizha there soon became famous. With a verse sung at each of the steps of which there are 365 in number, the devotees would gather and climb up, having their darshan at dawn on January 1. The crowds became so heavy in certain years that special trains had to be run from Madras city. A good tennis player and also a follower of Annie Besant for a while, his religious side was a study in contrast. But as Justice Patanjali Sastri said, “There is no doubt about his intensity and faith.” Mahaperiyava’s title of Tiruppugazh Mani came about as early as in 1928. In the 1950s, he was conferred ‘Tiruppugazh Jothi’ by Swami Sivananda. But perhaps what he liked most was how the devotees referred to him. To them he was Tiruppugazh Appa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-lawyer-who-revered-tiruppugazh/article31975561.ece

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Songs with a healing touch||The story of ‘Anandamrutakarshini’ in Muthuswami Dikshitar’s life is spoken of to this day in Tamil Nadu villages. Artist and musician S. Rajam captures the scene in a highly evocative canvas. As Dikshitar sings, his eyes look up to the sky. The villagers of Ettayapuram had sought Dikshitar’s help to escape from the fury of an unprecedented drought. Dikshitar’s answer was the kriti ‘Anadamrutakarshini,’ set to raga Amritavarshini. S. Rajam very aptly paints the raindrops drenching the rooftops even as Dikshitar raises his arms inspiringly in prayer and sings, ‘Anandamrutakarshini.’ Praising the Goddess as ‘Shive Bhavani,’ he pleads, ‘Salilam varshaya varshaya’ (Let the rain pour, and pour abundantly). Musicologist Prof. P. Sambamoorthy writing on the life of Dikshitar talks about how he also came to the rescue of disciple Thambiappan, who was suffering from an incurable stomach ailment. Realising that the illness was because of the unfavourable position of Guru in Thambiappan’s horoscope, Dikshitar composed ‘Brihaspate’ (raga Atana), as an offering to Guru. He asked Thambiappan to sing the kriti every day. Legend has it that the kriti proved to be a magical cure for the disciple. Dikshitar went on to compose nine songs each as a prayer to the nine planets (navagraha). These compositions are among his most famous group kritis. Extolling the nine planets ‘Suryamurthe,’ Dikshitar’s first Navagraha kriti, in raga Saurashtra, is believed to boost the immunity of those rendering it. It is clear that Dikshitar believed that mantras could be powerful when coupled with devotion and faith. Epics describe how Sage Agasthya shared ‘Aditya Hrudayam,’ with Rama ahead of the battle against Ravana. This hymn in praise of Surya helped Rama gain strength before heading for the battlefield. According to eminentmusicologist/musician Dr. S. Ramanathan, in the kriti ‘Suryamurthe’,the words ‘Saurashtrarna mantraatmane’ (you are the embodiment of the Saurashtrarna mantram) referring to the Gayatri mantra when chanted daily gives energy and develops positivity. Similarly, ‘Angarakamaasrayamyaham’ (Surutti), in praise of the presiding deity of Tuesday (Sevvai), Dikshitar takes us to Vaideeswaran temple, where Siva, the healer, is hailed as Vaideeshwara. To this day, those looking for a cure for ailments head to Vaidyanatha Kshetram, where there is a special sanctum sanctorum for Lord Angaraka.  Dikshitar’s Navavarana kritis, in praise of Goddess Kamalamba of Tiruvarur, are also about healing. Each kriti provides an incomparable visualisation of the Sri Chakra. A kriti in this series ‘Sri Kamalambikayam’ (Sahana) visualises the ‘Sarva Rogahara Chakra’ (embodying a cure for all diseases). Dikshitar describes Kamalambika as ‘Sarva-roga-hara niraamaya raja yoginyam’ and as ‘Hreemkara Sushareerinyam’ meaning: ‘An embodiment of Hreem, she is the Raja Yogini, who removes all illnesses.’ Coming back to the Navagraha kritis, for those who have the planet Saturn in an unfavourable position, Dikshitar’s ‘Divakara Tanujam’ (Yadukulakhambodi) could be the prayer. Dikshitar refers to Saneeshwara as ‘Malini vinuta’ and ‘Kalachakra bhedachitra bhanum.’ Malini is said to be Draupadi’s name while in exile with the Pandavas. As Malini, she worshipped Saneeshwara to rid her of her sufferings. Legendary musicians such as Madurai Mani Iyer used to render at their concerts Navagraha kritis for each day of the week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/songs-with-a-healing-touch/article31975545.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Waiting for the doors to open||Laptop and mobile phone screens have turned into the stage. Home has become an auditorium. Audience etiquette no longer matters. You can lounge on the couch and watch your favourite artiste perform. You can like, share or comment to express your appreciation. Meeting artistes backstage seems a distant past. The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the way we engage with the arts. While artistes are exploring the digital medium to reach out, the term ‘performance space’ has gained a new connotation, with the lockdown bringing the curtain down on live shows. And as long as the social distancing norm is in place, the possibility of the auditoriums reopening by the end of the year or even early next year, appears remote. Performance theatre owners across the world are not quite in favour of an interim seating arrangement with many empty seats since it would neither be economically viable nor augur well for a live show. One of India’s premier cultural centres that hosts more than 700 multi-genre events each year, the Mumbai-based National Centre for the Performing Arts set up in 1969 by JRD Tata and Dr. Jamshed Bhabha, has managed to stay connected with art lovers through the NCPA@home digital series. The series includes contemporary presentations, traditional performances, literary sessions, symphony orchestras and lec-dems. With five theatres, including the 300-seat Experimental Theatre, NCPA is a sought-after venue for both intimate and large-scale productions. But, with the pandemic forcing its doors shut, chairman Khushroo Suntook, who is also the co-founder of the Symphony Orchestra of India, elaborates on the challenges, concerns and hopes. How effective can the digital platform prove for the performing arts? Dissemination on the digital platform has existed for many years. At the NCPA, we have been hosting screenings of operas, ballets and plays for our patrons from institutions across the world such as the National Theatre, London, The Metropolitan Opera and the Bolshoi Theatre for some years now. For us, streaming archival performances with NCPA@home has helped reach out to newer audiences. We have witnessed a sense of community develop among viewers, who log on to our YouTube channel every weekend at 6 p.m., brought together by their love for culture. This strengthens our resolve to curate and present performances of the highest order for this ever-growing community. How do you perceive the future of performing arts? Do you think artistes will have to rethink their presentation style? Virtual learning and consumption is currently the new normal and we need to adapt to this form in order to reach a wider audience. As things gradually normalise, the performing arts will return to the theatres, however, the digital platform and theatres will co-exist. The evolution of the presentation style of artistes is a continual process, which factors in the dynamics of contemporary circumstances. How difficult is it going to be to keep a watch on quality of the online content? For cultural centres that insist on offering the best, this is a constant challenge. The NCPA is committed to adhering to the highest standards in the performing arts and will continue to present performances that live up to this benchmark, whether they are virtual or in front of a live audience. Some theatres across the world are facing permanent closure. Your thoughts on the situation in India. In India, culture centres and the artiste community have stepped up to keep art forms alive among their fans. It is vital that the government and art patrons support institutions during such times. How does NCPA plan to cope with the new set of challenges? We have already started coping with the new situation through constant investigation of the way forward, approach to programming and maintaining and building on our rich archives, teaching on the digital platform, and creating new material to be put out before we return. Through our digital initiatives like NCPA@Home and Utkarsh, a lecture-demonstration series, we have reached out to art lovers. We see these times also as an opportunity to explore other mediums for the dissemination of our content so that our audiences across the world can watch their favourite artistes and a host of exclusive performances. The initiatives will continue to run on digital platforms after we gradually reopen our doors to the audiences of live performances. What kind of measures you think are essential to help artistes, especially folk artistes in dire financial straits? This is an area where the government must help. Showcasing the folk traditions of India has been integral to NCPA’s programming. We continue to promote the folk performers of our country online. What about the future of live events? If one is to see the trends in Europe/abroad, the return of audiences to theatres will be a sure, even if a somewhat slow, one. We are currently working towards implementing sanitisation and safety measures to be fully prepared to bring live art to our patrons post lockdown. Do you think the immense response to your @home series reiterates the importance of archiving in art? The importance of archiving in art cannot be emphasised enough. Archiving has been an important facet of work at the NCPA since its inception and we are looking at using the best available technology to archive our programmes not only for the purpose of documentation but also for the digital medium. How has Mr. Suntook been spending the lockdown period? It has been busier than my regular working days with Zoom meetings and conference calls with our team, advisory committees, council members and consultants abroad to brainstorm strategies for the institution. In addition to our performances on @home, I try to keep myself updated with concerts around the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/waiting-for-the-doors-to-open/article31975535.ece
05 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Perfect proportion||Embellishing and enhancing the performance of other artistes requires constantly calibrating oneself with the other musicians on stage, and putting a lid, as needed, on one’s own creative urges. Especially so for accompanying violinists. L. Ramakrishnan, a prolific performer, has understood this role impeccably and rises to the occasion. He observes his fellow artistes closely, anticipates and follows carefully and knows how much, and where exactly, to play. Senior vocalist S. Sowmya says: “His knowledge of vocal music, his quest for learning and asking questions, are creditable. He plays in strict proportion. One has to practically beg him to play more.” Ramakrishnan Murthy adds: “He is the ideal partner to have on stage — he will bring out the salient points of what has been sung and spur you on as well.” He also avoids the common tendency of replaying what the co-artiste rendered but a few notes behind — though uncomfortably dissonant, it is so common that rasikas are desensitised. Mentored by Dr. Sulochana Rajendran at Shanmukhananda Vidyalaya in Bombay, Ramakrishnan learned violin there from Visalam Vageeshwar. He completed the seven-year course getting the Shanmukha Mani title in 2001. In 1996, he began learning from A. Kanyakumari. Focus on sahitya suddham On the combination of institutionalised learning and individual lessons, he says, “Listening to several other students play in a formal classroom situation is invaluable. We imperceptibly pick up much of what to avoid or imbibe right there. But just as one cannot be good in a language with correct grammar alone, Kanyakumari teacher made me realise much more, teaching me how to bring in ‘sahitya suddham’ in playing, to stress syllables and which ones to, to play gamakams in proportion, how to accompany and where playing might actually hinder the overall experience of the concert.” After graduating with a degree in Electronics and Communication, Ramakrishnan moved to Chennai on work. He was performing regularly and began learning from T.K. Govinda Rao too. Besides in-depth knowledge of ragas and kritis, Govinda Rao also taught Ramakrishnan to never let his guard down. Accompanying Govinda Rao at a concert, Ramakrishnan mentally relaxed after the main piece ‘Thiruvadi Charanam’ (Khambodi) and the tani avartanam concluded. Govinda Rao threw a googly, though. He sang ‘Adhaya Sri Raghuvara’ in Ahiri….with kalpanaswarams! “I knew Ahiri. But never thought of swarams in that raga!” He was called out on stage. It is difficult to digest public criticism but the then-22-year-old Ramakrishnan took it constructively. “It was an excellent lesson for me. I learned to be prepared for anything, literally.” The sense of positivity and possibility is an integral part of Ramakrishnan’s mental make-up. “I know Ramakrishnan since 2008 when he used to come home to practice — we would play one ragam for hours together. He has the amazing ability of explaining the most intricate nuances in a simplified manner,” says Abhishek Raghuram. From 2009-2015, Ramakrishnan was in Connecticut on work “to defray my house payments as quickly as possible.” Soon after his wedding in 2011, the couple met B. Balasubramaniyan of Wesleyan University, student of T. Viswanathan. Ramakrishnan learned a lot of the intricacies and compositions of the Dhanammal bani from Balasubramaniyan. Upon returning to Chennai, Ramakrishnan quickly got back into the performing circuit. He suggests accompanying violinists learn as many kritis as possible and listen to different patantarams without judgment. Otherwise, one has to be completely concentrated on looking at the artiste’s face and lips to just figure the piece out. Ramakrishnan Murthy says his own understanding of ragas has been enhanced by Ramakrishnan’s nuanced knowledge gleaned from his vast repository of compositions. “This was evident at the lecture demonstrations he recently did,” he adds. "Mistakes will happen. We should acknowledge it and move on immediately. A sense of humour is essential. If we insist on proving ourselves again and again, it can detract from the concert as a whole for the rasika," says Ramakrishnan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/perfect-proportion/article31975542.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Narayana Tirtha Jayanthi goes digital||Sri Narayana Tirtha Jayanthi celebrated annually with concerts organised by Thirupoonthuruthy Sri Narayana Tirtha Swamigal Trust was conducted online on July 1. A Tarangam series featuring the performances of well-known artistes is being streamed on the social media pages of the Trust. Swathi Ravichandran, Thirupoonthuruthy Venkatesan’s grand-daughter, decided on a digital celebration to avoid cancellation of the Jayanthi this year due to the lockdown. Besides concerts, the Trust members want to create awareness about rare Tarangam gitams. Artistes select a gitam (a song from 12 chapters/Tarangams of Sri Narayana Tirtha’s ‘Krishna Leela Tarangini’) of their choice, the sahityam for which is provided by the Trust. This is followed by a video recording of the artiste rendering the gitam, which is shared on social media platforms.

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Print to celluloid — hits and misses||News about Kalki ’s magnum opus, Ponniyin Selvan being made into a film by none other than Mani Rathnam provided food for this writer’s thoughts. So many Tamil novels have been turned into films, many meeting with success, some falling by the wayside. The visual may convey in a minute what two pages of writing does but what comes across as interesting or absorbing while reading may fall flat on screen. This happens when the films do not rise to the expectations raised by the novel. However, filmmakers find it hard to resist works of fiction. Wishing Mr. Ratnam the best in an endeavour, which has eluded many directors and actors in the past, let’s see what works have attained celluloid status and with what degree of success. And we can start with Kalki’s Thyaga Bhoomi (1939), which scripted success for the famous director, K. Subrahmanyam. Based on the freedom struggle, it was serialised in Ananda Vikatan , with movie stills as the shooting proceeded. It featured K.J. Mahadeven (Sridharan), S.D. Subbulakshmi (Savitri) and Papanasam Sivan (Sambu Sastrigal) in the main roles. Released much against the wish of the British government, the film was a huge success. A noted success was Kalki’s Kalvanin Kadhali (1955), which dealt with the tragic love story of Muthian and Kalyani starring Sivaji Ganesan and P. Bhanumathi with artistes such as T.R. Ramachandran, Sarangapani and T.S. Durairaj supporting. Suspense revealed   Parthiban Kanavu (1960), again of Kalki, did not do well in spite of an impressive star cast — Gemini Ganesan, Vyjayanthimala, S.V. Ranga Rao, S.V. Subbiah, P.S. Veerappa, T.S. Baliah and so on. The songs, composed by M. Vedha, however, were hits. A reason cited was the film revealed the identity of the Jatamudi Sivanadiyar, which was a closely guarded secret in the book.  Thigambara Samiyar (1955) based on the novel by the famous Vaduvoor K. Duraiswamy Iyengar was a commercial success. Produced by Modern Theatres and directed by T.R. Sundaram, the movie had M.N. Nambiar, M.S. Draupathi and M.G. Chakrapani. A popular novel, Karunguyil Kundrathu Kolai titled as Maragatham (1959), a thriller by TSD Sami, with Sivaji Ganesan, Padmini and Chandrababu proved to be a damp squib at the box office. A massive box-office hit was Malaikkallan (1954), adapted from a novel by Namakkal Kavignar, of the same title. M. Karunanidhi wrote the screenplay for this Robinhood kind of tale, which had M.G. Ramachandran and P. Bhanumathi in the lead, produced by Pakshiraja Studios. It was made into several languages. Popular novelist Lakhsmi’s two novels were turned into movies — Kanchana (1952) a triangular love story of Mathur Zamindar Pushpanathan (K.R. Ramasami), his wife Kanchana (Lalitha) and his mistress Bhanumathi (Padmini). Again a Pakshiraja production, the movie had nice songs tuned by S.M. Subbiah Naidu. Yet, it failed to impress the audience. After a decade, the same author’s Pen Manam was adapted as Iruvar Ullam (1963). Sivaji Ganesan and Saroja Devi played the lead roles. A movie from Prasad Studios, it turned out to be a hit. Akilan was another novelist, three of whose works attracted film makers. His popular novel, Paavai Vilakku , published in Kalki,  was made into a fiilm in 1960 with popular actors Sivaji Ganesan in the titular role of Thanikachalam, a writer, and as the four women who enter his life Pandari Bai, Kamala Laxman, Sowcar Janaki and M.N. Rajam. The film, directed by K. Somu, was studded with good songs composed by K.V. Mahadevan but was not well-received by the audience. The other two — Vaazhvu Enge and Kayal Vizhi met with moderate success as films. The former was Kulamagal Radhai (Sivaji Ganesan, Saroja Devi and Devika, 1963) and the latter, an absorbing historical, came out as Maduraiyai Meetta Sundarapandiyan (MGR and Latha, 1977). Renowned writer Jayakanthan’s works kindled the interest of filmmakers, at least three making it to the big screen. Yarukkaga Azhudhan? was made into a film of the same title with Nagesh in the main role. Critically acclaimed, it did not set the cash registers ringing. On the other hand, Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal , serialised in Dinamani Kathir (1970), worked out extremely well on the silver screen with Lakshmi and Srikanth in the main roles. Lakshmi’s essay of Ganga, especially was superb. Oru Nadigai Nadagam Parkiraal (1978), attempted with the same pair, however, met with a cold response from the audience.  Women centric novels Sivasankari’s women-centric emotional novels enjoyed the attention of film makers for some time. K. Balachander filmed the author’s 47 Natkal (1981), which was serialised in Idayam Pesukirathu, weekly, under the same title. Readers loved the story of the young village girl Visali, who marries Kumar and accompanies him to Paris. Shocked to find him already married to a white woman, she discovers that his motive is to cheat her of money and return to India. How she thwarts his plans putting her safety in line made for a racy serial. But not so as a film, in which Chiranjeevi and Jayaprada played main roles. Neither Avan Aval Adhu ( Oru Singam Muyalagiradhu on surrogacy) nor Nandu (same title on cancer) created ripples in the box office. Both the novel and the film were successful in the case of Manian’s Ilavu Kaaththa Kili . K. Balachander translated it very well on screen. With lovely songs (MSV) and the KB touch in every scene, Sollaththaan Ninaikkiraen (1973) was a huge hit. A blockbuster was Idhaya Veenai , with MGR leading a cast, which had Manjula, Lakshmi, Sivakumar, M.G. Chakrapani, Nambiar, Manohar and Thengai Srinivasan. That the script deviated from the original is a different matter. An evergreen hit is Thillana Mohanambal (Kothamangalam Subbu, serialised in Ananda Vikatan in 1958). A.P. Nagarajan brought the characters alive in the film (1968) with a galaxy of actors, led by Sivaji Ganesan. Nevertheless, the same team’s attempt to recreate Rao Bahadur Singaram as Vilayaattu Pillai (1970) turned out to be a damp squib. Celebrated writer Sujatha enjoyed the maximum attention of the film-makers. Priya (1978), the Sridevi-Rajinikant starrer directed by Sp Muthuraman was a huge hit Ilaiyaraja giving hummable songs. Gayatri (Sridevi and Rajnikanth), Vikram (Kamal Hassan) Idu Eppadi Irukku? with Jaishankar (original Anita Ilam Manaivi , which incidentally was Sujatha’s first novel) and Karaiyellam Shanbagapoo were the other attempts, which were not box-office hits. Director Mahendran made a poignant film of Mullum Malarum , Umachandran’s prize-winning novel in Kalki . Ilaiyaraja’s enchanting music contributing to the success of the film. Oru Oodhappu Kann Chimittugiradhu of Pushpa Thagadurai (Srivenugopalan) was made into a film of the same title with popular stars Kamal Hassan, Sripriya and Vijayakumar and was received well by the audience. Vaasanthi’s Moongil Pookkal, the story of a bold and determined woman was made into a Malayalam movie Koodevide (1983) starring Mamootty, Suhasini and Raguman. In the hands of Mahendran, Puthumaipithan’s Sitrannai blossomed into the critically acclaimed Uthiri Pookkal (1979). Recent times saw Visaaranai in 2016 based on the narrative of M. Chandrakumar and directed by Vetri Maran receiving both critical and public acclaim. So was the case with Asuran (2019), based on Poomani’s Vekkai, starring Dhanush in the main role. This list is by no means comprehensive. As long as film-makers have a thirst for potential scripts, this translation will continue, each enriching the other. Finally, it is left to the readers, who decide whether what they see does justice to what they have read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/print-to-celluloid-hits-and-misses/article31975509.ece

For instance, in ‘Alapadma...,’ I created an Alapadma alarippu, where the group movements were designed to look like a blossoming lotus. For the boat sequence in ‘Agadhi,’ the entire scene showed the refugees getting into the boat and travelling in the sea. The choreography was based on a soundscape, which was a mix of the rhythm of the waves and heartbeats. It was highly appreciated for bringing out the anxiety of the refugees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/moves-for-the-themes/article31975528.ece

03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Have your tea and eat your teacup, too||It is a small tea kiosk, that could be easily lost among the clutter of shops on Madurai’s busy West Masi Street. But in the last five years, it carved a niche for itself, not only by selling its own brand of tea called the RS Pathy Nilgiri Tea, but also by selling it in edible, chocolate-flavoured biscuit cups. Ever since the concept was launched on June 15, the shop has been selling a minimum of 500 cups a day. “Had it not been for the lockdown, we would have seen many more people crowding the shop,” says Vivek Sabaapathy, a fourth-generation member of the business family. It was his idea to introduce tea in an edible cup. But Sabaapathy is not alone: the cups, made by Hyderabad-based Edco India, are also popular with milkshake sellers and others in different cities. “We are the only manufacturers of this innovative product in India,” says Rohan Pamnani, MD of Edco India. He soft-launched the teacups nine months ago with a milkshake company as a trial. By the time Sabaapathy approached him for the product to be used for a hot beverage, COVID happened. “The pandemic has put brakes, but we are now working on introducing more flavours and also increasing the shelf life of the edible teacups beyond 10 weeks,” says Pamnani. The cup tastes like a cross between an ice cream cone and a chocolate biscuit and holds 60ml of hot tea for about 10 minutes. That is roughly the average time people take to finish the tea before turning to the cup, which turns soggy on the inside and has that very familiar taste of a biscuit dipped in tea. At Rs. 20 each, the cuppa has already earned a fan following in Madurai. “People are finding it safe, hygienic and a little more filling than the regular cup of tea, and are also happy about its zero-waste value,” explains Sabaapathy, who had spent a year searching for something suitable to serve his brand of tea in, following the State Government’s ban on plastic in January 2019. In the first consignment that arrived, he suffered 50% breakage in transportation and both Pamnani and Sabaapathy learnt their lessons fast. “We are getting them in sealed packets of six each that are placed safely in recyclable crates (similar to egg crates),” says Sabaapathy, who is also tying up now as a stockist for Tamil Nadu. The lockdown has delayed deliveries, but the breakage has now been reduced to less than 20% with improvised packaging, he says, and also hopes to get multiple flavours of the biscuit cup soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/have-your-tea-and-eat-your-teacup-too/article31976079.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Nine of those killed were forced to shout Jai Shri Ram||Nine Muslim young men, who were killed and their bodies thrown in a drain during the February communal riots in north-east Delhi, were forced to shout Jai Shri Ram before they were stripped, thrashed and bludgeoned to death. 51 killed in riots A total of 51 persons were killed in the riots that followed fierce protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the capital. More than 750 cases have been registered in connection with the riots and the murders, a copy of the charge sheet seen by The Hindu , said. The nine victims were identified as Mursalin, Aas Mohd, Aamin, Bhure Ali, Hamza, Musharraf, Akil Ahmed, Hashim Ali and his elder brother Aamir Khan. In their charge sheet, the Delhi police have mentioned that these nine Muslim men were murdered in the period from the evening of February 25 till late night on February 26. Their bodies were recovered over a period of several days from the Bhagirathi Vihar drain. The police arrested Lokesh Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Ankit Chaudhary, Sumit Chaudhary, Prince, Jatin Sharma, Himanshu Thakur, Vivek Panchal and Rishabh Chaudhary, after confirming their involvement in connection with the nine murders. All of them are in judicial custody. They were part of WhatsApp group “Kattar Hindut Ekta” that was created on February 25 to take “revenge” from Muslims. The creator of the WhatsApp group is still absconding. One of the accused Lokesh Solanki on February 25, messaged in the “Kattar Hindut Ekta” group: “Brother Lokesh Solanki this side from Ganga Vihar area if any Hindu need any back up then do contact. We have men, arms and ammunitions. I have just killed two Muslims in Bhagirathi Vihar area and thrown them in drain with the help of my team.” “Their [attackers] modus operandi was, they used to catch the people passing through the area and ascertain their religion by asking name, address and by their document i.e. Identity Card and they were forcing them to call ‘Jai Shri Ram’ many times. The person who was not calling ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and carrying the identity of Muslim identity, they were bluntly attacked and thrown into the Main Ganda Nala [dirty drain], Bhagirathi Vihar, Delhi,” the charge sheet said. A Police Control Room (PCR) call on February 25 at Gokalpuri police station and the caller mentioned: “Here Muslims are being killed and their vehicles are being burned.” The caller, who was a Hindu, and an eyewitness in the case, was traced during the investigation. The eyewitness himself was accosted by rioters on February 24 and found that his motorcycle was missing after he managed to free himself. On February 25, he went to the Gokalpuri police station to register a complaint that his bike had been stolen. At about 4 pm, while returning home from the police station, he saw a large mob carrying stones, cudgel, sticks, swords, and iron rods on Johripur pulia (bridge) shouting slogans like “Jai Sri Ram” and “Har Har Mahadev”. They were checking the identity of persons passing through and if any Muslim was found they were beating and throwing bodies in the drain after killing them. Most of the people in the mob were wearing helmet or had their faces muffled. He identified several rioters who were the part of the mob, the charge sheet said. Another eyewitness, in his statement to the police, said that he was part of a crowd of Hindu youth chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ that brought out one person belonging to the Muslim community from his house and beat him with Sticks and stones. When he died, they dumped his body into the drain. A Muslim man, who lost his shop and three vehicles in the riots, told the police that about 200-250 people had assembled near the Johripur drain and were raising slogans like Jai Shri Ram, Hindu Ekta Zindabad, Jaago Hindu Jaago in favour of the CAA through loudspeakers. Since many of them were locals, he knew them by name. Armed mob All of them were carrying iron rods, sticks, lathis, dandas and were insisting that Hindus assemble and kick out Muslims community people from Bhagirathi Vihar, Delhi. They torched his shop located on ground floor of his house. He somehow managed to save his family. WhatsApp chat transcripts are also part of charge sheet where rioters were talking about how many Muslims they have killed, offers for reinforcements and request of arms and ammunitions were also placed on the chat group. The WhatsApp chat transcripts between the “Kattar Hindut Ekta” group members clearly fell in the category of extra-judicial confessions and had been done voluntarily, the charge sheet added. During the investigation, some more co-accused/suspects persons -- Monty Nagar, Avdesh Mishra @ Sardar, Monu, Sahil @ Babu, Shekhar, Mongli, Baba and Tinku – were identified but are yet to be are to be arrested since their addresses could not be ascertained. After their arrests, a supplementary charge sheet will be filed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nine-of-those-killed-were-forced-to-shout-jai-shri-ram/article31975899.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||In close company||In Nalgonda’s Tangedu Vanam, across just an acre of land, grow over 36 native varieties of wild and flower-bearing trees. The story of this recently inaugurated mini-forest in Lakkaram village began two years ago, thanks to the Miyawaki method of growing urban forests, in a short duration using little space. As the monsoon arrives, we explore this unique method of afforestation, heralded by Haritha Haram, the six-year-old annual afforestation drive promoted by the Telangana Government. The Yadadri pattern follows the Japanese Miyawaki technique (invented by botanist Akira Miyawaki), which is fast gaining popularity, especially in urban areas. “The techniques may be the same, but we have not followed the system blindly. Since our soil and species are different, we have modified the Miyawaki model to suit our conditions,” says Priyanka Varghese, OSD (Officer on Special Duty) to CM K Chandrashekar Rao, adding that the method of plantation trial initially began in Mancherial. Mini forests Tangedu Vanam — demarcated from 125 acres of forest area that was cleared for a traditional plantation — was developed under constant supervision. District Forest Officer DV Reddy says, “Dry and fresh leaves are put on the cleaned area. Soil enrichment is essential before plantation, but existing trees should not be removed during this phase.” Native plants yield good results. The key is to begin with a number of plants in a small space — 4,000 plants per acre, including the native forest species neem, jamun, ravi, chinta, velaga and sitaphal . With farmyard manure and husk to retain moisture, the area showed significant results in one year. Elaborates Reddy, “Watering plants with tankers and pipe sprinklers instead of flood irrigation is a must till the rainy season. Also, mulching helps in suppressing weeds and preventing evaporation.” Close competition K Purushottam, district forest officer of Warangal district shares, “In a traditional method of planting, branches grow at a distance but here plants are close and compete for sunlight. Local species adapt and survive to grow and form a thick canopy.” Recalling his experiences of implementing the Miyawaki method in the National Institue of Technology, Warangal, he says, “Native saplings like raavi (peepal) , marri (banyan) , vepa (neem) , rela (golden shower) , chinta (tamarind)  and moduga (flame of the forest) were used. Our work started in August last year and a mini dense forest can already be seen. Besides giving an aesthetic look, biodiversity increases and groundwater recharges in such areas.” These green movements initiate healthy ecosystems and attract birds and animals, says retired Forest Officer Mukka Prakash. The 25 native varieties that his team planted on a barren area near Warangal Fort benefited from a nearby lake and have grown to four and a half metres. “The soil is enriched by native vegetation,” he adds. While these carefully curated plants create green oases in barren lands relatively quickly, the initial steep cost at Rs. 5.3 lakh per acre poses a challenge, though Priyanka says it is more economical in the long run. “In a traditional method, although one plants fewer seeds, it needs regular ploughing and replanting and even then the canopy cover achieved is not huge. This Miyawaki method is economical as the expenditure is only in the first year and the benefits can be seen from the second year itself,” she says. She hopes to see this method being used in open spaces in the city. She adds, “Haritha Haram has different components. Besides the creation of an urban forest, our focus is to rejuvenate a natural forest, create avenue plantation and use the Yadadri model of dense plantation forest with the patch of land available.”  Those interested in implementing the Miyawaki model may contact the Haritha Haram wing of the Telangana Forest Department. You will receive technical support too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/in-close-company/article31976084.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Delhi govt. launches India’s first plasma bank at ILBS Hospital||To enable the search for plasma donors more systematic, the Delhi government on Thursday inaugurated India’s first plasma bank at ILBS Hospital in Vasant Kunj. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to those who have recovered from COVID-19 to come forward and donate plasma to help others recover. Mr. Kejriwal said that people were finding it difficult to get plasma and the situation got quite chaotic in Delhi but hoped that it would improve with the inauguration of the plasma bank. Eligibility checklist Addressing a digital press briefing, Mr. Kejriwal said that apart from having recovered from COVID-19, there are other conditions the donor needs to fulfil. “They should be between 18-60 years, weigh above 50 kgs and need to have been virus free for over 14 days,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He added that women who have been pregnant at some time in their life, people with diabetes, hypertension, cancer survivors, those with chronic heart, liver, lung and kidney diseases and high blood pressure cannot donate plasma. He assured people that there are no side effects and that it was completely safe and would only take between 45 minute to an hour of their time. Donors need to call 1031 or WhatsApp 8800007722 to register and the government will contact donors and see if they are eligible to donate and schedule a time to visit the plasma bank. Doctor’s prescription For those wanting plasma, the CM said that the hospital will contact the plasma bank. “People whose family members or relatives are admitted in the hospitals and are advised plasma therapy please do not directly call on 1031 or WhatsApp helpline to seek plasma for therapy,” the CM said. He added that the doctors will prescribe plasma therapy to those patients and the hospital will contact ILBS, and the plasma shall be provided to the hospitals on the basis of the doctor’s prescriptions. Mr. Kejriwal said that there has been a reduction in number of deaths in Delhi but we need to bring this further down. “Until a vaccine is developed, plasma donation is the only way we can prevent deaths,” he added. “We are not saying that no casualties will happen because of plasma therapy, but the results have been encouraging and it has shown that it will help reduce the death rate and save lives,” the CM said. He added that people should be encouraged to donate and dispel all misinformation about plasma donation. “Until now, 58,000 people have recovered from COVID-19. So I urge everyone who is eligible to come forward. You get very less chances of saving someone’s life, if God has given you this chance, please do not hesitate to use it to save a life,” the CM appealed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-govt-launches-indias-first-plasma-bank-at-ilbs-hospital/article31975918.ece
03 July 2020||July 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Lost between truth and fiction||Loneliness is hyper-real in Werner Herzog’s Family Romance, LLC . The German auteur’s gaze on longing and solitude is raw and unfiltered. Through documentary aesthetics of using a single camera, often moving uncomfortably close to the actors’ faces, Herzog brings out a feeling of intrusion, as the film follows Yuichi Ishii, a father-on-hire, to an unsuspecting 12-year-old, Mahiro Tanimoto. There is a rudimentary, almost dispassionate perspective on what seems like a bizarre business, when taken out of cultural context, where one can rent a father, friend, or co-worker. The film has rough cuts almost to an amateurish degree. One would expect this realism to cut close, yet Herzog’s film has a detached quality to it, one that barely manages to make an emotional dent. The sentiment that overrides is that of oddity. Even as the narrative meanders and the subject at hand has profound relevance in the modern world, the film evokes a feeling of strangeness, rather than of introspection. The disconnect between the film’s aesthetics, staccato acting and intriguing subject, forms both the appeal and dissonance of the film. Known for his documentaries as well as his fiction features, Herzog could have captured this subject in one of his non-fiction works. He showcases Tokyo intermittently through clean drone shots, which function as an antithesis to the film’s otherwise rough look, yet again blurring the lines between reality and fiction. The casting also lends this film some verisimilitude. Ishii, who runs a rent-a-family service off-screen, may not be a terribly good actor, but his sheer presence, playing a version of himself on-screen, feels like one big meta-joke. As he goes about his routine, and eventually forms a bond with Mahiro, while pretending to be her long-lost father, and dealing with her affection in a morally-conscious way, he provides for a fascinating character study. It makes me wonder if he’s the same in real life. It’s this play between truth and imagination that’s most intriguing about this film, which otherwise is utterly banal. With a conscious obfuscation of fact and fiction, Herzog perhaps wishes to comment on performative relationships in modern times. The intent is most evocative in a scene where Ishii explores a robot hotel, speculating on the possibilities of AI having emotions someday. While commenting on the capitalist world, where money can buy relationships, Family Romance, LLC illustrates a larger dystopian reality, where human connections are transactional. In one of his interviews at the Cannes Film Festival, where the film had its world premiere in 2019, Herzog talks about ‘quasi-friendship’ in the world of social media. Family Romance, LLC in that light, has a lot to say about how these quasi friendships could one day become the biggest export of a soul-less capitalist world. But the film's biggest drawback is that intent and commentary seldom match what we see on-screen. What we are given is as blank and bland as AI humans, who perhaps have a lot going on inside their heads.

03 July 2020||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan to speed up ease of doing business measures||With the Centre linking reform parameters to the additional borrowing limit of States, the Congress government in Rajasthan has decided to speed up the ease of doing business (EoDB) measures. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot will monitor the progress of EoDB parameters in the State with the identification of focus areas. Chief Secretary D.B. Gupta said here on Thursday that Mr. Gehlot would preside over meetings every month to ensure time-bound implementation of all the EoDB measures. The business-related government processes will be made accessible online and rendered free of any physical contact in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Gupta said that ensuring the achievement of EoDB goals was the need of the hour, while the responsibilities would be fixed and core areas pinpointed in the schedule to meet the targets. The State government will convene monthly meetings with the Secretaries of the departments concerned as well as the nodal officers.  Additional borrowing The Union government has linked the implementation of EoDB parameters with the States’ additional borrowing limit, which has been established at 2% of the respective Gross State Domestic Product. Mr. Gupta said that 1% of Rajasthan’s GSDP amounted between Rs. 10,000 crore and Rs. 11,000 crore. The States are expected to comply with the directives till January 2021. Rajasthan proposes to create a centralised portal at the State level to help the districts implement the business reforms under the guidelines. The portal will also have a provision for the future requirements, as the Centre keeps amending the EoDB criteria. Mr. Gupta has given instructions to the related departments to enhance coordination with the Department of Information Technology for the purpose. He said the guidelines would be implemented under the supervision of State Industries Commissioner Muktanand Agarwal, who was the nodal office for implementation of EoDB. The State government will take into consideration the feedack of users while evaluating the implementation of EoDB parameters in order to determine that the reforms have been adopted to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-to-speed-up-ease-of-doing-business-measures/article31975928.ece
03 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||DoE launches plan to reduce academic loss to students||To reduce academic loss incurred due to schools remaining shut till July 31 in the wake of the pandemic, the Directorate of Education (DoE) has launched an alternative “remote” teaching-learning plan for students from Classes KG to XII of all government and aided schools of Delhi. Announcing the initiative, on Thursday Education Minister Manish Sisodia said a plan of action has been worked out for the students through a combination of strategies using digital devices and support from parents and management committees of schools to make online learning more effective. He added that the “learning with human feel” was the new mantra of the teaching-learning approach as digital technology would be used only to complement the efforts of teachers in reaching out to every child and assist them in learning. He added that steps have been taken to ensure that the digital divide does not come in the way of children’s access to learning opportunities. “The core of our approach is outreach and connection between teachers and their students. Our teachers will reach out to their students through WhatsApp or regular phone call. Give them light assignments and take regular feedback. In the process, they will also find out the well being of children,” Mr. Sisodia said. The DoE said that Classes KG to 12 have been divided into three cohorts to follow three distinct strategies to support the learning of students. “Step-by-step process has been laid down by which students of Class KG to Class X who are in cohorts 1 and 2, will get specially developed worksheets through their class teachers on WhatsApp that they will complete and send back,” the DoE said. It added that those parents who do not have access to WhatsApp groups will be contacted over the phone by the class teachers concerned and invited to the school to collect the worksheets for the entire week. Only parents will be invited following the physical distancing protocol. For students of Class XII, the DoE said, live online classes will start from next week in 12 subjects and the respective subject teachers in the school will follow up with their students over phone or WhatsApp and clear doubts, if any.  Step-by-step process has been laid down by which students of Class KG to Class X who are in cohorts 1 and 2, will get specially developed worksheets on WhatsApp Directorate of Education||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/doe-launches-plan-to-reduce-academic-loss-to-students/article31975916.ece
03 July 2020||New Delhi,||Private laboratories cannot stop conducting COVID-19 onsite tests: HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday said that private laboratories in the Capital should approach the Delhi government if they are facing any issue over continuing with the collection of onsite or home collection of samples for undertaking the RT PCR test for COVID-19. A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonuim Prasad noted that if there was any issue with regard to extra expenses that the private labs are likely to incur on onsite or home collection of sample, which doesn’t cover their costs in terms of rate fixed for the test by the Delhi government, Rs. 2,400, they should raise the grievance with the government. “However, it is not acceptable that the private laboratories will stop conducting onsite tests at such a critical juncture where the number of cases of COVID-19 infection are shooting up phenomenally, on a day by day basis,” the Bench remarked. Petition filed The High Court was hearing a petition filed in public interest by one Rakesh Malhotra, highlighting various issued faced by the individual while conducting tests for COVID-19. Mr. Malhotra had stated that the private laboratories had several grievances against the Delhi government that have been largely resolved by the expert committee constituted by the Lieutenant Governor. Private labs But most of the private laboratories have stopped collecting onsite samples, he said, adding that he had personally called up at least 2-3 laboratories only to be informed that they are not sending anyone to collect onsite samples. Sought clarification The Delhi government’s counsel said they have written individually to all the private labs seeking a clarification from them as to whether they are continuing with the collection of onsite samples, for undertaking the RT PCR test and most of the laboratories have reverted back saying that they have not stopped onsite testing. During the hearing, the Delhi government also told the court that that there are 433 containment zones as on July 1, 2020, in the city and point of care camps have been set up at 167 locations within the containment zones for testing purposes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/private-laboratories-cannot-stop-conducting-covid-19-onsite-tests-hc/article31975885.ece
03 July 2020||New Delhi,||Details of students breached due to DU admit card portal glitch||Personal details of over 2,000 students, especially of Delhi University’s Faculty of Law, were left poorly secured on the university’s admit card portal till Thursday evening.  The Hindu was able to access over 30 admit cards of students from the Campus Law Centre, Law Centre 1 and Law Centre 2, containing their personal details due to the breach. ‘Easily accessible’ Dean of Examinations Vinay Gupta admitted that there was an issue, especially with the Faculty of Law students as details from the previous semester were accessible from the results page of the university’s website. To access the admit cards, only three fields were required to be filled up: students’ names, roll numbers and a college ‘gateway code’, which was a single code issued to all students for a particular institution. In the case of the Law Faculty Centres, students informed that the college code for all three centres were circulated on the WhatsApp group. Using this, combined with the information available online, personal details of all final-year students could be accessed. Changes were made to the process after The Hindu reached out for comments, Mr. Gupta confirmed. An OTP system was introduced for students to get their admit cards after submitting a password to unlock it. The OTP would be sent to their registered email accounts, Mr. Gupta said. The issue was initially raised by Vivek Prasad, a final-year CLC student on social media. “Delhi University’s online admit cards are a privacy disaster!...Anyone with college code [easily known] can access any student’s admit card...and see the address” he tweeted, detailing the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/details-of-students-breached-due-to-du-admit-card-portal-glitch/article31975896.ece

After seven days of June reported 3,000 or more daily new cases, the past six days have recorded daily new cases less than 3,000. The highest single-day increase in the number of cases was recorded on June 23 when 3,947 cases were reported in the city. Meanwhile, there were 445 containment zones in the city as on Wednesday as per the bulletin. On June 21, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs had directed the Delhi government to assess and review its containment zone plan, following which such zones have increased from 261 on June 21 to 445 on Thursday.

03 July 2020||New Delhi,||HC vacates order staying bail of Faisal Farooq||The Delhi High Court on Thursday vacated its order of staying the bail granted to Faisal Farooq, principal of Rajdhani Public School, due to the unresolved arguments between the Centre and the government regarding the representation of police in a riot case. Justice Suresh Kait remarked that the controversy over who will represent Delhi Police in the case has been going on since June 22, and since it is likely to continue, the accused will be prejudiced if the order staying his bail was not vacated. On June 22, the court had stayed the bail granted to Mr. Faisal by a trial court here following an appeal made by the police. Justice Kait has called for a written submission from both the Centre and the State government over who will represent the police and posted the case for further hearing on July 22. During the day-long hearing, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aman Lekhi argued that the series of verdicts from the Supreme Court and the court on the power tussle would not be applicable in the present case. The ASG argued that the judgments dealt with the power of the Delhi government to appoint public prosecutor under the Code of Criminal Procedure. With the Unlawful Assembly Prevention Act (UAPA) invoked in many of the riots cases, the ASG said the Central government was entitled to a special counsel to represent the police. Delhi government’s senior Standing Counsel Rahul Mehra, on the other hand, argued that the previous judgments of the top court and the High Court had clarified that the Lieutenant-Governor cannot appoint special prosecutors without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Mr. Mehra argued that the Delhi Police was not an ‘ordinary client’ who could choose whom to hire to represent it. “Investigation and the prosecution cannot be hand in gloves. The role of the prosecutor is of an officer of the court. There are checks and balances,” Mr Mehra argued. Mr. Farooq was arrested in connection with a north-east Delhi riots case and have been charged under sections ranging from 307 (attempt to murder), 395 (dacoity), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance) amongst others. The police have challenged the trial court’s June 20 order granting bail to Mr. Farooq on the grounds that it was prima facie not established that he was present at the spot at the time of the incident. In the order, the Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav had pointed out that Mr.s Farooq’s presence has not been recorded in any of the CCTV footage installed at Rajdhani Public School.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-vacates-order-staying-bail-of-faisal-farooq/article31975884.ece

The State Cabinet had on June 29 approved the industrial ordinance, whose details are not available. The ordinance awaits approval of Governor Jagdish Mukhi. Members of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) burnt copies of the ordinance across all its urban and rural units on Thursday, calling it a “betrayal of trust” by the Bharatiya Janata Party that had come to power promising to protect ‘jati’ (race), ‘mati’ (land) and ‘bheti’ (hearth). “The BJP has taken advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown to plot the end of the indigenous people in the name of reviving the economy. Instead of bringing in investments to boost the farm economy of the local people, it is paving the way for industrialists who have scant regard for the people, the land and the ecology,” AASU’s general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi told The Hindu . The All Assam Tribal Sangha slammed the ordinance too. “Large swathes of the tribal blocks and belts protected during the British regime have already been encroached upon. We cannot accept this ordinance that threatens tribal areas by facilitating the easy transfer of land to non-indigenous industrialists,” the Sangha’s secretary-general Aditya Khakhlari said.  Minister’s clarification Assam’s Industry Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary has, meanwhile, clarified that the ordinance will not be applicable for hazardous industries and no industry will be allowed in eco-sensitive zones. “The ordinance has been approved for MSMEs only to largely help local entrepreneurs,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/protests-in-assam-over-bid-to-convert-land-for-msmes/article31975926.ece
03 July 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Central ration embezzled in Punjab, alleges SAD||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has alleged misappropriation in distribution of Central government ration in Punjab by the leaders of the ruling party. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday demanded a probe into the ‘embezzlement’. Mr. Badal urged that ration being sent under the extended Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) should be monitored strictly through Central observers so that it is not pilfered and sold in the open market. He alleged that Punjab government failed to distribute the Central ration to migrant labourers, resulting in their exodus from the State that adversely affected its industry and agricultural operations. The party also decided to hold State-wide protests against the State government to press for immediate withdrawal of the power bills send to traders for the lockdown period. SAD trade and industry wing president N.K. Sharma said that members of the party, along with traders and industrialists, will hold protests in front of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited offices across the State. “It is shameful that the PSPCL under direction from the State government has sent bills based on average to several traders and industries for the period of three month of lockdown. This is not acceptable. We will soon launch protests,” Mr. Sharma said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/central-ration-embezzled-in-punjab-alleges-sad/article31975925.ece
