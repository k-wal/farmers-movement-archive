03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Afghan-origin terror prime concern: India||With most Indians now evacuated from Afghanistan, the Government of India on Thursday said its “primary and immediate” concern was to curb any terrorism threat to India emanating from Afghanistan under the Taliban-led regime. Responding to questions on the reasoning and nature of the meeting between the Indian Ambassador to Qatar and the chief of the Taliban political office in Doha, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) repeated that the meeting had been requested by the Taliban, and would neither confirm nor deny whether India still considered the group a terrorist organisation. “Let us just treat the Doha meeting for what it is... it’s just a meeting. These are very early days,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said when asked if India could consider recognising the Taliban government which, officials said, is likely to be announced soon. “We used the opportunity to convey our concerns, whether it was on getting people out [from Afghanistan], or on anti-Indian terror-related activities. We received a positive response,” he said. Mr. Bagchi, however, did not reply to a question about the Haqqani Network, which is among the United Nations-designated terror groups and a key Taliban member. Haqqani issue Deputy leader of the Taliban Sirajuddin Haqqani is believed to be responsible for a number of attacks on the Indian Embassy and consulates in Afghanistan, even a suicide bombing in 2008 in which Indian diplomats were among 58 people killed, and the attack on Gurdwara Har Rai Saheb in Kabul in 2020, in which 25 people were killed. The Haqqani Network is believed to have collaborated with the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) in carrying out the attack on the gurdwara, according to the Afghan intelligence agency NDS at the time. While Taliban interlocutor Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, who had sought the meeting with the Ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, on Tuesday, is slated to be the Foreign Minister of the new Afghan government, New Delhi will watch with concern the role played by the Haqqani leadership. Asked why the Taliban had asked for the meeting at all, Mr. Bagchi said he “presumed that the Taliban wanted to reach out to all countries which have interests, and are relevant”. “Without thinking, we would not have taken such a step [meeting the Taliban]. Our main, primary and immediate concern is that the Afghan soil should not be used for anti-Indian activities or terror activities. This is our focus,” he said. Mr. Bagchi told presspersons at the MEA’s weekly media briefing that very few Indians now remained to be evacuated, and the 24x7 Afghanistan special cell was in touch with them. Flying them out would depend on the resumption of flights, and concerns were raised about them in the Doha meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/main-concern-is-curbing-terror-threat-from-afghanistan-centre/article36264729.ece
03 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State mulls reopening of schools||The State government is mulling reopening of schools in the State. Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty on Thursday said an expert committee would be set up to look into practical aspects related to school reopening. The report of the committee and a project on the reopening would be submitted to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Mr. Sivankutty said. An online meeting of public health experts that was convened by the Chief Minister on Wednesday had discussed the possibilities of school reopening. Schools in many States are reopening in a phased manner despite fears of a potential third wave of COVID-19. Schools in the State have remained closed since March last year, except for three months from January this year for the students of Classes 10 and 12 who were appearing for the public examinations. However, immediate reopening of schools like in neighbouring States such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka that have managed to bring down the case graph may be difficult here owing to the high caseload and test positivity rate. No time frame General Education Secretary A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish told The Hindu that there could not be any time frame for the school reopening. The expert committee had to be set up and it would need to hold wide-ranging discussions with both experts and laymen before a decision. The situation in Kerala was not the same as that in other States that had gone in for partial reopening. Many determinants had to be taken into account here. One was the prevalent test positivity rate (TPR). Then, the level of vaccination among schoolchildren. Factors such as how many students could be allowed together at one time, how many in a classroom, and how much physical distancing also had to be considered. When schools had opened for three months earlier this year for students, a few higher secondary schools had to be closed down after a large number of students and teachers tested positive. This will also weigh on the authorities’ mind.  B. Ekbal, chair of the State’s experts’ committee on COVID-19, said the panel would hold discussions with the Education Department soon. At the meeting convened by the Chief Minister on Wednesday, experts suggested schools be reopened from primary classes upwards as they were better abled to handle the virus. The Indian Council of Medical Research too had in July suggested opening primary schools first. The experts also opined that there was evidence that school closure had limited or no impact on COVID-19. Daily screening for students, regular testing, contact tracing for students, monitoring of contract intensity were also recommended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/panel-to-look-into-prospect-of-reopening-schools/article36265035.ece
03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||CJI flags ‘communal content’ in media||Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana on Thursday said certain sections of the media communalised everything, and this would ultimately result in giving the country a bad name. The remark came while a three-judge Bench headed by him was hearing petitions highlighting how some media outlets aired communal content linking the spread of the novel coronavirus to a Tablighi Jamaat meeting at Nizamuddin in Delhi. “The problem is everything in this country is shown with a communal angle by a section of media… The country is going to get a bad name ultimately,” the CJI observed orally. Social media platforms He upbraided social media platforms for a lack of accountability. They responded only to “powerful people”, while complaints made by ordinary people, institutions and judges over content were ignored. “These Web channels, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube... They never respond. There is no accountability. About the institution they write badly and then they do not respond... This is the condition of institutions, forget individuals... They consider only people who are powerful. Institutions, common man, judges, they do not... This is the reality,” he noted. The court asked the government whether there was any regulatory mechanism in place for the Web. Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta drew the court’s attention to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which provide a redressal mechanism and timely resolution of grievances of users of social media and over-the-top platforms. The rules require these platforms to appoint a grievance redressal officer, who is a resident of India. Transfer of cases The government recently asked the top court to transfer cases challenging the Information Technology Rules from the High Courts to itself. In the case of complaints against broadcasters, Mr. Mehta referred to the Cable Television Networks (Amendment) Rules of 2021. He submitted that the Rules provided for a three-level grievance redressal mechanism — self-regulation by broadcasters, self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the broadcasters, and oversight by an Inter-Departmental Committee at the level of the Central government. “The real contest is between the freedom of the press and the right of citizens to get unadulterated news... We have tried to regulate, balance,” Mr. Mehta submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/giving-communal-angle-to-content-unwarranted-cji/article36264727.ece
03 September 2021||New Delhi,||Exports rose 45% in August||India’s merchandise exports in August touched $33.14 billion, 45.17% higher than a year ago and 27.5% over the pre-pandemic level of August 2019, but the trade deficit widened to a four-month high, driven by a sharp uptick in gold imports, show preliminary estimates released on Thursday. Merchandise imports during the month grew 51.47% year-on-year to $47 billion, which is also 18% higher than the August 2019 figure. The trade deficit widened 69.15% year-on-year to touch $13.87 billion but was just 0.07% higher than the pre-COVID level of 2019. “With merchandise imports continuing to scale up, even as exports receded from their all-time high, the trade deficit came in higher than anticipated,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at rating agency ICRA, expressing concerns about rising gold imports. Yellow metal In August 2020, gold imports stood at $3.7 billion, implying an 82.22% jump in imports of the yellow metal last month. “Gold imports surged further to a five-month high of $6.7 billion in August 2021 and were responsible for 88% of the rise in the merchandise trade deficit relative to July 2021. Unless a weaker agricultural outlook restrains demand, gold imports may well touch $40 billion in 2021-22,” Ms. Nayar warned. Net oil imports remained largely stable, benefiting from a moderation in crude oil prices, despite a rise in mobility in the country, she pointed out. In the first five months of 2021-22, India’s merchandise exports have now touched $163.67 billion, nearly 67% higher than that of the corresponding period last year and 22.9% higher than 2019. The government has set a target of merchandise exports worth $400 billion for the year. Exporters said the steady recovery in global trade was helping their order books but sought urgent attention from the government on the runaway freight rates, rampant container shortages and other policy constraints, including the release of pending benefits under earlier export incentive schemes. “The government needs to provide freight support to all exports till March 31, 2022, as freight rates have skyrocketed,” said A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Exporters’ Organisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/exports-rose-45-to-33-bn-in-august/article36264731.ece
03 September 2021||New Delhi,||Court pulls up police for ‘callous’ probe||A Delhi court on Thursday expressed serious reservation over the failure of the city police in conducting a proper investigation into a north-east Delhi riots case, noting that it “will surely torment the sentinels of democracy”. The court’s stern remarks came while discharging former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam and two others in a case related to alleged loot and vandalism in a shop during the riots in the Chand Bagh area here. It noted that there was no CCTV footage of the incident to confirm the presence of the accused at the scene of the crime, nor any independent eyewitness or evidence regarding the criminal conspiracy. “When history will look back at the worst communal riots since Partition in Delhi, the failure of the investigating agency to conduct a proper investigation by using latest scientific methods will surely torment the sentinels of democracy,” Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said. “The casualty in the matter is the pain and agony suffered by complainant/victim whose case has virtually remained unsolved; callous and indolent investigation; lack of supervision by the superior officers of the investigation and criminal wastage of the time and money of the tax payer.” “The sort of investigation conducted in the instant case and the lack of supervision thereof by the superior officers clearly depict that the investigating agency has merely tried to pull the wool over the court’s eyes and nothing else,” the judge said. About 750 riots cases were registered in the north-east district of Delhi. “This is the sole court dealing with all the matters of riots cases in north-east Delhi... There are a large number of accused persons who have been languishing in jail for the last one and a half years merely on account of the fact that the trial in their cases are not being initiated. The police seem to be busy in filing supplementary chargesheets,” the court said. “This court cannot permit such cases to meander mindlessly in the corridors of judicial system, sweeping away precious judicial time of this court when the same is open and shut case.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/court-pulls-up-police-for-callous-probe/article36264881.ece
03 September 2021||MANGALURU,||Vaccination camps are being held near houses of BJP workers, says Congress||Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of politicising the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination drive, Dakshina Kananda District Congress Committee president K. Harish Kumar said on Thursday that vaccination camps are being held near the houses of BJP activists instead of holding them at government health facilities and gram panchayat offices. While commending the government for increasing the supply of vaccine in the district where active COVID-19 cases are high, Mr. Kumar told reporters that the district administration is not holding vaccination camps in the right manner while reaching out to vulnerable people. Just 14% of those aged between 18 and 44, 57% of those aged more than 60 and 60% of those aged between 45 and 60 have so far received both doses of the vaccine. “Vaccination camps should be held at government health facilities and gram panchayat offices and not near the houses of BJP activists,” he said and added that the district administration is keeping Congress councillors and panchayat members in the dark about these camps. Cancelled Last week, the district administration cancelled the vaccination camp scheduled in Bunder ward of Mangaluru, which is represented by a councillor from the Congress. “Despite being sidelined, the Congress councillors and other elected representatives are actively participating in the vaccination camps,” he said. Mr. Kumar said that the ongoing health check-up camps by KSRTC Mobile ICU vehicle in gram panchayats of Bantwal taluk is not being held in a proper manner. The camps in the Congress-ruled gram panchayats are being held in front of the houses of BJP activists, he said. Food kits of Labour Department are not being properly distributed to construction workers in Bantwal taluk, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccination-camps-are-being-held-near-houses-of-bjp-workers-says-congress/article36265376.ece
03 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||High Court sentences 4 IAS officers, retired official to jail||The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Thursday gave varying jail terms to and imposed fines on four IAS officers — Revu Muthyala Raju (Additional Secretary to Cheif Minister), S.S. Rawat (Principal Secretary- Finance), M.V. Seshagiri Babu (Inspector-General of Registration and Stamps) and A.Md. Imtiyaz, and retired IAS officer Manmohan Singh — in a contempt case. The High Court, however, allowed the officials to make appeals in one month, during which period the jail term would be suspended. The court further ordered that the petitioner, T. Savitramma, should be paid compensation out of the salaries of these officers. Notices served Contempt notices had been served on the officials earlier for their failure to pay compensation (in spite of the court orders) to Ms. Savitramma of Nellore district for acquiring a three-acre D-form patta land at Yerragunta village of Venkatachalam mandal that was owned by her husband Venkataiah, who had died in April 2018. Petitioner’s argument While Mr. Mutyala Raju and Mr. Seshagiri Babu were Collectors of Nellore district, Mr. Manmohan Singh was Principal Secretary (Revenue) and Mr. Imtiyaz was the Joint Collector at that time. Ms. Savitramma argued that the land was allotted and given possession to the erstwhile National Institute for the Mentally Handicapped (NIMH) for the construction of its regional centre without being compensated as per rules. Moreover, when the matter was pending to be sorted out, the Mandal Revenue Officer (MRO) concerned had issued a notice dated November 5, 2016, seeking an explanation within 15 days as to why the patta granted to her should not be cancelled due to its non-cultivation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-sentences-4-ias-officials-to-jail-term-in-contempt-case/article36264678.ece

This year, the academic calendar had been designed into two levels, for Classes 1 to 5 and Classes 6 to 10 with two parts in each, administrative and academic aspects. Schools reopened on August 16 for the academic year 2021-22 and classes are being conducted in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) communicated by the Health Department and general instructions issued by the government from time to time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/academic-calendar-revised/article36264721.ece
03 September 2021||New Delhi,||RT-PCR must for flyers from 7 more nations||Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Thursday said that with reports emerging of new mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the rising number of variants of concern and variants of interest, passengers coming from South Africa, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand and Zimbabwe will have to undergo RT-PCR tests on arrival in India. “Passengers from the U.K., Europe and the Middle East are already required to take this test. International passengers will have to undergo pre-arrival RT-PCR testing at least 72 hours before boarding and only asymptomatic passengers are allowed to board a flight to India. These latest revisions have been communicated to the States to ensure strict compliance so that the import of variants into India may be prevented,” he said. He added that in the case of symptomatic and/or positive international travellers, the States must continue to implement stringent public health measures of contact tracing, quarantine, testing, and ensuring COVID-19-appropriate behaviour. The Ministry has also written to the States and the Union Territories directing them to strengthen their Whole Genome Sequencing activities, which are critical to establishing clinical epidemiological correlations. Mr. Bhushan warned that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was not over. Kerala cases He added that 69% of the total cases in the past week were reported from Kerala alone. The State currently has more than 1 lakh active cases, while four States — Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh — have between 10,000 to 1 lakh active cases. “Forty-two districts in the country are still reporting more than 100 new cases daily, which is a cause of concern. However, India has managed to fully vaccinate 16% of its adult population, while 54% has got one shot,” he said. He added that Sikkim, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Himachal Pradesh have administered the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines to 100% of their population above 18. Reiterating the need to continue wearing masks even after being fully vaccinated, Balram Bhargava, Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research, said mass gatherings should be avoided, and full vaccination should be made a pre-requisite for all gatherings. He added that India currently had about 300 cases of the Delta Plus variant but assured that the vaccine worked well in these cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rt-pcr-must-for-flyers-from-7-more-nations/article36264725.ece
03 September 2021||CHENNAI,||Foreign breeds banned in jallikattu||The Madras High Court has directed the State government to ensure that only native breed of bulls are allowed to participate in jallikattu. Henceforth, there should be a prohibition on participation of foreign breeds like Bos Taurus or cross/hybrid breed bulls (Bos Taurus x Bos Indicus). Justices N. Kirubakaran (since retired) and P. Velmurugan passed the order while allowing a writ petition filed by E. Seshan, 71, of Chennai. He had insisted on participation of native bulls alone in events such as jallikattu, manjuvirattu , oormadu , vadamadu , vadamanjivirattu and eruduthu viduthal .  Agreeing with the concerns expressed by the petitioner who lamented loss of native species, the judges directed the government to encourage bull owners and farmers to groom native breeds by providing subsidy or incentives to farmers or bull owners who do so. Veterinarians must certify the bulls before participation in jallikattu, they ordered. The court also warned veterinarians of contempt of court proceedings if they falsely certify an imported or cross/hybrid breed as a native breed and if such illegality was brought to the notice of the court. Such veterinarians would also be subjected to departmental proceedings, the court said. The Bench also ordered that the government should, as far as possible, avoid artificial insemination of animals since it would deny mating rights of animals and thereby amount to cruelty under the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960. Recalling that hundreds of bulls would get paraded to the mandaiveli (yards) in each village during the Pongal festival, the judges rued that the number had thinned now, and the native bulls were fast disappearing from villages, forcing the latter to lose their originality. The Bench pointed out that the government enacted a legislation in 2017 for conducting jallikattu, and the primary objective of that legislation was to preserve native breeds like Pulikulam, Umbalachery, Nattumadu, Malaimadu and Kangeyam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/madras-hc-bans-use-of-foreign-breeds-in-jallikattu/article36264877.ece

03 September 2021||Bengaluru,||Clusters in nursing colleges: RGUHS on alert||After two COVID-19 clusters were reported in nursing colleges this week — one in Bengaluru and another in Kolar — Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) on Wednesday issued a circular to all its affiliated colleges to be vigilant and monitor students returning from other States. A committee has been formed to ascertain reason for spike in cases, and whether there were lapses while screening students. Since August 29, 34 nursing students from Christian College of Nursing, Horamavu, have tested positive. On Wednesday, Noorunnisa Institute of Nursing in KGF reported 32 cases. In both colleges, students who first tested positive have had a Kerala travel history. In the circular, RGUHS stated that a faculty member or an official of the college should be nominated by the head of the institution to coordinate with the university on this matter. Jayakar Shetty, V-C, RGUHS, said a panel will investigate why colleges are seeing rise in cases. “All students in our colleges are vaccinated, and have to undergo testing before they report to campus,” Dr. Shetty said. While investigating the cluster at Christian College of Nursing, BBMP officials told The Hindu that epidemiologists had identified multiple sources of infection, and that it could not be on account of travel history alone, as the students had submitted RT-PCR negative tests when they returned to Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/clusters-in-nursing-colleges-rguhs-on-alert/article36264767.ece
03 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||‘Insider trading’: HC quashes ACB FIR against former A-G, others||In a major reprieve to former Advocate-General (A-G) Dammalapati Srinivas and 12 others accused of “insider trading” of lands in Amaravati, Justice Cheekati Manavendranath Roy of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on Thursday quashed the FIR registered by the Anti-Corruption Bureau under the Prevention of Corruption Act and various Sections of the Indian Penal Code(IPC). The Judge ruled that Mr. Srinivas had the liberty to claim compensation or damages against the complainants for launching frivolous criminal proceedings. Justice Roy observed that the former A-G neither had the authority to discharge any constitutional or statutory duties and functions nor had any role in the decision making process in locating the area where the capital was to be established and in bringing into force Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Act, 2014. Mr. Srinivas was also not privy to any information related to the exact location of the capital city. Therefore, the question of him disclosing the said information to the other accused and purchase of the lands by them in Amaravati on the basis of such information did not arise, and there was no truth in the allegation, Justice Roy noted. Public domain Further, the Judge asserted that information about the location of the capital was not confidential and it was very much in the public domain from June 2014 itself, and the right to acquire property was a Constitutional and legal right of the petitioners as citizens of the country. Since they had purchased the lands in exercise of their rights from the owners/sellers who willingly and voluntarily sold the lands for valid sale consideration under registered sale deeds, the said private sale transactions could not be criminalised and no criminal liability could be attributed to the petitioners, the Judge said. The concept of offence of insider trading which was essentially an offence in the field of stock market relating to selling and buying the securities and bonds could not be applied to the offences under IPC and could not be read into Section 420 thereof. ‘No conspiracy’ The sellers did not incur any loss on account of the said transactions and no conspiracy to do any illegal act or to commit an offence could be made out from the facts of the case, Mr. Justice Roy observed in a common order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/insider-trading-case-against-former-a-g-12-others-quashed/article36264677.ece

A Division Bench of Justices V. Bharathidasan and S. Ananthi directed the Secretary to the Home Department to consider the representation and pass appropriate orders in six weeks. The petitioner said she recently underwent an eye surgery, and if her son was granted leave he could take care of her as there was no one to do so. In 2019, she underwent a surgery in her left eye. At that time she had sought ordinary leave for her son, but it was not granted. In June 2021, she underwent surgery in the right eye. Pointing to Rule 40 of the Tamil Nadu Suspension of Sentence Rules (power to exempt), she said the authorities ought to have considered the fact that she was 65 years old and was facing health issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/consider-plea-for-ordinary-leave-to-ravichandran-says-high-court/article36264952.ece

03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||India keeping a watch on ties between Taliban and Pakistan||India is closely watching the Taliban’s stance towards Pakistan as it appears imminent that the outfit will form the next government based in Kabul or Kandahar in the next few days. The concern in this regard is shaped by the fact that Sher Mohammed Stanekzai, head of the Taliban’s Political Office in Doha, met India’s envoy to Qatar, giving the first sign that channels of communication between the two sides are now open. Soon after the India-Taliban meeting in Doha, Pakistan’s Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed asserted the special bond between Pakistan and Taliban, saying in a TV debate, “We are the custodians of Taliban leaders. We have taken care of them for a long time. They have got shelter, education and a home in Pakistan. We have done everything for them.” Such repeated comments from Pakistan can increase India’s discomfort, especially after the meeting in Doha. The comment from the Pakistani Minister, however, is not reflected in the Taliban’s recent statements regarding Pakistan. Since the fall of Kabul on August 15, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid has spoken on four occasions about issues that matter to Pakistan. At an initial press conference, Mr. Mujahid refused to extend the general amnesty to former Pakistani military ruler General Pervez Musharraf. General Musharraf had ended Pakistan’s open support for the Taliban just before a military coalition led by the United States overthrew the Taliban regime in 2001. The Taliban responded by launching multiple attacks on General Musharraf that failed to succeed. Mr. Mujahid refused to follow the Pakistani position on the contested Durand Line, which is a sensitive issue for the Pashtun community that resides in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. “We are still in the process of forming a government, but the Durand Line is an important matter for our nation and it will be what the nation wants,” he said. Autonomous line When asked by a reporter on the Kashmir issue, he followed the line laid by Mr. Stanekzai, and said, “Kashmir is an issue between India and Pakistan. We have nothing to do with issues that are internal to our neighbours.” Mr. Stanekzai had described India-Pakistan tension as “political and geographical”, and urged both countries to not use Afghan territory to deal with that dispute. The Taliban’s comments asserting an autonomous line is creating mixed opinions as it is well known that Pakistan’s establishment has unparalleled leverage over the organisation which has operated out of Quetta. Veteran observers here say that the Taliban and Pakistan are both aware that the former’s military success against the government of President Ashraf Ghani may influence the restive Pashtun population in Pakistani territory. Veteran diplomat Rajiv Dogra observed that the Taliban has adopted “sophisticated messaging” for independently reaching out to major countries. “This outreach to the world is new,” said Mr. Dogra, explaining the Taliban’s attempts to project itself as a free player. He pointed at the discomfort between the Taliban and Pakistan over the Durand Line.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-keeps-a-watch-on-ties-between-taliban-and-pakistan/article36264478.ece
03 September 2021||Kolkata,||CBI files chargesheet in Bengal poll violence||The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday filed the first chargesheet in a case of post-poll violence in West Bengal. The chargesheet was filed before a court in Rampurhat in West Bengal’s Birbhum district. The case involves the murder of a person at Dubrajpur in Birbhum. The two accused in the case are already in custody. The CBI has so far registered more than 30 FIRs in cases involving post-poll violence after the Calcutta High Court directed the agency to investigate cases of alleged murder and rape in West Bengal after poll results were declared. During the day a team of CBI officials visited Presidency Correctional Home here, to interrogate the accused held for the murder of a person in the city’s Kankurgachi area, days after the election results were announced. In another development West Bengal government appointed 10 IPS officers to assist the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by Calcutta High Court to investigate into the allegations of post-poll violence during West Bengal Assembly elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-files-chargesheet-in-bengal-poll-violence/article36264493.ece
03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hospitals see many cases of long COVID||Medical care facilities across the country are now offering rehabilitation programmes for COVID survivors as there have been cases of long COVID, when symptoms persist even after several weeks of the infection. The most common symptoms being reported are muscle weakness/fatigue, sleep problems and hair loss. Hospitals are also seeing cases of COVID-19 related development of tuberculosis and fungal pneumonia and cases of increased heart rate. The rehabilitation programme includes physiotherapy, psychological counselling, pulmonologist consultation and lung function tests. Akshay Budhraja, pulmonologist, Aakash Healthcare, said: “We are seeing issues with those over 30 years and aggravated complaints among the elderly.” A study, published recently in medical journal Lancet on one-year outcomes among COVID survivors in Wuhan — the epicentre of the first coronavirus outbreak in China, said that a number of survivors continued to have lower health status a year after symptom onset. “Survivors continued suffering from at least one post-COVID medical complication even a year after COVID. While most survivors returned to their original work and life, the baseline health status of some continued to be lower,” said the study, which followed the cases of 1,276 patients admitted at the Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan over one year. All patients had been released between January 7 and May 29 of 2020 after their recovery. The Union Health Ministry said post-COVID sequelae is a matter of concern and that it has been tracking the subject since September last year. “The Ministry, understanding the issue, has prescribed a holistic approach, which includes continued monitoring of health and use of Ayurveda to aid post-COVID recovery,” said an official. Keeping in touch G.S. Chabbra, director, respiratory medicine, QRG Hospital, Faridabad, said while admissions due to long COVID have slowed down now, the hospital has been in constant touch with their patients via tele medicine and hospital app. “After the second wave we did have patients with complaints of hair fall, episodes of breathlessness, joint and muscle pain,’’ he said. Neetu Jain, senior consultant of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, PSRI Hospital, said the facility gets four or five patients every day with post-COVID symptoms. On the complications related to long COVID, the Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) has urged the World Health Organisation (WHO) and governments to prioritise and fund urgent research on the link between COVID-19 and dementia. Alireza Atri, neuroscientist and chair of the ADI’s medical and scientific advisory panel, said there seems to be a clear link between “long COVID” and dementia. “We are seeing this with my patients and we need to be worried about the ‘Trojan horse’ of dementia that long COVID is leaving behind in our brains,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hospitals-see-many-cases-of-long-covid/article36264663.ece
03 September 2021||Srinagar,||A witness to Kashmir’s history||Senior separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani (1929-2021) was laid to rest in a quiet pre-dawn burial in Srinagar’s Hyderpora area. Curfew-like restrictions were imposed in and around Srinagar. Only close family members and neighbours were allowed to attend the last rites at his home. Geelani’s political career spanned over six decades. He was a witness to all the critical phases of Jammu and Kashmir’s tumultuous history — the accession to India in 1947, the dethroning of then Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah in 1953, the ascension of the Jamaat-e-Islami in the 1970s, the rise of armed rebellion of 1990s, the secret dialogue on Kashmir in the 2000s, and the end of J&K’s special Constitutional position in 2019. The history Geelani witnessed may be chequered, but his ideology — accession to Pakistan — remained linear, single-point and unwavering, to the chagrin of many dispensations in both India and Pakistan. He was elected thrice as a Member of the Legislative Assembly from Sopore in north Kashmir since the 1970s but opposed electoral politics as a means to address the Kashmir problem after the 1990s. From CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury to lawyer Ram Jethmalani, Geelani befriended top political leaders and backchannel players of both India and Pakistan but refused to show any flexibility when the conversations revolved around accepting “realistic” solutions. His adversaries disliked his politics but admired his resolute stand. Born in Sopore’s Zoori Munz village, which still has tonga s (horse-driven cart), Geelani’s speeches and public appearances catapulted him to centre stage in the 1990s when armed rebellion broke out.   Riding high on his growing influence among youth, Geelani could afford to part ways with his mother organisation, the Jamaat; set up his own separatist group, the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat in 2003; separate himself from the Mirwaiz Umar Farooq-led Hurriyat over unconditional engagement with the Central government; and oppose Pervez Musharraf’s four-point formula. He also faced a backlash from the Musharraf regime for his stand. Parallel government Spearheading many street agitations from 2008 to 2016 and drafting protest calendars that ran a parallel government for many months, Geelani refused to open the doors to the group of 27 parliamentarians in 2016, when the Valley was embroiled for several months in street agitations after the killing of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen ‘commander’ Burhan Wani, was seen as unforgivable contempt by many in Delhi. Since then, his house detention, which had been a norm from 2008 to enervate his ability to galvanise masses on the streets, was made tougher and only close family members had access to him. Jailed several times since 1960s, the ailing Geelani was surviving on a pacemaker. Just 11 months after the Centre ended J&K’s special Constitutional position in August 2019, Geelani’s sudden decision to resign from Hurriyat surprised all. The resignation was his last bid to express anger at Pakistan and his own leaders’ failure to respond to the Centre’s decision. For sure, Geelani, once a mass leader in the Valley, died in isolation. But he succeeded in leaving behind a political legacy of hawkish and uncompromising politics, which many will be vying to follow. Whether the presence of Geelani was a safety valve in Kashmir or his absence will prove more dangerous, only time will tell.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-witness-to-kashmirs-history/article36264497.ece
03 September 2021||New Delhi,||Is the Cong. cold-shouldering Sidhu?||In a sign of growing distance between the newly appointed Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and the party’s top leadership, Mr. Sidhu is said to have returned from Delhi without getting an appointment with the Gandhis. The Punjab Congress chief came to Delhi on Wednesday, while the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary for Punjab, Harish Rawat, was still in Chandigarh to interact with party leaders, including Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. There was no official word about the purpose of his Delhi visit but sources claimed Mr. Sidhu wanted to meet general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, whose support ensured him the top party post in Punjab, and former party chief, Rahul Gandhi. However, no meeting took place between the Punjab Congress chief and the Gandhis, leading to speculation if they are cold shouldering Mr. Sidhu. Though the party high command had hoped that Punjab in-fighting would come to an end with Mr. Sidhu’s appointment as the party chief, subsequent developments have proved quite the opposite. Controversial comments on Kashmir by Mr. Sidhu’s adviser, Malwinder Singh Mali, embarrassed the party to such an extent that Mr. Rawat asked the Punjab Congress chief to remove him. Soon after, Mr. Sidhu himself put the party in a spot when he claimed that there was no freedom in decision-making and he did not want to become a showpiece. The Punjab Congress chief had also been constantly targeting the Amarinder Singh government over issues like the Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) and the drug mafia in the State. As Punjab Congress moved from one controversy to another ahead of next year’s Assembly elections, Mr. Rawat was forced to issue a public statement that the high command had “not handed over the party to Mr. Sidhu but chosen him to lead.” In a subtle hint, the AICC Punjab in-charge had also stated that Capt. Amarinder Singh will lead the party to victory in the polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/is-the-cong-cold-shouldering-sidhu/article36264501.ece
03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||40 Central universities to implement credit bank||Forty Central universities will kick off implementation of innovative measures such as the academic credit bank and the glue grant meant to encourage multidisciplinarity, at their meeting on Friday to be chaired by Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. However, Mr. Pradhan is likely to pull them up on a more basic issue — the fact that over a third of their faculty positions are still vacant. More than 6,000 out of a total 18,000-odd faculty positions are still vacant and that is a major issue on the meeting’s agenda, Higher Education Secretary Amit Khare told The Hindu on Thursday. Delhi University (DU) was the worst offender in absolute terms, with 846 or almost half of its 1,706 sanctioned posts lying vacant. At the University of Allahabad, the vacancy rate was almost 70%, with only 263 of its 863 posts having been filled. Glue grant scheme Without sufficient number of teachers, the other ambitious initiatives proposed under the National Education Policy would come to naught. “We have taken the first step by appointing Vice-Chancellors at many of the institutions where the position was vacant or filled by temporary personnel. Now they must get their act together,” said Mr. Khare, noting that even in institutions such as the DU and Jawaharlal Nehru University that still did not have permanent V-Cs, the process of advertisement and selection could begin. The interview process had been completed for the DU V-C post and was likely to be filled soon, while it had not yet begun at JNU. Under the glue grant, announced in this year’s budget, institutions in the same city would be encouraged to share resources, equipment and even allow their students to take classes from each other. “This is the first step for multidiciplinarity. We intend to start this from the second semester of the current academic year. Ultimately, faculty will be able to design joint courses, and you could see a DU student able to take a few classes at IIT-Delhi, or vice versa,” said the Higher Education Secretary. This also meant that institutions need not duplicate work by developing the same capacities, but would able to build on each other’s expertise. The first step would be the academic credit bank, which would have to be adopted separately by the academic council of each university to kick off implementation. To start with, the system would allow students to attain qualifications by amassing credits rather than specific durations on campus. A certain number of credits would add up to a certificate, then a diploma and then a degree, allowing for multiple entry and exit points. Students can earn up to 40% of their credits in online Swayam classes. In the future, the credits will be valid across institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/40-central-universities-to-implement-credit-bank/article36264481.ece
03 September 2021||New Delhi,||Long wait for a Deputy Speaker for Lok Sabha||With the Delhi High Court asking the Union government on Wednesday to explain its stand on a petition that said keeping the post of Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha vacant is a violation of Article 93 of the Constitution, the issue is once again in the spotlight. Petitioner Pawan Reley pointed out that the position had been vacant for the past 830 days. Constitutional post The Congress’s floor leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “It is a Constitution-mandated position and not a ceremonial one. During each session, the Congress has demanded that the election to the post be held, but our demands have been ignored.” Senior Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien said the longest time that this post had remained vacant was in the 12th Lok Sabha and even then on the 59th sitting of Parliament, election to the post was held. “Modi-Shah is dismantling every institution, including Parliament. We have been screaming ourselves hoarse. Angry. Sad,” Mr. O’Brien said. Congress Chief Whip in the Lok Sabha Kodikunnil Suresh said that by convention, this post went to the Opposition. “During the Budget Session of Parliament, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla contracted COVID-19. The panel of chairpersons are not equipped to handle the job,” he noted. As of now, there are nine members who are part of the panel from the BJP, the DMK, the YSR Congress Party, the BJD, the Trinamool Congress and the Revolutionary Socialist Party. A Deputy Speaker enjoys the same legislative powers as the Speaker. And in the absence of the Speaker because of death, illness or any other reason, the Deputy Speaker assumes the administrative powers. First attempt Soon after the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the government had made some effort to fill the position. It approached the YSR Congress Party, which turned down the offer since it would have been difficult to carry on a protest against the government for not according special status to Andhra Pradesh while occupying the post. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi and his deputy in the Lok Sabha, Arjun Ram Meghwal, were not available for comment. Mr. Birla had said that it was for the House to elect a Deputy Speaker and it was not the Speaker’s job. BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab, who is a member of the panel of chairpersons, said the Lok Sabha’s functioning was not affected by the lack of a Deputy Speaker. “Currently, the Maharashtra Assembly is functioning without an elected Speaker after the resignation of Nana Patole,” he said. As the combined Opposition did not have the strength to elect a member of their choice, the choice fell on the government. The fact that there was no recognised leader of the Opposition also hampered the process, he said. In 1984, when Rajiv Gandhi came to power with an overwhelming majority, the Deputy Speaker’s position was given to the AIADMK, he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/long-wait-for-a-deputy-speaker-for-lok-sabha/article36264483.ece
03 September 2021||New Delhi,||9-member Cong. panel to plan ‘sustained agitation’||After seven years in the Opposition, the Congress on Thursday announced a nine-member committee to plan “sustained agitation” on national issues. While former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh will head the panel, party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will be one of the members. “I have sought an appointment with the honourable Congress president and will seek her guidance,” Mr. Singh told The Hindu when asked about the issues the committee plans to identify to launch an agitation. This is the first time that the principal Opposition party has set up a formal structure to plan agitation and campaigns. Usually, the Congress general secretary in charge of organisation coordinates and plans such campaigns. While it is being speculated whether the panel on agitation was among the ideas shared by election strategist Prashant Kishor, sources said a few senior leaders had suggested it to the Congress president much before Mr. Kishor’s recent meeting with the Gandhis to revive the party. Raised earlier too The Congress has been raising the issue of repeated increase in prices of cooking gas, diesel and petrol, and the national monetisation pipeline (NMP). In the past two weeks, former party president Rahul Gandhi did two press conferences on these issues. On the issue of hitting the streets, Mr. Gandhi said they were exercising “restraint”. “The anger against the government is building, but voices are being suppressed. COVID-19 pandemic is still not over, so we also do not want lakhs of people to take to the streets. This can lead to other issues, so we are exercising a little restraint,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/9-member-cong-panel-to-plan-sustained-agitation/article36264499.ece
03 September 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Terrorists afraid of Modi govt.: Rajnath||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh asserted on Thursday that terrorists were afraid of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre and there had been no major terrorist attack in the country since Mr. Modi assumed office in 2014. He also credited the Prime Minister with adopting the policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism. The Union Minister was in Gujarat to address the BJP’s State executive meeting at Sardar Patel Statue of Unity in Kevadia, Narmdaba district. “No matter what it takes, we will not let terrorists succeed. Leave alone Jammu and Kashmir, no major terrorist attack took place in any part of the country after the arrival of Modiji. This is our major achievement... This is not a small thing,” he said. Recalling the surgical strike the Indian forces had conducted targeting terrorists and their infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 2018, Mr. Singh said it was a clear message that India would not allow safe harbours for terrorists either in its own territory or outside. “Terrorists have now realised that they are not secure even in their safe havens. The surgical strike in PoK after the Uri attack gave a clear message to the world that we can kill terrorists on this side, as well as by crossing the border if the need arises,” the Defence Minister said. OROP issue Mr. Singh also credited the Prime Minister with resolving the decade old One Rank, One Pension (OROP) issue that the previous Congress administration had refused to resolve during their tenure. “Modiji implemented OROP formula as soon as he came to power.” Mr. Singh slammed the Opposition Congress for playing politics over Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and said the BJP had sacrificed three State governments after the Babri mosque structure was demolished to pave way for the temple in Lord Rama’s birth place. Union Minister Parshottam Rupala praised Mr. Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for removing Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and ensuring J&K’s full integration with the rest of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/terrorists-afraid-of-modi-govt-rajnath/article36264495.ece

The 12th edition of the biennial DefExpo, which is India’s flagship event showcasing the land, naval, air as well as homeland security systems, will be held in Gandhinagar, Gujarat between March 10 and 13, 2022, a Defence Ministry statement said. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Ministry of Defence and Gujarat Government for organising the event, in the presence of Mr. Singh.

03 September 2021||Kolkata,||Indian biologist wins global award for turtle conservation||Indian biologist Shailendra Singh has been awarded the Behler Turtle Conservation Award for bringing three critically endangered turtle conservation species back from the brink of extinction. A press statement issued by the headquarters of the Turtle Survival Alliance earlier this week said: “For some species, such as the red-crowned roofed turtle ( Batagur kachuga ), northern river terrapin ( Batagur baska ), and black softshell turtle ( Nilssonia nigricans ), Dr. Singh and his team’s efforts are the last hope for their wild survival in the country.” The award has been bestowed by several global bodies involved in turtle conservation such as Turtle Survival Alliance, IUCN/SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group, Turtle Conservancy, and the Turtle Conservation Fund. “In just 15 years, there are few individuals that have made such monumental contributions to turtle conservation as Shailendra Singh. He and his team’s efforts now span much of India, impacting well over half of its turtle and tortoise species, many of which are among the most endangered turtles on the planet,” said Rick Hudson, president, Turtle Survival Alliance. “While it may take decades to witness the full impact of Dr. Singh’s commitment, his name and legacy have become synonymous with Indian turtle conservation,” Mr. Hudson added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-biologist-wins-global-award-for-turtle-conservation/article36264508.ece
03 September 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Police baton-charge farmers in Moga||The police on Thursday resorted to use of batons and water cannons on a group of protesting farmers at Moga in Punjab as they marched towards a venue where former Deputy Chief Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal was addressing a rally. Farmer leaders claimed that around a dozen farmers suffered injuries after the police resorted to ‘lathi-charge’ near the new grain market. Leader of the Kirti Kisan Union Nirbhay Singh told The Hindu that farmers were protesting peacefully and wanted to meet Mr. Badal to seek answers on farmers’ issues. “We have every right to seek answers from leaders, and today, we wanted to ask Mr. Badal why his party, at the first place, did support the three farm laws, when they [SAD] were a partner of the government at the Centre. As we moved towards the venue, the police used water cannons and batons on us, leaving close to a dozen injured,” Mr. Nirbhay Singh said. “Now, we have started a ‘pucca morcha’ [permanent protest], and until the farmers, who have been detained are not released, we will not relent.” Moga Superintendent of Police Gurdeep Singh said the police had to use mild force to control the situation after the protesters started pelting stones and attacking the police personnel. “We repeatedly urged the protesters to stay calm but when they started pelting stones, the police had to use mild force in a bid to maintain the law and order. Around four-five police personnel were injured in the incident,” he added. ‘Deep-rooted scheme’ Senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Singh Majithia alleged that attempts to disrupt the Akali Dal gatherings, being organised as part of the party’s “Gal Punjab Di” campaign, were part of a deep-rooted conspiracy of the ruling Congress in conjunction with the Central government to disturb the hard-earned peace in Punjab and impose President’s Rule in the State. “The disruptive conspiracy had a twin objective - to postpone the Assembly elections in Punjab as well as defame the peaceful farmer movement,” said Mr. Majithia at a press conference here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-baton-charge-farmers-in-moga/article36264486.ece
03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jallianwala Bagh conservation was supervised by ASI: Culture Ministry||Reacting to criticism of the renovated Jallianwala Bagh by some historians, Culture Secretary Raghvendra Singh said on Thursday the “conservation was done under direct supervision of the Archaeological Survey of India” and that there was “nothing factually incorrect”. Mr. Singh said the Ministry was in talks with the descendants of the martyrs of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to share their memorabilia for display at the one of the galleries at the complex. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated four new galleries and the revamped Jallianwala Bagh on August 28 after the site was closed for renovations for about a year-and-a-half. The site of a massacre of Indians by British forces on April 13, 1919 in Amritsar, some historians said, had been turned into a place for enjoyment through the renovations. According to sources, the project had been carried out by the ASI and the NBCC, which tendered out the work. The contract was given to Gujarat-based Vama Communications. In response to the critique that the space had been beautified, an official said landscaping had been done and it was not the same as beautification. One of the criticisms of the project was the addition of glittering murals on the walls of the narrow corridor through which British forces entered. The official said the murals had not been “mindlessly created” and that they depicted families happily entering the space where they were eventually killed. The official said the 31 descendants of the martyrs who attended the opening on August 28 had “no objections”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jallianwala-bagh-conservation-was-supervised-by-asi-culture-ministry/article36264503.ece
03 September 2021||PATNA,||Chapters on JP, Lohia off Bihar varsity syllabus||The Bihar government on Thursday took serious note of the removal of chapters on veteran socialist leaders Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia from the Post Graduate political science syllabus of the JP University at Chhapra in Saran district. It sought an explanation from the varsity, ironically named after Jayaprakash Narayan. Other eminent figures whose names have been omitted from the syllabus include Dayanand Saraswati, Raja Ram Mohan Rai and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. New additions include Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhayay, Subhas Chandra Bose and Jyotiba Phule. “The Vice-Chancellor and Registrar of the university have been asked to explain, and if there is no satisfactory response, they have to come to the State education department secretariat to explain the background,” Education Minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, he said, had expressed surprise and anguish and directed that the issue be resolved immediately. “The issue has been brought into the notice of the honourable Chancellor as well, who is currently outside the State,” the Minister said. He directed his department to gather information about changes made in the syllabus of other Universities in the State in recent days. “If anything improper and illegal is found, necessary corrective action will be taken,” he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chapters-on-jp-lohia-off-bihar-varsity-syllabus/article36264707.ece
03 September 2021||AHMEDABAD,||‘BJP selling what Congress has created’||The Opposition Congress in Gujarat on Thursday slammed the Narendra Modi government for its push to monetise national assets, calling it a mega sale to benefit a few corporates at the cost of public exchequer. Party spokesman Pawan Khera told the media in Ahmedabad that what the Congress party has created in the last 70 years will be sold by the current regime that has mismanaged the economy since 2014. Mr. Khera said if not stopped, all strategic assets of the government would be handed over to a few select corporates who are close to the ruling party. “What our governments in the past avoided, this government is doing it: creating monopoly in the hands of a few corporates in strategic sectors.” “If we do not stop them now, an entire generation will be destroyed. Before coming to power in 2014, the BJP used to ask what the Congress did during the last 70 years. The answer is the list of assets which you are now selling. While we built India in those 70 years, the BJP is now busy selling India,” he alleged during the party’s special media outreach against the Centre’s National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP). The NITI Aayog has identified 25 airports, 40 railway stations, 15 railway stadiums and an unidentified number of railway colonies for getting private investments. “It’s high time to seek answers. Assets worth Rs. 60 lakh crore are being given to a select few for just Rs. 6 lakh crore,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-selling-what-congress-has-created/article36264479.ece

The Foreign Secretary’s visit precedes a possible month-end visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Shringla’s delegation included Joint Secretary (Americas) of the Ministry of External Affairs Wani Rao and Joint Secretary (International Cooperation) from the Ministry of Defence Somnath Ghosh, both of whom led the Indian side at the India-US 2+2 inter-sessional on Wednesday. The U.S. side was led by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Affairs Ely Ratner and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Ervin Massinga. “Both sides took stock of the progress and developments in the bilateral agenda under the India-US strategic partnership, including defence, global public health, economic and commercial cooperation, science and technology, clean energy and climate finance, and people to people ties,” an MEA statement said. The inter-sessional included a discussion on strengthening multilateral cooperation among the U.S., India and “other like-minded partners”, according to a statement from the Pentagon. “The U.S. and Indian officials exchanged views on a range of regional issues of shared interest, including in South Asia, East and Southeast Asia, and the Western Indian Ocean and identified opportunities for enhanced cooperation on maritime security, regional connectivity, counterterrorism and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shringla-in-washington-for-talks-with-us-officials/article36264485.ece

The Ministry has also written to the States and the Union Territories directing them to strengthen their Whole Genome Sequencing activities, which are critical to establishing clinical epidemiological correlations. Mr. Bhushan warned that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was not over. He added that 69% of the total cases in the past week were reported from Kerala alone. The State currently has more than 1 lakh active cases, while four States — Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh — have between 10,000 to 1 lakh active cases. “Forty-two districts in the country are still reporting more than 100 new cases daily, which is a cause of concern. However, India has managed to fully vaccinate 16% of its adult population, while 54% has got one shot,” he said. He added that Sikkim, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Himachal Pradesh have administered the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines to 100% of their population above 18. Reiterating the need to continue wearing masks even after being fully vaccinated, Balram Bhargava, Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research, said mass gatherings should be avoided. Also speaking at the conference, NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul said people shouldn’t take the virus lightly. “The problems with the virus still continue and we have to be careful... Also, India is looking at evidence of the COVID vaccine booster dose requirement and a decision will be reached after due diligence,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rt-pcr-must-for-flyers-from-seven-more-nations/article36264487.ece

The rules require these platforms to appoint a grievance redressal officer, who is a resident of India. Transfer of cases The government recently asked the top court to transfer cases challenging the Information Technology Rules from the High Courts to itself. In the case of complaints against broadcasters, Mr. Mehta referred to the Cable Television Networks (Amendment) Rules of 2021. He submitted that the Rules provided for a three-level grievance redressal mechanism — self-regulation by broadcasters, self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the broadcasters, and oversight by an Inter-Departmental Committee at the level of the Central government. “The real contest is between the freedom of the press and the right of citizens to get unadulterated news... We have tried to regulate, balance,” Mr. Mehta submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/giving-communal-angle-to-content-unwarranted/article36264488.ece

Our main, primary and immediate concern is that the Afghan soil should not be used for anti-Indian activities or terror activities. This is our focus.” Mr. Bagchi told presspersons at the MEA’s weekly media briefing that very few Indians now remained to be evacuated, and the 24x7 Afghanistan special cell was in touch with them. Flying them out would depend on the resumption of flights from Kabul, and concerns were raised about them in the Doha meeting. The Stanekzai-Mittal discussions in Doha raised several other questions, as the announcement of the meeting has only been made by Delhi despite the Taliban reportedly requesting the meeting. Since Tuesday, Taliban spokesperson Muhammad Naeem Wardak has issued tweets on a number of other engagements, including the Taliban’s political office meeting diplomats from Canada, China, the Netherlands and Turkey, but has given no intimation of the meeting with India. “That is up to them, and I would refer you to the [Taliban] for answers,” Mr. Bagchi said, adding that there had been no particular “thought” behind the fact no photograph of the event had been recorded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/main-concern-is-curbing-terror-threat-says-centre/article36264489.ece

Net oil imports remained largely stable, benefiting from a moderation in crude oil prices, despite a rise in mobility in the country, she pointed out. In the first five months of 2021-22, India’s merchandise exports have now touched $163.67 billion, nearly 67% higher than that of the corresponding period last year and 22.9% higher than 2019. The government has set a target of merchandise exports worth $400 billion for the year. Exporters said the steady recovery in global trade was helping their order books but sought urgent attention from the government on the runaway freight rates, rampant container shortages and other policy constraints, including the release of pending benefits under earlier export incentive schemes. “The government needs to provide freight support to all exports till March 31, 2022, as freight rates have skyrocketed,” said A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Exporters’ Organisations. Apart from augmenting the flow of empty containers to Indian ports, he suggested that the government should establish a regulatory authority to seek justification of freight hikes and imposition of various charges by shipping lines. Among the major commodity groups, excluding petroleum, and gems and jewellery, which entail marginal value addition, engineering goods recorded a healthy 58.8% rise to $9.6 billion, while cotton yarn, fabrics and handloom products jumped 55.6% to about $1.3 billion. Electronics goods exports rose 31.5% from a year ago, to hit $1.15 billion. The employment-intensive readymade garments sector, however, only recorded a 14% growth at $1.23 billion in August.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/exports-rose-45-to-33-billion-in-august/article36264490.ece

03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Uphold rights of women in mental health centres’||The Supreme Court has given the State governments and the Union Territories three months to take measures and ‘alleviate’ the violation of human rights suffered by women institutionalised in government-run mental health establishments. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli based its order on research conducted by NIMHANS, in 2016, and the National Commission of Women, as recently as in 2020, about the deprivations suffered by hundreds of mentally-ill women in institutional care. In a 12-page order published on Thursday, the Bench highlighted that the research on the plight of these women indicates gross violation of the Mental Healthcare Act and other laws. They did not enjoy basic rights guaranteed under the Constitution like dignity and privacy, the studies showed. The women, the court quoted from the research, were denied sanitary napkins. Mothers were not allowed to keep their children. There were no separate mother-child wards in many of the government-run institutions. The court directed the Ministry to take up the issues in the monthly meetings it had ordered to be held between the Centre and the State governments to monitor the progress in the establishment of half-way homes for those treated and who needed a place to stay. Data would have to be regularly updated. The court scheduled the next hearing for December 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uphold-rights-of-women-in-mental-health-centres/article36264670.ece
03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Factors behind action||In the eighteenth chapter of the Gita, the factors involved in the jivatma's actions are explained and analysed against the backdrop of God's overall control. A proper understanding of these matters is crucial for every individual so that one is able to review the extent of his role and responsibility in his daily activities, pointed out Asuri Sri Madhavachariar in a discourse. The Lord explains that all actions in the world are possible owing to five factors. The body is the seat of all activity. The self in the body is the agent, the Kartha. The next factor is the Karmendriyas and the mind. The fourth factor is the vital breath, prana that sustains and pervades the body. The fifth factor is the Supreme Spirit dwelling in all these. Whatever action a man does, using his sarira, speech and mind, whether it is right or wrong, it is owing to these five factors. So, a jivatma cannot lay any claim as the sole agent for his actions. Now, if the Lord is the fifth and hence also the primary cause of all activity, it may be asked if He is the cause of the bad deeds in people. The answer lies in the fourth chapter when He explains the desireless nature of His work. As the Supreme Being, He is the cause of this universe of infinite variety, in terms of individual gunas and karma. He is the ruler of Prakriti, and who grants the respective sarira for each jiva and is also the karma phala data. He is the source of everything and pervades everything. He is the Kartha from this angle. But He is not subject to Prakriti which is dependent on Him. He is only a witness and always unattached and is not responsible for the acts, good or bad, of the jivatma. He is thus the non-doer, akartha from this angle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/factors-behind-action/article36264506.ece

Advocate Yug Chaudhry, appearing for Mr. Navlakha, informed the court about his [Mr. Navlakha’s] health and said he be taken to a private hospital where his sister is a nurse. However, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, representing the National Investigation Agency probing the case, said that moving Mr. Navlakha to the private hospital is not mentioned in the petition. Mr. Singh said, “If at all he wants to go for a check-up, he can go to Tata Memorial Centre Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer... People throughout the country come there for treatment.” The court directed Mr. Chaudhry to make an application for the same. Mr. Chaudhry said, “When your client tells you there is a lump possibly leading to cancer, you don’t want such delays.” He agreed for Mr. Navlakha to be taken to Tata Hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/navlakha-seeks-to-be-shifted-home/article36264476.ece

Newly appointed State Congress president Bhupen Borah left for Delhi on Thursday to meet the central leadership, a day after Mr. Gogoi met Rahul Gandhi and Mukul Wasnik in the national capital. “We will abide by whatever decision [on an alliance with Mr. Gogoi’s party Raijor Dal] the central leaders take. But I will let them know how he has been deriding the Congress in public,” Mr. Borah said before his departure. He alluded to “Congress is a setting sun”, “Congress cannot do well under Rahul Gandhi” and other such statements made by Mr. Gogoi. Mr. Borah said the party workers were unhappy over such remarks. The Congress had on August 30 severed its ties with the minority-based All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), one of its nine allies in the pre-poll grand alliance. The reason was said to be AIUDF’s praise of the BJP in Assam. Mr. Gogoi, approached by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to lead the Trinamool Congress in Assam, is reportedly trying to fill the gap left by the AIUDF by offering to support the Congress ahead of the Assembly byelections. The Raijor Dal president, who represents the Sibsagar Assembly seat, praised Mr. Gandhi’s “political maturity” and ‘experience’ after meeting him on Wednesday. “We discussed how the Opposition parties can fight to restore the federal structure and approach the upcoming byelections,” he told journalists. He also said the Congress State leadership has to accept the decision of its high command, which “favours an alliance”.

Besides Humayun Mahal, work is on at the tower block in the University of Madras, the south and north wings of the PWD premises and in the Deputy Registrar’s Office building on Rajaji Salai. Officials of the Building Center and Conservation Division of the PWD, which renovates archaeological and heritage buildings, said nearly 70% of the Rs. 41.12 crore project to renovate the fire-ravaged Humayun Mahal, which was started in 2019, has been completed so far. About 60 skilled masons are working at the site, and the project may be completed by February or March next year. “We have managed to continue the work with breaks during the pandemic. We are redoing the Madras terrace roofing, particularly in the southern corridor. A large portion of the complex Mughal wall plastering or Theervai is over. Teak wood doors and windows are being fitted,” said an official. Floor tiles K.P. Sathyamurthy, Joint Chief Engineer, PWD (Buildings), said: “We are now selecting the floor tiles to match the antique look of the building. We are checking for tiles from places like Hyderabad, Rajasthan and Gujarat too. We study three aspects in implementing heritage projects — architectural history, construction material and methodology used. For instance, mud and lime mortar was used in Humayun Mahal and sand lime mortar was used at the University of Madras building then. Selection of construction material was challenging and time consuming.” Reconstruction of two main domes was another challenging task as they had collapsed and there was no sufficient documentation available on the architecture of the structure built in 1760. About 20% of the work had been completed, he said. While the Rs. 18.5 crore work to renovate the north and south wings of the PWD premises is almost over, the department had expedited work to restore the damaged heritage Registration Department structure at Rajaji Salai. Nearly 40% of the Rs. 9.7 crore renovation work on the British era structure was over. Built in 1864 and spread over 24,908 sq ft, the dilapidated structure had remained unused for several years. Officials said skilled workers were repairing the leaky Madras terrace roofing and plastering that had worn out. The work is scheduled to be completed by March next. Similarly, nearly 65% of the work on repairing the roof and domes of the historic tower block in the University of Madras, taken up at a cost of Rs. 2.5 crore, had been completed. Govt. press on the list In the next phase, the department plans to take up the Government Printing Press at Mint that was damaged in a fire in 2013 for restoration. This would be one of the 13 projects lined up for restoration across the State. Besides restoration, the PWD maintains nearly 85 heritage buildings belonging to various government departments in the city.

03 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC keeps in abeyance order on bumper-to-bumper insurance||The Madras High Court has kept in abeyance an order passed by it recently, directing the Transport Secretary to ensure that all motor vehicles sold in the State from September 1 get bumper-to-bumper insurance cover, along with coverage for the driver, the owner, the passengers and third parties, for five years. Justice S. Vaidyanathan kept his order in abeyance after the General Insurance Council (GIC) approached the court and stated that it would require at least 90 days to implement the order after obtaining due approval from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). Earlier, the judge had issued the direction while setting aside a motor accidents claims tribunal’s order, directing an insurance company to pay Rs. 14.65 lakh to the family of a dead car passenger, though the insurance policy covered only third-party liability and not the passengers. The judge said the claimants could seek compensation only from the car owner and not from the insurer. He also expressed dismay over people showing interest in purchasing expensive cars, but unwilling to shell out a small amount of money towards comprehensive insurance. Circular to RTOs He directed the Transport Secretary to ensure that all new motor vehicles sold from September 1 get comprehensive insurance policy cover for five years. Pursuant to the court order, the Joint Transport Commissioner issued a circular to all Regional Transport Officers on August 31 for the strict implementation of the court order. Appreciating the government for the swift action, the judge said it only showed that the State was also interested in safeguarding the interests of motorists. Nevertheless, since GIC had sought time, he decided to hear the body and the IRDAI, at length, on September 13, before passing further orders on the issue.  It would require at least 90 days to implement the order after obtaining due approval from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of IndiaGeneral Insurance Council||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bumper-to-bumper-insurance-hc-keeps-order-in-abeyance/article36264851.ece

03 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Class V book content keeps police on tenterhooks||A part of the content in the Class V Tamil Nadu State Board Social Science textbook has invited the ire of certain Hindu organisations, prompting the police to mount vigil at sensitive locations. Representatives of some Hindu organisations objected to a chapter titled ‘Good Citizen’ in the Class V first-term Social Science syllabus. In it, there is a section that reads, “In the name of faith and worship people violate rules and values.” “The breaking of white pumpkin on roads causing inconvenience to people, burning of old objects, submerging of idols in waterbodies and bursting of crackers causing pollution” are the examples of such violations, it says. They have said the content indirectly criticises religious festivals like Deepavali, Bhogi and Vinayaka Chaturthi. Police sources said the representatives of the Hindu organisations also felt that the visuals alongside another text on “Good conduct and moral science are nothing but civic values” had communal overtones. Apprehending protests, the State intelligence has sent out an alert to all cities and districts to enhance security arrangements to avert any untoward incident because schools have re-opened for Classes IX-XII. Acting on intelligence inputs, Director-General of Police C. Sylendra Babu held a review meeting with senior officials and directed all Commissioners and Superintendents of Police to mount vigil at vulnerable locations, the sources said. The cyber crime police were told to keep a close watch and take action on any post or forward on social media platforms that could incite communal hatred. Days ahead of Vinayaka Chaturthi, the police were told to intensify vigil in areas that witnessed communal violence in the past and co-ordinate with religious leaders to ensure peace during the celebrations, the sources said. A senior official in the School Education Department, who was part of the team that compiled material for textbooks, told The Hindu that there was nothing objectionable in the text. “It is a scientific fact that submerging idols [painted in artificial colours] in waterbodies, burning unwanted articles at public places and bursting crackers cause pollution. There have been several instances in which pumpkins smashed on roads led to accidents. The chapter educates children on the conservation of environment by creating awareness. Instead of giving a communal angle to the content, the critics should go into the merits of the subject,” he said. The official said that the issues being flagged were addressed by different courts that even issued guidelines for the celebrations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/class-v-book-content-keeps-police-on-tenterhooks/article36264852.ece

A team of architects working on this project is carrying out assessments of these premises and then a plan is prepared for the design intervention that can be carried out based on the needs of the specific school,” said Sneha Divakaran, Deputy Commissioner (Education), GCC. A proposal is under study to extend this holistic transformation to 17 more schools in the city. Work is on at the Chennai Higher Secondary School, Manikandan Street; Chennai Public School, Cemetery Road; and Chennai Higher Secondary School, Nesapakkam. Senior students, who returned to the school at Manikandan Street on Wednesday, were welcomed into renovated classrooms. At the school on Cemetery Road, colourful murals and paintings adorn the walls of the classrooms. An official associated with the project said senior teachers would be considered for leadership training, sports facilities would be revamped, and students would be given coaching.

03 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin opposes monetisation of assets of public sector units||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Thursday informed the Assembly that the Centre’s plan to monetise the assets of public sector undertakings did not augur well for the country, and he would write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to record the State’s objection to it. “The assets of the public sector undertakings are our assets. Everyone knows that these undertakings were meant to serve as the root of the country’s development and create jobs...,” he said in response to a special calling attention motion moved by Congress floor leader Selvaperunthagai and CPI member T. Ramachandran. He said these undertakings were not aimed at profits but at public welfare. Minister’s plea Earlier, Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu said the DMK government would never allow the plan. Whether it was the nationalisation of bus services or banks, the DMK government, under M. Karunanidhi, had taken firm steps. This government will follow the same line, he said. “I urge the Union government to take into account the views of the State government because the land for public sector undertakings was given by the State,” he said, citing the vast amount of land given for opening the Salem steel plant. He said that in Tamil Nadu, some roads, the mountain train services in Udhagamandalam, and the berth facilities at the Thoothukudi port were being considered for monetisation. In the past, the DMK had opposed the privatisation of the public sector undertakings, especially those making profits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-opposes-monetisation-of-assets-of-public-sector-units/article36264842.ece
03 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Memorial for those killed during Vanniyar quota struggle||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Thursday said the State government would construct a memorial ( manimandapam ) in Villupuram for the 21 people who were killed in the police firing during the struggle demanding exclusive reservation for the Vanniyars in the 1980s. The memorial will come up at a cost of Rs. 4 crore. He also promised education qualification-based government jobs for family members of those killed in the agitation that was led by the Vanniyar Sangam. Making a suo motu statement in the Assembly, he said he had promised a memorial during the campaign for the byelection to the Vikkiravandi constituency in 2019. Recalling their struggles, Mr. Stalin said that to render justice to the sacrifice made by “social justice fighters”, the DMK government, led by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, in 1989 had created the ‘Most Backward Classes’ (MBC) and allotted 20% reservation in education and employment to members of those communities, including the Vanniyars. “That paved the way for their development,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the DMK government, after assuming office, had legally ensured 10.5% reservation for the Vanniyars in government jobs and higher education. “It is the objective of the DMK government to protect the rights of the oppressed sections,” he said. He also recalled Karunanidhi’s words, “I belong to a backward section of society, and my community has a place in the MBC list. I will fight till my last breath for the welfare of the backward classes.” Mr. Stalin said social justice was a gift of the Dravidian movement not just to the Tamil society but to the entire country. “It was the Justice Party that, through the communal government order, introduced the reservation policy. When it faced challenges after Independence, Periyar [E.V. Ramasamy] and Anna [C.N. Annadurai] worked together to protect it. The struggle drew the attention of the nation, and Kamaraj persuaded [Prime Minister] Jawaharalal Nehru to amend the Constitution to get legal protection,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/memorial-for-those-killed-during-vanniyar-quota-struggle/article36264846.ece
03 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Lakshman Rekha’ between judiciary, legislature must be maintained: HC||The Madras High Court on Thursday dismissed a public interest litigation petition which sought a direction to the Legislative Assembly Secretariat to treat the MLAs, who had contested on election symbols belonging to other political parties, as members of the latter parties and not as those belonging to their parent parties. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu rejected the plea after observing that it was the prerogative of the Speaker to treat the MLAs in a particular fashion inside the House, and the court could not interfere in such matters. They said the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ between the legislature and the judiciary must be maintained at all times. The judges pointed out that the litigant had complained only of an anomaly in the manner in which the MLAs were being treated inside the House and he had not complained about any illegality. They also said there was neither any scope for judicial interference nor any public interest involved in the matter. In his affidavit, litigant M. Loganathan, an advocate from Coimbatore, stated that as many as eight MLAs from different parties had contested under the ‘Rising Sun’ symbol of the DMK. The litigant insisted that they should not be allotted separate seating arrangements or time slots to speak during Assembly sessions, and they must be treated only as ruling party members. He also sought a direction to the State government to not invite those MLAs or other leaders of their parent parties in their capacity as representatives of those parties to legislature party meetings conducted by the government to discuss important issues. The petitioner pointed out that MLAs E.R. Easwaran, M.H. Jawahirullah, K. Chinappa, M. Boominathan, T. Velmurugan, P. Abdul Samad, T. Sadhan Tirumalai Kumar and A.R.R. Raghuraman do not belong to the DMK, yet they had contested under the ‘Rising Sun’ symbol following an alliance with that party. Similarly, M. Jagan Murthy of Puratchi Bharatham had contested under thr AIADMK’s ‘Two Leaves’ symbol, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lakshman-rekha-between-judiciary-legislature-must-be-maintained-hc/article36265245.ece

03 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Monetisation plan a cruel joke on people’||The BJP government’s National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) Policy is a cruel joke on the people of the country and is untenable, former Union Law Minister Ashwani Kumar said. The NMP is a ‘fire sale’ of the nation’s assets and is against national interest, and seeks to legitimise favours to a favourite few at the cost of public interest, and is in breach of the government’s fiduciary obligations, Mr. Kumar said at a press conference in Chennai on Thursday. Rent-seeking Slamming the BJP government for the proposal, he said the policy was tailor-made for rent-seeking at various levels and reeked of crony capitalism. “The policy is virtually a transfer of taxpayer-funded assets to a handful of business groups. It will lead to a rising concentration of economic power in crucial sectors of the economy, result in loss of public revenues for 30-50 years,” he said. The justification of collecting Rs. 6 lakh crore from the NMP to facilitate Rs. 100 lakh crore of investment in the infrastructure sector “is an absurdity”. He said no consultations had been held with the stakeholders or in Parliament before the announcement of “the grand clearing sale policy, which is a fraud on power”. He also questioned the criteria the government was using to select the assets for monetisation. He further said that the proposed concession period of 30-50 years in favour of private parties would virtually amount to passing off public rights in perpetuity, with no clear guidelines for balancing profits and utility motives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/monetisation-plan-a-cruel-joke-on-people/article36264850.ece

In a statement detailing the history of the Sri Lankan Tamils issue, he said they had come to India as refugees and not illegally. The Indian government welcomed them, registered their details and provided them shelter in refugee camps.

There were around 10,000 Eelam Tamils who were also seeking Indian citizenship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/citizenship-must-be-given-to-sl-tamils/article36264847.ece
03 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Judge refrains from allowing 16-year-old to write NEET||A single judge of the Madras High Court on Thursday refrained from passing an interim order permitting a 16-year-old girl to write National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on September 12 without insisting on her completing of 17 years of age as of December 2021. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh referred the matter to a Division Bench of the court for an authoritative pronouncement, since the test was being conducted at a national level and there had to be a uniform policy followed in all States. In the interest of the student, SP. Shree Harini, the judge requested the Division Bench to take up her present writ petition along with a writ appeal, already pending before the Bench, on September 6. Initially, Justice B. Pugalendhi had allowed a previous writ petition filed by the girl, and directed National Testing Agency (NTA) to permit her to write NEET if the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru tested her IQ and found her fit to write the test. Though NTA took the single judge’s order on appeal, it could not obtain an interim stay from the Division Bench which only ordered notice to the student. Subsequently, Ms. Harini filed the present petition since the date for NEET was approaching fast. Rajasthan HC verdict Senior counsel G. Rajagopalan, representing NTA, said the Rajasthan HC had upheld the minimum age criteria for medical courses. That decision was followed by many other High Courts. Even recently, the Delhi HC followed that decision and rejected a similar plea of an under-age student, he said. It was also brought to the notice of Justice Venkatesh that even a Division Bench of Madras HC had followed that decision in 2011. In such circumstances, a contrary view taken now by Justice Pugalendhi would open the floodgates and similar relief might be sought by students across the country, he said. All High Courts must take a consistent view on such issues. It was argued that experts had opined that students would attain the physical and mental maturity required for medical studies only after they completed 17 years of age. After hearing him and the petitioner’s advocate AL. Ganthimathi, the judge directed the High Court Registry to tag the present writ petition with the writ appeal pending before the Division Bench.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-single-judge-refrains-from-allowing-16-year-old-to-write-neet/article36265242.ece

Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration P. Moorthy, who introduced the Bill, said that despite government efforts to prevent fraudulent registration of documents, unscrupulous persons still encumbered properties with forged sale deeds. “The provisions of the Registration Act, 1908 (Central Act XVI of 1908), do not empower the registering officer or any other authority to cancel document once registered, even on grounds of fraud and impersonation, causing a grave hardship to the public,” he said, pointing to the Madras High Court’s instructions to the government to frame appropriate rules incorporating the circular issued by the Inspector-General of Registration for the purpose. Two sections added The government has added Sections 77-A and 77-B. Under Section 77-A, the Registrar could issue a show-cause notice asking why the registration shall not be cancelled; on consideration of the reply, the Registrar may cancel the registration and enter the cancellation in the relevant books and indices. Section 77-B allows any person aggrieved by an order of the Registrar under Sub-section (1) of Section 77-A to file an appeal with the Inspector-General within 30 days of cancellation. The Inspector-General shall pass an order confirming, modifying or cancelling the order of the Registrar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bill-to-curb-registration-with-forged-papers-passed/article36264843.ece

It said that it had helped the State exchequer save Rs. 42.18 crore so far. During his reply to the debate on the demand for grants in the House, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said a three-layered mask was procured at Rs. 9.8 during the AIADMK government, but it was being procured at Rs. 0.85-Rs. 1.15 now. An N-95 mask was procured at Rs. 14.4 then, but is now being procured at Rs. 6.95. As for PPE kits, it was earlier procured at Rs. 385, but is being procured at Rs. 139.5 now, he said. Pointing out that the rate of vaccination was only about 61,000 people a day during the AIADMK regime, he said it had now increased to over 2 lakh a day, adding that doses were being wasted then. He listed out efforts being taken by the DMK government to tackle a possible third wave. Though the Centre had advised States in 2017 to administer pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to children under the age of five, the AIADMK government did not make an effort to do so, but the DMK government started it in July itself, the Minister said. “It will cost Rs. 12,000 for every child and not all parents can afford it. On the Chief Minister’s advice, we are administering the vaccine for free,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-criticises-aiadmk-on-vaccination/article36264839.ece

03 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC dismisses advance bail petition of passport official||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday dismissed the anticipatory bail petition of Senior Superintendent of Regional Passport Office, Madurai, V. Veeraputhiran. The CBI has registered a case against him on a charge of issuing Indian passports to Sri Lankan nationals after allegedly taking bribes from travel agents. Justice B. Pugalendhi took note of the fact that though he abided by the conditions imposed by the court, he had failed to cooperate in the inquiry. The court was also informed that the reason was that he had sustained spinal injuries, after the court had granted him an interim anticipatory bail directing him to cooperate with the inquiry. The court took into account the serious nature of the offence and observed that a custodial interrogation was warranted in the case. In his petition, Veeraputhiran said he was innocent and he did not demand any bribe from anyone. He said that he was deputed to the Passport Office in Tirunelveli in 2019. It was alleged that he had entered into a criminal conspiracy and issued passports to many ineligible applicants in consideration for a bribe of Rs. 45,000. He said the allegation was not true and he would cooperate in the inquiry. The anticipatory bail petition was dismissed. The CBI is investigating the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-dismisses-advance-bail-petition-of-passport-official/article36265362.ece
03 September 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘First 50’ batch of MMC goes down memory lane||The first batch of 50 students who were admitted to Madurai Medical College after the then Union Health Minister Rajkumari Amrit Kaur inaugurated the institution on August 2, 1954, came together on the virtual platform for a first reunion after 67 years. Fifteen of the “first 50,” as they are called, had two hours of nostalgia chat. In their 80’s now, they recalled the contribution of their teachers “who not only taught us medicine and clinical diagnosis but also communication and life skills, etiquette and compassion.” A. Devadoss, 84, who still performs surgeries and teaches, went down memory lane about his first day at the medical college. “We were asked to wear white shirt and trousers with blue ties which were not available in any shop. We bought blue cloth and got the ties stitched overnight, “ he said. Mathiprakasam, 86, a general practitioner in Thoothukudi, is the only other doctor from the batch who continues to see patients. The friends in the group used to get together once in three years. The group has shrunk to 19 now and some of the doctors have developed health issues. “Though the pandemic helped us connect with technology, online learning is not good for students,” said Dr. Devadoss. “For anatomy and physiology classes, a student has to see, feel and touch to understand the human body and I hope things return to normal soon,” he said. Spouses of five deceased doctors also came on board to share their memories and in gratitude of the friendship that continues among the first-50 batchmates.

03 September 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||12 burglary cases solved, 3 held||Madurai district police have solved 12 cases of burglaries reported in Madurai and Virudhunagar districts with the arrest of three persons from Peraiyur. The police identified the accused as R. Rajakani, 29, of S. Paraipatti, M. Sundaram, 32, and K. Thangapandi, 31, of Chokkalingapuram. The gang would conduct a recce in select areas and identify locked houses before striking at them, Madurai Superintendent of Police V. Baskaran said. They would park their car in front of the gate and even as one would keep a watch on movement of people on the street, the other two would break open the house and almirahs. “They will lay their hands on all valuables, including household articles and electronic goods, so that they make the most of their effort and leave the house at the earliest,” the SP said. The houseowners’ habit of leaving keys on the almirahs at most expected places made their task only easier. “All of them had got stuck in financial crisis in the last few months and started to strike at locked houses outside their locality to make some quick money,” Deputy Superintendent of Police (Tirumangalam) S. S. Vinothini said. The accused had sold the goods at throwaway prices. The police recovered from them Rs. 1.10 lakh in cash, over 27 grams of gold jewellery, four LED TVs, three mobile phones, a laptop and several utensils and lamps worth Rs. 6.80 lakh. They had struck 12 houses in various parts of Madurai and Virudhunagar districts in the last two months. An analysis of the cellphone tower signals in all the crime scenes led the police to the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/12-burglary-cases-solved/article36264967.ece

The main accused are yet to be apprehended, the court said.

03 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Crowd in Big Market a concern||The crowding inside the Big Market on Jawaharlal Nehru Street due to lack of space has become a huge concern for the government and the public during the pandemic. Apathy in either improving the existing infrastructure or shifting the landmark market in Puducherry has led to civic authorities being unable to do anything for crowd management or enforcement of COVID-19 norms. The 13 gates that exist on Rangapillai Street, J.N. Street, Mahatma Gandhi Road and Bharathi Street have become cramped as vendors have occupied the entrance. The lanes inside the market have also gone into the hands of vendors, making it difficult for people to walk. “There is no way that we could follow social distancing norms or avoid coming in close contact with people as there is lack of space. All the lanes are occupied by the vendors,” Krishnamoorthy, a resident of Lawspet, said. “On Saturdays and Sundays, the situation turns horrible with no space even to stand. People have to jostle to buy items,” said Vijayan, a resident of Gnanaprakasam Nagar. S. Nadarajan, a resident of Ambalathadayar Madam Street, said the market has become highly congested due to growth in population and increase in the number of vendors. Closely-situated shops selling vegetables, fruits, flowers and household utensils added to the problem. The chaotic manner in which the shops are spread leave little space for customers to move about. “The market should be reconstructed in the existing place itself. It should be made more spacious with all infrastructure for shop owners and customers. It should not be re-located,” he added. According to local legislator G. Nehru alias Kuppusamy, the market was designed to cater to only a certain number of customers. With the increase in population, the market, in its present condition, cannot cater to such huge crowds. “It is true that people cannot follow social distancing norms. The unregulated way in which the vendors occupy the lanes creates hurdles for customers. People throng the market as goods here are cheaper and all household items are available under one roof,” he said. The safety of shop owners as well as customers are at risk. In the event of any accident, rescue services personnel would face difficulties entering the premises, he cautioned. Minister for Public Works K. Lakshminarayanan said the government was ready with a design and plan to reconstruct the market. Under the Smart City Project, the government has planned to construct one more floor, the Minister said. “If existing vendors and shop owners cooperate, we can construct one more floor in a year. We can provide all facilities and reconstruct the market in the existing place itself,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crowd-in-big-market-a-concern/article36265167.ece
03 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||DMK leads walkout from U.T. Assembly||Three Independents on Thursday joined DMK and Congress members in staging a walkout from the Puducherry Assembly against the denial of permission to the Dravidian party to move a resolution seeking withdrawal of the controversial farm laws introduced by the Union Government. During a discussion on demands for grants, Opposition leader R. Siva raised the issue of farm laws, and wanted the House to pass a resolution requesting the Centre to withdraw the legislation. Home Minister A. Namassivayam and Minister for Civil Supplies A.K. Sai J. Saravana Kumar countered the Opposition leader’s charge that the three legislation were against the farming community. The Chief Minister was away when the issue was raised. The Home Minister said the Opposition wanted to move the resolution with a political motive, and urged them to give specifics on the adverse impact of the legislation. Mr. Kumar said that only middlemen were against the legislation as a large number of farmers had accepted the laws. Mr. Siva said, “We will not accept the replies given by the BJP Ministers. Let the Chief Minister make a statement.” The issue again cropped up after the Chief Minister returned to the floor. The DMK and the Congress members were on their feet demanding answers after the Chief Minister occupied his seat. As the Chief Minister maintained silence, the DMK and Congress members staged a walkout. Independents G. Nehru, P.R. Siva and Prakash Kumar, who so far maintained equidistance from the NDA and the Congress-DMK camp joined the eight protesting legislators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-leads-walkout-from-assembly/article36265160.ece
03 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||CAG expresses concern about unhygienic eateries in U.T.||The Comptroller and Auditor General in its report on food safety has expressed serious concern at the possible adverse implications on public health due to the unregulated growth of Food Business Operators, including eateries, in the Union Territory. The CAG report tabled in the Assembly on Thursday said physical verification carried by the audit team in food outlets revealed that several of them are operating in unhygienic conditions and without proper licence. The report detailing the functioning of the Food Department pointed out that an inspection conducted in 89 outlets revealed that 45% of them are functioning in unhygienic conditions and were not as per the norms prescribed under the Food Safety and Standard Rules, 2011. The inspection found that foods classified under high risk categories are being cooked and displayed in the open outside the restaurants /hotels on the roadside. Besides, the general hygienic and sanitary practices noticed in the storage of food items was “unhygienic and unfit.”’ “The food outlets were functioning near the drainage. The food was cooked in an open, unhygienic area in these outlets and the stored food was found to be infested with worms. The consumers were exposed to risk of food poisoning and other gastro-intestinal problems,” the report said. A physical survey conducted by a joint audit team in restaurants, canteens, food manufactures, wholesalers revealed many of them were functioning without any licence, thereby giving room for them to operate outside the system. Of the 212 outlets surveyed in the Union Territory, 97 of them were functioning without any licence. Adherance to mandatory registration process would make the Food Department to properly monitor the functioning of the units, the report added. The reports said that the Department of Food and Drug Testing lifted samples from 439 outlets in 2016-17, 420 in 2017-18 and 2,037 in 2018-19. Of the samples tested during the years, food items lifted from 33 outlets were found to be unsafe for consumption. The department had failed to initiate any action against the 33 defaulting food outlets for selling substandard items, the report added. Pointing out that the Union Territory had only one food testing laboratory and about lack of food safety officers, the report said non-strengthening of infrastructure facilities in the laboratory had resulted in issue of test reports without analysing all the required safety parameters. “Consumers remained exposed to unsafe food items as vital tests were not conducted in the laboratory. Even accuracy, of the test results was questionable as the existing lab is deficient in infrastructure. The gaps in the implementation of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, clearly indicated that food safety was not prioritised and given importance to as it deserved. The adverse implications on the health of the populace are thus a matter of serious concern,” the report said. Unfruitful Expenditure The report had also pointed out that awarding of construction of a high-level bridge without ensuring availability of requisite land for the approach road had led to unfruitful expenditure of Rs. 24.84 crore as the newly-constructed bridge remained unused and inaccessible in the absence of approach roads. Also, the work for flood control project in Yanam, without ensuring site free from encumbrances and proper plan for execution coupled with inordinate delay in the finalisation of revised DPR, caused delay in executing the project for over eight years, despite an expenditure of Rs. 23. 11 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cag-expresses-concern-about-unhygienic-eateries-in-ut/article36265162.ece

While the traders in the 15-ward Swamimalai Town Panchayat staged a bandh last week to register their protest, the local people managed to seek the attention of their elected representative, M. H. Jawahirullah towards this issue. Responding positively to their plea, Mr. Jawahirullah assured them that he would take up the issue with the Chief Minister and urge him to elevate the Swamimalai Town Panchayat as a Selection Grade Town Panchayat. It would be apt to merge Baburajapuram and Thiruvalanchuzhi areas with Swamimalai instead of merging Swamimalai Town Panchayat with Kumbakonam Municipality so as to elevate the status of Kumbakonam town into that of a Corporation, he opined. The Swamimalai Town Panchayat comprising the famous Swaminathaswamy temple attracts devotees in large numbers. With a little over 2,000 residential, mixed residential and commercial properties under its belt the civic body collects little over Rs. 30 lakh as property and other taxes and around Rs. 8 to Rs. 10 lakh as tourist vehicle entry tax per annum, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/merging-of-swamimalai-with-kumbakonam-opposed/article36264931.ece

03 September 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Renovated Chathiram Bus Stand may reopen this month||As delay in reopening the refurbished Chathiram Bus Stand continues to pose hardship to passengers and bus crews, the Tiruchi Corporation says it will open it for public use within this month. According to sources, construction of two terminus at the Chathiram Bus Stand has almost been constructed. Except for the finishing touches, all major works have been completed. They have been constructed with the facilities to operate 32 buses at any time. Each terminus has 16 bays along with passenger amenities. Each terminus has a toilet complex and provision has been given for passengers to keep their luggage in the cloakroom. There is a facility for the bus crew to take rest in the groundfloor terminus. In addition to them, a parking lot has also been constructed to accommodate over 300 two-wheelers. The entire ground of the Chathiram Bus Stand is provided with concrete top so as to ensure smooth operation of buses. Though it was scheduled to be completed in March, the officials had expressed optimism on opening the terminus before the announcement of the dates for the State elections. But, the work dragged on even after completion of the elections. It was expected that it would be thrown open for public use on or before Independence Day but that did not happen. Though the operation of buses was managed with the temporary bus bays established along the road sides for more than two years, it is becoming increasing difficult for the bus crews to operate the buses in the temporary as near normal situation returns with the State government lifting several restrictions imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19. “The festival season is set to begin shortly. Considering the frequent traffic chaos and handling of festive crowds, the bus stand should be opened as early as possible,” says H. Ghouse Baig, a consumer activist. When contacted P. M. N. Mujubur Rahuman, Corporation Commissioner, told The Hindu that most of the works had been completed. Fine-tuning works were on and they would be completed within one or two weeks. The bus stand would be opened for the public use within September, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/renovated-chathiram-bus-stand-may-reopen-this-month/article36264942.ece
03 September 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Two more barrages planned across Kollidam river||The Water Resources Department has proposed to build a couple of barrages across the Kollidam river in the delta region. One of the two new barrages has been planned on the river at 79.5 km downstream of Upper Anicut, connecting Thoothur on the left bank of the river in Thirumanur taluk in Ariyalur district and Vazhkkai on the right bank in Papanasam taluk in Thanjavur district, according to the policy note of the Water Resources Department presented in the Assembly recently. The estimated water storage capacity of the barrage will be one thousand million cubic (tmc) feet. Construction of the barrage will ensure water supply to Ponnar channel and an ayacut of 4,696 acres will get assured supply of water for irrigation. There were more than 300 tube wells and 17 TWAD Board infiltration galleries around the proposed site and construction of the barrage would help recharge the groundwater benefiting the schemes. Also, constructing a barrage-cum-bridge across the river will provide connectivity between the two villages in Thanjavur and Ariyalur districts, facilitating transportation of people and commodity. After completion of Planning, Design and Investigation, the details of land acquisition will be finalised. Surveying, levelling and soil investigation works have been completed and currently preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) was under progress. The department has proposed another barrage across Kollidam at Mathirivelur in Kollidam block in Mayiladuthurai district and Nallamputhur in Komaratchi block in Cuddalore district. The barrage is expected to help improve the groundwater table in the surrounding villages. The project would entail acquisition of 242.882 hectares of patta land and 39.958 hectares of poramboke land. Surveying, levelling and soil investigation works have been completed for the proposed barrage and an estimate valued at Rs. 399 crore was under the consideration of the government. The policy note also indicated that 74% if the works on the construction of a barrage with head sluice across the River Kollidam, between Adhanur and Kumaramangalam villages of Cuddalore and Mayiladuthurai districts, has been completed so far. The project is being executed at an estimated cost Rs. 494.60 crore. Acquisition of 84.72 hectares of patta lands and 12.898 hectares of poramboke lands is being carried out by Revenue Department. The barrage with a capacity of 0.334 tmcft and total usable annual storage of 1.072 tmcft in four fillings would benefit an ayacut of 31,221 acres, out of which 26,810 acres through stabilisation and 4,411 acres by recharge of existing wells in Cuddalore and Mayiladuthurai districts. Water stored under this scheme will be utilised for drinking water supply to Chennai through Veeranam Tank. Villages on both the banks of the river will be linked by the bridge over the barrage.  Bridging the divide One barrage will connect Thoothur in Ariyalur district and Vazhkkai in Thanjavur district The other will connect Mathirivelur in Mayiladuthurai district and Nallamputhur in Cuddalore district 74% construction work is over on the barrage that connects Adhanur in Cuddalore district and Kumaramangalam in Mayiladuthurai district||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-more-barrages-planned-across-kollidam-river/article36264933.ece

03 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Look-out notice for Bulgarian||A Look-Out Circular (LOC) has been issued against the Bulgarian national, Ilian Zdrakov Markok, 55, who escaped from the special camp here a few days ago. Even as three special teams of the Tiruchi police were on the job of tracking down Markok, the LOC was issued against him by the Chennai City Crime Branch which had booked a cheating case against him a couple of years ago. The circular was issued on the day when Markok was found to have escaped from the camp that accommodates foreign nationals against whom cases had been booked in Tamil Nadu and were facing trial. The Chennai City Crime Branch had in 2019 registered a case against Markok under various IPC sections. Markok reportedly broke open the window grille using a sharp object and escaped despite a vigil mounted by the Tamil Nadu Special Police personnel. Police sources said an alert had been sounded all over the State to prevent him from escaping the country. The K.K.Nagar police here had registered a case under IPC section 224 (Resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension). The sources said the other inmates in the camp were being inquired. One of the special teams headed by an inspector of police was camping in Chennai to trace his whereabouts. Meanwhile, bandobust has been strengthened at the camp which is already equipped with CCTV units. In July 2019, a Nigerian national escaped from the camp and was re-arrested later. The special camp, under the control of the Tiruchi Collector, is not a prison and the inmates were not being treated as prisoners lodged in jails, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/look-out-notice-for-bulgarian/article36264828.ece

The two villages were completely backward and none residing in those villages were employed with the government service, they claimed and appealed to the District Collector not to merge the villages with the Corporation. The residents raised slogans in support of their demand earlier near the Collectorate before submitting the memorandum to the District Revenue Officer, said police sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-of-two-villages-oppose-merger-with-corporation/article36264940.ece

03 September 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 protocol: Tirunelveli CoP talks tough||With an anticipated ‘third wave’ of COVID-19 fast approaching and marginal rise in new cases being reported in several districts, Tirunelveli city police are all set to crack the whip against pandemic protocol violators. “Since a sizeable population still does not wear masks and violates COVID-19 protocol, the city police have been instructed to act tough against the violators in a bid to curb possible spike in new cases ahead of the anticipated third wave,” Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli City, N.K. Senthamarai Kannan told reporters here on Thursday. Despite repeated appeal to the public to wear mask and ensure physical distancing while coming out of their houses, the norms were being violated at will and a section of the people continued to show scant respect for COVID-19 protocol. Hence, tough action by the police would be taken against the violators while they visited public places. The shops, while receiving their customers on their premises, should not allow any violation when they were purchasing. After checking the customers’ body temperature at the entrance, the shops should ensure that the customers wore masks and maintained physical distancing until they left their premises. Those who chose to turn a blind eye towards such violations, would be forced to close down their business establishments. Of the 1,128 policemen in the city, 1,022 had been vaccinated and had conducted COVID-19 awareness programmes at 709 places so far. Mr. Senthamarai Kannan appealed to traders, public organisations and residents’ welfare associations to ensure installation of CCTV cameras at the 200-odd ‘blind spots’ in the city to curb crimes and movement of criminals. “We are in need of a minimum 2,000 CCTV cameras in Tirunelveli city,” he said. On rash driving by government and private buses within the city, he said he would soon have a meeting with transport officials and owners of private bus companies to tell them in clear terms that any violation of traffic regulation would land them and their personnel in trouble. Stopping buses at will at undesignated stops for dropping or taking commuters would also attract legal action, he warned. “To check the traffic rule and road safety violations, three ‘bike marshals’ have been deployed in the city, who would be on the move,” said Mr. Senthamarai Kannan, adding that barricades would be put near FX Engineering College to ensure safe crossing of students and near Galaxy Hospital on North Bypass Road for the benefit of patients coming to the hospital. The Commissioner of Police, in the presence of Deputy Commissioners of Police T.P. Suresh Kumar (Law and Order) and K. Suresh Kumar (Crime and Traffic), handed over mobile phones to six persons on Thursday, while owners of 51 mobile phones and a tablet, all worth about Rs. 6.90 lakh, had been informed of the recovery of their communication gadgets. “We recovered 101 mobile phones worth Rs. 11.85 lakh this year,” the CoP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-protocol-tirunelveli-cop-talks-tough/article36265235.ece

Come what may...,” said K. Kutralanathan, State secretary of Hindu Munnani. Earlier, he offered prayers in front of Nellaiyappar Temple here, seeking divine intervention for permission from the State government for Vinayaka Chaturthi celebration. He told reporter s that the DMK-led government, which did not have the courage to stop Muslims from offering Bakrid prayers in public places, or the ongoing annual festival in Velankanni, banned Vinayaka Chaturthi celebration citing COVID-19 restrictions to prove once again that it was an “anti-Hindu government”. While liquor shops and cinema halls were allowed to function as usual, the religious rights of the Hindus were being denied after the DMK came to power on May 7, Mr. Kutralanathan said adding that Vinayaka Chaturthi celebration would begin with kaappu kattu on Friday. In Thoothukudi, Hindu Munnani cadre offered prayers in several Vinayaka temples in the port town and submitted petition to the Lord seeking His intervention against the ban.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hindu-munnani-to-defy-vinayaka-chaturthi-ban/article36264965.ece

03 September 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Airport project gets a boost||The district administration has recommended acquisition of 10.72 acres from residents for completing the airport project on the Chennai-Bengaluru Highway. A detailed report, including total land needed and compensation package, has been sent to the government a few days ago to speed up the project. The land that needs to be acquired includes open lands, mainly privately owned, and the recently laid Abdullapuram-Alangayam Road, a State highway that connects Anaicut taluk in the district. The narrow stretch bifurcates the terminal and its runways with the Bengaluru Highway. “We have sent the report to the government. The land will be given to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to complete the project,” said an official. Once a narrow airstrip that was used since the British times mainly to transport essentials to the stationed officers, the new Vellore airport spreads over 98 acres of land along the Bengaluru Highway. At present, the under-construction airport has a runway, which is 850 m-long, a taxiway, ground handling equipment, air traffic control (ATC) and aviation information receiving facility, a terminal building and an oil depot. Land is needed to complete additional facilities, including parking lots, passenger amenities and connecting roads. The new airport can operate 20-seater planes to cities like Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. The airport was sanctioned under the second phase of the UDAN-RCS (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik - Regional Connectivity Scheme) a few years ago to provide connectivity to smaller towns, especially those closer to metropolitan cities and tier-two cities. AAI officials said once the land is given by the district administration, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) would issue airport licences after the Civil Aviation Ministry carried out spot inspections. Thereafter, the new airport would become operational. “Basic facilities at the new airport are ready. Land is needed to complete a few remaining works,” said an AAI official. The new airport will benefit those who want to travel to or from the Christian Medical College and VIT, and leather traders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/airport-project-gets-a-boost/article36265248.ece

After lamenting that the Centre behaved like a stepmother in distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, Minister for Public Health Ma. Subramaniam was saying that the State had adequate vaccine stock, thanks to the Union government, he said. “Hence, the DMK, which has passed a resolution in the Assembly against the farm laws and NEET with political motive, will understand the reality and accept it within next three months,” Mr. Annamalai said and urged the party workers to explain the advantages of the farm laws and NEET to the public. Addressing the party workers, he said the BJP, which won four Assembly segments in Tamil Nadu, would register resounding victory in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls as the voters, especially young electorate, were getting attracted towards the BJP. The party should be strengthened at the grassroots by forming booth committees and should exhibit its strength in the coming civic elections to provide firm base for the next parliamentary and 2026 Assembly elections. In other words, the victory in the local body elections should pave way for the election of over 150 BJP MLAs in Tamil Nadu. Before participating in the party meeting, Mr. Annamalai met veteran BJP functionaries in their homes to seek their blessings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-will-soon-accept-farm-laws-and-neet-annamalai/article36264954.ece

03 September 2021||Begnaluru,KARNATAKA||Software engineer attacked by duo||The Baiyappanahalli police are on the lookout for two armed men who allegedly assaulted and robbed a 23-year-old software engineer at Horamavu on Tuesday. Dinesh Kumar S., a resident of Hoysala Nagar, was walking to his workplace for his night shift when two men blocked his way at the railway track above the Horamavu underpass. “The attackers pulled out a knife and demanded that he give them his valuables,” said a police officer. With no one to call for help, Dinesh gave them his laptop bag, phone, and wallet which had Rs. 90. Unsatisfied, the two began to threaten him. At the same time, they saw a train approaching and started forcing Dinesh towards it, threatening to push him under it. “When he resisted, they attacked him with the knife. As he was trying to reason with them, his phone started ringing. It was the victim’s brother calling to check in on him. The accused instructed him to get his brother to transfer money to his own digital wallet,” said the officer. One of the attackers left to buy liquor, while his friend waited for the money to be transferred. But Dinesh had given him the wrong mobile password. A few minutes later, Dinesh's brother along with his friends arrived at the spot. Sensing trouble, the attacker threw the laptop bag and escaped. The police have taken up a case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/software-engineer-attacked-by-duo/article36264777.ece
03 September 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Fair wages, low-cost Internet, water supply among election promises||Elections to the Belagavi City Corporation being fought this time on party ticket have thrown up some interesting candidature. Among them are an IT engineer, a former journalist, a housewife, a social worker and an entrepreneur who wants to have his own style of Mann Ki Baat. Sarala Satpute did not lose heart when she was sacked from a Kannada newspaper during the lockdown. She set up a Customer Service Centre that helps residents get copies of government documents such as caste certificates and plunged into mainstream social service. She began helping weavers who lost livelihood due to the lockdown. She raised donations, distributed food packets and helped women in the Old City sell saris they had handwoven. Ms. Satpute, whose parents who worked in a weaving factory, is among the few post-graduate women candidates in the field. She was an active in student organisations while studying her Master’s in Mass Media in Bengaluru University. The Congress candidate from Ward No 21 has promised fair wages to weaver workers and remunerative prices for handloom and powerloom products. Ajit Patil, independent candidate from Ward No 46. is promising low-cost internet to students, while most candidates are promising drinking water, roads, jobs, housing and parks in the city. The IT professional quit a job in an MNC in Canada to start two businesses in Belagavi, his home town. He founded FAAST, an internet provider company that offers high quality internet at a cost lower than the big names in the business. The local company achieved significant success, prompting him to start a unit to produce an electric bike with all locally made parts. He is using tech tools such as drones for campaigning, GPS live location tracking for efficient logistics management, targeted social media advertising, use of QR codes to send messages, pre-recorded phone calls and GPS geofencing for campaign management. A team of professionals, including engineers and young lawyers, is helping him in his campaign. He has promised an AI-enabled network of CCTV cameras across the city, sports facilities and more public toilets. His company has set up a free WiFi facility on the District Court premises. Vani Vilas Joshi, BJP candidate from Ward No 43, decided to fight the polls on a hot afternoon two years ago. A couple of women had gone to complain to the then councillor about irregular water supply but he refused to hear them. “That day, I decided to enter the corporation council,” she said. Water features prominently in her list of promises. The others are State-sponsored care for elders and increased job opportunities to local youth. Advocate Sarita Pratik Shipurkar has promised free legal aid to voters. She has already been offering free legal counselling to women in distress and alternative dispute resolution tools to parties in disputes. The independent candidate from Ward No 32 is also particular that each home should get drinking water on their doorstep. Social work is not new to Seema Babasaheb Inamdar who has been helping people in her area get things done in government offices. The Janata Dal(S) candidate from Ward No 13 has promised democratic and accountable governance for all residents. “I have been organising awareness programmes on government schemes for the welfare of minorities and I want to extend them to other areas and make them a regular feature in the city corporation’s agenda,’’ she said. Shreyas Somashekar Nakadi, entrepreneur from Ward No 34, believes in grassroots level planning. He wants to organise “Janata Ki Baat-Janata Ke Sath” programmes in all the wards to address the problems of the residents and seek their inputs in the formulation of plans. He says that he is inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann Ki Baat programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fair-wages-low-cost-internet-water-supply-among-election-promises/article36265001.ece

The Union government’s policies and actions have led to regular increase in the prices of fuel and that has a cascading effect on prices of various commodities. It has crippled the economy and hurt the common man the most. There has been a 116% increase in the prices of food and other essential commodities across sectors. The prices of fuel have increased over 50%, despite the international prices falling by 25%. The BJP is not bothered even to explain the reasons behind the increase, she said. She accused the government of profiteering from such situations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/laxmi-hebbalkar-slams-bjp-government/article36265002.ece
03 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP polls not on the cards for now||Residents of Belagavi, Hubballi-Dharwad, and Kalaburagi will cast their vote to elect their local civic representatives on Friday. But even a year after the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) council’s term ended and an administrator took over operations of the civic body, it is unlikely the residents of Bengaluru will cast their vote anytime soon. Though the State Election Commission (SEC) is keen on holding elections to the BBMP, the legal and political tangle over it may push elections to next year, sources said. They added that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was not keen on holding polls in the near future. B. Basavaraaju, State Election Commissioner, said that though the commission was legally fighting the case to conduct civic polls in Bengaluru at the earliest, things have been delayed as the case is now before the Supreme Court. Hearing a petition filed by the SEC, the High Court of Karnataka had, in December 2020, directed the conduct of polls to 198 wards within six weeks. However, the State government formed a joint legislature committee that recommended the expansion of BBMP to 243 wards. The government passed the BBMP Act, 2020, which provides for 243 wards in the civic body in February this year, following which the State challenged the High Court order in the Supreme Court, arguing that elections have to be held to 243 wards. Delimitation   Even the delimitation of 243 wards is not yet complete. The committee formed for the purpose in October 2020 has met only twice till date. A senior official who is part of the delimitation committee said the joint legislature committee had recommended the inclusion of villages within a 1 km radius of the existing BBMP boundary, in case these villages are sufficiently urbanised. “This process of including new villages is what is taking time,” the official said, refusing to put a deadline for the process. “The State government is neither letting us hold elections to the existing 198 wards nor completing the delimitation exercise for 243 wards and submitting it to us, thus delaying the polls,” Mr. Basavaraaju said. ‘BJP not ready’ Meanwhile, multiple sources in the BJP said the party was not keen on holding civic polls in the city anytime soon. “There is a new dispensation in the State and it will be given some time before going for civic polls in the city. The party feels the timing for polls is not yet right,” a senior city-based party leader said. “We will take up new programmes in the city and then plan for polls.” The party will hold its first meeting on civic polls in the city on Monday. The meeting, chaired by State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel, will see all prominent party leaders of the city participate, sources said. “At present, we are planning for BBMP elections by March-April 2022,” said a senior party office-bearer from Bengaluru. A senior party leader overseeing polls to the three aforementioned city corporations said, “Given the COVID-19 restrictions, we are not happy with civic polls being held in the three North Karnataka cities either. We are not even being allowed to hold rallies, which is no way to hold polls. The BBMP elections will see nearly one crore voters exercise their franchise, which is not advisable given the situation we are seeing in Kerala and Maharashtra.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-polls-not-on-the-cards-for-now/article36264775.ece
03 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||New COVID-19 cluster in city: 34 nursing students infected||As many as 34 nursing students of a private nursing college at Horamavu have tested positive for COVID-19, making it one of the biggest clusters in Bengaluru. While all those who have tested positive have been admitted to the HAL COVID-19 Care Centre (CCC) and are said to be stable, the other students have been placed under institutional quarantine. The 22 girls and 12 boys of Christian College of Nursing, who tested positive, have some travel history, with most of them coming from Kerala and some from West Bengal. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials told The Hindu that epidemiologists have identified multiple sources of infection and it could not be on account of their travel history alone. The students entered Bengaluru with RT-PCR negative reports on August 5, officials said. “However, after coming to the city, they visited shops in the neighbourhood and also ordered food through delivery apps. This is why we have stated that the source of infection could be from multiple sources,” an official said. The zonal epidemiologist of Mahadevapura said that the college management informed the civic body after three students staying in the same room at the girls’ hostel developed symptoms. Initially, 10 students tested positive on August 28, following which they were shifted to the HAL CCC. On August 29, the BBMP took up testing of primary and secondary contacts, including teachers, housekeeping staff, and residents of the adjacent apartment. On August 30, another 12 students tested positive. On August 31, the civic body took up testing of all the residents of the boys’ hostel and of another building within the campus. Another 12 students tested positive, taking the total number of infected persons to 34. The epidemiologist said that samples have been collected and sent for genome sequencing. “The students who have tested positive are partially vaccinated. They do not have any major symptoms and are recovering in the CCC. The other nursing students, who are under institutional quarantine, have been asked to monitor their health and immediately report in case they develop any symptoms.” The college and hostel buildings have been sealed. The management has told the remaining students not to come to the college. Offline classes have been suspended and online ones have resumed. The local police station has been informed about the containment zone, which has now been barricaded, said civic officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-covid-19-cluster-in-city-34-nursing-students-infected/article36264783.ece
03 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Karnataka records 97% drop in active cases in 100 days||In 100 days, Karnataka has flattened the active cases by 97% from 6,03,639 on May 17 to 18,386 on August 31. In the last four weeks, active cases dropped from 24,280 to 18,386. A look at the district-wise spread of active cases in August shows that Bidar and Raichur had the lowest number of active cases -- two and six, respectively. At the other end of the spectrum, five districts contributed 75% of State’s total active cases as on August 31. Bengaluru Urban had the highest number with 7,438 active cases, contributing 41% of the total active cases. With 2,322 active cases, Dakshina Kannada shared 13%, Udupi (1,697) 9%, Mysuru (1,021) and Hassan (1,050) 6% each. Experts say the performance of these districts in September and October will set the future COVID-19 trend in the State. The number of new COVID-19 cases in the State increased by only 1.4% during this month — from 29.09 lakh to 29.49 lakh, up by 39,487 cases. According to an analysis by Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership initiative involving Public Health Foundation of India, Indian Medical Association and Proxima, a management consulting firm, 10 districts, which added more than a thousand new cases, contributed 87% of the total new COVID-19 cases in the State during this period. While Bengaluru Urban added 9,322 cases, Dakshina Kannada added 8,720, Udupi 3,719, Mysuru 2,728, Hassan 2,634, Kodagu 1,981, Uttara Kannada 1,386, Chikkamagaluru 1,326, Shivamogga 1,258 and Tumakuru 1,216 cases. Mysore Sanjeev, convener of Project Jeevan Raksha, said eight districts in the State demonstrated high-quality containment management by ensuring less than 100 new cases during the period. While Koppal, Vijayapura, Raichur and Bagalkote reported 69, 64, 59 and 53 cases respectively, Haveri saw 52 cases, Gadag 43, Yadgir 31 and Bidar 30.  With the death toll increasing by 688 (from 36,647 to 37,315) during August, the 28-day mortality Moving Growth Rate (MGR) of Karnataka during this period remained at 1.8%. While Raichur reported zero COVID-19 deaths during the period, Yadgir, Gadag, Bidar, and Kalaburagi witnessed one death each. The number of deaths in Dakshina Kannada outnumbered Bengaluru Urban in a single month. While Dakshina Kannada witnessed 130 deaths, Bengaluru Urban reported 101 deaths, which means that one in every five COVID-19 deaths in Karnataka occurred in Dakshina Kannada. Two-third of the deaths occurred in Dakshina Kannada (130), Bengaluru Urban (101), Hassan (54), Kolar (49), Mysuru (49), Udupi (38), and Mandya (26), according to the analysis. “The 28-day mortality Moving Growth Rate is relatively higher in Dakshina Kannada (9%), Udupi (9%), and Kolar (8.5%), when compared with the State's mortality MGR of 1.8%. This indicates that the daily death toll is relatively increasing faster when compared with other districts of the State,” Mr Sanjeev said. May challenging month So far, May has been the most challenging period for Karnataka wherein active cases crossed 6 lakh and Test Positivity Rate (TPR) for the month was over 25%. One in four people tested positive during May when 4.1 million tests were carried out and over a million COVID-19 patients were traced. However, in August Karnataka tested 4.8 million samples (20% higher than the tests carried out in May) and detected 44,321 cases. As many as 110 tests were carried out to detect one positive COVID patient, Mr Sanjeev said. “There is some room for Karnataka to improve its COVID management performance and reduce the active cases below 10,000 and death toll as well. It needs to scale up daily testing by at least three times from the current level in districts that witnessed relatively high caseloads in August,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-sees-97-drop-in-active-cases-in-100-days/article36264766.ece
03 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Ensure there is no illegal mining near KIA’||The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the State government to ensure that no illegal mining activities are carried out at Sadahalli stone quarry, which is surrounded by several residential layouts near Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the direction while hearing a petition filed by Ramabadran Veera Raghavan and five others, including 71-year-old former City Police Commissioner S. Mariswamy, who are residing in the residential townships at Sadahalli and Chowdenahalli villages in Devanahalli taluk. The petitioners had sought a direction to the government to revoke all the mining licences given for quarrying at Sadahalli and ban quarrying activity in the area as the quarry is surrounded by the two villages and residential townships such as Hollywood Town, Swiss Town, and Jade Town where retired senior citizens, including the petitioners, live. It was pointed out in the petition that stone quarrying activities at Sadahalli quarry were stopped a few years ago by not renewing mining licences following complaints from the public. Later, illegal mining activities started and the same were stopped with the intervention of the Lokayukta. The petitioners pointed out that they gave representations to the authorities against resuming quarrying activities in November 2020 when they came to know about the renewal of mining licences. Though no action was taken based on their representation, the petitioners said that mining activities were halted in view of COVID-19, but have now begun again. Questioning the grant of permission for mining in an area surrounded by residential layouts, the petitioners complained that dust from quarrying would cause serious health problems to the residents of the two villages and the townships, besides affecting aircraft operations. The petitioners have also questioned how mining activities could be permitted at Sadahalli, which is an integral part of the city as it is comes under the jurisdiction of the Bengaluru City Police Commissionerate. The Bench adjourned further hearing while directing the government to file its response to the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ensure-there-is-no-illegal-mining-near-kia/article36264773.ece
03 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice to Centre on ban on ECT as form of treatment||The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday ordered issue of notice to the Central government on a PIL petition questioning the validity of prohibition imposed on the medical practitioners, including psychiatrists in the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, from using electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a form of treatment on persons with mental illness. A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the order on the petition filed by Vinod G. Kulkarni, neuropsychiatrist and social activist from Hubballi.  Stating that it is necessary for the court to take the opinion of an expert body on whether ECT can be used or not, the Bench asked Dr. Kulkarni to implead the Director of the National Institute Mental Health and Neuroscience (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, as a party to the proceedings for taking the opinion.  Section 94(3) of the Act, which prohibits use of ECT as a form of treatment, is contrary to the very object of providing emergency treatment to mentally ill persons, particularly those who have suicidal tendencies, the petitioner claimed. “ECT, which is erroneously termed by people as ‘shock treatment’, if used in the cases mental illness leading to suicidal tendencies as an emergency treatment and treatment of choice, can undo suicidal ideas and suicidal attempts,” said Dr. Kulkarni in his petition.  ‘Can be saved’ The petitioner also claimed that “by administering modified ECT, mentally affected patients can be saved from the death due to suicide or other disastrous consequences.” While seeking a direction to quashed Section 94(3) and to direct the Centre to allow modified ECT as a form of treatment, the petitioner also requested the court to form a joint expert team comprising retired judges and experts from the mental health field to study the issue on need to use ECT as a form of treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-to-centre-on-ban-on-ect-as-form-of-treatment/article36264799.ece
03 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State govt. plans to conduct randomised testing of students||With upper primary classes set to reopen on Monday, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education plans to conduct random testing of students for COVID 19-in taluks where the positivity rate is high. According to officials, this will not only help them monitor the situation on ground, but also build confidence among parents to send their children to school. Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.C. Nagesh told The Hindu that he will issue oral orders to test students randomly in districts where the positivity rate is above 2%. “School managements, both private and government, will however have to obtain the consent from parents before a student’s swabs are drawn for testing,” said Mr. Nagesh. While the department had initially planned to test students in schools across the State, Mr. Nagesh said that a section of parents were against the move. “Parents told us that if students are forced to undergo tests, they would not send their children back to school. Hence, we will not impose it, but make it voluntary. Our only aim is to take all measures possible so that parents are confident about sending their children to school. We also want to create a conducive environment and ensure that children are safe in the school,” he added. The government had undertaken a similar exercise after high schools and second year pre-university classes reopened on September 23. A total of 6,472 high school and PU students tested for COVID-19. To date, around 14 students tested positive. The results of all the samples are however yet to be processed. Doctors, too, feel that randomised tests are the need of the hour. H.M. Prasanna, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) said that random testing, with parental consent, should be done as it would help prevent the spread of the virus on campuses. “The association had also recommended that all schools should appoint a nurse to help with the detection of early symptoms among students,” he said. School managements, however, are sceptical of whether this move will inspire confidence among parents. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said that many parents may not cooperate with this exercise. The government should test students only if they show symptoms of COVID-19, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/randomised-testing-of-students-planned/article36264787.ece

03 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Roads here resemble a war zone’||Infrastructure work such as white-topping, TenderSURE, and the laying of new underground drainage/drinking water pipelines is proving to be a nightmare for traders in the commercial hub of Avenue Road and Chickpet area. The slow progress on Avenue Road, where Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. (BSCL) has taken up work, has traders worried about business prospects, especially during the festive season. “It is an arterial road connecting southern parts of the city to the Central Business District. With non-existent footpaths, pedestrians have to vie for space on roads with the vehicles,” said Sajjan Raj Mehta, a trade activist. Rahul Goyal B.K., secretary of Karnataka Hardware and Allied Merchants’ Association, said the traffic diversion to SJP Road was causing a bottleneck on that road. BSCL managing director P. Rajendra Cholan claimed the white-topping work on the 900-metre Avenue Road would be completed soon. “We have already completed white-topping a 450-metre stretch. Work is taken up on 50 metres of road every day. By September 26, we hope to complete the white-topping and footpath work on Avenue Road,” he said. Other neighbourhoods are in a similar situation, with the recent spate of rains compounding the problem. For nearly two weeks now, several roads in Jayanagar I Block have been dug up by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which is laying a new underground drainage pipeline. Former Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun said that the work to replace the 70-year-old pipeline at Jayanagar I Block was approved by the then BBMP council around two years ago. On coordination Roopa D., a resident and member of Jayanagar I Block Residents’ Association, said that even getting in and out of homes had become difficult for citizens. “After the roads were dug up, the contractors have not come back,” she said, adding that there also seems to be poor coordination between the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) and the BBMP, which has also taken up white-topping of an arterial road in the area. Another resident, C.N. Kumar, said the roads now look like a war zone. “The roads have become non-motorable. What is more, the contractor has been demanding money from each household to connect the existing drainage system to the new line,” he said. BWSSB chairman N. Jayaram said contractors should not be taking money from residents to give a connection to the new line. “We will look into this complaint. We will also direct the contractor to expedite the work and minimise inconvenience to the residents,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/roads-here-resemble-a-war-zone/article36264781.ece

This time also job creation will be our priority.” He applauded the people who worked hard to complete the food park project. “The park is spread over 105 acres and has attracted over Rs. 1,000 crore in investment from national and international companies. This will help spur industrial growth,” he said. Replying to a query over denial of jobs to locals, Mr. Nirani said: “As per Dr. Sarojini Mahishi report, 80% of jobs must go to locals. I will hold talks with officials if there is any violation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/schedule-of-gim-2022-to-be-decided-in-15-days/article36264802.ece
03 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Lives of even the middle class have become miserable, says ex-CM||The BJP, which has been preaching “false nationalism” to the middle class, is making their lives miserable owing to steep price rise of all commodities, said former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah. Speaking at a press conference here on Thursday, he said that price rise, coupled with direct and indirect taxes, was proving a huge burden on the urban middle class as well. Talking about various products that have seen big jump in prices, he pointed out that cooking gas prices had gone up by Rs. 50 in a week. “Prices of all commodities is going up and there is no sign of anything coming down. Is this the promised acche din ?” he asked. He said that on the other hand, the number of the super rich was growing, with the debts of big corporates being waived by the government. “A government that takes away a poor farmer’s tractor for not repaying debt has waived about Rs. 7 lakh crore of corporate debt in seven years,” said Mr. Siddaramaiah. Mr. Siddaramaiah opposed the National Monetisation Pipeline scheme and said that huge national assets were being sacrificed to private interests. “Assets created over seven decades are being lost. Has Prime Minister Narendra Modi taken the consent of the people of this country to do this?” he sought to know. Arguing that people tend to talk excessively about things they in reality lack, he said the BJP and Sangh Parivar spoke excessively about nationalism and patriotism since they do not have a legacy of contributing to the freedom struggle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lives-of-even-the-middle-class-have-become-miserable-says-ex-cm/article36264794.ece
03 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Admission process begins sans NEP guidelines||The new academic year may be off to a bumpy start for degree college students. Many colleges have completed, or are in the process of wrapping up, admissions for the 2021-22 academic year, but have yet to receive guidelines on the new National Education Policy (NEP). As a result, students were unable to make the most of the revised combinations. They were instructed by college managements to choose regular subject combinations in their respective streams (such as arts, science and commerce), instead of selecting multi-disciplinary courses under the NEP. Many students say they were not made aware of this option. When contacted, principals said that students the would get a chance to re-select subjects across disciplines once the guidelines are issued. They added that they had no choice but to start the admission process on August 23, as per government orders. C.B. Annapurnamma, principal of National College, Basavanagudi, which began its admission process on August 23, said, “Universities that colleges are affiliated to will have to issue guidelines on the NEP and how students can choose multi-disciplinary courses. After we receive these guidelines, we will have a counselling session for parents and students so that they can understand the new system and choose courses accordingly.” Under the new system, students will be able to opt for two subjects in their chosen stream and one elective from another stream. This is a shift from the earlier system under which colleges had a fixed combination of three subjects from only one discipline. Almost all the students that The Hindu spoke to said they were not aware of this while completing the admission process. A student admitted into the B.Sc. programme at a government degree college in central Bengaluru said, “I have read about the NEP in the newspapers. I wanted to wait to see what electives the colleges would offer, but I was anxious and completed the admission process on Wednesday. I will be disappointed if the college does not offer economics as an elective,” she said. B. Thimme Gowda, vice-chairman, Karnataka State Higher Education Council, said that students who have opted for regular combinations would be informed that they can pick one elective subject. “So instead of the third subject, they can opt for an elective that will be a vocational course and help them become more employable,” he said. K.R. Venugopal, Vice-Chancellor of Bangalore University, said that they were waiting for the State-level subject committees to frame the syllabus. “Once these committees submit their report, we will place it before our academic council for approval and then issue guidelines to colleges in the second week of September. We are racing against time to make things happen this academic year,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/admission-process-begins-sans-nep-guidelines/article36264778.ece

While the third wave is expected in September-October, it may not be of the same intensity as the second wave unless there are no new virulent mutant strains,” he said. With the festival season approaching, people should not let their guard down. “Any complacency during this period will prove to be costly.

03 September 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Create awareness on vaccination: Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday urged BJP workers to strive for creating extensive awareness on vaccination in districts where it was lacking and people were hesitant to get vaccinated. Addressing a gathering after inaugurating the Gandhi Bhavan, the GMIT Central Library and the Karnataka State Police Public School (established at Kondajji) on the campus of GM Institute of Technology in Davangere, Mr. Shah said that it was high time one understood that 100% vaccination is the only solution to fight the pandemic. He urged BJP workers to convince people and take them to vaccination centres. Mr. Shah elaborated on steps taken by the Union government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fight the pandemic. He said that under Mr. Modi, the country had fought the pandemic effectively. He said that the country has been able to come out of the effects of the pandemic to some extent because 130 crore citizens joined hands with with Mr. Modi. Lakhs of corona warriors, including doctors and safai karamcharis, fought with him, while several lost their lives and others had sacrificed their lives. While the lives of some could not be saved, the collective steps helped in saving the lives of many, he said. He said that the biggest vaccination drive in the entire world is being run in the country with over one crore doses being given per day. As on date, the country has administered the highest number of vaccine doses in the world. On the Karnataka vaccination figures, he said that he was confident that the State will be covering 90% of the population by September-end under Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s leadership. Already 5.20 crore people have been vaccinated of whom 1.20 crore people have received the second dose also. Mr. Shah elaborated on the food kits distribution scheme of the Union government. During the first and second wave from May to November, 80 crore people were covered and five kilograms of foodgrains were given to households for 10 months as the government wanted to ensure that nobody suffered due to hunger during the pandemic. He said that because of the measures taken so far, the country is in a better position to fight the next wave of the pandemic, if any. As oxygen plants have been set up in view of oxygen shortage during the second wave, the country will be able to become self-reliant within a short time if any further wave of the pandemic struck, he said.

Ravikumar late on Wednesday night. Mr. Ravikumar has, however, rubbished the allegation saying that he did not beat up Suleiman. “I was not present at the spot.

Earlier, addressing presspersons, Suleiman, who is Ms. Fatima’s brother-in-law, said that Mr. Ravikumar stopped their vehicle near Haft Gumbad while they were on their way back home and started thrashing him [Suleiman] in front of the MLA. Condemning the incident, Congress leader Sharanprakash Patil said that the police have become a puppet in the hands of the BJP leaders. They could have booked him [Suleiman] if he had violated rules, Mr. Patil said and added that the Congress will take it [incident] to its logical end. “We will write to Home Minister Araga Jnanendra and also complain to the State Election Commission,” he added.

Mr. Bhat said that all 4,032 eligible people in Kavradi Gram Panchayat, comprising Kavradi and Halnadu villages, and 1,888 people in Nadur village, under Kaadur Gram Panchayat, have been vaccinated. He said that the staff of the Health Department and respective gram panchayats, ASHAs and their elected members personally identified those who have not taken the vaccine. They convinced such persons of the need to take the vaccine. The bed-ridden and the aged who could not make it to the vaccination sites were administered the vaccine on their doorsteps.

Panchayat Development Officer (PDO) of Kaadur Gram Panchayat Mahesh told The Hindu that the panchayat has two villages, Nadur and Kaadur. The success in Nadur is the result of well coordinated effort by officials and elected representatives. “We personally called up those who did not take the vaccine and convinced them to take it. It worked as such persons understood that there are people who are monitoring them,” he said. Mr. Mahesh said that all eligible people in Kaadur village will be given the first dose in a day or two. Only 22 people remain to be vaccinated in the village. Mr. Bhat said that 78% of the eligible people have been given the first dose under the jurisdiction of all gram panchayats in the district. All people should get themselves vaccinated to protect themselves and others from COVID-19. The gram panchayat level task forces should ensure this. Doctor Latha Nayak and her team at Kandlur Primary Health Centre and doctor Anil and his team at Mandarthi Primary Health Centre and Panchayat Development Officers of the respective gram panchayats have made the vaccination drive a success with good coordination, Mr. Bhat said. District COVID-19 Nodal Officer M.G. Rama said that all should get at least the first dose to get themselves protected from a possible third wave which can affect all.

03 September 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Proper scientific investigation is crucial in establishing prosecution case: Judge||While stressing on the importance of fingerprint analysis, DNA test, and other scientific investigation techniques in crime investigation, III Additional District and Sessions Judge B.B. Jakati on Thursday asked police officers to ensure that scientific investigation is carried out in the right way for courts to find credence in the findings. Inaugurating a three-day investigation skill training programme for the 75 police sub-inspectors and other crime investigation staff of the city, Mr. Jakati said that scientific investigation techniques play an important role in crime investigation as evidence given by such experts are crucial in establishing the prosecution case. Investigation officers should visit the crime scene and take all steps to secure the spot to enable collection of fingerprints, blood stains and other evidence. Officers should mention in the case diary about the visit of scientific officers to the scene of crime, he said. Asking officers to properly collect samples for DNA test, Mr. Jakati cautioned against filing charge-sheet before getting forensics report. Citing an instance, the judge said that in a murder case, DNA report, which came two years after the submission of charge-sheet, revealed that the deceased person was different from the one mentioned in the charge-sheet. “By the time, the accused had spent four years in judicial custody,” he said. Deputy Director of Prosecution Shivaprasad Alva said that committees at the district and State-levels review all cases of acquittal and disciplinary action is taken against investigation officers and prosecutors if lapses are found in the way they have discharged their duty. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar asked trainees to make the best use of the training programme and overcome possible lapses. During the three-day programme, focus will be on forensics investigation and on cases related to Protection of Children from Sexual Officers Act, Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and heinous crimes, he said.

03 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||MP wants Rajiv Gandhi’s name dropped from Nagarahole park||Close on the heels of C.T. Ravi, BJP MLA, seeking to rename Indira Canteens, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha has urged Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to rename the Rajiv Gandhi National Park at Nagarahole in honour of Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa. His letter to the Chief Minister follows an online petition launched by a few individuals in August urging the State government to rename the park after Field Marshal Cariappa. The online petition has garnered nearly 15,000 signatures. It argues that the park was originally known as Nagarahole and was renamed after Rajiv Gandhi “to please a particular family and its party”. Hence, the petition calls for either reverting to the original name or renaming it in honour of Field Marshal Cariappa who was from Kodagu. In his letter dated August 30, Mr. Simha argued that several national parks in India bear the names of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family, which he described as an attempt to “wrongfully appropriate inheritance of projects”. Online campaign Citing the online campaign, he said that Nagarahole derives its name from a winding river that runs eastward through the forest, which was declared a sanctuary in 1955. The forest was spread over 258 sq. km, which was subsequently expanded to cover an area of 643.39 sq. km spread across Mysuru and Kodagu districts. Keeping in mind the sentiments of a vast majority of people of Kodagu district, Mr. Simha requested that the park be renamed Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa Nagarahole National Park and Tiger Reserve. The BJP MP had recently written another letter to the Chief Minister objecting to the fan pages on social media sites of IAS and IPS officers arguing that some of them not only pit the public against politicians but also corner credit for projects launched by government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mp-wants-rajiv-gandhis-name-dropped-from-nagarahole-park/article36264790.ece

According to local people, it was the first major tragedy to strike the village after the 2004 tsunami. The tsunami had claimed more than 30 lives there.

A good number of residents of the Tharayil Kadavu make a living by fishing. “All the four were from economically disadvantaged families and they ventured into the sea in the early hours to make a living. The youngest, Sunil Dutt, 24, started going to the sea regularly only two years ago. He became a fisherman soon after his studies to look after his ailing father. The other three who perished in the sea too had families that depended on them,” Mr. Rejimon said. The final rites of Thankappan, Sunil Dutt, and Sreekumar were held on Thursday. Sudevan’s body will be cremated on Sunday after his wife returns from the Gulf, where she is employed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/loss-leaves-village-shell-shocked/article36265082.ece
03 September 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Paddy pact before Sept. 20||Steps will be taken to resolve issues pertaining to paddy procurement, Food and Civil Supplies Minister G.R. Anil has said. He was speaking at a meeting attended by representatives of padasekhara samithis, Supplyco, and other officials at the District Collectorate on Thursday to discuss the problems related to paddy procurement. The Minister said an agreement between the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) and mill owners for the procurement would be finalised before September 20, ahead of the harvest of the second crop. Online registration The procurement will be done based on the online registration of farmers. As many as 1,729 farmers have so far registered on the Supplyco portal for the second crop season. The registration process is continuing, Mr. Anil said. “The government’s policy is to find solutions to issues faced by farmers. Measures will be taken to put an end to the exploitation of farmers. The role of middlemen will be reduced,” the Minister said, adding that the vacant posts of paddy marketing officer and paddy procurement officer would be filled soon. ‘Rs. 431 cr. distributed’  He said that two mobile units would be allotted for Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Pathanamthitta districts for measuring the moisture content in harvested paddy. The Minister directed officials to issue Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) to farmers within two days of procurement. He said Supplyco had procured paddy worth Rs. 439 crore from farmers in the district in 2020-21. It has so far distributed Rs. 431 crore to farmers. Agriculture Minister P. Prasad said the government would consider setting up panchayat-level committees for paddy procurement. He said that 100 posts of agriculture officers were lying vacant in the State. The posts would be filled in 10 days by recruiting people from the Employment Exchange. Thomas K. Thomas and M.S. Arun Kumar, MLAs; District Collector A. Alexander; and Supplyco Chairman and Managing Director Ali Asgar Pasha attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/paddy-procurement-pact-before-sept-20/article36265080.ece

Venugopal has said that there are no unresolved issues in the Congress in the State. Speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of the inauguration of the District Congress Committee headquarters in Kannur on Thursday, he said that differences of opinion were natural but the party would be the centre of focus for all. KPCC president K. Sudhakaran said that discipline would be enforced in the party in Kerala. An indisciplined party could not survive in the political arena. The Congress would be transformed into a semi-cadre party and all preparations in that direction had begun. Earlier, the new office was inaugurated by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi online. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Gandhi said what the Congress and the country had built over the past 70 years was being given away to five crony capitalists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-in-kerala-to-take-on-semi-cadre-form-sudhakaran/article36265047.ece

The Payyannur police took into custody her husband, Vijesh, in connection with the death of Sunisha, who was found hanging in the bathroom on Sunday evening. The police had registered a case of unnatural death in the incident. Harassment alleged The two had married against the wishes of the family members. However, on June 5, the mother of the deceased lodged a complaint with the police alleging that her daughter was being harassed by her husband and in-laws. Though the police had summoned the couple and attempted to work out a compromise, the family members of Sunisha reportedly refused to accept her back to the home unless she left her husband. Audio clip Meanwhile, an audio clip of Sunisha revealing the alleged abuse at her husband’s house too surfaced in social media. Following her death, Vijesh had filed a complaint with the district police accusing the family members of his wife of being responsible for her death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-detain-husband-of-dead-woman/article36265038.ece

Savitri, 41, from Vengadu in Kasaragod has no proper home. SHRC member K. Baijunath issued the order to the Kasaragod District Collector and the District Social Justice Officer and directed them to submit a report on the matter during the September 28 sitting of the commission here. The action was taken on a suo motu case registered by the commission. Savitri was a victim of brutal ragging while she was a pre-degree student. Her right eye was allegedly pierced with a compass. Frightened, she stopped her studies. She now lives in a house that may collapse any time. Though she had applied for a house under the LIFE scheme, she was not considered as a beneficiary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/provide-house-to-ragging-victim-shrc/article36265040.ece
03 September 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Monitoring to be stepped up in Eloor-Edayar industrial region||A monitoring committee consisting of members of industrial association, elected members, environmentalists, and government officials will be formed to avoid increasing incidents of air and water pollution in the Eloor-Edayar industrial region. The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) will take the lead in forming the monitoring committee. Residents of Eloor municipality, Kadungalloor, Alangad and Varapuzha panchayats had been protesting against repeated incidents of odour and water pollution in the region. Many had experienced respiratory and other ailments following the spike in pollution. Besides elected representatives of the local bodies, the committee will have representatives of industrial associations, board officials, environmentalists, and farmers. They will meet every two months to assess the situation. The preliminary assessment by the board had found that the biofilter system installed in 13 units suspected to be responsible for the odour pollution was not functioning properly. The companies will be asked to resolve the lapses in consultation with the board officials. The services of scientists at the National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research will be sought for identifying lapses of biofilter units. They will recommend solutions to ensure proper functioning of the units. The board will also study the efficiency of equipment installed in one of the industrial units to suck the foul odour at source itself. The facility, which costs around Rs. 1.5 lakh, will be recommended in other units once it is found to be working effectively. Change in colour The board has promised action to complete the setting up of the common effluent treatment at Edayar to check pollution of the river and drains leading to it owing to illegal discharge of effluents from the industrial units. The Periyar had changed colour twice in August following dumping of effluents from the industrial units. A rubber processing unit at Edayar was responsible for the first incident after local residents and environmentalists found that the company was discharging untreated effluents into a nearby land to its waste water treatment plant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/monitoring-to-be-stepped-up-in-eloor-edayar-industrial-region/article36265356.ece
03 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||On a mission to make Kerala animal-friendly||In a novel initiative, Daya Animal Welfare Organisation, recognised by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and active for the past two decades, has put together a technical team for the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme. The team, christened DATTA (Daya Technical Team for ABC), is composed of a group of three veterinary surgeons led by consultant surgeon Kishore Janardhanan, and five animal handlers led by master animal handler Ramesh Pulickan, one of the founding members of Daya and trained in animal handling at the National Institute of Animal Welfare. The objective is to make Kerala animal friendly and rabies-free. “This is perhaps for the first time that an animal welfare organisation is setting up such a team. We have planned for at least the next 10 years since ABC is a long-drawn process. The initiative goes beyond animal welfare and should be seen as part of the larger public health programme. It will also add to the reputation of Kerala as a tourism destination, as inhumane culling of animals, like the recent episode involving stray dogs in Thrikkakara municipality in Ernakulam district, taints even the global image of the State,” said Ambily Purackal, coordinator and a founding member of Daya. DATTA could probably launch its operation in Thrikkakara since the Kerala High Court has entrusted Daya with the ABC programme of stray dogs in Thrikkakara in a suo motu public interest litigation on animal rights, though a final verdict is awaited. Sterilisations A team led by Mr. Janardhanan has done an inspection of ABC facilities of Kochi Corporation at Brahmapuram where Daya has proposed to conduct the sterilisation surgery of stray dogs from Thrikkakara. An inspection report explaining the sorry state of the road leading to the facility and other shortcomings such as faulty generator and air conditioner, has been submitted to the amicus curiae in the case. Sharing expertise “In the long run, we plan to train and share our expertise with other recognised animal welfare organisations across the State,” said Ms. Purackal. While DATTA will offer technical expertise, the recurring expenses involved such as the salary of the staff, medicines, vehicle, operation theatre and so on will have to be borne by the local body concerned. Previously, the cost of ABC activities was shared equally between the local body concerned and the AWBI, though that arrangement ceased to exist some time ago. Ms. Purackal, however, said that it would not be a tough task for the local bodies as they could find the allocation for the ABC programme either under their projects or from own funds. DATTA is supported by Buimerc India Foundation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/on-a-mission-to-make-kerala-animal-friendly/article36265341.ece
03 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||LDF councillors stage sit-in protest||Members of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the Thrikkakara municipal council have reiterated their demand that chairperson Ajitha Thankappan step down from her position. There have been allegations that she and the ruling council paid Rs. 10,000 each to the 43 municipal councillors as part of Onam celebrations. A group of LDF councillors staged a sit-in protest in front of the office of the municipal chairperson on Thursday demanding that she step down. “We will continue the protest until she resigns,” said Opposition Leader and CPI(M) member M.K. Chandrababu. He added that it was obvious that the chairperson had paid the money to the councillors. However, an inquiry by the Ernakulam district Congress party leadership had given Ms. Thankappan a clean chit. The party leadership said the allegations were politically motivated, and that there was no substance in them. The Ernakulam unit of the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) has submitted a report on the issue to the Vigilance Directorate in Thiruvananthapuram. Any further action will be initiated by the Vigilance Directorate. The Thrikkakara municipal premises was witness to high drama on Wednesday as a group of LDF councillors tried to prevent the chairperson from entering her chamber. A big posse of police personnel was engaged in providing protection to the chairperson as well as to prevent any law and order problem. The LDF councillors were forcefully removed by the police. The chairperson’s chamber was sealed on Monday by the municipal secretary as the chamber was under the scrutiny of the VACB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-councillors-stage-sit-in-protest/article36265349.ece
03 September 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Mass culling of wild boars begins||Gun shots are echoing in the silence of night on the forest fringes as the Forest Department has launched a culling campaign to eliminate crop-raiding wild boar population in the State. Close to 50 animals have been gunned down by sharpshooters engaged by the department. The programme is to eliminate the populations that have established themselves outside forest areas and places where there are no natural predators for the species. Those located inside forests are spared, forest officials said. Rs. 1,000 for each kill Each successful kill will earn the shooter a remuneration of Rs. 1,000. Members of rifle clubs and farmers with licensed guns are joining the drive. A few trigger-happy gunners from neighbouring States have volunteered for the programme. However, their service has not been used, they said. In the Southern Circle, which covers Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts, 14 animals have been killed. The department has shortlisted 20 hotspots in the circle from the earlier identified 74 where the menace is prevalent, said Sanjayankumar, Chief Conservator of Forest (CCF), Southern Circle. Aiming the animals that raid the crops under the cover of darkness is a challenging task. They venture out of their habitats during the late evening hours, he explained. In the Eastern Circle, 20 wild boars have been shot dead with the Nilambur South Division accounting for 14 kills, said K. Vijayananthan, CCF, Eastern Circle. Inclement weather has hampered the operations. A section of the forest staff, who had a mental block over the culling operations, had to be sensitised. More men will be deployed for the drive, he said. The shooters of the High Range Circle are yet to hit the target. Though permission has been issued to farmers who sought clearance for killing the animals, no case of successful hunting has been reported, said Georgi P. Mathachen, CCF, High Range Circle. The farmers need to obtain prior permission, inform about the culling, and turn over the carcass to the Forest Department, he said. In the Central Circle, the officials are thinking in terms of developing traps for the animals as the guns have failed to produce the desired results.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/culling-of-crop-raiding-wild-boars-begins-in-kerala/article36264680.ece
03 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Periyar action plan projects moving at a snail’s pace||The projects to be implemented by the Aluva municipality as part of the Periyar action plan have been moving at a snail’s pace, according to official estimates. An assessment by the government showed that the timeline fixed for the implementation of key projects has elapsed. The delay in the execution of the projects has prompted the authorities to stretch the deadline by six months to one year. Sewage plant The augmentation and revamping of the existing sewage treatment plant near Adwaitha Ashramam remains one of the major projects that has remained in cold storage for long. The project proposal included increasing the capacity of the plant to treat more sewage generated in the municipality. The municipality authorities have not yet reported on the source of funding for the project. The augmentation of the sewage treatment plant at Aluva market is also pending. The project was mooted to reduce the pollution load in the Periyar after studies found that untreated wastewater was illegally let into the waterbody. No concrete action has been taken to stop the illegal discharge of sewage from the township into the river through a drain near Periyar Hotel, according to an interim report on the updated status of the Periyar action plan. Shortage of funds M.O. John, chairman of the Aluva municipality, cited serious shortage of funds to carry out the implementation of the projects as per the original schedule. “The financial situation has been hit owing to lack of support from the government. “We are yet to receive arrears to the tune of Rs. 8 crore towards payment of pension,” he said. Mr. John stated that the delayed Periyar action plan projects would be included in the Plan programme for next year. “The Kerala Water Authority has assured support to set up a sewerage treatment plant in Aluva. The augmentation of the sewage treatment plants at Adwaitha Ashramam and Aluva municipal market will be taken up in the plan projects starting next March,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/periyar-action-plan-projects-moving-at-a-snails-pace/article36265351.ece
03 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kochi Corpn. to start licensing scheme for pets in February||A licensing system for pet dogs and cats will begin in the city from February next. The Kerala High Court had recently asked local bodies in the State to introduce a licensing system for pet cats and dogs. It was while considering the case of harassment meted out to a dog in Thiruvananthapuram that the Division Bench of the court issued the directive to local bodies in the State. The Kochi Corporation is waiting for a guideline from the State government regarding the licensing scheme. The scheme would mostly come into force from February next year as that was when all the annual licences issued by the civic body were renewed, said T.K. Ashraf, chairman of the health standing committee of the Corporation. The court has also suggested micro-chipping the pet animals to prevent the tendency to abandon them. Details of owners of pet animals can be obtained from the chip. The civic body had initiated preliminary discussions with health officials regarding the implementation of the programme, he said. Collars for dogs Meanwhile, the Corporation has decided to provide collars for community dogs, which were neutered and vaccinated as part of its Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme. The collars will help in the easy identification of vaccinated animals. Currently, a V-notch was made on the ear of the dog to indicate that it had been neutered and vaccinated, said civic officials. The Corporation has resumed the ABC programme at its Brahmapuram facility. As many as 20 community dogs were neutered and vaccinated in two weeks. Three veterinary surgeons and six dog-catchers are working in two shifts at the facility. The dogs are trapped from the streets during morning and evening hours to be taken to the facility. The dogs, kept in observation for a few days after the surgery, were released back at the place from where they were caught, said officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-corpn-to-start-licensing-scheme-for-pets-in-february/article36265347.ece
03 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kudumbashree ABC project in limbo||The recent Kerala High Court order directing local bodies not to transfer funds to Kudumbashree for Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme has put spokes in the wheels of four Kudumbashree units in Ernakulam district engaged in the sterilisation of stray dogs. Two units at Alangad and one each at Pattimattom and Malayattoor were engaged in ABC programmes with the help of empanelled veterinary surgeons and trained animal handlers, including professionals from outside Kudumbashree on daily wages. “We have initiated steps to secure recognition of the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) since that was cited as one of the grounds for suspending the ABC programme of Kudumbashree units. The unit operations are now restricted to using the already allocated funds since local bodies can no longer allocate fresh funds,” said Vijayam K., assistant district mission coordinator, Kudumbashree. Expertise questioned Kudumbashree’s expertise in conducting the ABC programme was questioned by the Daya Animal Welfare Organisation and Animal Legal Force Integration, which impleaded, in a suo motu public interest litigation proceedings initiated by the Kerala High Court, on the executive and legislative inaction of the State government in animal protection rights. “We have been active since 2018 and had sterilised 3,563 dogs till the operations were suspended last month. “We even had a well-equipped mobile unit, which was effective and deployed in Malappuram district. The suspension of the programme could pose problems as the breeding season of dogs is around the corner when they could become aggressive,” said Priya Prakasan, who is trained in ABC management from an internationally recognised institute in Ootty and headed the ABC programme run by the Kudumbashree unit, Sradha, at Alangad. Rendered jobless The stalemate seems to have left the Kudumbashree members engaged in the programme jobless during an already trying pandemic period. “I have opted for a new job since I could not afford the loss of income now,” said Sreeshma Aneesh, a member of Suraksha, another Kudumbashree unit from Alangad. ‘Botched surgeries’ Ambily Purackal, coordinator and founding member of Daya, said that Kudumbashree, which is entrusted with women empowerment, did not have the expertise for conducting the ABC programme. “There have been many instances in which Kudumbashree units botched the ABC surgeries, inflicting misery on stray dogs. Their operations flagrantly violated the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kudumbashree-abc-project-in-limbo/article36265344.ece
03 September 2021||Kochi,KERALA||11th season of Pattanam excavations on||The 11th season of excavations has begun at Pattanam in the North Paravur-Kodungallor area, as part of an endeavour to unearth more mysteries about the ancient port of Muziris which had a human settlement starting from 1000 BC and evolved into a legendary port around 300 BC. Treasure trove The area is a treasure trove of ancient history, with the excavation at every 10 cm depth leading one to relics that date back to another 100 years. The sedimentation process during the past 3,000 years has led to relics and other items of yore accumulating at different levels, up to a depth of around four metres, says P.J. Cherian, Director of the Pattanam excavations. He served as Director of the Kerala Council of Historical Research. “The relics that date back to 1000 BC show the history of human settlements in Pattanam and the maritime trade that the locale witnessed.” Fragments collected over the years have proved beyond a shadow of doubt that this was indeed the port of Muziris. As proof, there were items that were used by 40 different language groups -- from what is now Spain to South China. Excavations which led to unearthing of 11 productive samples of DNA — sourced from teeth and bones which could not be identified as male/female — were put to mitochondrial tests and compared. They point to a plural cosmopolitan life that existed in Kerala, well before Christ, says Mr. Cherian, who led the excavations during the first nine seasons. They provided the springboard for the Muziris Heritage Project, which resumed after a lull during the 2015-2020 period, when the PAMA Institute for Advancement of Transdisciplinary Archaeological Sciences came into the picture in 2020. Religious activity Interestingly, there was little to suggest of any religious activity during the Muziris era. Trade was not at all in the modern sense, what with barter system being the norm. The discovery of wine containers of different shapes, used in 11 places in the Mediterranean, is proof that foreign traders paid back for spices and other commodities procured from Kerala with gold and wine, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/11th-season-of-pattanam-excavations-on/article36265091.ece

The girl was brought to the hospital with stomach pain in the morning. DNA test A DNA test would be held to confirm the paternity. The arrested man was a resident of Wayanad but had stayed in the city for work. The police claimed that the duo had known each other and that the girl was abused at her house. He was produced in the court and was remanded in judicial custody. The police could not yet establish any relation between the two though it was initially reported that the accused was a distant relative of the girl. The police had registered a case of unnatural death in connection with the death of the baby and another under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for the alleged sexual abuse of the minor girl. The police said that she was about six months pregnant and probably had a premature delivery at the hospital.

A total of 57 fishermen from the traditional boat (St. Antony) and mechanised fishing vessel (Ashiqmon) were rescued by fellow fishers. The traditional boat with in-board engine sank in the early hours of Wednesday after it ran into the remains of the mechanised boat, which had gone down on the night of Tuesday around 9.30 p.m. The accident on Tuesday night occurred after the mechanised fishing vessel ran into the debris of a previously sunken vessel. The two incidents forced the fishers’ unions to approach the Cochin Port Trust with a request to help remove the remains of the sunken vessels to make fishing operations smoother. However, Port Trust sources said on Thursday that the onus of removing the sunken vessels and wreckage was on the owners of the boat. They also said that the owner of the fishing vessel that sank on Wednesday morning had sought permission to remove the remains and the Port Trust had granted permission for the same. Port Trust sources also said that the office had issued a notice to the owner of the vessel that had sunk earlier and to the State Fisheries Department to remove the wreckage. They said if any vessel sank within the shipping channel it was for the Port Trust to clear the shipping channel. In such cases, the wreckage was removed and the cost of the operations recovered from the owner of the vessel. P.V. Jayan of the Paramparagatha Matsya Thozhilali Union representing traditional fishers in Vypeen said two boats, Poornasree that sank in May 2021, and Ashiqmon that sank on Tuesday night, posed a grave threat to the operations of fishing vessels. Sources close to the fisheries sector said most of the fishing vessels did not have insurance cover as the boat owners considered the premium too high. As a result, they were unable to engage in recovery and removal of sunken vessels. Meanwhile, efforts are under way to salvage the remains of the fishing vessel St. Antony using a floating crane. The fishing vessel is being salvaged at the expense of the fishers and the boat owner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-sunken-boats-not-salvaged-fears-of-marine-accidents-remain/article36265343.ece
03 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Outbound tourism from State perking up||Outbound tourism from the State is showing signs of resurgence with people, in their eagerness for what is being referred to as revenge travel, getting ready to fly to countries in Europe, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Dubai from mid-October. The yearning to fly out at the next-given opportunity has resulted in thousands of people, who had to cancel their trips to Europe and other destinations in 2020 due to COVID-19 curbs, opting for package and other tours in large numbers, says tour operator Joby George. Many countries, mainly in Europe, have lifted curbs on arrival of Indians, what with the United Kingdom moving India from the red to amber list. “Interestingly, people are keen to travel abroad despite the marginal hike in airfares and the 5% tax collected at source (TCS) for outbound travel from October 2020. Europe (where demand peaks in April-September during the summer-spring season) and the Maldives are the preferred destinations for travellers from Kerala. Still, lack of direct flights from Kerala to European countries — barring to the U.K. — is a major constraint for both outbound and inbound tourism,” says Mr. George. Direct flight to U.K. “An average of 1,600 Keralites travel to European countries every day. This calls for a daily direct flight from the State to the U.K., in place of the three per week now, and to many other destinations. This will in turn bring in high-spending inbound tourists from those countries to Kerala. The situation is such that most European tourists who arrive in direct flights to Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi, and other metros skip Kerala The State only gets the spillover revenue from those who come, while the States which have direct flights get GST revenue on that account. There is also the risk of people preferring to visit Sri Lanka, which is similar to Kerala,” he says. The pandemic and awareness about the prohibitive treatment cost in Europe and the U.S. have in the meantime resulted in most travellers opting for travel insurance packages. “There are numerous insurance schemes, including a Rs. 1,000 premium which provides coverage for 14 components, including for loss of baggage.

Justice Devan Ramachandran orally observed that if the High Court had allowed long queues in front of the liquor shops, we would have been sitting on a time bomb and it would have blown up by now. The moment the court had intervened in the case, authorities took corrective action, which meant they were admitting their lapses. The court said long queues were still seen in front of certain liquor shops. The court asked Bevco not to resile from taking action on the basis of the Excise Commissioner's report, adding that Bevco might be the highest revenue-generating industry in the State. But it could not gloat that it was doing a good job as the people were forced to go to the public health system because of it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/abide-by-excise-rules-hc-tells-bevco/article36265092.ece

03 September 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Crucial time for Cong. in Kottayam||Nattakom Suresh, the newly appointed president of the District Congress Committee (DCC) in Kottayam, is set to assume office on Friday. At a brief function to be held at the DCC office in the morning, Mr. Suresh will take charge in the presence of senior leaders and office-bearers of the party’s State and local leadership. While common wisdom would suggest that Mr. Suresh — a loyalist of the ‘A’ group led by Oommen Chandy — was a natural choice to lead, the situation on the ground tells a different story. According to sources, the selection of Mr.Suresh with the backing of Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, another veteran Congress leader in Kottayam, appears to have triggered a major change in the group equations. The emergence of this new power axis, ostensibly with the support of the State leadership, appears to have created a vertical divide in the ‘A’ group in Kottayam. Chandy’s stance Mr.Chandy, on the other hand, stands unhappy and desolate, as evident from the lack of support from the district Congress unit for his remarks against the selection of new DCC presidents. Mr. Suresh, however, firmly believes that stable coordination can mitigate volatility on the top. Having got wind of the mood in the Oommen Chandy camp, he has reached out to leaders and begun efforts to patch up differences. “As a politician who started his career under the shade of Mr. Chandy, I have no doubt that he will support me. Indeed, I have been supported by all senior leaders irrespective of groups,” he told mediapersons. His assumption of office also assumes significance against the backdrop of back-to-back setbacks suffered by the Congress-led coalition in the local body and Assembly elections. Long regarded as a bastion of the Congress, the party is now facing a tough challenge here, especially after long-time associate Kerala Congress (M) switched sides to the Left Democratic Front. As the Congress plans to re-haul itself on a semi-cadre line, Mr.Suresh has his task cut out. “Strengthening feeder organisations, ensuring party discipline, and restoring the dominance of the Congress in Kottayam are some of these,” observed a senior Congress leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crucial-time-for-cong-in-kottayam/article36265077.ece

Department sources said on Thursday that an inquiry into the incident had revealed that the staff did not ensure that the vaccine vials were stored properly. Health officials said that the vaccine stock arrived by Monday evening. The public health nurse (PHN) who was on duty had left by then. The PHN directed a staff nurse over the phone to store it in an ice-lined refrigerator that maintains a temperature between 2 degrees Celsius and eight degrees Celsius. However, the nurse chose to keep it in a deep freezer in which the temperature is maintained between -15 degrees Celsius and -25 degrees Celsius. The staff noticed that the vaccine vials were damaged when they opened the boxes ahead of sending them to other vaccination centres on Tuesday. The officials said on Thursday that it was the responsibility of the supervisor at the centre as well as the staff who handled the vials to ensure that they were properly stored. V. Jayashree, District Medical Officer (DMO), is expected to forward the inquiry report to the Director of Health Services. The DMO is also learnt to have directed the staff at all vaccination centres in the district to be on alert to avoid a recurrence of similar incidents. Organisations representing Opposition political parties, meanwhile, staged protests outside the centre against the negligent attitude of the staff. Caseload spirals Active COVID-19 caseload rose to 34,415 in Kozhikode district on Thursday, with 3,531 more people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The Thodupuzha native, who is also a suspect in the parallel telephone exchange case, is claimed to be one of the close associates of K.T. Rameese, who was earlier arrested in connection with the gold smuggling case. The special investigation team from Kozhikode is planning to quiz the man who is now undergoing imprisonment in Telangana after he was convicted in a parallel exchange running case. During the Telangana police team’s interrogation, he had reportedly revealed his job as a carrier for Rameese. According to police, the youth was suspected of maintaining close connections with Ibrahim Pullat as well who was earlier arrested by the Karnataka police in connection with a major parallel telephone exchange case in Bengaluru. He had been brought to Kozhikode as part of the efforts of the SIT to gather more evidence in the case registered in Kozhikode city. According to police sources, the Thodupuzha native was also part of the gangs that operated parallel telephone exchanges in various parts of Kerala last year. He had also been arrested by the Ernakulam police in connection with the incident. Accessories seized It was on June 1 that the police busted the illegal telephone exchanges in the city and seized a number of accessories used for operating the illegal service. A special squad had been constituted to probe the case as extremists were suspected of utilising the parallel service for their communications. There were also allegations that the gold smuggling rackets too were using the parallel service.  He is claimed to be an associate of K.T.

Titled Vimuktham, the project with the theme Pakarillenikku, pakarthilla njan (I will not get infected nor will I transmit it to others) is being implemented in Ulliyeri grama panchayat. The concept of ‘social bubble’ where one interacts with only a select number of trusted people to avoid chances of infection is being tried out. Officials claimed on Thursday that such a project was being executed for the first time in any grama panchayat in the State. The plan is to have a task force in each ward. The over 8,500 houses in the panchayat will be divided into various units, each having 10 houses. Around 1,000 volunteers and as many student ambassadors will be part of the drive. Complete vaccination and COVID-19 testing are part of the campaign, and volunteers have been trained by Mohammed Asheel, former head of the Kerala State Social Security Mission. The project also envisages conceiving long-term health habits. Pamphlets, handbills, and posters will be brought out to take up awareness campaigns to protect each family from COVID-19. Wearing of double face masks and regular cleaning of hands will be made a habit in each family. Panchayat-level domiciliary care centres will be strengthened, and infected persons will be shifted there.

With few takers for industrial and fabrication work, owners of such units have been going through a tough period unable to pay rents and wages. “It may take several months to return to normality. Instead of investing a huge sum on rentals, we are just trying to manage work orders from home,” said V. Sathyan, an aluminium fabrication unit owner in the city. He added that a few accessories and equipment were brought home to run the business. In some domestic units, supportive labourers are mostly family members, including children. As a homely ambiance offers more safety amid pandemic threats, many are finding it a comfortable option to temporarily manage the crisis. They are also saving on rentals with the cooperation of landlords. Micro enterprises managed by women neighbourhood groups are also following similar path to minimise labour costs. Work on food-based items, fabrics, sandals, and consumables are now being taken up in a decentralised manner. At the same time, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) said it had noticed an unusual trend of consumers using domestic connections for industrial purposes. Though the board is going easy on such practices considering the pandemic situation, action is likely in case of public complaints. A KSEB engineer said there were isolated complaints from a few city residents following voltage fluctuations during day time. “Operation of welding machines and other power tools using domestic connections is one reason for voltage fluctuations. Machines operated using commercial connections cannot be run using domestic connections, and any violation of rules will attract hefty penalty,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-crisis-prompts-micro-enterprises-to-explore-wfh-option/article36265054.ece

The bombs, found buried under the soil on a private field, were reportedly very powerful and newly made, allegedly to attack political rivals. Incidentally, there were a series of attacks on houses using crude bombs in the last two weeks. In the wake of the unearthing of bombs, a few youth organisations had called upon the police to investigate the suspected role of drug traffickers and smugglers’ rackets in explosive materials trade. They alleged that investigations into such incidents were casual, with the police failing to make headway in probes. “It was a narrow escape for a few workers who found the steel bombs while digging the earth as part of a construction work. There were similar incidents in which labourers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme had recovered bombs during cleaning work,” said a Youth Congress leader from Nadapuram. He claimed that the police had been unsuccessful in finding the source of such explosives. ‘Isolated incidents’ Meanwhile, the police are of the view that the politically-sensitive Nadapuram and surrounding areas had changed a lot with the cooperation of various political parties for maintenance of peace. “The latest incidents are isolated ones, and we seriously suspect the involvement of anti-social elements in them,” they said.

District borders will be covered by separate teams to carry out surprise inspections and monitor the movement of inter-State vehicles. The use of official stickers and logos on the carriers’ vehicle to mislead the checking squads have been brought to the attention of the District Anti-Narcotics Special Action Force. Henceforth, no vehicles will be granted any special privilege in the name of official stickers or logos. Also, there will be efforts to verify the authenticity of such stickers on the spot by contacting the authorities concerned. “In a recently exposed ganja smuggling case, the carriers were found using the official sticker of lawyers on their rented vehicles with fake numbers. Since it is reportedly a new trickery to bypass checking, the squads have been asked to stay alert,” said an official attached to the anti-narcotics squad. For several months, the police and excise squads have been very keen on checking inter-State goods carriers after some of the drivers were found misusing their trips for shipping ganja to wholesale traders in the State. A police officer, who was part of many flash inspections at Thamarassery, said the smugglers were found coming back to the business by employing women as carriers by offering huge returns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/more-vigil-against-drug-smuggling/article36265049.ece

The 20 per cent seat increase for higher secondary schools will bring more trouble to the classes, it said, demanding that the problems in the higher secondary sector should be addressed by introducing new batches and courses. School upgrade The Jamaat demanded that unaided high schools should be upgraded to higher secondary and the students on such campuses should be given all concessions and rights enjoyed by their counterparts in government and aided campuses.

03 September 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Teacher seeks to rid campus of sir, madam salutations||Taking inspiration from the bold move made by the Mathur grama panchayat to ban the use of ‘sir’ and ‘madam’ in its office, an Assistant Professor at Government College, Chittur, has raised a demand to get rid of those salutations from the campus. “Calling teachers ‘sir’ and ‘madam’ is from the British age. More than a respectful way of addressing the teachers, those salutations have a colonial hangover. We don’t want to take pride in the colonial hangover. We should rid our campuses of such terms that distinguish the people as the subjects,” said Pradeesh K., Assistant Professor at the Department of Commerce, Government College, Chittur, in a memorandum to the Principal. Mr. Pradeesh demanded that the students be given the freedom to address their teachers using any terms they are comfortable with. “A circular should be issued proscribing the students and other staff members from using ‘sir’ and ‘madam’ on the campus. This will set a new trend in the modernisation of our language,” he said. Mr. Pradeesh argued that teachers, especially those paid by the government, are supposed to serve the students who represent the people at large. “In a democracy, people are the most powerful. Therefore, making the students call us sir and madam is an injustice from a modern perspective,” he said. The Mathur grama panchayat near here had become the first civic body in the country to drop words like ‘sir’ and ‘madam’ from its official use when it adopted a unanimous resolution two days ago. A silent campaign is on demanding corrections in the official Malayalam language used in government and related offices. A WhatsApp collective named Sauhruda Bhasha Group has been pushing for the purgation of several outmoded words still in official use in the State.

03 September 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||New parcel system under Palakkad division soon||The Palakkad division has begun work to implement the Railways’ new parcel management system (PMS) at 10 stations. Apart from Palakkad, Shoranur and Mangaluru Junctions, Kozhikode, Tirur, Thalassery, Kannur, Payyanur, Kasargod and Mangaluru Central railway tations will have the new facility by December. The PMS will help the people track their parcels carried by the Railways. It will also offer them SMS updates about the arrival of the consignment at the destination. A meeting of parcel forwarders convened by Divisional Railway Manager Trilok Kothari here on Thursday underscored the relevance of the railway parcel service in view of the changes brought about by COVID-19 pandemic. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager Jerin G. Anand also addressed the meeting. Fifteen parcel forwarders from the division took part in the meeting, which clarified the parcel space availability on various trains connecting major destinations. Wide recognition Mr. Kothari said that the railway parcel service was widely getting recognition as fast, reliable and economical as compared to other modes of transport. Traders in small towns are increasingly relying on the service for transportation of their products to larger cities, he said. Railway officials said that the footwear made at the industrial cluster near Kozhikode was being sent by rail to various towns across the country. “Small footwear makers are effectively utilising our facility,” said Mr. Kothari. Railways regularly carries betel leaves from Tirur, spices from Mannarkkad, mangoes from Muthalamada, red chillies, fish and areca nut from Mangaluru to various destinations across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-parcel-system-under-palakkad-division-soon/article36265150.ece

03 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||‘A’, ‘I’ groups clamour for organisational polls||The row in the Congress in Kerala over the appointment of District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents has reportedly constrained the influential ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups to resurrect the longstanding and arguably improbable demand for organisational elections. When pressed, ‘I’ group leader Ramesh Chennithala told newspersons on Wednesday: “Organisational elections are welcome if held according to the timetable set by the All India Congress Committee (AICC).” The ‘A’ group led by Oommen Chandy is also reportedly stoking up a similar demand. The insistence on inner-party elections reflects the growing sense of powerlessness among the factions over the reorganisation process. The groups reportedly feel they could claw back to organisational relevance and negotiate with the official Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leadership from a position of strength by powering the demand for inner-party polls ahead of the impending reorganisation exercise. A faction manager claims the incumbent “power pair”, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran and Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, did not have the required organisational leverage in the party to survive an inner-party election. “The rank and file of the KPCC are organised obstinately on group lines. It is difficult to break the mould,” he says. However, the AICC views the demand for organisational elections as a step into the unknown. It feels the call for holding inner-party elections instead of nominating office-bearers may look rosy on paper but unravel in actuality. Hence, the AICC has plumbed for the idea of a strong KPCC president who does not have to bother about the electoral approval of party factions. Notably, AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal and Mr. Satheesan have openly repudiated factionalism and affirmed in Kannur on Thursday that Mr. Sudhakaran is the final word of the Congress in Kerala. A party insider says the Congress high command feels factionalism is hugely responsible for Congress’ debacle in the 2021 Assembly polls. Cracking the whip The AICC has endorsed the KPCC’s move to crack the whip on factionalism. It has warned group leaders against making a spectacle of themselves in the media by feuding publicly. The AICC wants the KPCC to be laser-focussed on authoring a generational shift in the party to halt declining membership and improve its electoral prospects in the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.  AICC feels factionalism was hugely responsible for Congress’ debacle in the 2021 Assembly polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-i-groups-clamour-for-organisational-polls/article36265100.ece

Minister for Tourism P.A. Mohamed Riyas on Thursday said the State government would consider beautifying city spaces in all districts by bringing them under the purview of Arteria, whose third phase was under implementation in the capital city. He was speaking to mediapersons after visiting an artwork at the Palayam underpass in the capital. The idea was not only to improve the cityscape, but to make the visitors feel positive, the Minister said. The colourful images at the Palayam underpass are being painted as part of Arteria, launched in 2015 by the Tourism Department in association with the District Tourism Promotion Council, to cover the city walls with paintings by renowned artists.   Canvases of creativity Arteria has been seeing the conversion of walls and fences of public, private, and cooperative entities into canvases of creativity. The project’s first two phases (in 2015 and 2016) envisaged 25-odd paintings by as many artists. It succeeded in completing a work by renowned artist K.G. Subramanyan (1924-2016) without the supervision of the Kerala-born master. Brightened up In January this year, the paintings under Arteria were brightened up after the works had dulled in the past half a decade. The third phase will witness wall murals come up along the Akkulam bypass at Kuzhivila Junction, St. Joseph’s School and the Museum, besides the Palayam underpass in the capital. It features 20 graffiti artists and their team members from across the State.  P.A. Mohamed Riyas, Tourism Minister, says the idea is also to make visitors feel positive||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/arteria-to-add-colour-to-city-walls-in-all-districts/article36265232.ece
03 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Gun, permit procured via agency||The five Jammu and Kashmir natives who were arrested by the City police on Wednesday with guns that lacked valid licences have purportedly confessed to have procured the documents through illegal means. The gang allegedly bought the guns and the licences through a Maharashtra-based agency in order to apply for employment as security guards for a cash management firm that handles ATM replenishment and maintains cash in transit fleets. The youths were arrested by the Karamana police from a house at Neeramankara with alleged possession of two double-barrel and three single-barrel guns. They were taken into custody after the licences were found to be invalid. While they had submitted documents purported to be licences issued by the Rajouri district administration, the City police arrested them after alerted by authorities there of the possibility of the documents being forged. Following their arrest, the accused claimed to have purchased the licences for Rs. 6,000 each and guns for prices ranging from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 40,000. Despite obtaining the licences through illegal means, the youths maintained that they were under the impression that the documents were genuine and that they were duped by the agency. The investigation team was, however, yet to ascertain their claims. Screening The police viewed the development as a lapse on the part of the cash logistics firm, which usually conducted thorough background checks prior to appointing security guards. Steps had been initiated to screen people roped in for such activities in the city for criminal antecedents, official sources said. The Karamana police led by Station House Officer Aneesh V. collected evidence from the house where the youths stayed. While various Central intelligence agencies are learnt to have questioned the youths, the police remained tight-lipped about such details. The five persons were remanded in judicial custody after being produced at the court on Thursday. The City police intended to seek their custody for further investigation that could extend as far as Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gun-permit-procured-via-agency/article36265417.ece
03 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Probe begins into alleged police high-handedness||The Thiruvananthapuram Rural police have instituted an inquiry into an incident of alleged high-handedness by officers attached to the Balaramapuram police during a traffic enforcement drive over six months ago. The controversy has put the police in the dock again at a time when the force has been trying to put to rest an incident relating to a false accusation made by a Pink Patrol officer against an eight-year-old child and her father at Attingal. On February 23 Incidentally, the latter incident had emboldened the complainants, Shibu Kumar and Anjana, to speak up against the police in connection with the incident that occurred on February 23. The couple, both musicians, have accused the police of locking their three-year-old daughter inside their car after flagging down their vehicle on charge of speeding. They were on their way to the city from Mr. Kumar’s house near Kunnathukal when the incident took place. The police team directed Mr. Kumar to pay a fine of Rs. 1,500, but he expressed his inability to pay the amount due to the financial hardship the family had been facing. He possessed only Rs. 500 at the time of the incident. While he managed to pay the fine after his friends lent him the required sum, a remark made by him about the lack of efforts by the police to stop other traffic violators did not go down well with the policemen. On seeing Ms. Anjana recording the incident on her mobile phone, a sub-inspector (SI) got inside their car and took away the key before slamming the door while the child was still inside the car, the couple alleged. They claimed that the key was returned to them only after several minutes. With the issue grabbing headlines, the Deputy Inspector General, Thiruvananthapuram Range, has directed the District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram Rural) to conduct an inquiry. The Special Branch is learnt to have collected the statement of the couple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probe-on-into-incident-of-police-highhandedness/article36265155.ece

Mr. Devarkovil said steps had to be taken to conserve Ravi Varma’s paintings and sketches to be exhibited at a new art gallery that would be completed by the end of the year. The paintings would be given priority and their chemical conservation would be taken up by the museum conservation laboratory. Third in country The laboratory, set up at Rs. 1.41 crore, is the third such state-of-the-art facility in the country. Conservation of paintings at the art galleries in the museum and those available with individuals would be done at the lab, the Minister said. The lab will help conserve nearly 1,100 invaluable paintings in the possession of the Museum Department. The lab has been equipped with a photo documentation room, suction table, stereo microscope and other modern equipment. V.K. Prasanth, MLA, presided. Museum Additional Chief Secretary V. Venu delivered the introductory address. Museum authorities and members of the technical committee set up to advise on conservation also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rs-141-crore-conservation-lab-inaugurated-at-museum/article36265405.ece
03 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Steering State’s conservation effort||For Pune-based art conservator S. Girikumar, it is a dream come true. Nearly 30 years after he first put up a proposal for conservation of the State’s cultural heritage, he is heading a technical committee involved in setting up a modern conservation lab at the museum here and supervising the restoration of paintings, including those by Raja Ravi Varma. It was his association with Museum Additional Chief Secretary V. Venu that in 2018 saw him guide the stabilisation of objects that were salvaged from the Muziris-Kodungalloor area after the floods. Realising the lack of expertise in conservation in the State, Mr. Girikumar stressed the need for a state-of-the-art facility, and submitted a detailed proposal to the authorities. Last year, he was approached by the museum authorities for his technical expertise in a project for conservation of paintings in possession of the department. Instead of a contract for the work, he suggested that a lab be set up here to ensure continuity in conservation efforts. A detailed financial outlay was given, and the technical committee set up to advise and select trained conservators. National treasures “The paintings in the art gallery in the museum are national treasures... Ravi Varma, Rabindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, Nicholas Roerich, Nandalal Bose. We cannot take a casual approach to them,” says Mr. Girikumar. The idea, he says, is that the lab should continue beyond this project, as there is much conservation work that can be done in the State. The lab has been planned as a flexible space, with movable equipment to accommodate larger objects such as sculptures. The money remaining after setting up of the equipment is being used for restoration of 16 paintings in the first phase. Mr. Girikumar and fellow panel member Sreekumar Menon have identified the paintings, most of them by Ravi Varma. Mr. Girikumar has already started work on some sketches that require stabilisation and treatment before they can be put up for display in the new gallery coming up on the museum premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steering-states-conservation-effort/article36265408.ece

K. Vijayan, a farmer, started growing the fruit on an experimental basis, but scaled it up to commercial levels after a good harvest. Today, the dragon fruit farm at Thannichal covers 15 acres and has different varieties. On its part, the Pangode panchayat is hoping to become the first ‘dragon fruit panchayat’ in the State. The local body is encouraging every household to grow at least one plant. Cultivation has been kicked off in several wards, according to the district administration. Suitable climate Native to the Americas, the dragon fruit had become a hit with farmers in Kerala who discovered that the climate in the State is suitable for its cultivation. With the fruit gaining popularity here, the State Horticulture Mission is now offering a per-hectare subsidy of Rs. 30,000 for its cultivation. A big attraction for farmers is that the plant is easy to grow. A seven-foot column with a tyre atop it is fixed on the ground so that the dragon fruit vines can climb up. Up to six harvests are possible in a year on a single plant. A three-year-old plant produces around 25 fruits. A single fruit weighs, on an average, 400 gm. Incidence of pest attacks on the plant is relatively low, which is a boon for farmers. On rooftops too The dragon fruit can also be grown in rooftop gardens. According to the district administration, numerous visitors drop in at the Thannichal farm to check out the fruit and savour the distinct taste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dragon-fruit-a-hit-in-pangode/article36265410.ece

Ms. Raja had said the State police were patently insensitive to the issues faced by women. She doubted whether an ‘RSS gang’ was leading Kerala’s law enforcement. Ms. Raja also demanded a separate Minister for women. She cited cases of women petitioners being turned back at police stations and aired concern about increasing moral policing and misogyny. Ms. Raja attempted to call Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s attention to the issue. Party ‘surprised’ By one account, the CPI State leadership was surprised by Ms. Raja’s ‘plain-speak.’ Some leaders felt she had jumped the gun and, in the process, rocked the almost cult-like discipline in the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF). The CPI has rarely aired its grievances outside the LDF fold. The party had once openly disapproved of the gunning down of Maoists in north Kerala. Some leaders felt the United Democratic Front (UDF) could construe Ms. Raja’s statement as a veiled criticism of Mr. Vijayan, who heads the Home Department.

General Education Secretary A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish told The Hindu that there could not be any time frame for the school reopening. The expert committee had to be set up and it would need to hold wide-ranging discussions with both experts and laymen before a decision. The situation in Kerala was not the same as that in other States that had gone in for partial reopening. Many determinants had to be taken into account here. One was the prevalent test positivity rate (TPR). Then, the level of vaccination among schoolchildren. Factors such as how many students could be allowed together at one time, how many in a classroom, and how much physical distancing also had to be considered. When schools had opened for three months earlier this year for students, a few higher secondary schools had to be closed down after a large number of students and teachers tested positive. This will also weigh on the authorities’ mind. B. Ekbal, chair of the State’s experts’ committee on COVID-19, said the panel would hold discussions with the Education Department soon. At the meeting convened by the Chief Minister on Wednesday, experts suggested schools be reopened from primary classes upwards as they were better abled to handle the virus. The Indian Council of Medical Research too had in July suggested opening primary schools first.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-to-look-into-school-reopening/article36265086.ece

That said, the collection in August this year is lesser than that in July (Rs. 1,675 crore). Commenting on the 31% increase recorded last month over August 2020, Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal said it remained to be seen whether it was sustainable. Whether this growth reflected an abrupt surge in economic activity after a three-to-four-month pandemic-induced slowdown needed to be examined. If the present momentum was kept up, the economy could revert to pre-COVID-19 levels at a faster rate, Mr. Balagopal said here on Thursday, replying to queries at a meet-the-press organised by the KUWJ. Notwithstanding the financial situation, the State government would ensure adequate resources for the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) so that loan repayment and other responsibilities were not hit, Mr. Balagopal said. The State would press for the extension of the GST compensation period by another five years at the upcoming meeting of the GST uncil on September 17. Mr. Balagopal reiterated that the Centre, which was bolstering its revenues through the collection of petroleum cess, had been denying the States’ their fair share of the revenues. “It requires a serious debate on how the States can move forward in such a situation. There is a need for States to stand united to protect their interests,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/31-increase-in-gst-collection-in-kerala/article36265358.ece
03 September 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Hypermarket goes up in flames hours before inauguration||The new branch of Pavitra Hypermarket, a chain of supermarkets, near the JNTU Anantapur campus went up in flames in the wee hours of Thursday, just hours before its scheduled inauguration at 8.30 a.m. Preliminary investigations by the Fire Services Department officials suggested that a suspected electrical short-circuit caused the fire. The total estimated loss is anywhere above Rs. 50 lakh, they said. A fire tender that was on standby close to the JNTU, Anantapur campus rushed to the spot within minutes after the Fire Services officials received a phone call. The people associated with the hypermarket who came early for preparation for the inaugural ceremony alerted the officials after noticing smoke billowing from the section of the hypermarket, where sanitisers, oils, and detergent cleaners—all inflammable products— were stored. Assistant District Fire Officer N. Aswatha, who coordinated the fire-extinguishing operations, said two more fire tenders from the main office were rushed to the spot and it took the personnel close to 3 hours to bring the flames under control. The fire seemed to have started at the midnight. It took time for the smoke to come out as all the shutters were closed, the Fire Services personnel said. ‘No mandatory clearance’ The hypermarket is on the ground floor of a three-storied yet-to-be-occupied building and it does not have the mandatory clearance from the Fire Services Department. The facility does not have any fire-fighting equipment, the officials said. Any building, which is more than 9 metres in height and has more than 500 sq. metres of plinth area, needs a prior clearance from the department and emergency fire-fighting equipment must be installed. A majority of the supermarkets in Anantapur district do not have the mandatory clearance as most of them are being operated out of residential buildings. This particular building, however, has not been occupied so far. The cellar and other higher floors are vacant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hypermarket-goes-up-in-flames-hours-before-inauguration/article36265132.ece

03 September 2021||HUBBALLI,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP will fight next election under Bommai, says Shah||In what is being seen as a message to BJP leaders and cadre that new Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai is not a “stop-gap” arrangement, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said in Davangere on Thursday that he has confidence that under the leadership of Mr. Bommai, the BJP will come back to power with full mandate in Karnataka. This is being interpreted in BJP circles as a message from the high command that Mr. Bommai is going to be at the stewardship position for a long time. A section of party leaders were speculating that there is a possibility of a leader from the RSS stables replacing Mr. Bommai. There was also speculation that former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s son B.Y. Vijayendra could emerge a competitor to Mr. Bommai for leadership role. However, the remarks of BJP’s key strategist Mr. Shah has for now ended speculation on who is going to lead the party in the next elections. Addressing a gathering after simultaneously inaugurating the Gandhi Bhavan, GMIT Central Library, and Karnataka State Police Public School on the campus of GM Institute of Technology in Davangere on Thursday, Mr. Shah said Mr. Bommai had vast experience in governance as well as in public life and he had been with the BJP for long. However, the Home Minister did not forget to recall the contribution of Mr. Yediyurappa. He said Mr. Yediyurappa did a “great job” during his two terms as Chief Minister, especially for the development of villages and farmers. “If at all the era of development began in Karnataka, it was under the BJP rule and under Mr. Yediyurappa’s rule,” he said. He further said that Mr. Yediyurappa had himself decided that a new leader should be given the responsibility of Karnataka. “And the party decided that Mr. Bommai should be Chief Minister,” he said. Mr. Shah said Mr. Bommai had taken new initiatives even on issues like not taking police guard of honour and shunning VVIP culture. Although it had been a very short time, those following Karnataka developments from Delhi had observed that by choosing Mr. Bommai as the Chief Minister, the BJP had strengthened its position in Karnataka, Mr. Shah said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-will-fight-next-election-under-bommai-says-shah/article36264714.ece

The 12th anniversary of Dr. Reddy held at the HICC by his widow Vijayamma and daughter Y.S. Sharmila for his close followers saw people sharing their views on him as an individual and his achievements as Chief Minister of the combined Andhra Pradesh. The meeting, which was restricted to invitees and away from media glare, evoked lot of interest in the political circles. More so for Y.S. Sharmila launching her political party YSR Telangana Party trying to get a foothold in the already clattered political space. Political leaders who attended the meeting included YSR’s close friend and former Rajya Sabha member KVP Ramchander Rao, former Minister Raghuveera Reddy and former MP Undavalli Arun Kumar. From Telangana, Congress MP from Bhongir Komatireddy Venkata Reddy attended after initial reluctance. From the BJP, former Member of Parliament A.P. Jithender Reddy, former MLA Kuna Srisailam Goud and former GHMC Mayor Banda Karthika Reddy were present. As expected none of the YSRCP leaders or the TRS leaders made it to the event. There are several leaders in the YSRCP and the TRS who owe their political life to late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy but political compulsions seem to have kept them away. Speaking at the event Mr Komatireddy Venkata Reddy said that Arogyasri, Muslim reservations and irrigation projects were his unforgettable contributions to Telugu people. He said Telangana was the biggest beneficiary with irrigation projects launched by Mr. Reddy. Those who spoke included Mr Raghuveera Reddy, Undavalli Arun Kumar, BC leader R Krishnaiah, Shantha Biotech chairman Varaprasad Reddy, senior journalist ABK Prasad among others.

03 September 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||COO, CFO of Karvy Stock Broking held||Continuing their probe into the financial irregularities by Karvy Stock Broking Private Limited, Hyderabad Central Crime Police on Thursday arrested the firm’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The COO Rajiv Ranjan Singh (52) and CFO G. Krishna Hari (63) were arrested from their respective residences in the city. Last month, the police arrested the group’s Chairman and Managing Director C Parthasarathy for allegedly defaulting bank loans, besides raising loans against the securities of his clients without their consent. On the complaint of vice-president of IndusInd Bank Hyderabad, a case was registered at CCS, against Karvy Stock Broking Pvt Ltd on the allegation of availing credit facilities of Rs. 137 crores from the complainant bank by pledging securities/shares and personal guarantee of Chairman and MD Parthasarathi by suppressing the facts that the pledged securities belong to the clients without their consent and misusing power of attorney. The securities were transferred into the Demat account of Karvy stock Broking Pvt Ltd and pledged before the complainant bank for margin and short-term requirement in the business of KSBL from March 1, 2013, Joint Commissioner of Police Avinash Mohanty said. The accused company became a defaulter by diverting the funds into its own and connected businesses entities and on November 22, 2019, the SEBI revoked the pledge of securities with Banks/NBFCs and returned the securities/accounts. “The complaint bank was left with no collateral and thereby KSBL defaulted in repayments of about Rs. 137 crores as on March 31,” he said. During the course of the investigation, Mr. Parthasarathy was arrested and remanded for judicial custody, on August 19. Further investigation revealed that, the CEO of KSBL, Mr. Rajiv Ranjan Singh, who is in charge of trading and broking, unauthorisedly executed trading in nine other companies trading accounts from 2014 to 2019. The CFO G. Krishna Hari diverted funds which were raised from banks by pledging client securities as collateral to nine shell companies as per the oral instructions of their CMD for showing huge turnover and market share of KSBL in Stock Market and caused huge loss of Rs. 300 crore which was shown as book debts, Mr.Mohanty said. Several cases were registered against the accused company and others at CCS Hyderabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/coo-cfo-of-karvy-stock-broking-held/article36265136.ece

Mr. Owaisi was speaking to the media at the party headquarters in Darussalaam, where he also raised questions over India’s engagement with Taliban, and ‘radicalisation’ of certain sections of the majority community. The Hyderabad MP said he intends to visit Rudauli in Uttar Pradesh’s Faizabad district on September 7, Sultanpur on September 8, and Barabanki on September 9. “Elections are coming up, and the party has to be strengthened. We have to meet the people, get closer to them, and instill confidence in them about our party. We have to fight well in the Vidhan Sabha elections, and send party candidates to the Vidhan Sabha. And we have to defeat the Yogi government,” Mr. Owaisi said. Taking questions on the country’s engagement with the Taliban, Mr. Owaisi said: “We want to know from the Modi government its clear stand on the Taliban. Do you consider Taliban a terrorist organisation or not?” He said India chairs the United Nations’ sanctions committee, and sought to know whether it would delist ‘top 100’ leaders of the Taliban and the Haqqani Network. He sought to know whether India would add the two organisations under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Touching upon the cases of lynching of Muslims, Mr. Owaisi sought to know from the Centre who was responsible for this . “I have listed as an example 10 incidents. Which ideology has radicalised all the accused? They know that those who will support them are in power, that is why they’ve been radicalised,”he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aimim-will-contest-in-up-says-owaisi/article36264715.ece

Sources revealed that he has sought the appointment of Mr Modi and it is expected on Friday or Saturday. As per the original schedule, KCR was expected to fly back to Hyderabad on Friday. If the appointment comes through, the Chief Minister may discuss State-related issues but politically too it is going to be an important meeting with opposition to the BJP government growing. Interestingly, the national BJP leadership has been quite soft on the TRS government though the State BJP leaders are going hammer and tongs against the CM. Sources also said KCR himself has been soft in his criticism on the Prime Minister despite his strong views on the State’s requests being ignored by the Centre on extending funds for projects. The softness is quite revealing though the CM’s political ambitions in forming a third front at the Centre bringing in non-Congress, non-BJP parties on a single platform.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kcr-may-extend-delhi-stay-to-meet-modi/article36265026.ece

03 September 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Horse dies during Mani Ratnam’s Ponniyin Selvan shooting||A horse had a head-on collision and died during the shooting of Mani Ratnam’s Tamil epic historical action-drama Ponniyin Selvan in Hyderabad. Following a complaint from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India that a horse was involved in a head-on collision and died during the shooting of the film, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) called on the Hyderabad District Collector and the Telangana State Animal Welfare Board to conduct an enquiry into the death. The AWBI is the prescribed authority under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, 1960, which authorises the use of animals in films. The AWBI also asked officials to ensure that the culprits receive “exemplary punishment” so that such crimes do not happen in the future. The Abdullapurmet police of Rachakonda also registered a case against the management of Madras Talkies and the owner of the horse under Section 11 of the PCA Act, 1960, and Section 429 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The owner is reported to have allowed producers of the film to keep using horses which were tired and dehydrated. “In the age of computer-generated imagery (CGI), production companies have no excuse for forcing exhausted horses to play at war until one of them drops dead,” PETA India Chief Advocacy Officer Khushboo Gupta said. Compassionate, forward-thinking filmmakers would never dream of hauling sensitive animals to a chaotic movie set and forcing them to ‘act’, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/horse-dies-during-mani-ratnams-ponniyin-selvan-shooting/article36264686.ece

03 September 2021||KOLLAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||4 fishermen killed in Kerala boat capsize||Four fishers were killed and 12 others were hospitalised when a boat capsized near Azheekkal on Thursday morning. The deceased have been identified as Thankappan, 70, Sunil Dutt, 24, Sudevan, 53, and Sreekumar, 52. All the four are residents of Tharayilkkadavu in Alappuhza district. Tharun, Aravindan, Aneesh, Riju, Soman, Bhanu, Biju, Akshakumar, Sajeevan, Ramanan, Baiju and Sumesh are the crew members who sustained injuries in the incident. The accident occurred one nautical mile off the shore and though they were rushed to nearby hospitals, their lives could not be saved. Reportedly, the boat Omkaram lost balance and capsized after it got caught in strong waves. Since the incident took place very near to the shore, rescue operations were launched immediately by others on the spot. Most of the fishers were brought to the shore by other fishing boats. According to some residents, the Coastal police failed to arrive on time. They also allege that their repeated attempts to alert the Coastal police unit were ignored. Fisheries Minister Saji Cherian visited the families of the deceased and announced an emergency financial assistance of Rs. 10,000 to the kin of the dead fishers and Rs. 5,000 to those who sustained injuries. Ex gratia will be provided to the immediate dependents of the dead and free treatment will be made available to the survivors. Ministers K.N. Balagopal, P. Prasad and J.Chinchurani, A.M Arif, MP, MLAs P.P.Chitaranjan and C.R Mahesh and District Collector B.Abdul Nasar also visited the families of the dead and the fishers undergoing treatment at the Karunagapally taluk hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/4-fishermen-killed-in-kerala-boat-capsize/article36264682.ece
03 September 2021||Kottayam,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDB probe finds former Melsanthi responsible for missing thiruvabharanam||An independent investigation by the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has found the previous Melsanthi (head priest) of the Ettumanoor Mahadeva Temple, Kottayam, responsible for the pilferage of gold from the thiruvabharanam (sacred jewellery) of the presiding deity. The probe, carried out by TDB Vigilance Officer P.V. Joy, found the jewellery, a gold-plated rudraksha with 81 beads and 21 grams of gold, had been replaced with a new one with just 72 beads. The person, who had served as the temple’s head priest during the three-year term that ended in June this year, is the sole accused in the case. “The Vigilance report, along with details of the Melsanthi, will be handed over to the local police for initiating criminal action,” said a senior TDB official. The report, according to him, was prepared by collecting statements of the head priests and other officers who had served at the temple since 2006. According to sources, the Melsanthi post in the temple is traditionally reserved to a group of brahmin families, who are appointed for a term of three years. The sacred jewellery of the main deity at the temple, which is used for the rituals on a daily basis, are generally kept under the head priest’s custody while the TDB, on its part, maintains a register of the ornaments. The remaining articles, which are not used on a daily basis, are kept in a strongroom. Meanwhile, the Board will be initiating disciplinary action against a handful of its officers, including a Deputy Commissioner and administrative officers, for failing to report the incident on time. “To begin with, they will be served notices seeking explanations for their action. Based on this, further action will be decided,” added the officials. Stock verification The theft came to light in July during a stock verification led by the newly appointed head priest, carried out in the presence of TDB officials, including an assistant commissioner. Following this, the thiruvabharanam commissioner of the TDB launched a probe into the incident as well as the local police. A preliminary verification has pegged the loss at about seven grams of gold.

A youth going on a motorcycle was injured in the incident, but he was out of danger, the police said. The accident occurred when the driver tried to avoid colliding with a car coming in the opposite direction and veered to the left and climbed the footpath and hit the railing of the bridge. A portion of the railing collapsed where it fell on a motorcyclist, but he did not receive any major injuries. All the 21 passengers alighted from the vehicle and boarded another bus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lucky-escape-for-bus-passengers/article36264738.ece
03 September 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Winged visitors begin reaching Pulicat||Thanks to the comfortable storage in the major reservoirs in Nellore district, migratory birds, including the famous flamingos, have started arriving to the picturesque Pulicat Lake, the largest brackish water ecosystem in the country, next only Chilika in Odisha. Bird gazers will not be disappointed this year also, as the aquatic avians have started reaching their winter home early from far off places for the second year in a row as Somisala, Kandaleru and other water bodies in the district are brimming with water, vouching for the availability of prey in abundance. The arrival of, among other birds, greater flamingos and pelicans, has just begun. The wetland bird population is expected to go up in geometric proportion in the three months till November when the district experiences wet spell as the southwest monsoon retreats from the north. The district gets water replenishment both during southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon periods. “The situation is conducive for the arrival of avians in full strength this year also to their winter sojourn,” according to forest officials in the Sullurpeta range. This is in contrast to the previous years, when the arrival of birds had been delayed in view of drought condition. “The famous flamingos can now be spotted in hundreds in and around the Pulicat lagoon and also in the Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary. So are the spoonbills, which used to be far and few in between a decade ago,” the officials say. In all, two lakh birds, including the rare ones, are expected to stay put in and around Pulicat as also Nelapattu, which is endowed with Barringtonia and Acacia nilotica species, an ideal breeding site for spot-billed pelicans. It is a safe haven for 189 bird species, including 50 migratory ones, Sullurpeta Divisional Forest Officer D. Ravindra Reddy says while overseeing the arrangements for the comfortable stay of the winged visitors. It is also home for black-headed ibis, Asian openbill, black-crowned night heron, and little cormorant. Other migratory birds that visit the sanctuary include northern pintail, common teal, little grebe, northern shoveler, Eurasian coot, Indian spot-billed duck, grey heron, Oriental darter, black-winged stilt, garganey and gadwall, says Sullurpeta Forest Range Officer Venu Atmakuri. Last year, a large section of the birds had left early from the district in the wake of the devastation caused by the Nivar cyclonic storm during November.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/winged-visitors-arrive-in-pulicat/article36264685.ece

Suresh in the wake of the Supreme Court staying the Telangana High Court’s order, quashing the first information report filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against the Minister and his wife T.N. Vijayalakshmi in a disproportionate asset case. “Now, the Minister should step down or should be dropped from the Cabinet by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy as the apex court recently allowed the CBI to go ahead with the investigation into the DA case,” TDP MLA from Prakasam district Dola Balaveeranjaneya Swamy said. The TDP leaders including Yeluri Sambasiva Rao, former MLA B.N. Vijaykumar and Yerragondapalem party in-charge G. Erickson Babu said continuation of Mr. Suresh as Education Minister would set a ‘bad precedent’ as he and his wife, a civil servant, were facing charges of owing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income and booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Alleging corruption in the implementation of the Mana Badi-Nadu Nedu programme in the government schools, the TDP leaders wanted the Chief Minister to order a CB-CID probe into the allegations. The wall collapse at a government school at Rajupalem village near Markapur last month was an example of the poor condition of several State-run schools, they said. “The Minister , has not paid adequate attention to the problems of the people in his constituency,” they charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-wants-education-minister-to-resign/article36264741.ece

03 September 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD introduces ‘Dhana Prasadam’||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has introduced ‘Dhana Prasadam’ —a novel concept aimed at providing coins of various denominations to the pilgrims in the form of a prasadam. The concept for the present is introduced at various TTD run sub-enquiry offices which provide cottages and guest houses with a daily rental tariff of below Rs. 500. Pilgrims availing themselves of such moderate accommodation are normally asked to tender Rs. 500 in the form of caution deposit. The sub-enquiry offices, while refunding the caution deposits back to the pilgrims (on vacation of their premises), shall henceforth provide plastic pouches containing coins of various denominations for a minimum of Rs. 100 along with vermilion and turmeric powder of Lord in the form of ‘Dhana Prasadam’ and the rest of the amount in cash. Pilgrims availing themselves of these packets could either preserve them at their homes in the form of ‘prasadam’ or utilise them in meeting their day-to-day expenditures. At present, the TTD has coin currency reserves amounting around Rs. 2.5 crore. The idea, if implemented on expected lines, is also believed to relieve TTD from the pains of frequently approaching bankers in clearing its coin stocks. The hundi at the Tirumala temple of Lord Venkateswara on an average nets over Rs. 3 crore in the form of income on normal days and a fair percentage of it is received in the form of coins, including those of foreign countries. The process of sorting and counting of coins has always proved an arduous task for the TTD, which found itself at the receiving end whenever the question of disposing of the coins stock arose. The bankers who ferociously compete with each other in securing the daily cash proceeds received from the temple hundi sound disinclined when it comes to the lifting of coin stocks. Thanks to the hard line approach adopted by the Addl. EO A.V. Dharma Reddy during August last year, the TTD successfully cleared its coin stocks worth over Rs. 4.33 crore that was lying idle in its coffers at the sprawling administrative building in Tirupati for over a couple of years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-introduces-dhana-prasadam/article36265143.ece

03 September 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Land resurvey in pilot villages to end litigations||The court litigations, tiff over fixing the fence are all set become a thing of past, once the ongoing comprehensive resurvey of agricultural land is completed. The State government has undertaken the exercise with the objective of eliminating the grey areas between the registers and the actual field situation, in terms of extent and nature of the land. The resurvey has reached a crucial phase in the pilot villages across the State. Narasingapuram in Chandragiri mandal, Jamal Palle in Gudipala mandal and Ramapuram in Thamballapalle mandal have been chosen as the pilot villages for Tirupati, Chittoor and Madanapalle revenue divisions respectively. The ryotwari villages are chosen in such a way that they have limited number of pattadars and no endowments or Inam lands, to ensure the survey goes on in a hassle-free manner. As many as 156 land parcel maps (LPMs) of Narasingapuram village have been generated and brought to the field for ground validation. The village has 310 pattadars in an extent of 234.56 acres. After the drone survey, the 234.56 acres have been converted to 156 land parcels as part of the exercise. Revenue Divisional Officer (Tirupati) V. Kanaka Narasa Reddy, accompanied by Assistant Director (Survey Settlement and Land Records) Jaya Raj, interacted with a group of farmers regarding the exercise on Thursday. “The farmers have been assuming figures all these years, but they are shown the actual extent of land they have with the help of technology,” said Mr. Narasa Reddy. Once the process is completed by September 10, the actual figures will be published, objections called for and final settlement arrived with the farmers. The beneficiaries will get new passbooks and title deeds after October 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/land-resurvey-in-pilot-villages-to-end-litigations/article36265179.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has instructed the officials to ensure that the COVID-19 protocols are strictly followed in educational institutions and at public places in order to pre-empt the possible impact of the third wave of the pandemic. Reviewing the COVID-19 situation on Thursday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy also wanted the officials to focus on “breakthrough infections,” completion of the two-dose vaccination drive, and administering booster doses thereafter. ‘Continue night curfew’ Besides, he directed that the night curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. be continued in view of the festival season. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said there was no room for complacency as the schools had reopened amidst the looming threat of the third wave and because the vaccination drive was yet to be over. Officials informed the Chief Minister that so far 3,02,52,905 doses of vaccine had been received and they were administered to 2,18,04,564 people. Of them, 1,33,56,223 received a single dose and 84,48,341 both the doses. They expressed confidence that by the end of November, all those aged above 18 would be given the first dose and the task would be completed by February 2022. The officials also told the Chief Minister that the number of active cases was 14,473. While the recovery rate stood at 98.58%, the positivity rate was 2.11%. “The positivity rate is less than three in 10 districts, and there are zero cases in the purview of almost 10,000 village secretariats,” they added.

03 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Helping slum children stand on their own feet||Unmindful of the dust and dirt around, a dozen-odd children sitting on a plastic sheet spread on the floor, listen in rapt attention to their teacher explaining about the dos and don’ts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A banner of ‘Adarsh Education Centre’ in the background is the only sign suggesting that it’s an open-air school run at Sugali Colony, tucked away from the main road in the bustling Patamatalanka in the city. This modest centre is run by Jones Manikonda and her dedicated team of volunteers who reach out to children from marginalised communities in an attempt to bridge the education inequality, further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspiring children Islavat Divya, a Class V student from the Zilla Parishad school on Ashramam Road, loves to attend the daily 4 p.m.-6 p.m. class at this centre as she gets to learn things here the fun way. Bukya Sai Ram Nayak, a Class VIII student from Vijaya Bharathi School run by the Child Line Foundation, says the best part is that the teachers egg them on to aim high and dream big. “I am able to think of life beyond this tiny colony where I live,” he says. At a parallel centre being run at a waste pickers’ colony, off Pedda Pulipaka Road at Yanamalakuduru, Rajini, a resident of the colony, is delighted that her eight-year-old son Moshe is able to write his name, thanks to Kalpala Sravanthi, a college student-turned volunteer. “Sravanthi is also a resident of this colony and among the few children who continue their education in the community. We try to select volunteers from among the communities so the children feel comfortable and the teacher can also touch upon issues directly affecting their lives,” explains Ms. Manikonda. A person with a deeply ingrained sense of altruism, Ms. Manikonda has been in the service sector for the last 20 years, initially on a personal level and later, by collaborating with like-minded individuals and organisations to expand her reach to the needy. During her visit to slums to distribute food, used clothes, toys and other material, she closely watched their lifestyle, cut off from the forces of mainstream society. “I thought if we can impart basic education to these children, at least the next generation will realise its value,” she says explaining about the several hurdles she had to cross before starting the centres at these colonies, including stiff resistance by parents who preferred taking their children along to the dump yards for help. Expansion What started as a ‘special school’ to bring children from some of the most backward communities into education fold, at Mylavaram in June last year, in collaboration with Dalit Bahujan Resource Centre, her former employer, has now multiplied into 62 education centres in five cities in the State – Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Machilipatnam, Ongole and Kurnool – thanks to like-minded friends and well wishers who joined hands and shared their money and wisdom to take the initiative forward. “Finding teachers is a difficult task as we can’t afford to pay high salaries,” she says, adding that the volunteers are paid a nominal monthly salary of Rs. 2,000. “We try to compensate by providing them groceries and taking care of some of their medical needs,” she informs. The few full-time teachers, however, are paid Rs. 10,000 every month. The good news is that a few NGOs have offered to adopt some of these education centres. “We’ll give them a few and include new areas in our fold,” she says with a smile.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/effort-to-bring-slum-children-into-the-education-fold/article36264747.ece

03 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Software to streamline working of chit fund cos.||The Stamps and Registration Department is gearing up to streamline the functioning of the chit fund companies in the State. A new software has been developed for the purpose, under which the chit fund companies will have to upload all the information relating to their financial transactions on a day-to-day basis. This is to ensure that the subscribers are not duped, or do not incur losses. According to information, the department is testing the software at its offices across the State. The officials at the district level have been asked to upload the data furnished by the chit companies manually into the software. “It helps the officials in fixing the problems, if any, in operationalising the software. Redesigning and changes needed will be made in the software based on the experiences during the trial period,” sources say. “The software testing is nearing completion. Changes, if any, to the software will be made. The new system will be launched in about a week or so,” says Stamps and Registrations Inspector-General M.V. Shesagiri Babu. There are more than 500 registered chit fund companies in the State. Officials are unable to monitor issues such as ‘discount’ (the sum of money a subscriber forgoes to meet the expenses of running the chit); dividend, and draw of chits. At present, these details are being furnished manually. “As a result, it is becoming difficult to monitor the activities. A software is developed to ensure that no subscriber is at the receiving end,” sources say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/software-to-streamline-working-of-chit-fund-cos/article36265137.ece

03 September 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police order lands idol makers in a spot||The announcement of the Visakhapatnam City Police banning public celebrations of Vinayaka Chavithi has sent idol makers into a tizzy, who were putting finishing touches on many large idols of Lord Ganesha that they were hoping to sell this year. The city police on Wednesday announced that they would not accord permission for setting up of Ganesh pandals in public places in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, and appealed to citizens to celebrate the festival indoors. While the decision of the police has been welcomed by the public as pragmatic and timely, it has come as a shocker to the idol makers who are now left wondering about their future course of action. A number of makers have already moulded idols of heights varying between two and seven feet, and most of these idols have already been booked by various pandal organisers. The artisans,who are already reeling under losses since last year ever since the first wave of COVID-19 swept the country, are worried that they would land in an even deeper financial crisis if they are not paid their money. This is the second year in a row that public pandals have been prohibited due to the pandemic, which has taken a toll on the artisans’ finances. Though they feel that large public gatherings are not advisable at this stage keeping in view the looming threat of a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, they opined that pandals could have been allowed by restricting the number of visitors. They say that as all sectors have opened up, including educational institutions, permission could have been given for setting up pandals as it would have spurred much-needed economic activity. “We have received advance payments for over 25 idols, some as tall as seven feet. I will have to wait and watch how my customers respond to this development,” said A Raju (name changed), an idol maker from Waltair. Another idol maker from One Town area of the city said that anticipating some restrictions on public celebrations, he had restricted the height of the idols to a maximum of five feet. The idol maker said that he has received 15 to 20 orders of Ganesha idols ranging from three to five feet in height, while around 30 idols are under three feet tall. Idol makers have already come up with different themes and are now worried about what to do next. Some idol makers opined that the State government should have announced the decision to ban public celebrations last month itself. “It is a bit too late on their part to announce the ban on public celebrations now,” they said. “Many of us could land in hefty financial debts as we have already invested huge amounts of money,” they added. On the brighter side, many idol makers are hoping that though the public pandals have been banned, they are expecting orders from apartment associations and gated communities. “We are also hopeful that the public would come forward to buy idols from us, which would give us solace.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-order-lands-idol-makers-in-a-spot/article36265439.ece

Mr. Shah scaled the peaks in the Alpine style of climbing. “Mountaineering and trekking have always fascinated me, and I began trekking from the age of 11. I started my journey by participating in national trekking expeditions organised by Youth Hostels Association of India (YHAI),” Mr. Shah told reporters on Thursday. Later, Mr. Shah had served as a camp leader with the YHAI. “I first completed my Basic and Advanced Mountaineering Course from government-recognised institutes like Jawahar Institute of Mountaineering and Winter Sports, Kashmir, and Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, Darjeeling, in 2018 and 2019 respectively. I had also completed the Basic Skiing Course from Jawahar Institute of Mountaineering and Winter Sports, Kashmir, in 2019,” said Mr. Shah, who shares a love for adventure. Mr. Shah has also successfully scaled the BC Roy Peak (5,548 m) located in Sikkim, and says he now plans to climb an 8,000 m peak in the coming years to add to his accomplishments. ‘Pure style of climbing’ Alpine style of climbing is one in which a mountaineer carries all of one’s food, shelter and equipment as one climbs, without fixed ropes or mountain guides.

Rajasekhara Reddy on the occasion of his death anniversary at the YSRCP office here on Thursday. “Former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had endeared himself to the masses by introducing welfare schemes, which benefited all sections of the people.

Hari Venkata Kumari recalled how YSR had given a new meaning to ‘welfare’ through his schemes that were designed to ensure maximum uplift for the poor. Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that YSR had made a special place for himself in people’s hearts through his schemes like Aarogyasri, free power supply for farmers, house sites for the poor and fee reimbursement to weaker sections and minorities. His son, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, was following in his footsteps, the Tourism Minister said. Visakhapatnam South MLA Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar, Gajuwaka MLA T. Nagi Reddy, party leaders Vamsi Krishna Srinivas, Tynala Vijay Kumar and Malla Vijaya Prasad were among those who attended the programme. ‘Allegations baseless’ Reacting to allegations by Opposition that he was getting involved in land issues, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said that he had no interest in making money. “I am here on the directions of Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy to look after the affairs of the party in north Andhra. My intention is to serve the people and ensure development of the region. There are no lands in my name in Visakhapatnam so far. I have plans to settle in the city in the future,” he said. He said that he would soon give two toll-free numbers to enable people to lodge complaints against anyone indulging in ‘land grabbing’ in his name. Legal action would be initiated against such persons, the Rajya Sabha MP said, He added that he had lodged a police complaint in the past when some persons had tried to misuse his name for official favours. The accused were arrested in those cases, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrs-untimely-death-a-huge-loss-to-state-says-vijaya-sai/article36265460.ece
03 September 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Self-medication can be dangerous, say doctors||A fever does not necessarily mean that the person has been infected by COVID-19 or dengue, doctors said, warning the public against the perils of self-medication. “Self-medication is very dangerous. Taking medicines under the assumption that any fever might be one of these two may sometimes result in a threat to one’s life,” warned Dr. M.V.V. Gandhi, a specialist in general medicine. Dr. Gandhi was speaking at a conference on ‘COVID-19: third wave and seasonal diseases’, organised jointly by the Praja Arogya Vedika (PAV), Praja Parirakshana Committee (PPC) and the Indian Medical Association (IMA), at the Public Library here on Wednesday evening. Dr. Gandhi said that the use of medicines without consulting a doctor and without getting the requisite tests done could endanger the lives of patients. Common cold, dry cough, body pains, and headache were symptoms of COVID-19 and in some patients vomiting and diarrhea could also occur. The rains have brought seasonal changes and the stagnation of water has led to the proliferation of houseflies and mosquitoes, which causes a number of diseases like malaria, dengue and diarrhoea. He called upon the public to visit a doctor, when they turn sick and get the tests done to confirm the disease. Dr. P. Janaki Ram said that there were several apprehensions among the public on the third wave and many wild rumours surrounding the pandemic were being spread on social media. He appealed to the people to be vigilant and take adequate precautions but not be carried away by rumours. Dr. Y.L.N. Rao, Professor of Gynaecology, called for greater awareness among the people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/self-medication-can-be-dangerous-say-doctors/article36265442.ece

03 September 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Exercise due diligence in clearing mining leases, former bureaucrat urges State govt.||Taking exceptions to media reports that the Department of Mines is trying to streamline the procedures for granting mining leases to reduce the clearance time to 30 days, former Union Secretary E.A.S. Sarma has said that it will be detrimental to people living in the proposed mining areas and may create huge environmental and ecological issues. Speaking to The Hindu here on Tuesday, he said that it is understood that there are hundreds of mining lease applications pending and the intention is to expedite the clearances. ‘Irreversible impact’ The mining activity may yield limited revenue for the State but in the long run causes irreversible adverse impacts on the local environment, if they are not complied with the PESA (Panchayat Extension to Schedule Areas) Act and Forest Rights Act (FRA). He said that in most of the mining leases, the mining work is taken up often without prior clearance, mining area extends over the proposed lease area, minerals other than those approved extracted and mining undertaken indiscriminately violates the forest laws. In a letter to Gopala Krishna Dwivedi, Principal Secretary of Mines Department, and Kantilal Dande, Secretary, Tribal Welfare Department, the former Union Secretary pointed out that no mining lease should be cleared without a public hearing and prior Environment Clearance (EC) issued by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) under the Environment (Protection) Act and in the case where the mining leases are located within or adjacent to the forests, prior clearance should be obtained under the relevant forest laws from the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) of the MoEFCC. He said that if the mining activity is in the Scheduled Areas, it is imperative that the provisions of the Panchayat Extension to Schedul e Areas Act and the Forest Rights Act are complied with strictly. “No mining activity should be permitted without the prior consent of the local Gram Sabhas. This position has been emphasised by the Supreme Court in the Vedanta case and no mining activity should be allowed to be undertaken by non-tribals in such areas, as emphasised by the apex court in the Samata judgment,” he said. According to him, broad-based tribal cooperatives alone should be permitted to undertake mining as per the Samata Judgement. He urged the State government to to exercise due diligence in clearing the mining leases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/exercise-due-diligence-in-clearing-mining-leases-former-bureaucrat-urges-state-govt/article36265470.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy was giving equal priority to both development and welfare, similar to how his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy did. “YSR’s flagship programmes such as free power for farmers, fee reimbursement for weaker sections and Aarogyasri set a template for other States to follow,” Mr. Satyanarayana said. He garlanded a statue of YSR to commemmorate his 12th death anniversary and recalled his personal association with him. “Mr. Jagan’s Navaratnalu schemes were designed keeping in mind the ideals of YSR. Like his father, Mr. Jagan will continue to be in the hearts of people forever,” he said. Vizianagaram MLA Kolagatla Veerabhadra Swamy said that YSR’s welfare schemes ensured overall development of united Andhra Pradesh while helping each and every family get the benefits of welfare schemes. At another meeting organised at Pucchala Street in Vizianagaram, YSRCP youth wing general secretary Avanapu Vijay urged party leaders to rededicate themselves to achieve the goals of YSR. Along with party leaders Kalla Gowri Sankar and Avanapu Vikram, Mr. Vijay garlanded a statue of YSR. “Underprivileged sections witnessed an improvement in their lives due to reforms instituted by YSR in the fields of healthcare and higher education. Now, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government is on a similar path, following YSR’s ideals. Renovation of hospitals, establishment of urban centres and refurbishing government schools under the Nadu-Nedu programme indicate that YSR continues to be a guiding force behind the YSRCP government,” Mr. Vijay said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrs-schemes-are-still-close-to-peoples-hearts/article36265173.ece

03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Over 300 city bridges under SCR lens||More than 300 bridges in 34 locations in Secunderabad and Hyderabad divisions alone are under round-the-clock surveillance by railway personnel during this monsoon season. Altogether, 704 bridges in 152 locations in divisions of Vijayawada, Guntakal, Guntur and Nanded are also under special watch to ensure trains run safe. Anemometers to keep track of wind velocities installed on station buildings near water bodies, special ‘Scada’ sensors to provide real time information on bridges, water depth measuring gauges at vulnerable spots, IMD alerts directly to the central control room, are among the measures taken, informed senior railway officials. Besides, special watchmen are being stationed near water bodies this year with communication sets in addition to patrolling teams due to the vagaries of rainfall in recent years. Heavy rainfall in short spans resulting in flash floods or incessant rainfall for longer durations due to climate change induced weather patterns has made railway authorities revise their safety protocols. South Central Railway (SCR) is running 544 trains daily and about 6,500 km of track has to be monitored to prevent possible mishaps. “Watchmen are provided with walkie talkies to immediately convey to the sectional engineer concerned if they notice any flooding or sudden water surges, who in turn, will determine if the train can be allowed to pass or not once they check flows and water levels,” they explained. Permissible limit Railway engineers have notified that 3-4.5 cm of water above the tracks is permissible for trains to move, in case of water on tracks for passenger and freight trains, respectively. Indication posts painted in black and white of 120 cm height are placed in the centre of the track for a proper estimate of flooding by the designated inspector to check. He has to walk on the line to satisfy himself on allowing a train to pass through safely. Even then, a light engine is made to pass the section and only then, it is determined if the entire train with passengers or freight can move on. Same goes with water flow on bridges with loco pilots periodically informed about the levels and the speeds on which they are supposed to be running in certain sections or on bridges over rivers/rivulets. Joint inspections with local irrigation and other officials are often carried out near the water bodies to alert the sections concerned to take appropriate decisions. “Multi-disciplinary teams are on standby. We have freight trains filled and ready in 10-12 depots with boulders, ballast, and sand, for taking up any immediate repairs in case a track is washed off,” they said. Emphasis on safety, infra work like strengthening of track, maintenance of spare parts, and introduction of German-designed LHB rolling stock, have been given to reduce train derailments to the minimum. They are the main cause of mishaps other than those at level crossings, added senior officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/over-300-city-bridges-under-scr-lens/article36265186.ece

Chandrashekhar Rao laid the foundation for the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) office in New Delhi on Thursday amid chanting of slokas by priests as the top leadership of the party converged in the national capital. Mr. Rao, who strongly believes in astrology, laid the foundation exactly at 1.48 p.m. as the leaders and the cadre raised slogans of ‘Jai Telangana’ and ‘Desh ka neta KCR’. His family, including his wife and son and IT Minister, K.T. Rama Rao, were among the present. He went to New Delhi in a special flight on Wednesday afternoon. Apart from Mr. Rao, party secretary-general and MP K. Keshav Rao, Ministers -- Mahmood Ali, Vemula Prashanth Reddy, G. Jagadeeshwar Reddy, Ch. Malla Reddy, V. Srinivas Goud, Sabitha Indra Reddy, Satyavathi Rathod, and Planning Board vice chairman B. Vinod Kumar, Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament Santosh Kumar Joginapally and all party Parliament members were among those present The building, coming up on 1,200 sq.mts., is being constructed on the land allotted by the Centre. This is very near to the Samajdwadi Party building and the Vasant Vihar Metro. Telangana Roads and Buildings Minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy said that they have permission for a three-storied building given the restrictions in the area and it will consist of a conference hall, audio visual theatre and a library apart from offices for the top leadership. Mr. Reddy said the TRS Bhavan will function as a research centre for and the party will try to propagate innovative welfare schemes launched in Telangana for the country to replicate. Interestingly, TRS is the only political party from south India to have its own party bhavan in the national capital. Though the Telugu Desam Party (TDP)., which once was the main opposition party in the Parliament, too never came up with the idea. Other South Indian parties like the AIADMK, DMK and the Deve Gowda led Janata Dal (Secular) that played a key role in the governments at the Centre too don’t have their own party bhavans in the national capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/chief-minister-lays-stone-for-trs-bhavan-in-new-delhi/article36265218.ece
03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Establishment of garbage transfer points in limbo||Close to a year after they were announced, the 90 Secondary Collection & Transport Points (SCTP) promised across the city with the stated aim of improving waste collection, are in a limbo, as also the modernised garbage segregation and transport. Failure in setting up the stations is being attributed to the stalemate in deliberations between the government and the concessionaire agency for solid waste management (SWM) about payment. According to confidential sources, the agency has made it clear that unless government hands over the complete SWM chain as agreed upon in the initial contract, it will not be able to go ahead with the SCTPs. The Public-Private-Partnership agreement of 2009 between GHMC and Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited (REEL) stipulates that the entire SWM chain of the city including primary, secondary, and tertiary garbage transport, and waste treatment and disposal be handed over to the concessionaire. GHMC staff protest Due to vociferous protests by GHMC staff, only garbage treatment and disposal part, along with capping of the legacy dump at Jawahar Nagar SWM facility, was handed over to the agency. Primary transport is still held by Swachh Auto Trolley drivers, upon monthly collection from users. Initially GHMC’s own trucks, and later hired vehicles, were deployed for secondary and tertiary transport — up to any of the 17 transfer stations, and therefrom upto the dump yard respectively. Since January this year, the civic body has distanced itself from secondary and tertiary collection and transportation, and handed over the job to REEL, facilitating an agreement between the agency and hired vehicle owners, till the former could procure its own vehicles. As per the concessionaire agreement, GHMC is to pay REEL a tipping fee of Rs. 2,050 per tonne of waste — 40 per cent for primary and secondary transportation, 20 per cent for tertiary transportation and 40 per cent for the waste treatment. The agency is also to build eight transfer stations across various points of the city. REEL has, however, built only two transfer stations so far. The agency also failed to modernise garbage transportation. Despite the lapses, 60 per cent of the tipping fee agreed upon is being paid to it. As per the sources, the government has insisted that the agency build 90 SCTPs across the city instead of the remaining six transfer stations as agreed upon. The agency, in turn, has reportedly demanded transfer of primary transport too, along with the residual 40 per cent tipping fee — a proposal pending with the government. Only about 30 mini transfer stations have been built so far, with 20-plus being operational, sources said. Sought for version, REEL has, through a statement, clarified that 55 advanced waste compactors have been pressed into service across six zones, and 50 more compaction platforms are being procured by October end. About 50 per cent of the SCTPs are operational. The remaining are expected to be operational in the next couple of months, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/establishment-of-garbage-transfer-points-in-limbo/article36265200.ece
03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Doctors’ tips for politicos ‘going the extra mile’||Surrounded by hundreds of followers, politicians in Telangana are trying to reach out to people by taking up padayatras. And this is not a recent phenomenon. Right from the beginning, we have seen politicos walking their way among the crowd to make a mark. But, their journey was and is never easy. It involves heavy physical exertion lasting for months together. Here, orthopaedicians have something to say. Recently, a sports and regenerative orthopaedic surgeon said that embarking on long walkathons without bone health and other check-ups, and sans physical preparation, can lead to bone health issues lasting for lifetime. There have been cases in the two Telugu states where politicians had to cut short their yatras after developing health complications. Regenerative orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Kolla Saketh said that weight issues with knee, back and other factors, determine if anyone is fit to take up marathon walks. Osteoarthritis (knee pain) and back pain developed during yatras might cause discomfort throughout life. If politicians develop stress fractures, ligament injuries, cartilage wearing, pain in heels and legs, or recurrence of an old injury, the issues can last for two to six weeks. Check-ups before start So, he has suggested politicians and their followers to opt for pre-padayatra orthopaedic clinical and radiological check-up by sports medicine surgeons, clinical examination to assess any old injury, or any orthopaedic issues due to ageing, and X-Rays and MRI scan if necessary. “This will help them to get an idea of how long they can walk, for how many days, breaks needed, and vulnerability to complications involving bones. If anyone plans to participate in marathon walks, it is suggested that they take up physical actions such as warm-up and proper tone-up of muscles, and muscle strengthening exercises, for at least a month before the padayatras. Even selecting the right kind of footwear like sports shoes with softer material silicone insoles or micro-cellular rubber material is a must,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/docs-tips-for-politicos-on-yatras/article36265189.ece
03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Two-hour rain inundates several areas||Unexpected cloudburst caught the city off guard and inundated several localities during evening hours on Thursday. A largely sunny day was rounded off with sudden and intense shower a little after 8 p.m. The rain lasted for more than two hours with hardly any gap, which turned in several stretches into virtual water bodies, and resulted in traffic jams. Vehicles and pushcarts were seen being washed away in flood water in areas such as Yousufguda and Krishna Nagar, video clips of which went viral on social media. Commuters were stranded everywhere, as roads were engulfed by large streams of water. As usual, the stretch in front of the Chief Minister’s camp office had knee deep water, making it difficult for even four-wheelers to negotiate a path. As per the data from automatic weather stations across the city at 10 p.m., Shaikpet received maximum rainfall at close to 10 centimetres, followed closely by Kukatpally. Areas such as Serilingampally, Balanagar and Saroornagar received over eight centimetres of rain. Video clip of people rescuing a man from being washed away in Krishna Nagar was widely shared. More rain Khairatabad, Bandlaguda, Hayatnagar, and Qutbullahpur received over six centimetres of rainfall, Saidabad, Charminar, Asifnagar, and Uppal were among localities which experienced heavy rain.

03 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||ED grills Charmme in drug case||Three days after noted filmmaker Puri Jagannadh was summoned to the Enforcement Directorate office in connection with a money laundering case involving a high-end drug racket that was busted in the city in 2017, his business partner and actor-turned-producer Charmme Kaur was grilled by the central agency on Thursday. Summons were issued to Ms. Kaur by ED’s Assistant Director (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) Muttaarapu Ashok on August 17, asking her to appear before him on September 2 at 10.30 a.m. in connection with the investigation in the case of ‘NDPS cases registered in Telangana State’. On August 31, Puri Jagannadh was grilled by the ED, while actor Rakul Preet Singh is likely to appear before the central agency on Friday. Ms. Kaur, the Vijay Devarakonda and Ananya Pandey starrer Liger producer, entered the ED office at Basheerbagh around 10.20 a.m. and was there till 6.30 p.m. Ms. Kaur, who was asked to produce her bank statements, was reportedly questioned about a suspicious transaction of Rs. 2.5 lakh into the bank account of an alleged drug dealer. However, the 34-year-old actress reportedly told the investigators that she “didn’t know who Kelvin Mascarenhas was” while they produced the bank statements, WhatsApp chat, Call Details Record between Ms. Kaur and Kelvin, apart from other electronic evidence. Kelvin Mascarenhas reportedly saved Ms. Kaur’s contact number as ‘Dada’ in his mobile phone. “I have submitted all the documents which were mentioned in the summons by the ED. I have cooperated with the investigation and answered all their questions,” she told the media after coming out of the central agency’s office. The investigating agency has summoned more than 10 celebrities of Tollywood, including director Puri Jagannadh and actors Daggubati Rana, Rakul Preet Singh, in a case related to the smuggling of ‘Class A’ narcotic substances, including LSD and MDMA. In 2017 too, after the racket was busted in July, which further followed the arrest of several people, including an American , a South African and a Netherlands National, Charmme was questioned by the Telangana’s Prohibition and Excise department sleuths. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Excise department also probed the alleged drug-links with Tollywood, and had then questioned 11 people connected to the film industry to find out if they had any links with the racket as consumers or suppliers or with those arrested. They had also collected hair and nail samples. The ED summoned the Tollywood personalities who were among those questioned by SIT and they were asked to appear before it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ed-grills-actor-charmme-in-drug-case/article36265205.ece
03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘KCR deliberately ignored Krishna water share for TS’||Telangana Congress president A. Revanth Reddy has placed the blame squarely on Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for the ongoing water dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana stating that the CM had deliberately stayed away from Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) meetings. Speaking to reporters here, he reminded that despite pleas from the Congress party and other irrigation experts the Chief Minister chose to ignore the issue totally before being forced to act due to intervention from the Court case. He said both Chief Minister Chandrasekhar Rao and then Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao had agreed in New Delhi for 299 TMCft usage for Telangana and 512 TMCft for Andhra Pradesh for one year. However, they continued the same usage for the next five years without even discussing the new allotment for the new State. Mr. Reddy alleged that the GO 203 of the Andhra Pradesh government for the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation project had the full backing of KCR as both Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao and Jaganmohan Reddy indulged in lunch diplomacy in the Pragathi Bhavan right after the project was announced in the AP Assembly. The GO allows lifting of 3 TMCft for the project every day from the Krishna basin. He said KCR did not even react to the AP Chief Minister’s grand plans for the project during their meeting or later. However, Congress leader and former minister Nagam Janardhan Reddy had written a letter to the CM highlighting how South Telangana would turn into a desert forever if A.P. goes ahead with the project, and the need to stop it immediately. But there was only silence from KCR, he claimed. Accusing the CM of following a hidden agenda, the Congress leader also claimed that the TS government agreed to 299 TMCft in the KRMB meeting on Wednesday. “Where are the ministers from South Telangana who made grand announcements of seeking 50% share,” he asked. “Perhaps the CM is busy with the dinner hosted at Nama Nageshwar Rao’s house in New Delhi,” he said sarcastically. The TPCC chief said that, as his wont, KCR is trying to divert the issue to the power generation after failing to protect the water share of Telangana. Moreover, the government is raising issues that were not in the purview of the KRMB only to create confusion. Attacking BJP State president Bandi Sanjay he asked him to make clear the party’s stand on Krishna waters. The padayatra of Mr. Sanjay would not yield anything as both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and KCR were working together for their mutual interests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-deliberately-ignored-krishna-water-share-for-ts/article36265214.ece
03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Six held in Warangal triple murder case||In less than 24 hours of gruesome killing of three persons of a family, the Warangal police on Wednesday arrested six persons in the case. Among the arrested was the prime accused and conspirator Mohammed Shafi, 51, who was charged with killing his elder brother Mohammed Chand Pasha, and the latter’s wife and brother-in-law. Other arrested persons included Boyini Venkanna, 45, Md. Sajid, 32, Ragula Vijender, 35, Md. Mira Akbar, 40, and Md. Pasha, 37. Hunting sickles, petrol chain saw, two auto-rickshaws and a bike used by the accused were seized from them, Warangal Police Commissioner Tarun Joshi said at a press conference here. Shafi and his elder brother Pasha were jointly into cattle trade. They would purchase cattle from villagers surrounding Warangal and sell them. In the past few years, they slipped into debts and had to pay money to farmers from whom they purchased cattle. As creditors and others began mounting pressure on them, Shafi wanted his brother to clear the Rs. 1.20 crore debt. This created a rift between them. Accusing his elder brother of evading paying the debts, Shafi quarrelled with him many times and eventually decided to eliminate him. Accompanied by five of his accomplices, Shafi went to Pasha’s house in the early hours of Wednesday. By cutting open the doors with petrol chain saw, they gained entry inside and attacked Pasha’s family inflicting wounds with hunting sickles leaving three of them dead on the spot. Pasha’s two sons too sustained injuries in the attack but they are recuperating in a hospital. The accused were presented before a court and remanded in judicial custody.  Hunting sickles, two autorickshaws and a bike used by the accused were seized from their possession.

03 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Improved attendance on second school day||On the second day after schools reopened in the State, the attendance went up a notch in government-run schools as well as the few private schools that began functioning. While government primary schools functioned normally, a majority of private schools are still awaiting consent from parents. “Parents of pre-primary students are not willing to send their children and want us to continue online classes. But children of higher classes between 6th and 10th are keen to return. I expect normal attendance from Monday,” said Shaik Sayeed Ahmed who runs a private school in Malkajgiri. At some of the private schools in the State, it was down to bargaining as managements demanded payment of pending fees. “We are accepting up to 50% discounted fee. We are not even asking for advance fee as is the policy,” said a school owner where the fee ranges between Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 24,000 per annum. The association of private schools has informally sent out a message to managements to go easy on fee collection. Some of the parents took to social media to raise the issue, tagging the education minister, the education board as well as the Minister of Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao. “Telangana State government said schools opened yesterday. While children have passed Class X. The schools are asking the fee of 9th class and also 10th class, the total amount is Rs. 40,000,” shared one of the parents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/improved-attendance-on-second-day-of-school/article36265184.ece
03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘DNA fingerprint for crime negligible’||DNA fingerprinting taken for crime suspects or convicts is only of a “certain negligible part” looking for more variations to prove the uniqueness of the person concerned and will not give out any background, identity or religion, clarified Director of the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) K. Thangaraj on Thursday. A different set of markers are used to trace the human origin and evaluation with the entire DNA or genome when the background of the person is known, he explained, in an effort to differentiate between using the technology for solving crimes and genetic study for population studies, during a webinar on ‘DNA Fingerprinting Technology – its success and future’ organised by Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR). Mr. Thangaraj, also Chief Scientist of the CSIR-CCMB, said the technology is to be used only for suspects and convicts with a specific timeline with the profile to be destroyed if proved innocent as per the proposed Bill. While England’s Dr Alec Jeffery is the father of the DNA fingerprinting technology, he traced its development here due to research efforts by CDFD founder-director Lalji Singh. Dr. Singh was studying the evolution of sex determination through chromosomes of poisonous snakes following which individual specific banding pattern was identified. This technology over the last 25 years has helped to solve many complex crimes like establishing the identity of killers of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Suicide bomber Dhanu and mastermind Sivarasan were identified after taking DNA from the respective parents from Sri Lanka and compared with the DNA obtained from the dead bodies. Incidentally, the ex-PM inaugurated the CCMB from where CDFD originated. While there are privacy and individual freedom issues, it is possible to ensure innocents are not convicted if the DNA technology is accepted by the legal fraternity and also ensure 100% conviction rate, observed professor of the National Law University G.K. Goswami. In United States alone about 20 people on the death row have been saved as DNA evidence helped, he said and explained close to 60 countries have got the legislations, yet none has come up with an iron clad one. Currently, DNA fingerprinting is being done for those accused of sexual offences and those involved in other crimes can seek the court’s permission to prove their innocence. Professor in NALSAR University of Law K.V.K. Santhy said a legal framework for exoneration has been lacking for the innocent and spoke of the fears of DNA profiling in data collection and maintenance. CSIR-CCMB Director N. Vinay also spoke while Dr. Shika moderated the discussion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dna-fingerprint-for-crime-negligible/article36265194.ece
03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||MIDHANI, NFC release second consignment of SG Tubes for BHEL Trichy||MIDHANI (Mishra Dathu Nigam Limited) and Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC) have flagged off the second consignment of ‘Steam Generator (SG) Tubes’ to be supplied to BHEL Trichy on Thursday. The third consignment is expected to be completed by December. Both public sector firms together participated in a global tender for supply of critical SG tubes to BHEL (Trichy) and had won the tender. Now, the MIDHANI-NFC combine is the only manufacturer having this capability to manufacture right from raw material forged billets to the required SG Tubes. Steam Generator Tubes comprise a substantial portion of the Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary (RCPB), said an official spokesman. Since their integrity is important to the safe operation of a nuclear reactor, regulatory authorities have established stringent requirements to ensure SG tube quality is maintained. The process of making SG tubes from the billets is quite complex as it consists of a large number of processes, re-conditioning, inspection and testing stages. Extensive conditioning of the material at every stage is required for qualification of these tubes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/midhani-nfc-release-second-consignment-of-sg-tubes-for-bhel-trichy/article36265193.ece
03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre urges State to examine request to extend CA for RGIA||Union Minister of Civil Aviation Jyotiraditya M. Scindia has written to Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao to look into the issue of extending the period of Concession Agreement (CA) for Hyderabad International Airport Limited (HIAL). The CA has been executed between the Ministry of Civil Aviation and HIAL for development, construction, operation and maintenance of Hyderabad International Airport on Dec. 20, 2004. The HIAL has requested for extension of its concession period for another 30 years beyond the initial 30 years, i.e., beyond March 23, 2038, and till 23.03.2068. The Government has been requested to ‘re-examine’ the request of HIAL for extension of the period of CA and furnish its recommendations to the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The Minister mentioned about the operationalisation of Warangal Airport and its inclusion under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). While the airport is within 150 km aerial distance of HIAL, it can be developed with mutually agreeable solution, to be explored by Government with HIAL and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) , a press release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-urges-state-to-examine-request-to-extend-ca-for-rgia/article36265216.ece
03 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||IIIT-H team proposes safer, simpler polling method||A team of researchers from the International Institute of Information Technology - Hyderabad (IIIT-H) has pressed for a simpler blockchain-based polling system that would make casting votes both safer and scalable. In a research paper titled “FASTEN: Fair and Secure Distributed Voting Using Smart Contracts”, Prof. Sujit Gujar from IIIT-H’s Machine Learning lab, and his students Sankarshan Damle and Moin Hussain, made a case that would simplify handling sensitive data. He opined that despite several blockchain voting solutions which ensure that manipulation does not take place, anonymity of voters is maintained, and multiple voting is kept at bay, there are no solutions that could be scaled for sheer number of voters in India. While on the one hand, homomorphic encryption, a method that does not compromise privacy and deals with encrypted data without having to decrypt it, is available, the method proposed by the team involves simple public key encryption by distributing decryption across the network. “With this being a distributed network, no single entity can cheat. Homomorphic encryptions are computationally very heavy. By using simpler public key cryptosystems, the process will also be quicker,” the professor said.

Once the victims click on the links he/she is directed to either investment platforms or e-commerce platforms. Further, they are asked to either invest or perform few tasks such as purchasing few items on the promise of high commissions. “Believing the words of the fraudsters, the victims invest money or purchase items and get duped eventually,” Cyberabad Cyber Crime police said. On August 28, a city-based youngster received an SMS from VK-SECRRE “HI (xyz victim) Amazon urgently recruiting for part-time jobs and you can earn Rs. 3000-Rs. 10,000 every day, add whatsapp:wa.me/ 918125323349mj.” The complainant clicked the link and contacted the WhatsApp number and the fraudster sent a link which was clicked by the complainant and she/he was directed to another web page where he invested money. For initial investments, he got commissions, believing the victim invested Rs. 1.02 lakh and got cheated. Based on the complaint, a case was registered.

03 September 2021||Mysuru,TELANGANA||Tourism stakeholders await govt. decision on Dasara||Ahead of the high powered committee meeting on Dasara slated to be held in Bengaluru on Friday, stakeholders in the hospitality and tourism sector in Mysuru are keeping their fingers crossed over its outcome. Even if the government agrees for a ‘meaningful’ Dasara with thrust on tradition, it is likely to be a low-key affair and hence stakeholders in the hospitality sector aver that the bulk of the crowd this year may only be locals drawn from Mysuru and surrounding areas. This, they opine, will not have any bearing on the fortunes of the tourism and hospitality sector which generates at least 80,000 direct jobs. Narayana Gowda of the Hotel Owners Association said for the sector to thrive outstation tourists are a must as it results in spending which helps revive the economy. Almost 40 per cent of the tourists to Mysuru are from Kerala which is witnessing a surge and hence no tourists can be expected in the immediate future from that State, he added. The tourism season normally tends to commence around September once the monsoon subsides leading to a peak in October coinciding with Dasara and extending till January. But this year the stakeholders are not optimistic of any revival in their fortunes and will prefer to just sit it out till the bulk of the population gets fully vaccinated over the next few months. “The tourism sector took a hit from February 2020 and the lockdown became a norm from March 2020 onwards. Though there has been a graded unlocking since then the recovery of the sector is expected to commence only from summer of 2022. We hope to reach the pre-pandemic level of traffic only next year as the bulk of the population would have been vaccinated and the pent up demand for travel will also overwhelm the sector’’, he added. Travel agents B.S. Prashanth of Mysore Travel Agents Association said they had plans to bring travel agents from across the country and showcase the city and surrounding areas. “This year accommodation availability will not be an issue as we don’t expect tourists to turn up in large numbers. So the association is keen to bring travel agents so that they promote Mysore in their respective regions. We sought a stakeholders meeting with the district administration but it was simply not interested’’, said Mr. Prashanth. Risk factor The general perception is that the COVID-19 is just coming under control in Mysuru with the number of fresh cases hovering around 100 only since the last few days. So the risk of organising a State-sponsored festival extending to 10 days that could lead to another wave, is worrying. Hence the stakeholders are not positive of any revival in their fortunes as unlike in the past Dasara is not being perceived to be a springboard to promote tourism this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tourism-stakeholders-await-govt-decision-on-dasara/article36265111.ece

03 September 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||India’s first bio-brick based building opened at IIT-H||India’s first bio-brick based building was inaugurated at Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad (IIT-H) on Thursday by Director B.S. Murty. A prototype of the guard cabin was designed and set up in the space allocated by IIT-H. It is part of the Bold Unique Idea Lead Development (BUILD) project to demonstrate the strength and versatility of the material. The sample building is made up of bio-bricks supported by a metal framework. The roof is also made of bio-bricks over PVC sheets to reduce heat. Both inside and outside walls are cement-plastered to protect the bio-bricks from rain. PhD scholar Priyabrata Rautray under his supervisor Prof. Deepak John Mathew at the Department of Design and his team have published two international conference papers on bio-bricks at ICED 2019, Delft University and ICoRD 2021, IIT Mumbai. The research team received a ‘Special Recognition Trophy’ for sustainable housing at Rural Innovators Start-Up Conclave 2019 organised by National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRDPR) Hyderabad. In April this year, Priyabrata and his team were awarded ‘Indian Patent’ for the bio-brick material and its manufacturing technology. Congratulating Priyabrata and his team on completion of the bio-bricks project, Prof. Murty said, “BUILD project is one of the amazing initiatives IIT-H has taken during the pandemic. BUILD objective is to bring out the best innovative and unique idea our students have and provide them the necessary support to convert their idea into reality. Many such incredible ideas were supported to promote innovation and service to the society at large. It is a perfect illustration of ‘Wealth from Waste’ and we would be submitting a proposal for promoting its wider adoption by the rural community to the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.” “This innovation is going to be a game changer for farmers as their agricultural waste will become an income generator for them. Also, this will give employment to them during their lean period,” said Prof. Deepak John Mathew. “I am happy to complete this project. I sincerely hope farmers adopt this technology to build their homes. I would like to dedicate this accomplishment to my father, whom I lost last year due to the pandemic,” said Rautray.  I am happy to complete this project. I sincerely hope farmers adopt this technology to build their homes.

And if two deaths happen in a gap of 10 days in addition to losing the very roof over their heads and their precious land, the tragedy turns manifold. On Tuesday, Gupta Ramulu (47), a resident of Pallepahad village in the newly established Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Colony at Mutrajpally, passed away. He had suffered cardiac arrest. He is survived by wife, son and three daughters. Ramulu had performed the marriage of his third daughter Bhagya with Arey Kanakaraju of Erravalli few years ago. The couple had a daughter and Bhagya is carrying now and in fourth month of her pregnancy. On August 22, Kanakaraju went to his native village to vacate his house. The village officials were demolishing houses then as the next day water was scheduled to be released into Mallannasagar reservoir by Irrigation department officials. While Kanakaraju was standing near his house, a powerline snapped and hit him, causing him serious injury. He was immediately shifted to a private hospital in Hyderabad where breathed his last. Exactly on the 11th day, his father-in-law Ramulu passed away unable to come to terms with the tragedy and worrying about the fate of Bhagya. “My father had been staying with Bhagya at Hyderabad for the past few days since Kanakaraju died. He was worried about how she will survive and how her future will be. It weighed on him heavily and he passed away due to cardiac arrest. We got about Rs. 20 lakh by selling about 3.5 acres of our land to the government and spent about Rs. 12 lakh in performing the marriage of my last sister Bhagya. The government has not paid compensation for our house in about 500 yards and there was no proper response from officials.

R&R administrator is Joint Collector and he should issue notice for Gram Sabha and instead the Tahsildar has issued notice, which was against the rules,” said the oustees in the memorandum submitted to the officials. They have demanded officials to provide complete details of the project first followed by inviting objections which can be addressed by the government before proceeding further.

Speaking in Mumbai, Mr. Pawar said the final decision on starting schools would be taken by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after his discussion with the State COVID-19 task force on Sunday. He said, “While [State Education Minister] Varsha Gaikwad had declared a reopening date during an earlier review, the final decision rests with the CM who has said he would announce a date only after discussing the matter with the task force. While schools have reopened in some States, students tested positive within a few days. Kerala has the highest number of patients, followed by Maharashtra, and the Centre has directed to take required measures to celebrate festivals indoors.” He added, “Hence, we have decided that until a decision is taken, we will fully vaccinate teaching and non-teaching staff in schools, be they Zilla Parishad or government schools, grant or non-grant institutions.” ‘Parents will be relieved’ The Deputy Chief Minister said even parents will be relieved to an extent if both doses of the vaccine are administered to teachers and other staff of the school their child is attending. Meanwhile, Minister Bacchu Kadu said a decision on reopening schools will be taken in the next two days. “A meeting on this is to be held within the next couple of days. Schools have started in other parts of the country, so it should be started in our own State, too. But the decision will have to be taken carefully keeping in mind that Maharashtra has the highest number of active cases after Kerala,” he said. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Sunday had said the State government planned to fully vaccinate all teaching and non-teaching staff by September 5. Mr. Tope had said that a special drive was being conducted to achieve this, and that the State COVID-19 task force was of the opinion that schools in districts which were not reporting positive cases could be reopened.

State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said while cases were declining, the threat from the virus was far from over. He said a lockdown would only be imposed in if the oxygen demand rose to a very high level. The total cases have reached 64,73,674, while its cumulative recoveries have risen to 62,81,985, with the recovery rate rising incrementally to 97.03%. Pune reported nearly 950 new cases, taking its total cases to 11,21,068, while four deaths pushed the total death over 18,700. As per district authorities, the active case tally has exceeded 9,300. Mumbai reported 440 new cases to take its total case tally to 7,45,010, while the active count rose incrementally to 3,756. Three deaths took the city’s death toll to 15,984.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/states-active-case-tally-further-dips-to-50607/article36264927.ece
03 September 2021||Pune,||Sambhajiraje-led delegation of MPs meets President||Bharatiya Janata Party MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, who led a delegation of Maharashtra MPs on Thursday to meet President President Ram Nath Kovind, said they urged Mr. Kovind to request the Centre to lift the 50% reservation limit. Speaking to reporters in New Delhi, Mr. Sambhajiraje — a direct descendant of the Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji and social reformer Rajashri Shahu Maharaj — said as the Supreme Court, while scrapping the Maratha quota law in May, had upheld the 1992 Indra Sawhney verdict, the 50% quota limit in a State remained. The delegation consisted of MPs from the four major parties in the State and included Ranjitsinh Naik-Nimbalkar (BJP), Vandana Chavan (NCP), Vinayak Raut (Shiv Sena) and MLA Sangram Thopate (Congress), who filled in for party Chandrapur MP Suresh Dhanorkar, who could not attend as he was unwell. He said, “We explained to the President in detail all aspects of the Maratha quota issue and he patiently heard us out.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sambhajiraje-led-delegation-of-mps-meets-president/article36264930.ece
03 September 2021||Kabul,||Taliban close to forming government||The Taliban said on Thursday they were close to forming a new government, as dozens of women held a rare protest for the right to work under a new regime that faces enormous economic hurdles and deep public mistrust. The Islamist militants, who have pledged a softer brand of rule than during their brutal reign of 1996-2001, must now transform from insurgent group to governing power. Cabinet formation The announcement of a Cabinet, which two Taliban sources said may take place on Friday following afternoon prayers, would come just days after the chaotic pullout of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, ending America’s longest war with an astounding military victory for the Islamist group. In one of the most symbolic moments since the takeover of Kabul on August 15, the militants paraded on Wednesday some of the military hardware they had captured during their offensive, even flying a Black Hawk helicopter over Kandahar, their movement’s spiritual heartland. Now, all eyes are on whether the Taliban can deliver a Cabinet capable of managing a war-wracked economy and honour the movement’s pledges of a more “inclusive” government. Speculation is rife about the make-up of a new government, although a senior official said on Wednesday that women were unlikely to be included. Top posts unlikely Senior leader Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai — a hardliner in the first Taliban administration — told BBC Pashto in an interview that while women could continue working, there “may not” be a place for them in the Cabinet of any future government or any other top position. In the western city of Herat, some 50 women took to the streets in a rare, defiant protest for the right to work and over the lack of women’s participation in the new government. “It is our right to have education, work and security,” the protesters chanted in unison, said an AFP journalist who witnessed the protest. “We are not afraid, we are united,” they added. Herat is a relatively cosmopolitan city on the ancient silk road near the Iranian border. It is one of the more prosperous in Afghanistan and girls have already returned to school there. One of the organisers of the protest, Basira Taheri, said she wanted the Taliban to include women in the new Cabinet. “We want the Taliban to hold consultations with us,” Ms. Taheri said. “We don’t see any women in their gatherings and meetings.” Among the 1,22,000 people who fled Afghanistan in a frenzied U.S.-led airlift that ended on Monday was the first female Afghan journalist to interview a Taliban official live on television. Speaking to AFP in Qatar, the former anchor for the Tolo News media group said women in Afghanistan were “in a very bad situation”. “I want to say to the international community — please do anything (you can) for Afghan women,” Beheshta Arghand said.  In Kabul, residents voiced worry over the country’s long-running economic difficulties, now seriously compounded by the militant movement’s takeover. “With the arrival of the Taliban, it’s right to say that there is security, but business has gone down below zero,” Karim Jan, an electronic goods shop owner, said. The UN warned earlier this week of a looming “humanitarian catastrophe” in Afghanistan, as it called to ensure that those wanting to flee the new regime still have a way out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-close-to-forming-government/article36264469.ece
03 September 2021||Beijing,||China bans reality talent shows||China banned reality talent programmes on Thursday and ordered broadcasters to promote more masculine representations of men, in a wide-ranging crackdown on “immoral” pop culture Beijing believes is leading young people astray. Talent shows that put hundreds of aspiring young performers through rigorous boot camps and subject them to public votes have become massively popular in China, sparking criticism over obsessive fans and poor role models. “Broadcast and TV institutions must not screen idol development programmes or variety shows and reality shows,” China’s broadcast regulator, the National Radio and Television Administration said. The regulator ordered broadcasters to resist “abnormal aesthetics” such as “sissy” men, “vulgar influencers”, stars’ inflated pay and performers with “lapsed morals”. Faced with falling birth rates, Chinese authorities have tried to instil traditional masculine values in the youth by ramping up gym classes and criticising male entertainers who model the effeminate looks of Korean pop idols. Instead, broadcasters were urged to “strongly promote outstanding traditional Chinese culture... and advanced socialist culture.” Popular Chinese blogger Feng Xiaoyi had his account suspended by Douyin — China’s version of TikTok — last week for “promoting unhealthy values”, after some users complained about his “sissy” videos.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-bans-reality-talent-shows/article36264471.ece
03 September 2021||Doha,||Qatar, Taliban working on reopening Kabul airport||Qatar is working with the Taliban to reopen Kabul’s airport as soon as possible, its Foreign Minister said on Thursday, urging the hardline Islamists to allow Afghans to leave. The airport, the scene of a frenzied evacuation which ended with the U.S. troop withdrawal on Tuesday, is out of operation with much of its infrastructure degraded or destroyed. “We are working very hard (and) we remain hopeful that we will be able to operate it as soon as possible,” said Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani. “Hopefully in the next few days we will hear some good news,” he told a news conference in Doha. A Qatari technical team flew into Kabul on Wednesday to discuss reopening the airport, the first plane to land there since the evacuations. A source with knowledge of the matter said the goal was to resume flights both for humanitarian aid and to provide freedom of movement, including the resumption of evacuation efforts. More than 123,000 foreign nationals and Afghans fled the country in the airlift operation, but many more are desperate to depart. “It’s very important... that the Taliban demonstrate their commitment to provide safe passage and freedom of movement for the people of Afghanistan,” Sheikh Mohammed said.  Turkey’s role Qatar is “engaging with (the Taliban) and also with Turkey if they can provide any technical assistance”, he added. Sheikh Mohammed was addressing a joint press conference with his British counterpart Dominic Raab, who said “we need to adjust to the new reality” of Taliban rule. “Our immediate priority is to secure the safe passage of those remaining British nationals, but also the Afghans who worked for the U.S., and indeed others who may be at most risk,” Mr. Raab said. Qatar hosted negotiations between the Taliban and the U.S. in recent years and was a transit point for about 43,000 evacuees from Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/qatar-taliban-working-on-reopening-kabul-airport/article36264475.ece

Korea shuns vaccines||North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered officials to wage a tougher epidemic prevention campaign in “our style” after he turned down some foreign COVID-19 vaccines offered via the UN-backed immunisation programme. During a Politburo meeting Thursday, Mr. Kim said officials must “bear in mind that tightening epidemic prevention is the task of paramount importance which must not be loosened even a moment,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported Friday. While stressing the need for material and technical means of virus prevention and increasing health workers’ qualifications, Mr. Kim also called for “further rounding off our style epidemic prevention system,” KCNA said. Mr. Kim previously called for North Koreans to brace for prolonged COVID-19 restrictions, indicating the nation’s borders would stay closed despite worsening economic and food conditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/north-korea-rejects-chinese-vaccines-unicef/article36264474.ece

The Iran-backed rebels attacked pro-government positions south of the strategic city, making progress despite losing dozens of fighters in coalition air strikes. It was the Houthis’ first major offensive on Marib, the key to controlling the region, since June, when 111 fighters on both sides died in three days of clashes. “Twenty-two pro-government (forces) were killed and 50 others were wounded, while 43 Houthis were killed in the last 48 hours,” a government official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/65-dead-as-yemen-rebels-launch-new-assault-on-govt-stronghold/article36264470.ece
03 September 2021||Beijing,||China: ball in U.S. court for climate cooperation||China has challenged the United States to fix relations with Beijing to make progress on climate change, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, as Washington’s climate envoy visits to press the world’s top polluter to slash emissions. Tensions between China and the U.S. have soared in recent months with the two sides trading barbs on Beijing’s human rights record and its initial handling of the coronavirus. Tackling climate change is among a handful of issues where the two sides had struck notes of harmony. But Beijing has in recent months emphasised that environmental cooperation could be hurt by deteriorating Sino-U.S. relations. Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday told U.S. climate envoy John Kerry during a China visit that cooperation on global warming could not be disentangled from broader diplomacy between the two countries. In a video call with Mr. Kerry, Mr. Wang accused Washington of a “major strategic miscalculation towards China”, according to the Ministry statement. “It is impossible for China-U.S. climate cooperation to be elevated above the overall environment of China-U.S. relations,” Mr. Wang said. The Chinese Minister said “the ball is now in the U.S.’ court, and the U.S. should stop seeing China as a threat and opponent”. Mr. Kerry visited Japan earlier this week before travelling to the northeastern Chinese city of Tianjin. At a virtual meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng on Thursday, Mr. Kerry said “there is no way for the world to solve the climate crisis without the full engagement and commitment” of China, according to a U.S. State Department spokesperson.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-ball-in-us-court-for-climate-cooperation/article36264472.ece
03 September 2021||London,||Ireland fines WhatsApp after probe||Ireland’s privacy watchdog has fined WhatsApp a record €225 million ($267 million) after an investigation found it breached stringent EU data protection rules on transparency about sharing people’s data with other Facebook companies. The Data Protection Commission said on Thursday that it was also ordering WhatsApp to take “remedial actions” to change the way it communicates with users so that it complies with EU regulations. WhatsApp, which has 2 billion users worldwide, said the fine was out of proportion and it would appeal the decision. The watchdog’s announcement wraps up an investigation into the Facebook-owned messaging service that opened in December 2018, after the EU rules, known as General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect. It’s the second penalty — and the biggest — issued by the Irish watchdog under GDPR. Last year, it fined Twitter €4,50,000 for a security breach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ireland-fines-whatsapp-after-probe/article36264473.ece
03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Is monetising public assets a good idea?||Last month, the Centre released the ‘National Monetisation Pipeline’, a document listing the various public assets that will be leased out to private companies over the next four years. The government believes that monetising underutilised public assets will bring in almost Rs. 6 lakh crore to the government and help build new infrastructure to boost the economy. The Opposition has accused the government of selling off valuable national assets to “crony capitalists”. In a conversation moderated by Prashanth Perumal J. , Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Ajay Shah discuss this move. Edited excerpts: What do you think of the government’s idea of monetising operating assets to build fresh assets? Ajay Shah:The grand strategic question is this: on the one hand, we have the government developing and owning public assets forever. And this has certain consequences. On the other, we have the public-private partnership (PPP) model, where the private sector will develop and operate assets. We have found that the PPP model runs into many difficulties. The government does not have the capacity to enter into contracts and deal with contract negotiations and difficulties. Many pieces of the development process are difficult for private people to solve. So, is there a way out? Conceptually, it seems that there is a way out, which is that the government should do the early development of infrastructure, which is the high-risk phase, create an operating asset, and then sell the asset off to private people. So, the asset goes off the public balance sheet and into the private balance sheet. The money collected by the government can go back into developing new assets. I think there is merit in this thought process given the constraints of state capacity in India. Montek Singh Ahluwalia:Many people have reservations about bringing in the private sector into infrastructure. There is no dispute that we need more infrastructure but the public sector simply doesn’t have the resources to build it. There are two possible responses. One, for new infrastructure, one can think of bringing in the private sector, set up a contractual framework for what it has to do, and then let it bring its own resources. The second is to recognise that there are more risks in the construction stage and it is perhaps better to let the public sector build the asset and then sell it off to private players or if not an outright sale, let the private sector manage it. We have a huge amount of infrastructure to build in the future and we have huge value embedded in existing infrastructure. So, why not realise that value and let the public sector use the resources to build the infrastructure we need? Of course problems will arise. The first is whether you are realising adequate value from the assets. This depends on the quality of the bidding process and whether enough private players are attracted to bid. The second is cronyism. The only way of ensuring that asset monetisation doesn’t lead to cronyism is to make the bidding conditions such that the people eligible to bid are not a small, predetermined set. However, because of the capital intensity of the project, not everybody is going to be able to bid. Even so, you can ensure that there is sufficient participation. Why would the government choose asset monetisation over outright privatisation? MSA:I don’t know what considerations went into making that decision. I think we should do monetisation and privatisation because we don’t know what’s best. One reason that the government might not want to do outright privatisation is if it involves the transfer of a scarce resource like land. Land is so valuable that you may not want to just hand it over. It’s easier to justify a 30-year lease because at the end of that lease the land stays with the government. In another context, if the land is of no great value, you could simply hand it over. That’s why I feel that these are issues of choice. AS:I would like to put more considerations on the table on the trade-off between outright privatisation and asset monetisation. The first is: do we want to build a society where there is a gigantic public sector? How much do we want state domination of society? My view is that reduced state domination of society is important. The second aspect is practical. When a private person builds an infrastructure asset, it tends to get done better because a person has self-interest in making it a high-quality asset. The economist Lawrence Summers once famously said that never in the history of the world has anyone ever washed a rented car. If I’m a private investor in a highway through a complex asset monetisation contract, I do not really own the highway and I will take less care of the asset. Entering into a complex contract with a government organisation involves great risk because the Indian state is not a great party to have a contract with. So, a clean asset sale puts an end to the complexity of government interference. Are there ways to ensure that there’s no asset stripping by private investors with limited time horizons? MSA:When you have a 30-year contract, for example, your incentive to put money into the asset, which would ensure that it remains productive in the 31st, 32nd and the 33rd year, goes down compared to when you own it yourself. That’s an unresolved problem. People should think about that. One option would be that you allow a renewal of the lease even before the lease ends. But then you need a competitive process there. If you take the Taj Hotels, for example, which owns valuable property in Delhi on a fixed lease, they didn’t allow the hotel to run down right at the end of the lease in the hope that the lease will get renewed. So, the problem can be resolved. AS:The question is how much complexity you want to build into a contract. Imagine that I’ve got a highway contract for 30 years. In the contract, the government can embed some clauses stipulating various conditions. But you’re soon starting to go closer to the complexity of the PPP world. The more complex you make the contract, the more difficult it is for the Indian state to achieve the state capacity required to uphold the contract. All too often the Indian state engages in dadagiri, so private people are not comfortable entering into complex contracts with the Indian state. Now, that doesn’t mean that outright sale is easy. With an outright sale, we will still have a government regulator and we will face the problem of regulatory capacity. The trade-off is about the cost of building regulatory capacity versus the cost of building contracting capacity. What about the risk of assets being owned by a few large companies and its impact on consumers? MSA:Because of the limited number of private players, bidding for assets may not be totally fair. If you open up bidding to include foreign players, then you’re not limited to small players. As far as the consumer becoming hostage to a particular player is concerned, many of these projects by their very nature are monopolies. You don’t have competition in the sense that if you’re handing over a road from Delhi to Agra to a private player, there isn’t a parallel road competing with it. You can maybe go by rail, or you can go by air. But there’s only one major highway between Delhi and Agra and you certainly don’t want the person who has got it to start behaving like a monopolist. So, what do you do? You lay out in the operating contract that you signed the terms of service. Now all this is subject to the government’s poor contracting ability. But in principle, it is possible to have a relatively more complex contract, and to have a way of adjudicating within the terms of that contract with a sufficiently credible, independent set of regulators. This may not be easy because many people believe that regulators appointed by the government will give judgments favourable to the government. So, the regulatory authority should not be under the institutional control of the ministry that enters into the contract. But these are all areas we need to experiment with. Here, however, the critical thing to ask is: what’s the alternative? We could limit ourselves to what the government can do with its own resources and accept the lower trajectory of infrastructure development; or we could take these risks and go for a higher trajectory. We should do the latter. AS:I agree with what Montek said about experimenting with many pathways rather than presuming that we know the right answer. I feel that if you have a simple problem like a highway, then outright sale to the private sector makes more sense. But there are many problems that are far more subtle. So, I feel it’s healthy for us as a society to go in with an epistemic scepticism and an approach of experimentation and learning. About crony capitalism, I would like to say that opening up bidding to global players will be extremely valuable, not least because the vast amounts of money required to build infrastructure are best financed through global corporate finance structures. Overseas organisations are particularly important in obtaining the most efficient arrangements because Indian financial organisations need to deal with the infirmities of Indian finance. I’m attracted to dispersed shareholding companies as the owners of operating assets. A lot of elements of policy can and should be modelled in favour of more competition. How do we overcome issues that have stymied past disinvestment and monetisation efforts? MSA:The history of our efforts at privatising is littered with cases where the system doesn’t actually want to privatise. So, it puts forward conditions which to the government look very sensible. For example, any government would like to say when it is privatising something that the new owner will not be able to get rid of excess staff. But if you’re a private owner, making management changes and also scaling down excess labour is one of the key things in efficiency. If you come up with a privatisation proposal which says that you can’t get rid of the staff, you’re going to end up with poor bids. In the mid-1980s, when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister, it was agreed that we can privatise Scooters India. At that time, Bajaj Auto was willing to take over on conditions that were quite reasonable. But the conditions that the ministry came up with were guaranteed to make Bajaj Auto say, ‘no, thank you’. I don’t know the conditions that will be imposed in the asset monetisation programme. But I think these are the sorts of things that should be addressed upfront in a policy document. AS:Take the example of a Food Corporation of India warehouse in Mumbai occupying 120 acres of land. The question should be whether you really want a government asset occupying such a large area of land in Mumbai. The best imaginable use of that land is probably to sell it off, raise money and pay down public debt. So, that’s a classic privatisation question. If you try to view this through an asset monetisation lens, you will start thinking, ‘I want to give this asset to a private vendor, who will continue to store wheat in it as an agent of the government for the next 30 years’. That really does not make much sense. So I think we should be asking first principles questions about how many of these assets we really want under government control.  When a private person builds an infrastructure asset, it tends to get done better because a person has self-interest in making it a high-quality asset.

03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A hydro onslaught the Himalayas cannot take||In normal circumstances, when a mistake is understood and suffered, one tends to learn from it and not repeat it. Unfortunately, this does not hold true in the case of the policymakers who are bent upon permitting projects and large-scale infrastructure in the already fragile and vulnerable Ganga-Himalayan basin. Recurrent disasters in the last decade in the State of Uttarakhand have been studied and analysed. And in every disaster, the increasing anthropogenic pressure in this area has been found to be a direct or an indirect contributor. The most recent example is the Rishi-Ganga valley disaster, in February this year which claimed over 200 lives as the river turned into a flood carrying a heavy load of silt and debris and demolishing hydropower projects along its course. While science and logic tell us to press on with conservation and protection in these sensitive areas, our Government has decided to go in the dangerous and opposite direction. The background The affidavit filed recently by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC in an ongoing matter in the Supreme Court of India has recommended the construction of seven partially constructed hydroelectric projects in the Uttarakhand Himalaya. This essentially goes against the core mandate of the Ministry — which is to conserve the country’s natural environment — and one of the prominent electoral promises of the Government, the rejuvenation of one of the country’s major rivers, the Ganga. After the Kedarnath tragedy of 2013, in suo motu cognisance by the Supreme Court, an expert body (EB-I) was constituted to investigate whether the “mushrooming of hydro-power projects” in the State of Uttarakhand was linked to the disaster. In its findings, EB-I said there was a “direct and indirect impact” of these dams in aggravating the disaster. Paving the way for the projects, the Ministry formed committee after committee until it got approval for these projects with some design changes. This affidavit, dated August 17, reveals that the Government is inclined towards construction of 26 other projects, as in the recommendation of the expert body (EB-II; B.P. Das committee). The conclusions of the first expert body (EB-I), chaired by Ravi Chopra, that had flagged the incalculable environmental risks of such structures have been conveniently sidelined and overwritten by EB-II whose mandate has been to pave the way for all projects through some design change modifications. Politicians in cahoots with private developers are bent upon going ahead with such projects for short-term monetary gains despite the dire warnings of climate change threats and environmental challenges. It must be noted that the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has special significance in the context of fragile mountainous ecological regimes. Dangerous reversal The aforementioned affidavit submitted by the MoEFCC conceals the Ministry’s own observations and admissions given in its earlier affidavit dated May 5, 2014 which admitted that hydroelectric projects did aggravate the 2013 flood. Interestingly, the recent affidavit also conceals the minutes of the meeting and decision taken by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on February 2, 2019 in this regard. The minutes of this meeting make the policy decision of there being “no new hydropower projects” on the Ganga along with the cancellation of those that have not reached at 50% of its construction. This in itself is a bizarre demarcation because on one hand there is an acceptance of the devastative impact of the dams (and the decision not to have more) while on the other, there is a push to still pursue them on an unfounded logic of money having been spent on them. Should we continue with a mistake made or make amends? The sustainability of the dams in the long term is highly questionable as hydropower solely relies on the excess availability of water. Climate change models are clear about the cascading impacts of global warming trends on the glaciers of the Himalaya — the main source of water in the region that sustains the drainage network within the mountain chain. Temperatures across the region are projected to rise by about 1°C to 2°C on average by 2050. Retreating glaciers and the alternating phases of floods and drought will impact the seasonal flows of rivers. The most crucial aspect is the existence of sediment hotspot paraglacial zones, which at the time of a cloud burst, contribute huge amounts of debris and silt in the river, thereby increasing the river volume and the devastation downstream. The flash floods in these Himalayan valleys do not carry water alone; they also carry a massive quantity of debris. This was pointed out by EB-II alongside its recommendation not build any projects beyond 2,000 metres or north of the MCT, or the Main Central Thrust (it is a major geological fault). The existing fully commissioned dams in the region are already indicative of the fact that these high-capital intensive ventures have negatively impacted local communities and their livelihoods. It is high time the MoEFCC formulated a written position on climate change adaptation with respect to the hydropower sector, after a thorough public discourse. ‘Risk-laden artifacts’ Amelie Huber, a political ecologist who has conducted extensive research on the hydropower development in northeast India, says that the dams in the mountainous regions that are exposed to earthquakes, floods, extreme rainfall, avalanches and landslides, are “risk-laden artifacts” (https://bit.ly/3t8u6EE). The dominantly clichéd discourses on hydropower as a renewable source of green energy promoted by the dam lobby, deliberately ignore the contentious externalities such as social displacement, ecological impacts, environmental and technological risks. Factor of climate change These discourses assume great significance in the Himalayan terrains as these projects exacerbate ecological vulnerability, in a region that is already in a precarious state. The intense anthropogenic activities associated with the proliferation of the hydroelectric projects in these precarious regions accelerate the intensity of flash floods, avalanches, and landslides. The additional element of climate change makes these scenarios much worse. About 15% of the great earthquakes (of magnitudes greater than 8) of the 20th century took place in the Himalaya and many of its segments are likely to see a period of intense earthquake activity in the future, as studies show. The 2015 Nepal earthquake is a case in point. Several dams were damaged in that event destroying a third of Nepal’s hydropower. The recent events such as the Rishi Ganga tragedy and the disasters of 2012 (flashfloods), 2013 are examples of how hydroelectric projects which come in the way of high-velocity flows aggravate a disaster and should be treated as a warning against such projects in the disaster-prone Uttarakhand river valleys. The proliferation of dams is not restricted to Uttarakhand. By 2007, Sikkim had entered a contract with private public sector players for development of 5,000 MW and Arunachal Pradesh signed memoranda of understanding in 2010 for 40,000 MW. As Ms. Huber points out, “these agreements thrived on speculative investments and political brokering.... Private companies... often partner with public companies — have minimal accountability or experience in the courier and logistics, real estate, steel fabrication, and tourism sectors”. She cites the example of the 510 MW Teesta V hydropower plant in central Sikkim, commissioned in 2008. The local communities have been complaining about the sinking of mountain slopes, drying up of springs, development of fissures and increased incidents of landslides. The construction and maintenance of an extensive network of underground tunnels carrying water to the powerhouses contribute to the failure of mountain slopes. Several people in the Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project were washed away earlier this year, while scores were buried in the debris of the 2013 floods aggravated by the Phata-Byung and Singoli-Bhatwari hydroelectric projects of the Kedarnath valley. Many lives and livelihoods were lost in the Ukhimath flash floods of 2012 where the Kali-Ganga and Madmaheshwar dams are located. The dangers of an impending earthquake or flash flood loom large over the highly vulnerable Chamoli region where Vihsnugad-Pippalkoti is based. We are already aware of the massive impact of the Tehri hydroelectric project, if an unfortunate catastrophe strikes this gigantic structure. The river must flow free These are the projects that have been approved by the Government with no science backing them but with several scientific truths demanding their cancellation. A preposterous amount of money is being wasted in the construction of these dams that will always function much below their efficiency, cause the loss of water and forests, and render the area fragile. By the time they are constructed, the cost of electricity generated will also be phenomenally high and would have no buyers. Considering the environmental and cultural significance of these areas, it is imperative that the Government refrains from the economically challenged rapacious construction of hydroelectric projects and declares the upper reaches of all the headstreams of the Ganga as eco-sensitive zones.

03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||There has to be space for Bharati, and Bama too||The decision of the authorities of the University of Delhi to remove the texts by Dalit writers Bama Faustina Soosairaj, Sukirtharani and Mahasweta Devi from the undergraduate courses of English literature should worry the academic community for the reasons given and the manner in which it was done. Consultative syllabus drafting These writings were part of different papers of the undergraduate programme. The syllabus was drafted through a long process of consultation with the teachers of the undergraduate programme and approved unanimously. There was no dissent note even from any of the faculty members. The established norm requires the courses to be endorsed by the academic council, which comprises teachers from all disciplines and is the apex body of the university for academic matters. Usually, the council respects the academic decision of the department concerned. But the University of Delhi has created another layer of an oversight committee to look at the syllabus cleared by the department before putting it up for discussion by the academic council. It consists of nominees of the authorities. One need not say that this is an unnecessary arrangement as there is another standing committee of the academic council to look at any objections to the courses. It is this committee which ignored and overruled the collective academic wisdom of the department of English and arbitrarily removed these texts. And the members of the academic council, ignoring the protests from their colleagues from the English department, seconded the decision of the oversight committee. They know well that these writings must have been chosen after a long debate and discussion among the faculty members teaching these courses. There are certain departments which take this task seriously and there are some which do not bother about the rigour of the process. The department of English cannot be faulted for a lack of rigour at least. This insensitivity of the academic council towards the intellectual labour put in by their colleagues of the English department is a sign of lack of collegiality in the apex body. It is disturbing that a majority of the members of this body, most of them nominees of the Vice-Chancellor and ex-officio members, choose to follow the wishes of the authority. This is not their role. They abdicate their responsibility by not engaging with academic arguments and simply toeing the line of the authorities. The FYUP rollback case One must also note that this very academic council also took a momentous decision of introducing the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) without any discussion. The casual approach of the academic council in a matter such as this explains why it did not care about this ‘small’ issue of three texts. We had witnessed the same pusillanimity when the academic council had approved the FYUP in 2012 and then withdrew it in 2014 at the instance of the Government. The academic council showed no embarrassment in rolling back what it had termed as a historic and revolutionary step only two years earlier! I remember asking the then head of my department the reason why he had voted for FYUP and he nonchalantly told me that it was for the ‘people above’ to think and not his concern. We, as teachers, do need to introspect about this internal, moral weakness for which only we are responsible. We make those bodies, be it departmental committees or faculty bodies or the academic council. It is we who fail the students and the university by not performing our role as members of these crucial committees. We forego our freedom of thought for the comfort of being on the ‘right’ side. Patronising approach Dismissing the criticism of the censoring of the syllabus the University said, “The university subscribes to the idea that the literary content forming part of the text in a language course of study should contain materials which do not hurt the sentiments of any individual and is inclusive in nature to portray a true picture of our society, both past and present. Such an inclusive approach is important for the young minds who imbibe the teaching-learning emanating from the syllabus in letter and spirit. Therefore, the content of the syllabus depicts the idea of inclusiveness, diversity and harmony.” The patronising approach towards young minds aside, need one repeat that the role of the department of literatures is precisely this: to understand how emotions and sentiments are formed, to examine the claim of a sentiment to be universal, the question of whether the ‘subalterns can speak’, not only for themselves but for others too, and why the question of representation and voice is important? It is not enough to have space for the empathic and nationalist voice of Subramania Bharati. It is equally important to have the space for the assertive voices of Bama and Sukirtharani. The chairman of the committee is free not to look at things in terms of caste but he is not at liberty to erase the reality of castes. The removal of Draupadi and the refusal to have any text by Mahasweta Devi reveals the political bias of the committee. The story depicts the resistance of an Adivasi woman despite her being ravaged by the security forces, who confronts the ‘nation’ with the nudity of body. Obviously, it leaves the claim of the nation shamefaced. It is dismaying The department of English of Delhi University was one of the first to diversify and Indianise its syllabus by opening up to the writings from languages. In this process, it discovered many Indias, the silenced ones, those who are laying claim over this India, and exposed its students to them. It is sad that the process is now being reversed and that too by those who have no academic authority to do so. Even more dismaying is the fact that the larger academic community of the university watches this silently while this butchering takes place.

03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Hichilema’s herculean task||The new Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema’s landslide victory on August 12, in his sixth bid for high office, was a resounding rebuke against an unpopular rule. Mr. Hichilema, leader of the United Party for National Development (UPND), won by about a million votes more than his predecessor Edgar Lungu, of the Patriotic Front (PF), in an extremely polarised climate. Army patrols in major cities on the eve of voting; a cyber security law enacted months earlier, ostensibly to prevent the dissemination of fake news; a shutdown of social media platforms on election day; and intimidation of independent media only heightened apprehensions of a rigged election. In the event, the country witnessed a record turnout of over 70%. Contentious moves Mr. Lungu had set his sight on extending his rule. First, he ensured that he could sidestepthe legally stipulated two-term limit for a President. In December 2018, the constitutional court upheld Mr. Lungu’s eligibility to run in last month’s elections. It maintained that the latter’s ascent in the January 2015 by-election could not be construed as a full first term because he was chosen to serve the remainder of his deceased predecessor’s tenure. His second objective was to preclude the risk of losing in the event of a close contest. To this end, he devised a constitutional amendment last year to alter the two-stage election procedure. Under the proposal, if the candidate with the maximum vote failed to clear the 50%+1 ballot in the first round of polling, he would be authorised to explore a coalition government rather than face his closest rival in a run-off. The bill did not garner the requisite majority for a constitutional amendment. No less contentious than these two moves was the manipulation of voter records. The electoral commission deferred the complex exercise of compilation of new voter registers until just a year before the August 2021 polls. The delay triggered a legal challenge on grounds that this contravened the constitutional requirement for continuous registration between elections. As millions of voters were allowed little over a month to register in the midst of COVID-19 restrictions, civil society groups voiced concerns about the potential disenfranchisement of large numbers of citizens. Defying past practice, the authorities further refused an independent audit of the new rolls. The road ahead Mr. Hichilema, a business tycoon, embarks upon a difficult task of putting Zambia’s public finances in order. As his government negotiates a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he can count on the support of the country’s veteran economists and central bankers who have publicly advocated such a deal. Africa’s second largest producer of copper, Zambia last year defaulted on around $12 billion in external debt. The government benefited from a G-20 initiative on concessional terms of repayment on bilateral lending following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Private bondholders have, however, declined Lusaka’s plea to defer interest payments in the absence of an IMF rescue and reforms of its domestic finances. They also have concerns about all creditors being on an equal footing. Their concerns relate especially to the usually opaque terms that the Chinese investors enter into in their trading with African countries. While the economic priorities of the new government in Lusaka undoubtedly need urgent attention, there could possibly be no trade-off with the consolidation of political and civil liberties that have been a major casualty in recent years. The country was described as one of the fastest eroding democracies in the world, by the 2021 report of the Varieties of Democracy Project. The millions who voted Mr. Hichilema to office would be quite anxious to see that stain erased at the earliest. For the incumbent, that would be no small feat.

03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Noble intentions||As India ended its month-long presidency of the UN Security Council this week, the Government claimed a victory of sorts for chairing a session that resulted in the adoption of UNSC Resolution 2593, condemning terrorism and urging the Taliban to ensure human rights in Afghanistan. The Government has said that the resolution — sponsored by the U.S., the U.K. and France — addressed key Indian concerns, calling for the Taliban to ensure safe evacuations of Afghans wishing to leave and not allowing Afghan soil to be used for terrorist activity. The passage of the resolution was timely, practically coinciding with the exit of the last U.S. troops from Kabul, and the Taliban’s declaration of complete victory. It also followed on three discussions held under India’s chairmanship that have set out the expectations from the new regime in Afghanistan: the importance of upholding rights; to push for an inclusive, negotiated political settlement for government, and condemning all acts of terror, including the recent attack on Kabul airport; preventing any future attacks, and combating of the presence of UN-designated entities. However, the resolution did not contain any consequential language that would give the UNSC’s stated intentions any real teeth, and appears to accept the Taliban regime as the default force in Afghanistan. While it is very early to consider more punitive action against the Taliban for violating their commitments by using the UN Charter’s “Chapter 7” mandate, that empowers the UNSC to maintain peace, it is disappointing that the India-chaired resolution does not contain language that would hold the new regime more accountable. The watered-down language was probably on account of severe opposition from Russia and China, who later decided to abstain. This divide in the P-5 nations will only prove to be counterproductive if the UNSC wants to remain “seized” of the situation, as the resolution affirms. It is hoped that the UN system acknowledges the powerful leverage it has in Afghanistan’s future and actualises all mechanisms in its mandate to monitor the progress of government formation. A major tool is the India-chaired 1988 (Taliban) Sanctions Committee, due to meet soon, which needs to ensure that no designated leader of the Taliban and their associates are given recourse to funds, arms or travel permission unless they show a commitment to international principles. The renewal, on September 17, of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan’s mandate is another lever. As a concerned neighbour of Afghanistan, one that could be drastically affected by an uptick in terrorism there, and a believer in the UN-led multilateral order, India still has a role in Afghan’s future. While it has decided to embark on talks with the Taliban in Doha, it must continue to play that role on the world stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/noble-intentions/article36264451.ece
03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Breakthrough challenge||With over 66 crore vaccines administered since the vaccination drive commenced in January, India has now inoculated at least half its adult population with at least one dose, and 16% with two. There is a small, discernible rise in the number of new infections. Kerala, which contributes the bulk of infections, also has among the highest proportions of the population who are double vaccinated. This apparent paradox underlies concerns about the rise in ‘breakthrough infections’, or confirmed infections in those who took the second dose at least two weeks earlier. A recent study by CSIR scientists found that nearly a quarter of 600 fully vaccinated care workers were reinfected. Earlier studies from the CMC Vellore, and PGIMER, Chandigarh, too have reported between 1%-10% of fully vaccinated health-care workers as having been infected. However, less than 5% of them have required hospitalisation and no deaths have been confirmed, indicating the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe sickness and death. Internationally too, the trend is clear. Israel and the U.S. in spite of high vaccination coverage, continue to report new cases; though here too, the infection rate is much higher in the unvaccinated. The prime suspects, internationally as well as in India, is the preponderance of the Delta variants and related sub-lineages that are believed to form the bulk of coronavirus infections. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) that tracks mutations in coronavirus strains has said that the breakthrough infections reported so far are within “expected” numbers. That is, vaccines in large, controlled clinical trials had demonstrated 70%-90% efficacy but lost considerable ability to reduce symptomatic infections when confronted with the Delta variants, and so a certain fraction of those fully vaccinated would continue to be vulnerable. While it is a fact of evolution that viruses would mutate to be able to avoid antibodies, and vaccines, therefore, would have to keep being upgraded, it seems that the moment appears to have come too soon. A country like India, in spite of being a major vaccine producer in the pre-pandemic era, has only now managed to get production lines to deliver one crore vaccines a day. While other vaccines are in the pipeline, all of them are designed on the Wuhan-virus platform and although companies claim that the strength of m-RNA and DNA-based vaccine platforms lies in the ability to quickly tweak them to accommodate new variants, there are no reports yet, anywhere in the world, of vaccine makers specifying a timeline for vaccines that are tuned to the Delta variants. Vaccine makers who may have got emergency-use authorisations but are a while away from launch, should ideally move to making vaccines for the Delta variants and not rely on their existing pipeline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/breakthrough-challenge/article36264452.ece
03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Population decline in Europe||Strasbourg, September 2: You may not have noticed it the last time you elbowed your way down the Via Veneto or tried to find a parking space in downtown Paris, but Europe is becoming emptier. That is what population study experts, known as demographers, from nearly 30 countries gathered for an eight-day conference were told yesterday. Although it may be an exaggeration to think of Europe as a ghost continent, experts said the ramifications of under-population should be taken seriously. The Director of the French Institute of Demographic Studies, Mr. Georges Bourgeois-Pichet, told his colleagues that some nations, namely West Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal, were proving incapable of maintaining present population levels. He said the replacement of their future generations was uncertain. Mr. Bourgeois-Pichet offered statistics showing that the European birth rate had been declining since 1965. In the Soviet Union the drop began in 1958, and in Portugal and Holland it started in 1963, he said. Other population experts said that from 1920 to 1960 the world population increased 60 per cent while that of Europe lagged with 31 per cent. Europe would account for an estimated 42 per cent of the population of developed nations by the year 2,000 whereas it now contained more than 53 per cent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/population-decline-in-europe/article36264461.ece
03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Lack of GST details stumps economists||GST collections have crossed Rs. 1 lakh crore in 11 of the last 12 months, with the government attributing the trend to a rapid economic recovery and improved compliance levels, but economists are unable to analyse these tax numbers as critical data points are no longer shared by the government. Until December 2020, when monthly GST collections were released, the official statement from the Finance Ministry usually included details of the number of GSTR 3B returns filed by taxpayers and a State-wise break-up of revenues. State-wise revenue trends have been shared for only four of the eight months since then — February, March, July and August. The last month for which the government shared the number of GSTR 3B returns filed was January. The return is a summary of a firm’s GST liabilities for each month. “With the current details available for GST, there cannot be any kind of analysis except to say the revenues went up or down,” said a professor at a major Delhi-based economic research institute, requesting anonymity. GST now accounts for 65% of States’ own tax revenue, he pointed out. The chief economist at a rating agency, who also asked not to be named, said it was difficult to tell how much of the GST kitty could be ascribed to better compliance and how much to rising economic activity. “Continuous improvements in compliance levels are a major factor according to the government itself. Ideally, we should have the information on compliance so as to assess trends better,” the economist observed. ‘Concern for States’ Kerala’s Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal said the lack of transparency around GST data was a concern for States. “Transparency is critical even for States to know the situation on the ground. If a transparent attitude is not there... States will lose not only their rights, but they could lose financially as well if they are not able to check the situation,” he said. In January, when GST collections hit a record of Rs. 1.2 lakh crore, the total GSTR 3B returns filed were 90 lakh as per the Ministry. But that number hasn’t been released ever since. “After the sharp uptick in January, the government has stopped disclosing compliance levels, but the Finance Minister’s statement talks about a 40%+ increase in the GST tax base to 12.8 million since then,” JM Financial analysts Aishwarya Sonker, Dhananjay Sinha and Arshad Perwez wrote in a note on GST collections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/lack-of-gst-details-stumps-economists/article36264447.ece
03 September 2021||MUMBAI,||Govt. focus on infrastructure, exports to propel growth: UBS||The government’s push to boost capital expenditure, especially on infrastructure, combined with its focus on manufacturing and exports could prove to be the next set of growth drivers, UBS Securities said in a report. “We maintain our base case estimate of India’s real GDP growth at 8.9% YoY in FY22 (consensus: 9.2%),” Tanvee Gupta Jain, chief India economist, UBS Securities, said in a statement. “In our view, the government’s push towards boosting capex, especially on infrastructure, focus on manufacturing and exports could be the next growth drivers. Our Activity Indicator suggests economic activity rebounded in the September quarter,” she added. In the near term, growth is expected to gain momentum between October and March on cyclical tailwinds including pent-up demand, largely led by contact-intensive services, especially after more people are vaccinated, as per the securities firm. Besides, favourable external demand would aid growth. UBS Securities said the formal sector seemed to have gained market share during the pandemic period while the unorganised / informal economy had suffered; this had not been adequately captured in the GDP numbers at the current juncture, it added. “The scarring caused by the pandemic has adversely affected employment and income levels of workers in the informal sector (largely in non-agriculture in rural areas and high-contact services in urban areas),” UBS Securities said in the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-focus-on-infrastructure-exports-to-propel-growth-ubs/article36264437.ece
03 September 2021||MUMBAI,||UKIBC urges tariff cuts ahead of free-trade negotiations||The U.K. India Business Council (UKIBC) said it had presented its pre-Free Trade Agreement (FTA) submission to the island nation’s Department for International Trade with recommendations to the U.K. government. FTA negotiations are scheduled to begin this year. ‘Inputs from 200 firms’ The council said the submission captures inputs from about 200 companies from all parts of the U.K., representing sectors such as digital and data, food and drink, life sciences and healthcare, insurance and financial services, higher education, defence and aerospace, and energy. It has recommended that the negotiations should focus on reducing tariffs, including on alcoholic spirits and medical devices; reducing non-tariff barriers to goods trade, such as by aligning standards, simplifying burdensome and costly customs procedures, and ensuring tax parity between U.K. and Indian businesses. The council has also recommended that the governments sign a series of interim or mini agreements that will, over time, form a fully comprehensive FTA. “The announcement and signing of the Enhanced Trade Partnership between India and the U.K. in May represented the culmination of much effort and engagement between the two governments,” UKIBC Chair Richard Heald said in a statement. “The launch of the process into a FTA between the two nations is moving on apace as evidenced by the end of the consultation period today,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ukibc-urges-tariff-cuts-ahead-of-free-trade-negotiations/article36264443.ece
03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Chip paucity hurting car sales, not tepid demand’||India’s economic growth is facing challenges not due to lack of demand, but because of supply constraints, a senior Finance Ministry official said, asserting car sales were down not because people didn’t want to buy cars but because of the chip shortage that was hampering output at carmakers. Taking on economists and ‘Nobel laureates’ for urging India to spur demand to revive the economy, Principal Economic Adviser to the Finance Ministry Sanjeev Sanyal said there was no point pumping up demand by endowing ‘helicopter money’ on people if the supply side was unable to respond. “The biggest problems that we are now facing in economic expansion, at least in India, is not lack of demand. It is in fact, that we have run out of chips for our automobile industry, it’s not that people don’t want to buy cars, we can’t produce them because we can’t procure chips,” Mr. Sanyal said in an interaction with Elara Capital chief economist Garima Kapoor, on Thursday. “Similarly, there is enormous demand for our exports… we are seeing record exports. But the lack of containers and ships is constraining us,” he said, stressing on the government’s focus on supply-side interventions. Mr. Sanyal said India’s macroeconomic situation was in good shape to scale up growth very rapidly. “This year, we are likely to see double-digit growth. But I think we will see possibly double-digit growth even in 2022,” he said. Anticipating strong growth in the July-September quarter after the 20.1% GDP growth in the first quarter, the former banker said some sectors involving personal services were still under lockdown and would be opened up. “Wherever we have opened up, we have found demand coming back very strong. So even in areas like tourism, restaurants, which we had restricted till recently, wherever restrictions are even mildly removed, we see demand coming back.” ‘Direct tax overhaul’ Terming an overhaul of India’s direct taxes as the only major structural economic reform that remained to be done, Mr. Sanyal also said the government would now focus on administrative reforms of the bureaucracy and judiciary as enforcement of contracts remained an area of concern. He also indicated the government may tweak some of the provisions around the three agriculture laws that are facing protests. “We have a supply-side approach to most of the reforms we are doing, including the ones which we have faced political opposition over, like the farm sector reforms... we may need to make some adjustments in order to make it politically palatable in the 1-2 States where there is opposition, but nevertheless, we remain committed to the general direction,” he underlined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/chip-paucity-hurting-car-sales-not-tepid-demand/article36264445.ece

While the 24-year-old Pukhraj shot the best round of his professional career, 25-year-old Manu continued his impressive run having already posted five top-10s in the season. The duo was one shot ahead of Mysuru’s Yashas Chandra (65). Pukhraj’s younger brother Digraj, who had an eagle-two on the 14th during his round, was tied for fourth with a 66 along with Noida’s Amardeep Malik.  Pukhraj, who turned professional in 2018, reaped the benefits of some terrific ball-striking as he bagged three birdies on the first six holes. He then had a quiet stretch till the 14th before going on a birdie blitz on the last four holes to end up with a bogey-free 64. After being in the bunker on the 17th, Pukhraj salvaged a birdie with a quality up and down. On the 18th too, he managed to pick up a birdie from a tough spot as he chipped-in after hitting his approach over the green. Manu, who started from the 10th, was slow off the blocks, collecting two birdies and a bogey on the back-nine, but then turned it on with six birdies on the front-nine. He sank a 22-footer on the third and made exceptional chip-putt birdies after hitting it over the green on the sixth and eighth. Mane in poor way PGTI Order of Merit leader, Chandigarh’s Karandeep Kochhar, and the 2019 champion Chikkarangappa of Bengaluru were tied sixth with a 67.

Shardul made 57, including a fifty in just 31 balls — the fastest in terms of balls faced in a Test in England — as he revived India from 117/6 to a total of 191 all out after the team had lost the toss in overcast, bowler-friendly conditions. Prize wicket Jasprit Bumrah then removed both the hosts’ openers in the same over before Umesh Yadav captured the prize wicket of England captain Joe Root for 21 after the star batsman, now top of the world rankings, had made hundreds in the first three Tests of a five-match series all square at 1-1. At stumps, England was 53/3, a deficit of 138 runs, with Dawid Malan 26 not out and nightwatchman Craig Overton on one. Shardul’s innings surpassed England great Ian Botham’s 32-ball fifty against New Zealand, also at the Oval, in 1986 as the quickest in a Test in England. India captain Virat Kohli, who made exactly 50, was the only other India batsman to pass 17. England all-rounder Chris Woakes, playing his first Test in over a year because of injuries and Covid complications, took 4/55 in 15 overs. But the Warwickshire paceman, who replaced left-arm swing bowler Sam Curran, would have had even better figures had not two catches been dropped off his bowling. England, having seen its openers share a welcome century during last week’s innings and 76-run win in the third Test at Headingley, then found itself 6-2 in four overs. Bumrah had Rory Burns playing on for five on the Surrey left-hander’s home ground and four balls later he had Hameed, trying to get off the mark with a flamboyant square-cut, caught behind for a duck. It was not long, however, before Root hit two fours in three balls off Umesh Yadav — a leg-side clip followed by a stylish late cut. But Umesh had his revenge when he bowled Root between bat and pad with a ball that seamed in off the pitch.  Earlier, first-change Woakes struck with his sixth ball Thursday when Rohit Sharma (11) fended a steeply rising delivery to Jonny Bairstow, back keeping wicket after Jos Buttler missed this match due to paternity leave. Cheteshwar Pujara, the promoted Ravindra Jadeja and the struggling Ajinkya Rahane were all caught behind the wicket cheaply as they failed to deal with the moving ball.  England 53/3 Jasprit Bumrah’s dismissals of the two openers and Umesh Yadav's key wicket of Joe Root was the highlight as India pegged England at 53 for 3 at the end of the day’s play.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/woakes-robinson-strike-as-india-gets-bowled-out-for-191/article36264696.ece
03 September 2021||NEW YORK,||Barty and Bencic advance as NY recovers from a storm||Stefanos Tsitsipas took a trademark long bathroom break then credited it for advancing to the third round of the U.S. Open on Wednesday as a storm lashing New York forced the suspension of an indoor match. The 23-year-old Greek third seed was booed after taking more than eight minutes between the third and fourth sets but dominated after his extended toilet trip to flush Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-0 at Arthur Ashe Stadium. “I think taking a break and going to change — I was completely wet — I was refreshed,” Tsitsipas said when asked about the key to sweeping the final set in 30 minutes. “I was much more able to deliver good tennis in the fourth set. I was able to stay resilient on each and every point.” Tsitsipas, who matched his deepest US Open run, has been ridiculed by Andy Murray and Alexander Zverev for extended bathroom breaks seen as gamesmanship. The French Open runner-up fired a career-high 27 aces, five more than his previous best, in winning his ATP-best 50th match of the year. Wet weather affects play High winds and water drenched the grounds and wind-blown rain entered through upper corner openings under the closed roof of Louis Armstrong Stadium to suspend a second-round match between South African Kevin Anderson and Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman. Remnants of deadly Hurricane Ida would shut down the covered court after twice interrupting the match, with the National Weather Service issuing a tornado and flash flood warnings for the area. Anderson and Schwartzman resumed in Ashe after Tsitsipas’s victory, with the South American winning 7-6(4), 6-3, 6-4. Russian second seed Daniil Medvedev breezed past Germany’s Dominik Koepfer 6-4, 6-1, 6-2. In the women’s section, Sloane Stephens, the 2017 winner, beat 21st seed Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2 in an all-American showdown. Two-time Grand Slam winners Victoria Azarenka and Garbine Muguruza booked a third-round showdown. Spanish ninth seed Muguruza, the 2016 French Open and 2017 Wimbledon winner, beat Andrea Petkovic 6-4, 6-2, taking her first win in four tries against the German. She will next face two-time Australian Open champion and three-time U.S. Open runner-up Azarenka, the 18th seed from Belarus who defeated Italy’s Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 7-6(1). Azarenka and Muguruza have split four career meetings. Romanian 12th seed Simona Halep, a two-time Major champion, beat Slovakian Kristina Kucova 6-3, 6-1 for her deepest U.S. Open run since 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tsitsipas-rolls-on-after-another-long-toilet-break/article36264701.ece
03 September 2021||TOKYO,||Canoeist Prachi Yadav makes the semifinals||Prachi Yadav qualified for the semifinals of the canoe sprint event in women’s Va’a single 200m in the Tokyo Paralympics on Thursday. The 26-year-old recorded a time of 1:11.098s to finish fourth in class VL2 heat 1 at the Sea Forest Waterway. Prachi, who has paralysis below her waist, has competed in para swimming at the National level as well but took up canoeing on the recommendation of her coach Virender Kumar. World No.1 Pramod Bhagat sailed into the men’s singles semifinals, after beating Ukraine’s Oleksandr Chyrkov 21-12, 21-9 in his group A match of the Class SL3 badminton event on Thursday. Other Indian shuttlers, including Suhas Yathiraj, Tarun Dhillon and Krishna Nagar also had a good day as they opened their men’s singles campaign impressively. Easy wins While Suhas and Tarun notched up easy victories over Germany’s Jan Niklas Pott (21-9, 21-3) and Thailand’s Siripong Teamarrom (21-7, 21-13) in SL4 class respectively, second seed Krishna outwitted Malaysia’s Taresoh Didin 22-20 21-10 in the SH6 class. Young Palak Kohli overcame Turkey’s Zehra Baglar 21-12 21-18 in her second women’s singles match of SU5 group A. In SL classification, persons with standing/lower limb impairment/severe are allowed to compete, while SU refers to athletes with upper limb impairment. Earlier in the day, 19-year-old Palak and Parul Parmar went down 7-21, 5-21 to China’s Cheng Hefang and Ma Huihui in a Group B women’s doubles SL3-SU5 class match. Parul, who competes in SL3 class, was no match for China’s Cheng Hefang, lost to 8-21, 2-21 in singles and then to Germany’s Katrin Seibert 21-23, 21-19, 15-21. In athletics, Arvind ended seventh in the men’s shot put F35 event with a best effort of 13.48m. Uzbekistan’s Khusniddin Norbekov produced a season-best 16.13m to take gold. The F30 classes are for athletes with coordination impairment (involuntary movements, uncoordinated movements and/or muscle tension) often due to cerebral palsy or brain injury. In F35 category, athletes compete in standing position.  Tragedy for Aruna Aruna Tanwar was forced to withdraw from the repechage round of the women’s taekwondo K44-49kg class because of injuries sustained during her opening bout despite which she fought in the quarterfinals. Aruna beat fifth seed Danijela Jovanovic of Serbia 29-9 in the opening round before losing to Espinoza Carranza of Peru 84-21 in the quarterfinals. K44 classification is for those who have undergone unilateral arm amputation (or equivalent loss of function), or loss of toes which impacts the ability to lift the heel properly. Shooter Rahul Jakhar signed off fifth in the P3 mixed 25m pistol SH1 event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/canoeist-prachi-yadav-makes-the-semifinals/article36264698.ece
03 September 2021||Brussels,||Hassan headlines a classy field||Sifan Hassan, who won two gold medals and a bronze in an unprecedented effort at a distance treble at the Tokyo Olympics, heads a talent-loaded field at the penultimate meeting of the 2021 Diamond League series here on Friday. In the last event before the two-day Diamond League finals in Zurich on September 8 and 9, the men’s 100m featuring Tokyo silver medallist Fred Kerley of the USA will also be a highlight. Kerley will be up against compatriots Trayvon Bromell, Michael Norman and Ronnie Baker, along with Canada’s 200m Olympic champion Andre De Grasse. Kerley, fresh from a personal best of 19.79 seconds in the 200m in Paris last week, said: “I’ve got a lot of confidence in my current form and want to show what I’ve got in the upcoming weeks. My goal is very clear, I want to be the fastest man in the 100m, 200m and the 400m.” Hassan will race the mile at the King Baudouin Stadium, a venue she knows well, having broken the one-hour World record there last year. The Ethiopia-born Dutch runner is also the World record holder in the mile and, given her sparkling form, it would take a brave person to bet against her winning once again. The women’s 200m is packed full of quality, with Tokyo bronze medallist Shericka Jackson, Olympic finalist Marie-Josee Ta Lou and a handful of sprinters who have a point to prove after the Olympics disappointment this summer.  I want to be the fastest man in the 100m, 200m and the 400m — Kerley   Kerley joined an exclusive club of sprinters this year who have broken 10s in the 100m, 20s in the 200m and 44s in the 400m Only Michael Norman and Wayde van Niekerk have achieved this feat||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hassan-headlines-a-classy-field/article36265396.ece
03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Arif leads the pack with fine show||Mohammed Arif came up with a fine performance to top the table with 69 points after four rounds of champions league in the Indian online carrom challenge organised by the All India Carrom Federation (AICF).

Arif was followed by Abdul Rahman (83), Riyaz Akbar Ali (102) and Vikas Dharia (103) into the knockout stage. Yogesh Dhongade (104) and the champion of the last Indian online challenge Mohd. Ghufran (105) narrowly missed qualifying for the semifinals. Lagging behind The reigning world champion Prashant More was 14th with 151 points while the former world champion Yogesh Pardeshi placed eighth with 135 points. In the women’s section, Rashmi Kumari continued to assert her supremacy as she topped the field with 137 cumulative points after four rounds of Champions league. Even though it was the reigning world champion S. Appoorwa who had the best score in the fourth round with 39, she was second to Rashmi overall with a difference of 28 points. Appoorwa had the distinction of scoring a white slam on the second board in the fourth round. Rashmi was the only other player in the women’s field to record a white slam. Missing out Nidhi Gupta (172) and S. Shainy (175) were the others to enter the knock-out stage, while the champion of the last world online challenge, Naga Jothi missed out on qualification by two points.

03 September 2021||MUMBAI,||Oman clinches a nail-biting thriller||Mumbai’s youngsters could not end their tour to Oman on a winning note, with the home team snatching the nail-biting third one-dayer after K. Kaleemullah’s last-ball six off Aman Khan. With Mumbai having won the first two one-dayers after conceding the T20 series, Shams Mulani and Co. were keen on a clean-sweep in the one-dayers. Oman was 227 for six after 49 overs chasing 240, leaving Mumbai within touching distance of a clean sweep. However, the last over in Muscat turned out to be dramatic with 17 runs scored and two wickets falling at the very end. The last over started with Sandeep Goud being run out while attempting a second run. This was a second run-out in as many balls after Ayaan Khan’s vigil (91, 135b, 8x4) came to an end off the last ball of the 49th over in similar fashion. N. Dhamba then scored a boundary but perished off the third ball he faced. With eight required off two balls, B. Khan scored a four while Aman faltered with a wide that conceded two runs and a change in strike. Kaleemullah, facing his first ball, had to score two off the last ball. The tailender tonked a six off to give the home team a reason to smile. Earlier in the day, opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (90, 116b, 6x4, 3x6) and captain Mulani’s (55, 66b, 2x4, 3x6) 111-run partnership for the fourth wicket helped Mumbai from a precarious 26 for three. Aman’s flurry at the end (31, 19b, 3x4, 2x6) took Mumbai to 239 before being bowled out in the 49th over. In the end, it wasn’t enough for Mumbai.  The scores: Mumbai 239 in 48.2 overs (Yashasvi Jaiswal 90, Shams Mulani 55, Aman Khan 31) lost to Oman 244/8 in 50 overs (Ayaan Khan 91, Mohammad Nadeem 55) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/oman-clinches-a-nail-biting-thriller/article36265397.ece

03 September 2021||KOCHI,||Vimal impressed with Kiran’s rise||Five years ago, when he won the silver at the under-17 Asians in Indonesia, Kiran George appeared to be in a hurry to climb the men’s ladder in Indian badminton quickly. He was just 16 then but he did not want to spend much time on the junior circuit. Kiran is now just below the top-100 in the men’s world rankings but is showing the country where he actually belongs. The 21-year-old topped the Badminton Association of India’s recent trials in Hyderabad to select the Indian team for this month’s Sudirman Cup and Thomas Cup in Denmark in October. Players ranked in the World’s top-20 were exempted. Still the trials, which raised many eyebrows and much noise, had some big names like Lakshya Sen (World No. 24), Sameer Verma (28) and H.S. Prannoy (30) in the men’s section. And Kiran defeated Sameer, Prannoy and Ajay Jayaram to finish on top. “This is one of the best years, I also defeated Mark Caljouw (World No. 23) in the Orleans Masters in France in March,” said Kiran in a chat with The Hindu from Bengaluru. He had shocked Prannoy in the same tournament. “Game-wise too, I’m playing a lot better, picking shots and attacking at the right time.” Former international Vimal Kumar, who coaches Kiran at the Prakash Padukone Academy, feels the youngster would be flying high in a couple of years. Improvement “I was very confident that he would be in the top-50 last year but there were no tournaments. He has definitely improved and I’m quite impressed. Kiran has to now play the Challenge and Tour 100 events and graduate to the big stage,” said Vimal. “I feel in the next one or two years he would get into the top-30. And he should start looking at playing Super Series and try to win. By 2024 when the Olympics come, he should try to make the best he can. The Olympic Gold Quest has been supporting him for the last seven years. He was just 12 when he came to us in Bengaluru and ever since then he has been here.” Kiran comes from a family of shuttle stars based in Kochi. His father George Thomas was a former National champion and his mother Preetha and brother Arun had also made a mark in the national circuit. That shows in his game. Deceptive strokes “Kiran has very good deceptive strokes and half smashes, he also has a good ‘tumble’ at the net. That’s why sometimes a lot of these players, like Sameer who depend on speed and power, get upset with Kiran’s game,” said Vimal. “Prannoy is also a very powerful, hard-hitter but Kiran manages him. But he needs to improve his strength.”  Game-wise, I’m playing a lot better, picking shots and attacking at the right time||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vimal-impressed-with-kirans-rise/article36264753.ece
03 September 2021||Paris,||Ronaldo surmounts another peak||Cristiano Ronaldo became the all-time top scorer in men’s international football with two late goals as Portugal beat the Republic of Ireland 2-1, while holder France drew 1-1 with Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2022 World Cup qualifying on Wednesday. Ronaldo had an early penalty saved by teenage goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu in Faro before Ireland took the lead on the stroke of half-time. John Egan’s glancing header put Stephen Kenny’s side on course for a famous win, but Ronaldo broke Irish hearts with an 89th-minute equaliser that took him past Iranian Ali Daei’s record of 109. The 36-year-old Ronaldo then snatched all three points for Portugal in the sixth minute of injury time, rising highest to power in a header from Joao Mario’s right-wing cross. Portugal sits top of Group A with 10 points from four matches, although Serbia is only three points behind with a game in hand. France fell behind in Strasbourg when Edin Dzeko rifled in a low drive from 20 yards. Antoine Griezmann equalised when Dzeko’s header at a corner struck the France forward and bounced just over the line. Erling Haaland scored his first World Cup qualifying goal in Norway’s 1-1 draw against the Netherlands in Oslo. Haaland’s scrappy finish gave Norway the lead on 20 minutes, but Davy Klaassen levelled before the break as Louis van Gaal began his third stint in charge of the Dutch national team. Croatia drew 0-0 away to Russia and remains above its opponents on goal difference as leader of Group H. Slovakia is a point behind after a 1-1 draw with Slovenia.

03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Shardul believes India can restrict England||India’s top-scorer Shardul Thakur feels the visitors can put up a good fight on the second day and restrict England to a low total in the first innings, especially after taking three wickets on day one. “Keeping England’s first innings total under control is key and they have already lost three wickets. (Their) in-form batsman (Joe) Root is out,” said Thakur, who made a quickfire 57 to help India get to 191. “I believe we have an amazing opportunity to restrict them to a low total, that will keep us in the game. The game will be neck-to-neck and is always won in the second innings,” he added. Speaking about his batting, Thakur said, “I really prepared well before the start of the series but missed the last two matches because of injury. But I made sure that I went to the nets and kept batting. Our batting coach and throwdown expert kept pushing me that I can score runs and gave me confidence. So on this day, it was a time to deliver.” Thakur also said the move to promote Ravindra Jadeja ahead of Ajinkya Rahane at number five was to have a left-handed batsman alongside skipper Virat Kohli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shardul-believes-india-can-restrict-england/article36264718.ece

Thapa scored for the Blue Tigers in the 60th minute after Anjan Bista gave the home team the lead in the 36th minute. The first half kicked off with India on the front foot, earning a corner with its first attack. Both sides battled it out for the opening goal and in the 36th minute, the hosts took the lead through Bista, who pounced on a loose pass in the Indian defence and put the ball in the back of the net. The Blue Tigers made a host of changes at the break, with Thapa and Sahal Abdul Samad coming into their midfield positions, and Seriton Fernandes and Rahim Ali being brought on as well – making their respective senior India debuts. At the hour mark, the Blue Tigers got the leveller through substitute Thapa, who showed great awareness to poke the ball home from close range.

Fernando, who made 118, put on key partnerships including a 97-run fourth-wicket stand with Charith Asalanka, who scored 72, after the hosts elected to bat at the start of the three-match series in Colombo. Maharaj bowls well South Africa spinner Keshav Maharaj returned figures of 2/30 from his 10 overs to check Sri Lanka’s run rate in the middle overs.

Lakshmanan (94), one of the country’s prominent sports administrators and a former sports officer of Southern Railway, passed away here on Tuesday, after a prolonged illness. He is survived by his wife, three daughters, and two sons. Lakshmanan, a 1500m National champion, accompanied the Indian athletics team for the 1968 Mexico Olympics as manager and held various positions in the Athletics Federation of India (it was earlier called Amateur Athletics Federation of India, AAFI), Indian Olympic Association (IOA), Tamil Nadu Olympic Association (TNOA), and Tamil Nadu Athletics Association (TNAA). Lakshmanan was the technical director for the 1982 Delhi Asian Games. He was also the vice-president of TNOA when he accompanied the state contingent as chef-de-mission in the National Games in 1989 & 2011. A qualified NIS (Patiala) athletics coach, Lakshmanan recruited a lot of sportspersons into Southern Railway, who went on to achieve laurels internationally.

03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||The Glass Palace travels to Sri Lanka||While crisscrossing the globe on diplomatic postings, there is one trusted companion Niluka Kadurugamuwa never forgets to take along — his books. The Sri Lankan foreign service officer does not stop with just reading them. He translates critically acclaimed fiction from around the world to Sinhala, the language spoken by a majority in the island nation. His latest work Veeduru Maligawa (by Colombo-based Sumitha Publishers) is a translation of the novel The Glass Palace , bringing its acclaimed author Amitav Ghosh to the Sinhala reader for the first time. Kadurugamuwa began translating the historical novel — over 500 pages long — in October 2020, at the height of the pandemic. He completed the task in July this year and the Sinhala version, which is more than 800 pages, is now ready for launch. It marks his first major translation of an Indian author, and coincides with his time in New Delhi, where he is currently the Deputy High Commissioner at the Sri Lankan mission. On why he chose Ghosh’s historical fiction published in 2000, Kadurugamuwa said it was the “mesmerising prose”. “I like all his work but this novel speaks to our shared histories. Ghosh captures the anti-colonial sentiment so powerfully. And that is something intertwined with all our stories, because we were all colonised in the past,” he says in a telephone interview. “The story spans generations and countries, covering South-East Asia, Burma and India… it is so well-researched and rich in context,” adds the 46-year-old diplomat. Growing up in Diyatalawa town in Badulla, located in Sri Lanka’s scenic hill country, Kadurugamuwa began reading Sinhala translations of European, American and Russian writing, mostly fiction. Soviet literature has for long had a dedicated readership in Sinhala, especially in Leftist circles. Later, Kadurugamuwa took a strong liking to Latin American literature, introduced to Sinhala readers by writer-activist Gamini Viyangoda. In his late teens, Kadurugamuwa attempted his first translation, with African-American author Richard Wright’s short story Silt . “I was so thrilled to see my translation in print, although it was heavily edited,” he says, chuckling at his writer’s scepticism of newspaper editors. He continued through his university days, sending translated short stories to newspapers and magazines. “They would pay some 500 rupees (LKR), and that was big money for a student in the mid-1990s.” Kadurugamuwa’s interest in world politics and languages led him to Masters’ degrees in International Affairs and Languages, and eventually to Sri Lanka’s foreign service in 2003. Despite a hectic career, marked by regular moves and busy days, his late evenings were invariably dedicated to a page or two of translation work. Over the years, he has translated Columbian writer Gabriel Garcia Márquez’s novel In Evil Hour , Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk’s The Red-haired Woman , Chilean writer Isabel Allende’s Island Beneath the Sea , American author Mario Puzo’s Six Graves To Munich , and fellow Sri Lankan writer Manel Abhayaratne’s novella Maya — in addition to several short stories — traversing genres such as crime, historical fiction and magic realism. His translations have been published mostly by Colombo-based Vidarshana Publishers until now. Kadurugamuwa’s translations sell at least 2,000, which is considered a good figure in the Sri Lankan market. The books are often priced a little over LKR 1,000 (roughly Rs. 366); The Glass Palace’ s translation will be priced at LKR 1,600. With long days, full of high-stakes bilateral meetings or discussions at UN forums, it cannot be easy to meet deadlines, even those set by him. “Oh, it is certainly not. In the case of The Glass Palace , I bought a copy in Bangkok about a decade ago, but never got to reading and translating it. Then I bought another copy when I was posted to New York, but still couldn’t do it. I brought it back to Colombo but never got to it. And then I bought a third copy when I was posted to New Delhi this time, and actually sat down with it,” says the writer-diplomat, who has won Sri Lanka’s State Literary Award for the best translation twice. In terms of style, Kadurugamuwa prefers literal translations. “I don’t drop anything from the original, I try to be as faithful as possible to the text. Of course, there are things you can’t translate quite literally, because the context could be vastly different. In those cases, I use footnotes. Veeduru Maligawa has about 110 footnotes.” Despite the effort and time that translation warrants, Kadurugamuwa revels in the exercise. “You get to inhabit another writer’s head, temporarily becoming that person while writing. It is a marvellous feeling!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-glass-palace-travels-to-sri-lanka/article36265055.ece
03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Silver chains that tinkle on||On a muggy afternoon, men in vests and lungis are busy at work at this nameless unit behind the Pallapatti Lake in Salem, assembling an ornament that the South Indian city has been famous for, for nearly a century: the silver kolusu or anklet. Artisans lay out varying lengths of silver wire that has already been cast in the ‘Khusbhoo’ pattern (named, like theidli, after the actress when she was at the peak of her popularity in the 1980s) and manually fix die-cut embellishments like flowers and enamel accents in a painstakingly slow process. Made of silver alloyed with copper, these ornaments come with tinkling bells attached. Mud from the road outside has been mixed with water to create a paste that is packed into iron trays, forming a non-reactive base that keeps all the tiny parts of the anklet from dislodging. Once done, the tray is sent to another worker who solders the pieces on each anklet, until it is ready for cleaning and polishing. “There are 30 steps to making an anklet, and each one goes to at least 10 places before it returns to the unit for the finishing stage,” says V. Suresh, who has been manufacturing the ornaments with his elder brother for the past 15 years in Salem. “One of the unique features about the Salem anklet is that except for a few stages, most of the manufacturing is still done by hand.” In the inner chambers of his home-cum-office, Suresh keeps rods of kachcha silver, made of melted down anklets that will be mixed with pure silver to manufacture a new batch of ornaments. Plastic bags of rasagolla (silver globules), screws and other accessories fill the small steel cupboard. With the recent easing of the lockdown, production is almost back to normal in this family-run business. Historic links Suresh is part of a cottage industry that is thought to employ up to 10 lakh people in and around the city. With nearly 60% of the anklets sold across India reportedly from Salem, the ornament has made the city one among the leading manufucturing hubs in India. In areas of the city like Shevapet and Sivathapuram, it is possible to see anklets in different stages of manufacture laid out in long lines, twinkling in the sunlight. Despite this, Salem’s kolusu industry does not have a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for its products. A lack of supportive documentation to prove the antiquity and uniqueness of the business in Salem is the main cause, say local history enthusiasts and jewellery industry players. “According to our research, silver anklet production in Salem has been supported by a community of traders who migrated from Saurashtra. They were initially into textiles, but when the industry became shaky due to restrictions imposed by the British, they moved into making silver anklets,” says A Anand Kumar, managing partner, ANS Guptha and Sons, a leading jeweller in the city. This demographic has changed in recent decades to include skilled artisans and sellers from a multicultural background. Anand Kumar is also a part of the local chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), and has been spearheading an initiative to get a GI tag for the Salem kolusu . In 2019, the brand’s ANS Dhivyam showroom got 20 anklet makers in the city to create a 127-feet long anklet, weighing five and a half kilograms and featuring five of Salem’s most popular patterns, within a month, for a special public display. “We did this mainly to give some pride to the artisans who are always in the shadows, compared to the retailers,” says Anand Kumar. “Even when you take images and statuary of 200 years ago, you will find the anklet, which was called the kaapu then. It may be in a slightly different form, but it would be a key way to identify the cultural and ethnic origins of a woman,” he adds. Among Salem’s unique designs is the thala kolusu , made for infants. The silver wire is wound in such a way that it loosens as the child grows, and can be used for up to four years. Impact of technology Technology and competition from mechanised production have affected Salem’s anklet industry in myriad ways. While social media has facilitated nationwide trade, a growing number of people are making ‘true copies’ of the original product. “North Indian manufacturers are putting up replicas of our designs on their Facebook pages, claiming it to be their product. A GI tag will help prevent this plagiarism,” says C Srianandarajan, secretary of Salem District Kolusu Manufacturers Kaivinai Sangam. The industry body, which has 300 anklet manufacturers on its rolls, hopes to get this heritage jewel given due recognition. “This is an industry that defines our city. We should do more to honour this ornament that has given Salem so much,” says Srianandarajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/silver-chains-that-tinkle-on/article36265056.ece
03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Shin Ha Ri says namaskaram||Nineteen-year-old Prathyusha G. credits her interest in everything K- to the Korean face masks she stumbled upon at a neighbourhood store. While K-beauty and fashion trends play seminal roles, K-pop — more specifically the boy band BTS — forms the core of her love. Then, Prathyusha discovered K-webtoons, Korean digital comics that are specifically fashioned for smartphones. Now, she collects digital episodes to binge-read over the holidays on her phone. Sixteen-year-old Subiksha, another loyal reader, says she enjoys Korean webtoons “way better” than Indian movies or TV shows. She got hooked in November 2020, and has not looked back since. Even as the Korean cultural wave or hallyu has gained momentum in the past few years, it was the lockdowns that led a rush of Indians to Korean comics. In the form of webtoons that are available in regional languages, they are more accessible than ever before. In India, Kross Comics pioneered the entry of this format to the Indian market through its app, on which are titles — sometimes episodic — that can be accessed for free.  Manhwa , as K-comics are commonly referred to in South Korea, came into existence as early as the 1920s when Korea was under Japanese occupation. An offshoot of cultural imitation, manhwa quickly became a cousin to the more popular Japanese cartoons and comics, manga . In India, manga has had a strong and loyal fan base for many years, while manhwa the newest entrant, is often accessed digitally. Within South Korea, the format of webtoons that took form in the early 2000s, are now part of a billion dollar market. A gradual boom “The hallyu started in the early 2000s in Japan, with Korean dramas becoming popular. Since then, K-dramas have been finding new audiences across China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan... In India, in particular, back in 2015 I was surprised to find that the wave had not started despite the glaring similarities in culture,” says Hyunwoo Thomas Kim, co-founder of Kross Comics, headquartered in Seoul. Around 2019, the scene changed. By then, BTS was also on its way to becoming a household name in India. “That’s when I realised that K-pop and K-drama are already here in a big way. What could be next? I started showing some of the digital comics to Indian friends and the interest was palpable. From a storytelling point of view, K-dramas and Korean webtoons are very similar,” says Kim. In December 2019, they rolled out about 100 titles and have been growing fast since. Now, with the pandemic, their app stands at over three million downloads. Some of them are also being adapted into K-dramas: Kross Comics’ webtoons, A Business Proposal is currently being made into a serialised drama which is expected to release in 2022. Similar to music and drama, webtoons also have a target audience of people between the ages of 15 and 24. Readership records show that 80% of the response is from a female audience. “It is very different from the comics that the Indian youth is used to, like Amar Chitra Katha for instance, which deals with mythology, superheroes and so on. We talk about love, dating, romance and just everyday life,” says Kim. Culturally, while Indians and Koreans in their mid-40s might be very different in their way of thinking, the Gen Z audience globally is similar in many ways. Kim says that their online social exposure is perhaps the reason for these similarities. More importantly, the webtoon format strikes an easy balance between visuals and text, with the latter mostly in the form of concise dialogues. Visualisation is episodic. Tap to read Author of the popular webtoon She Hates Me , Amadoji, 31, from Korea believes that webtoons resonate with the audience because of digital accessibility. “Many read webtoons as most people now own smartphones. I wasn’t expecting it [the global reaction] at all, because this work includes a lot of parodies and memes that are specifically used in Korea, and the main background itself is Korea.” Illustrations and colours also contribute to this attraction, especially when published in a serialised manner, says Endless ’ creator Kim-Yeon. “I start doodling without any plans. And when I encounter a character’s face that I like, I start attaching surrounding characters one by one by imagining their personality and background,” she says. Now with translations made available in regional Indian languages like Hindi and Telugu apart from English, they are slicing through a larger Indian demographic. “The response from Telugu readers has been good. So we are thinking of adding more southern languages. Our goal is to expand to at least 11 Indian languages in the next few years,” adds Kim. The average daily readership varies between 60,000 to 1,00,000, of which 70% reads in English, 25% in Hindi and 5% in Telugu. Twenty six-year-old Dhanashree Kodkani had never read a Korean comic until she began translating one to Telugu in September 2019. Now, she feels disheartened when a series she is translating, ends. Dhanashree recalls titles she started with: Que Sera Sera and The Reason Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke's Mansion . “As someone who has a habit of reading subtitles, it really gets me when a joke or a moment is lost in translation. Hence, I am extra careful when I do this ,” she says. With the pandemic, there is a shift in preferences too. In 2021, K-webtoons that revolve around positive and uplifting stories are seeing more takers. Young adults are finding these simple narratives in the webtoon format a welcome escape. “It is more convenient, doesn’t cost any money if I am willing to wait for new episodes and it doesn’t require me to go to a store,” says Subhiksha, adding “For students like me, it is ideal entertainment. Everything can happen right from my phone.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/shin-ha-ri-says-namaskaram/article36265057.ece

03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Step up and speak up||Twelve-year-old Aman was sitting in the empty classroom, his head on the desk, his cheeks wet with tears. He looked up as he felt a firm hand on his shoulder. Jacob Sir, his Maths teacher, was standing there. “What happened, son?” Aman stood up quickly. “N…nothing sir!” he stammered. “Then, why are you sitting in an empty classroom and crying? Is there anything wrong?” “Sir, I participated in the inter-class elocution competition today. I worked very hard. But, after a few sentences, my mind went blank. I stood there,gaping at the audience. Out of 14 contestants, I stood last. It was humiliating.” “How serious are you about becoming an effective speaker, Aman?” “I am desperate, sir.” “Okay, from tomorrow after lunch, we will meet in my room. I will help you.” “B…but sir…you?” “Why, a Maths teacher cannot teach the skills of public speaking?” Jacob Sir smiled and walked out. A new start Aman discovered quickly that Jacob sir was as much an expert in giving tips on debating, as he was in teaching algebra. “Aman, how did you prepare your speech?” “Sir, I asked Javed of Std. X to dictate the points and memorised them.” “Never do that. Even if you take someone’s help, write down the speech in your own words.Don’t memorise because if you forget a phrase or even a word, then, everything goes blank.” Aman nodded. “Public speaking is both a science and an art. The content of your speech is the science part. Your style, presentation, voice modulation and how you manage to mesmerise the audience is the art aspect.” This was the beginning of a fascinating series of sessions Aman had with Jacob sir, who illustrated his points with several examples from great orators, as well as his own successes and failures. After each session, he would give Aman an assignment. He was a taskmaster and did not tolerate even the slightest slip up. As the session progressed, Aman found his confidence growing. “Aman, this Sunday, I will be going to Ashiana, an old-age home, which is near your house. I want you to address the members on ‘The value of empathy’ .”  “Sir…b….but do you think I really can speak in front of senior citizens?” “You have no choice. We will meet at Ashiana at 11.00 a.m. sharp.” Aman had just two days to prepare. He worked hard, wrote and rewrote his speech half-a-dozen times and practised it front of the mirror just as Jacob sir had taught him. At five minutes to 11, when Aman entered Ashiana, he was led to a huge hall, which was full. Jacob sir was sitting in the front row. He saw Aman and said, “Don’t worry. This is no competition. You speak from your heart and forget about the rest.” Ten minutes later, Aman went to the podium. He was sure everyone could see his shaking legs. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and started. He stuttered a bit, paused thrice, stammered a few times, but didn’t stop. He finished to rousing applause. “Aman, the Rotary Club of Jayanagar is organising an open elocution competition for students from Std. VI to Std. XII. I have entered your name. It is this Saturday. This will be your toughest test yet.” Twist in the tale Aman’s jaw dropped. “Sir, do you think I am ready?” “I am not asking you to win the trophy. I only want you to do your best and enjoy yourself.” There were nine contestants. and the topic was ‘Artificial Intelligence: A boon and a bane’ . Aman prepared his points carefully and went through his speech a few times. Just as the competition was about to start, Jacob sir appeared and sat in the third row. Aman was the fifth speaker and thought he spoke quite well. But even he was surprised by the result: he was placed second. The first was a boy from the local club and the third was a girl whose face looked familiar. As Aman collected his trophy and went to Jacob Sir, he found the girl talking to him. “Congrats Aman, meet Sharon.” Seeing them together, the truth dawned on Aman. “Sir, is Sharon your daughter?” “Of course! Can’t you see the resemblance?” Sharon said, laughing. “But, sir, how could you train me to compete against Sharon?” “Son, I am not only a loving father, but also a committed teacher,” Jacob sir said, as he smiled and high-fived Aman.  I am not asking you to win. I only want you to do your best and enjoy yourself||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/step-up-and-speak-up/article36265318.ece

All hell broke loose when Bhuvan woke up the next morning. It was nine, and he was late for school. He stormed into the living room and found Aai busy stitching a face mask.“I am late for school. Why didn’t you wake me early?” “Your school is going to be closed for the next few months,” said Aai. Bhuvan put his hands in the air and danced around the house, before peeping through the living window facing the street. Stella was standing near the door and feeding her little sister, Mercy, a banana. “Have you heard the good news?” asked Bhuvan. “No school! We can get up late and play the entire day.” “There is no reason to be happy,” answered Stella with a straight face. “Didn’t you hear the news last night?” Unexpected “There is a new Corona virus, which has arrived in the country and is making people sick. We can’t visit each other’s houses or play together. Our city is under a lockdown.” Bhuvan frowned at the mention of the unfamiliar word. “Don’t think too much! Be happy, Stella! No school!” said Bhuvan, puffing his cheeks. Mercy started giggling. “Yes! I will be happy,” replied Stella. “My mother spoke to our teacher this morning. We will receive holiday homework through SMS. Isn’t that exciting?” Bhuvan’s smile turned into a scowl. He turned his attention to Baba cleaning his auto outside the house. “Can we go for a ride?” he asked. “No! We can’t leave the house until the lockdown is over!” said Baba. Aai interrupted them with two face masks. She tied one around Bhuvan’s face and gave another to Baba. “This is so uncomfortable,” said Bhuvan, pulling the mask down and gasping for breath. Aai laughed. “You will get used to it. Wear one when you step out of the house.” They entered the house and sat down to eat breakfast; a simple meal of roti and gravy with carrots. “What is a lockdown?” asked Bhuvan, pushing all the carrots to a corner of his plate. “Everyone has to stay inside their house!” “Will I fall sick too?” asked Bhuvan. “If you eat well, play and be happy, you will remain healthy,” replied Aai, pushing all the carrots back to the centre of his plate. “Stay away from sick people and wash your hands before you eat,” added Baba. “Do you know the old lady at the lace shop across the street?” Bhuvan nodded. “She caught the Corona virus and was admitted to the hospital last night! I hope she recovers soon,” said Aai. Bhuvan stopped eating and muttered to himself, “Who will feed Mrs. Miranda’s kittens?” To be continued||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/bhuvans-secret-freedom-from-school/article36265264.ece

03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Golden, yodelled ditty||Swashbuckling Rajesh Khanna in a scarlet sweatshirt. A speeding motorbike, skilfully navigating the traffic of Marine Drive. A serenading hero on the bike humming ‘Zindagi ek safar hai suhana, yahan kal kya ho kisne jana’ (Life is a joyful journey, who knows what tomorrow will bring). It is from Andaz , a Shammi Kapoor-Hema Malini starrer, which completes 50 years of its release. Khanna, the superstar, between 1969 and 1971, had delivered 17 hits in a row, and Andaz became one of them, although he only played a 15-minute cameo in the film.  Andaz had several distinct ‘firsts and lasts’. The film was Ramesh Sippy’s directorial debut, and the first major project for Salim-Javed, who went to become highly successful screenplay writers. Andaz also played a role in Shammi Kapoor’s comeback and was one of his last successes. High point in playback music However, the spotlight was, and remains, on the title song, ‘Zindagi ek safar hai suhana’. Penned by poet Hasrat Jaipuri, who went on to win that year’s Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist, the song remains a high point in Hindi playback music. Counted as numero uno of Kishore Kumar’s yodel numbers, it is the last song recorded by Jaikishen of Shankar-Jaikishen fame, before he died on September 12 the same year, ending a 22-year musical partnership. Shankar-Jaikishen used both Indian classical and Western music elements in their scores and never shied away from out-of-the-box ideas. By the time Jaiskishen passed away in 1971, they had recorded 104 songs for 19 films in that year alone. Among those, ‘Zindagi ek safar’ struck a unique chord with people, becoming a huge hit, more than the film itself, with Kishore Kumar’s yodelling becoming a phenomenon. Besides music and singing, Hasrat Jaipuri’s lyrics contributed immensely to its success, with lines like ‘Chand taron sey chalna hai aage, aasmanoh sey badna hai aage, piche rahe jayega yeh zamana’. Loosely translated, it means, ‘We forge ahead of the stars and moon, leaving this mundane world behind.’ It’s not known if Kumar suggested the yodelling to complement the experiential lyrics, or if it was the music composer duo who came up with the innovative idea to enhance the vocal effect. Believed to be a mode of traditional communication among the shepherds of the Alps in Central Europe, yodelling got a touch of refinement in the 19th century, emerging as a musical form in choirs. It then travelled worldwide, reaching India as well. Back home, Anoop Kumar, the second of the Ganguly brothers, had an ear for European folk music, and was thus familiar with yodelling. Kishore picked it up from his brother and mastered it in no time, and soon began to use it in his songs. ‘Panch rupaiya bara aana’, a popular song from the 1958 film Chalti Ka Naam Gadi , was his first successful attempt, and got him some attention. By the time ‘Zindagi ek safar’ came, it became Kumar’s signature style. Such was the song’s impact that Ramesh Sippy chose to use it thrice in the film, in three different situations and playback voices. It became a leitmotif binding the three main characters — for Sheetal (Hema Malini; sung by Asha Bhosle), it reminded her of her husband Raj (Rajesh Khanna; sung by Kishore Kumar), while for Ravi (Shammi Kapoor; sung by Mohammad Rafi) a widower, the song was a note of optimism.  The writer is a filmmaker and author, most recently of Banaras: Of Gods, Humans And Stories .   ‘Zindagi ek safar’ struck a unique chord with people, becoming a huge hit, more than the film itself, with Kishore Kumar’s yodelling becoming a phenomenon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/golden-yodelled-ditty/article36264639.ece
03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Echoes of the rhythm||Tabla exponent Subhankar Banerjee’s untimely death to post-COVID complications has left the music world shocked and deeply saddened. What brought Subhankar close to every music-loving person’s heart was his sensitive art of accompaniment, which brought him immense success within a short span of time. His exemplary tabla solos, versatility as a vocalist as well as composing prowess made him a complete artiste. The annual event that he organised under the aegis of his Kajalrekha Music Foundation in aid of the differently-abled showed his compassionate nature and the ability to reach out to all. The event was in memory of his mother, who had a physical disability due to polio. Gentle and ever smiling, Subhankar always made time to greet and meet people, which added to his popularity as a musician. His father, a government employee and amateur tabla player, introduced him to tabla while his mother inspired him to pursue music. Subhankar learnt the finer nuances of the art watching his vocalist-composer mother rehearse at home with other musicians. Long years of training His parents were delighted with his deep interest in music. When he was four, they sent him to their neighbour, Manik Das, who belonged to the Benaras gharana, to learn to play the tabla. Later, he came under the tutelage of Pandit Swapan Shiva of Farukkhabad gharana and trained for 25 years. Simultaneously, he also began to accompany the exponents of Bangla gaan. Banerjee once said, “So-called light music gave me a clear insight into the numerous shades of bols .” Soon, he got an opportunity to travel abroad with senior sitar artiste, Pandit Shalil Shankar. During this nine-month tour, he learnt many music lessons the hard way since the senior musician was a tough taskmaster. This exposure made him understand the requirements of each musician he accompanied. He also began to listen to archival records of tabla maestros, analysed their style, and picked up their unique compositions. It helped him give a different dimension to his solo concerts. He would openly acknowledge the influence of the great masters on his music. Subhankar took to composing to widen his repertoire as a teacher. He was also known to constantly improvise. He could transform each theka to match the compositions chosen by the musician he was accompanying. The same eight-and-half beat taal would sound different at each concert. The youngest top grade tabla player of AIR, Subhankar’s performances at Nobel Peace Prize concert, Festival of India in Brazil, Asian Fantasy Concert in Japan, and as part of the London Symphony Orchestra won rave reviews. His collaboration with well-known international musicians resulted in albums like ‘Tabla Tale’, ‘Heart Beat’, ‘Calcutta to California’, and many more. The Sacred Drums of India, his brainchild, became a successful rhythm band. More recently, his solo pieces during the tribute concert for Ustad Allarakha, featuring six top tabla players, won him great appreciation, including from Ustad Zakir Hussain. “Despite his hectic schedule, he would spend long hours teaching students at his Taalsen Music Academy,” says Surojato Roy, a senior disciple. “As a guru, he shared his musical treasures with us and handled each one of us with patience and care. Not just music, he imparted life lessons too.”     The writer is a music critic and musicologist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/echoes-of-the-rhythm/article36264660.ece
03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Watching Kalamandalam Gopi live again||When Kalamandalam Gopi appeared on the stage of the Sreebhadra auditorium in Thrissur after 18 months at home, there was huge excitement. The legendary Kathakali artiste, who hundreds throng to watch, went on to give a performance similar to a cholliyattam (enactment of excerpts without make-up and costume), and followed it up by staging select scenes from the play Kirmeeravadham, composed by Kottayathu Thampuran. Poignant portrayals Aptly titled ‘Bhavaprabhavam’ (splendour of expressions) Gopi presented emotionally charged scenes from various Kathakali plays beginning with ‘Ajithahare’, the famous padam of Kuchela addressing Krishna from Kuchelavrutham (Story of Kuchela). Although the Sastras do not list bhakti (devotion) as a rasa , it does enjoy a certain space in Kathakali plays. Gopi’s expressive face conveyed in full measure the import of the lines describing Krishna as one worshipped by Brahma and other Devas and as the charioteer of Arjuna. He later switched to Karna’s soliloquy from the relatively new Kathakali play Karnasapadham (Karna’s Pledge). Immediately preceding the Kurukshetra battle, sitting on the banks of the Ganga, Karna asks himself who he is. He wonders whether Radha and Adhiratha are his real parents. As one who has dexterously enacted the role several times, Gopi once again made the audience empathise with Karna’s emotional turmoil. The actor then moved on to two non-textual slokas (couplets); one detailing the beauty of Damayanti by King Nala in Nalacharitam Day II and the other a description of sights in the hermitage of the sage Sukra by Kacha in the play Kachadevayani . In the former, Gopi depicted with wisely deployed histrionics how Brahma created Damayanti by appropriating the most beautiful components from multiple sources to challenge the moon’s luminosity. The second piece was almost an adaptation of the Ashramavarnana (description of a hermitage) from the Koodiyattam play Subhadradhananjayam by King Kulaskehara. Here the actor as Kacha, the son of Brihaspati, the guru of the Devas, enters Sukra’s hermitage and is wonderstruck by the incredible sights: moths falling into the wildfire and rising up unscathed, camaraderie between an elephant and a lion, a panther and a deer, and a mongoose and a cobra. Gopi’s upaangaabhinaya (eyes, eyebrows, cheeks and lips) vividly illuminated these images. Gopi’s minimal movements and immaculate expressions made the last two pieces from Nalacharitam Day III unforgettable. These were ‘Vijane bata mahati’ depicting Bahuka’s agony over separation from his consort, Damayanti, who he had abandoned in the forest, and ‘Marimaankanni’, dealing with his nerve-racking reaction to the news of his wife getting married again.

03 September 2021||September 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Refreshing notes of Gaud Malhar||The distinguishing characteristics of a gharana emerge from the magical chemistry of many elements, especially the emotional and subliminal landscape that the musician has inherited and the intellectual assimilation of the nature of the raag. This realisation came to mind while listening to the sitar recital by Ustad Shujaat Khan, son and disciple of Ustad Vilayat Khan, the doyen of Etawa Imdadkhani gharana. Performing for ‘Transcendence,’ the HCL Mega Concert, Shujaat Khan opened with Gaud-Malhar, the melodious monsoon raag. The surprise element for listeners was in the way the raag was presented — quite in contrast to how it is rendered conventionally. His Gaud Malhar sounded like an introspective interpretation of the raag. “People think that Gaud Malhar is just putting a teevra (sharp) gandhar in place of the komal gandhar (a flat variant) in Miyan-Malhar, but what I have heard from my buzurgs (elders) has led me to explore newer facets of it within the confines of the grammar. This is the beauty of classical music, I enjoy the creativity and spontaneity it offers,” said Shujaat. Shujaat’s playing reminded one of how monsoon is not just about thundering clouds and lightning, but also about rim-jhim phuhaar (drizzle), which came through in his refreshing four notes ‘ga re ni sa’. Obviously such an approach to ‘raag-sangeet’ calls for a certain internalisation of the raag that is difficult to achieve. Shujaat Khan was able to create a monsoon ambience with a beautiful alap, jod and jhala, before presenting the composition in Teentaal. After this sumptuous main course, came Tilak Kamod and Khamaj as delicious desserts with a touch of folk to the popular Sufi compositions by Hazrat Amir Khusro, ‘Khusro baazi prem ki, piya ghar aaye’ and ‘Chhap tilak,’ encouraging the brilliant youngsters, Zuheb Ahmed and Shariq Mustafa, seated on either side, to take turns on the tabla. Tuneful notes  Shujaat’s tuneful singing interspersed with the notes of the sitar made one curious about his prowess as a vocalist. Ustad Vilayat Khan was initially a ‘ vocalist, who trained under his maternal grandfather Ustad Bande Hussain Khan and uncle Ustad Zinda Hussain Khan. “I consider it a blessing to have been guided by stalwarts such as Ustad Amir Khan and Pt. Bhimsen Joshi, who were dear friends of my father. They taught me many lovely compositions,” he says. “I learnt while driving Pt. Bhimsen Joshi around during a week-long tour of London or when we travelled together on train journeys. Those moments gave me precious insights,” says Shujaat. Referring to the concert’s title, ‘Transcendence’, Shujaat says, “I experience it when I sit with my instrument and the whole universe seems to disappear. It is about transcendence of the self, space and time, to a different zone, where you encounter the emotional and spiritual facets of music.”  The Delhi-based author writes on Hindustani music.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/refreshing-notes-of-gaud-malhar/article36264657.ece

03 September 2021||New Delhi,||Cannot register multiple FIRs for same crime, reiterates HC||No multiple FIRs can be registered for the same crime, the Delhi High Court has reiterated while quashing four but one first information report in a case of looting and setting on fire a compound during the north-east Delhi riots in February last year. “There can be no second FIR and no fresh investigation regarding the same cognisable offence or same occurrence giving rise to one or more cognisable offences,” Justice Subromonium Prasad remarked. The High Court’s order came while hearing a petition filed by accused Atir, who was facing prosecution in five FIRs lodged by Delhi Police. One of the complainants, had stated that a mob entered the compound of his house in Maujpur area, ransacked it and set it ablaze. A fire tender was called to douse the blaze. The complainant states the articles in the house valued at Rs. 7-Rs. 10 lakh was charred in the fire. The other complainants also made similar complaints. One family unit Atir’s counsel argued that all the five FIRs are in respect of one unit and filed by different members of the same family. The court noted, “All the above FIRs areidentical in their content and more or less a facsimile of one another and pertain to the same occurrence. They all pertain to one house where fire was started mischievously and spread to immediate neighbouring premises as well as floors of the same house”. “All the FIRs state that monetary loss was caused to each of the complainants residing in parts of the buildings in the same compound and in the immediate neighbourhood as their belongings and other valuables had been burnt down,” it added. “There might be discrepancy regarding the width of the passage within the same compound or the exact place where the fire was set, but both sides agree that it is within one compound,” the court said.  No separate incidents “It, therefore, cannot be said that there are five separate incidents and, therefore, five separate FIRs cannot be registered for the very same incident as it is contrary to the laws laid down by the Supreme Court,” Justice Prasad remarked while quashing four FIRs in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cannot-register-multiple-firs-for-same-crime-reiterates-hc/article36264908.ece
03 September 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Cong. stages protests against Karnal incident||Haryana Congress workers and leaders on Thursday staged demonstrations in several parts of the State against the recent baton charge on farmers in Karnal, accusing the BJP-led State government’s policies of being against farmers. In Karnal, the party’s state president Kumari Selja led the demonstration and said that the policies of the BJP and its alliance partner — the Jannayak Janta Party — has been exposed time and again for ignoring the interests of farmers. “The recent use of batons on farmers protesting in Haryana’s Karnal during a protest against BJP leaders is the latest example of the BJP-JJP’s insensitivity towards the farming community,” she said. She said the Congress had submitted a memorandum to the Governor, Bandaru Dattatreya, seeking action against the officials involved in the violence against farmers. Land Acquisition Bill “We also requested the Governor not to give his assent to the new Land Acquisition Bill passed in the Monsoon session and send it back to the Haryana Legislative Assembly for reconsideration under Article 200 of the Constitution. This Bill is anti-farmer, anti-poor and undemocratic,” she said. Ms. Selja, in a statement, said that after the Congress party’s complaint, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has sought a report within four weeks from the Deputy Commissioner and Superintendent of Police of Karnal regarding the baton charge on farmers on August 28. “The NHRC move is a welcome one. I am hopeful that this step will pave the way for justice to the farmers. I believe that the administration will submit the report to the NHRC after conducting a fair investigation and strict action will be taken against the guilty with immediate effect,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-stages-protests-against-karnal-incident/article36264889.ece

Dean of Social Welfare (DU) Rajeev Gupta, said: “We are currently working on the modalities after holding a meeting with principals and heads of departments.

03 September 2021||Patna,||Chapters on prominent leaders taken off Bihar varsity syllabus||The Bihar government on Thursday took serious note of the removal of chapters on veteran socialist leaders Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia from the Post Graduate political science syllabus of the JP University at Chhapra in Saran district. It sought an explanation from the varsity, ironically named after Jayaprakash Narayan. Other eminent figures whose names have been omitted from the syllabus include Dayanand Saraswati, Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. New additions include Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhayay, Subhas Chandra Bose and Jyotiba Phule. “The Vice-Chancellor and Registrar of the university have been asked to explain, and if there is no satisfactory response, they have to come to the State education department secretariat to explain the background,” Education Minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said. ‘CM surprised’ Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, he said, had expressed surprise and anguish and directed that the issue be resolved immediately. “The issue has been brought into the notice of the honourable Chancellor as well, who is currently outside the State,” the Minister said. He directed his department to gather information about changes made in the syllabus of other Universities in the State in recent days. “If anything improper and illegal is found, necessary corrective action will be taken,” he asserted. Earlier, students of the JP University had protested the changes and threatened to launch an agitation. The Vice-Chancellor of the University Faruque Ali, however, said the syllabus committee constituted by the Raj Bhawan had made the changes. It was Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad’s tweet on September 1 that brought the issue to light. “I had set up JP University 30 years ago in the name of Jayaprakash Narayan at my karmbhoomi. Now the RSS-backed Bihar government has removed the thoughts of great socialist leaders like JP and Lohia from the same University. This cannot be tolerated. The government must take immediate cognisance,” he had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/chapters-on-prominent-leaders-taken-off-bihar-varsity-syllabus/article36264885.ece
03 September 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Ruckus in Odisha Assembly||The second day of the Odisha Assembly’s monsoon session was washed away after Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress vociferously demanded immediate sacking of State Law Minister Pratap Jena, who was entangled in a murder case. BJP members rushed to well of the House as soon as the question hour began on Thursday. Waiving posters in front of Speaker’s podium, they demanded removal of Mr. Jena from Council of Ministers. Kulamani Baral, former chairperson of Mahanga block of Cuttack and BJP leader, and his associate Dibyasingh Baral were brutally hacked to death when they were returning to their village Nrutanga January this year. Ramakant Baral, son of deceased Kulamani Baral, had filed case in Mahanga Police Station against 13 persons including the minister alleging their involvement in the murder. On finding Minister’s name missing in the charge-sheet, he had moved court seeking a probe against Mr. Jena. Subsequently, Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC), Salipur ordered fresh probe against Mr. Jena after hearing a petition regarding dropping of minister’s name in the charge-sheet. Armed with the court direction, BJP members alleged Mr. Jena as a minister could influence investigation process. “An inspector in charge of police station cannotw probe against State’s Law Minister. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik must remove him from his Cabinet to pave the way for a fair investigation,” said BJP member Mohan Majhi. Probe sought Similarly, Debasish Patnaik, a Congress leader, demanded that the Minister be immediately removed from his position and an independent probe be ordered to find out real culprit in the murder case. Speaker Surjya Narayan Patro had to adjourn the House due to ruckus created to by Opposition members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ruckus-in-odisha-assembly/article36264887.ece
03 September 2021||New Delhi,||Injury sustained by gangster points to custodial death: HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday remarked that the nature of injury sustained by gangster Ankit Gujjar, who died inside Tihar jail last month, clearly shows that it was a case of custodial violence. “It is writ large that it is a case of custodial violence and who has done it is also very clear,” Justice Mukta Gupta said while reserving order on the petition by Gujjar’s family members for transfer of investigation into his alleged murder to the CBI. Extortion by officials The 29-year-old gangster was found dead and two others were injured inside his cell in Tihar jail on August 4. The family has alleged that Gujjar was being harassed by jail officials as he was “unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money” and was murdered “as part of pre-planned conspiracy”. Advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for the family, alleged that the police did not conduct the investigation properly. Mr. Pracha said the DVR of the CCTV installed in the jail has yet to be recovered and the aspect of extortion of money by jail officials through online transactions was not being looked into. “The status report filed before the Magistrate and the one filed here say that the injury is minor. The post-mortem shows 12 grievous injuries,” he said. The counsel for the prosecution said the deceased, who was found to be in possession of a mobile phone amongst other things, had attacked the Deputy Superintendent (DS) earlier in the day. The counsel said action has since been initiated against certain officials. “The issue is the moment a phone is recovered, your [jail] officer is asking for money...It is far more serious. What has happened to the deceased must have happened to others also,” the High Court said. “He may have committed an offence [but] this man [jail official] not only beats him up but also gets CCTV closed...A life has been lost. Twelve injuries show it is a case of custodial torture,” the court remarked. The jail administration, in its report, said four officials, including the Deputy Superintendent, have been suspended and eight others have been shifted from Central Jail No.3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/injury-sustained-by-gangster-points-to-custodial-death-hc/article36264893.ece
03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||TOD highlighted in draft regional plan 2041||As a part of urban regeneration, Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and planned housing along TOD corridors have been highlighted in the draft Regional Plan-2041 for the National Capital Region. The TOD policy, which proposes to have residential, commercial, civic and institutional establishments in close proximity, also features prominently in the draft Master Plan for Delhi-2041. Apart from enhanced walkability and last-mile connectivity through a higher dependence on public transport and multi-modal integration, the development of strategic transit nodes has also been proposed. ‘Unique character’ The need for new towns to be planned and designed in tandem with technology to bring “convenience and nature closer to residents,” and taking into consideration “unique character of local neighbourhoods” are a part of the draft plan. According to the TOD policy, the nodes will comprise sites such as vacant or underutilised government lands, government housing, commercial centres, industrial centres and so on. A strategic location, either economic or cultural hub for the city, will also be factored in. “Joint ventures for station area development or development of multi-modal transit hubs may be considered between multiple transport agencies. Such projects shall be designed to ensure integration between various transport services and may be designed as part of the same building or complex for seamless commuter movement,” the draft MPD-2041 said. Putting forth the proposal that all the transit corridors and transit nodes will be the “axes of urban densification,” the draft Regional Plan – 2041 stated that the NCR region had a wide metro network with plans of having an increased regional rapid transit system. The draft Regional Plan- 2041 also emphasied on the need for planned housing projects in NCR along the TOD corridors. The plan proposed that states can identify the preferred locations for its population to reside and general public tendency and develop such areas on priority. “Areas beyond Gurugram, Faridabad, Rewari, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Hapur, Rohtak, Panipat and ao on, and along transport corridors like Metro Rail, RRTS and expressways could be looked at for future housing projects so that housing and transportation are interlinked. TOD with incentives would go a long way in creating projects which are easily accessible and will get occupied quickly,” the plan read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/tod-highlighted-in-draft-regional-plan-2041/article36264906.ece

The schools were now open and regular classes were being conducted, therefore, the health department had decided to appoint the doctors already working with the children under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram as nodal officials to ensure adherence of protocol in schools, said Civil Surgeon Virender Yadav. Deputy Civil Surgeon Isha Narang said doctors were made into 11 teams — each comprising a male doctor, a female doctor, an Auxiliary Nurse Midwife and a pharmacist — and each team was imparted training in conducting Rapid Antigen Tests. The teams have been issued 25 kits each to conduct tests on the students for early identification of infection and ensure quick isolation. “These teams will ensure that the home isolation protocol was also strictly followed by the parents of the infected child and conduct regular visits to their home,” said Dr. Narang. The teams will also educate the children regarding cough etiquettes, hand hygiene, social distancing, different types of masks and how to use and discard them. It has been more than a month since schools were allowed to open in Haryana from Class VI onwards. The primary schools for Class IV and V were also allowed to open on September 1. However, prior consent of the parents is must for the students to attend the classes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/surprise-check-in-gurugram-schools-to-ensure-covid-norms/article36264912.ece
03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Over 3,500 buses are in shambles’||The BJP said that barring 32 out of a fleet of 3,760 DTC buses, all other buses currently plying in the Capital are overage. The party said that these buses should have been withdrawn from use, but the Delhi government is instead spending crores of rupees for the maintenance of these buses. BJP MLA and former Delhi BJP president Vijender Gupta alleged that the AAP government has spent Rs. 500 crore for the maintenance of 1,000 such overage buses. “If the Delhi government spends Rs. 500 crore per 1,000 buses for all the 3,760 overage buses, the total cost to the exchequer would amount to approximately Rs. 1,800 crore. The amount being spent on maintenance of overage buses could have been utilised to procure 2,000 new buses,” Mr. Gupta said. The party said that for the last six years, no new buses have been added to the DTC fleet and since 2015, the DTC has been inuring recurring losses that has left the transport system in shambles. Plaint to CVC Mr. Gupta said that he had complained to the CVC and sought intervention in the AMC contract of 1,000 overaged DTC buses after which the CVC has initiated an inquiry. “The AMC contract of the new DTC buses is already under scanner by the CBI. Instead of answering people’s questions on the matter, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot are trying to deflect attention from their misdeeds by running in courts and attacking the Opposition for exposing them,” Mr. Gupta said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/over-3500-buses-are-in-shambles/article36264916.ece

Protesters marched from Raisina Road to Shastri Bhawan where they were stopped and detained by the police. IYC president Srinivas B.V. said that the public are suffering from inflation while the Narendra Modi government is busy with tax collection. “The Modi government came to power by showing big dreams to the citizens. But today, it has become difficult for the poor to purchase expensive cooking gas cylinders,” he said. The IYC said that the dream of ‘Achhe Din’ has remained only a poll promise. “The price of LPG cylinder has again increased by Rs. 25. With this, the price of LPG cylinder in Delhi has now gone up to Rs. 884.50. Why is the Modi government punishing the public by continuously increasing the prices of cylinders? Petrol and diesel are the most expensive in India as compared to the neighbouring nations,” Mr. Srinivas added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-protests-against-hike-in-fuel-lpg-prices/article36264917.ece

The Delhi government counsel said that the authorities were interviewing persons to fill the vacancies and no patient was being returned from the hospital. The petition, however, referred to a newspaper report to claim that the hospital witnessed a “chaotic situation” recently “due to shortage of anaesthetists so much so that police are handling the situation between the relatives of patients and hospital staffers”. “From the past one week, emergency ward of Jag Pravesh Hospital is not being available from 4 p.m. to 8 a.m. due to the shortage of anaesthetists in the hospital. Pregnant women, who are coming to the hospital for delivery and need an emergency C-section, are sent to other hospitals, which is putting both the mother and child’s life in danger,” the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/treat-as-representation-plea-for-appointment-of-doctors-hc-tells-govt/article36264894.ece

Narinder Chhikara, vice-president, Bahadurgarh Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), in his complaint, said the industry in the town bordering Delhi was suffering due to the sealing of the border by the Delhi police. Bahadurgarh, the hub of non-leather footwear industry in the country, is a major industrial town of Haryana with 9,000-odd micro, small and medium units. Losses worth Rs. 2,000 cr. Mr. Chhikara said the industry, already having suffered due to the national lockdown in March last year, had incurred losses to the tune of Rs. 2,000 crore due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation. He claimed that around 2,000 units, mostly in Part-B of the Modern Industrial Estate of the town, were hit the most and a large number of them were completely shut. Taking a detour He said the industrialists and the workers mostly commuted to work from Delhi and had to take a detour to reach the units when earlier it took them just a few minutes to cross over to Bahadurgarh. Mr. Chhikara said the industry was also dependent on the national capital for supply of raw material and sale of the finished goods.

The BJP is convinced that they are going to lose in the next municipal elections, which has caused the BJP leaders to go on a spree of selling off the civic assets,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj. Mr. Bhardwaj alleged that the BJP-ruled North Corporation is prepared to sell 10 hospitals and one medical college and the proposal is on hold for the time being after constant pressure and protests by the AAP. “The AAP will continue to fight for the people of Delhi. Will stop the BJP’s mega sale to protect the municipalities from going penniless,” the AAP leader said.

03 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Baghjan oil well fire: new panel to assess damages||The Supreme Court on Thursday formed an expert committee led by former Gauhati High Court judge, Justice B.P. Katakey, to assess the damage and the cost of reparation of the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and surrounding ecologically fragile areas of Assam, which were damaged in the Baghjan oil well blowout in May 2020. Justice Katakey’s committee substitutes the National Green Tribunal’s 10-member committee led by the Assam Chief Secretary in which the Managing Director of Oil India Limited, the public sector company allegedly responsible for the fire and destruction, was a member. A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said the committee’s work would require extensive domain expertise and was of an “adjudicatory” nature. Moreover, the apex court took exception to having the OIL chief on board the very same committee which would decide the compensation. The court recorded that this would be a “serious conflict of interest and would not contribute to the fairness of the outcome”. Besides Justice Katakey as chairperson, the new committee would comprise Qamar Qureshi, a professor with the Wildlife Institute of India; Ritesh Kumar, Director of the Wetlands International South Asia; Bedanga Bordoloi, a soil expert and G.S. Dang, a petroleum expert. The court requested the committee to begin its work expeditiously and submit an interim report within a month on the remedial compensation OIL ought to pay. The Court directed OIL to pay for the committee’s expenses. The environment ministry has been ordered to appoint a nodal officer to facilitate the committee and take care of its logistical arrangements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/baghjan-oil-well-fire-new-panel-to-assess-damages/article36264891.ece

03 September 2021||New Delhi,||‘Many in posh areas using 10 times more water’||Many people living in affluent areas are using up to 10 times more water than the daily average per person in the city, according to the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) data accessed by The Hindu . Water is available 24x7 in these areas. Meanwhile, several other parts of Delhi face water shortage during summers and rely on water tankers for their daily needs. Currently, most parts of the city receive water at a particular time every day. Delhi govt. aim However, the Delhi government is trying to achieve a 24x7 water supply for the entire city. The average water consumption of a person in Delhi is 240 litres per day, which is also termed as 240 LPCD (litres per capita per day), as per the DJB. But in Westend Colony in Vasant Kunj, which has 24x7 water supply for more than three years, as per the DJB, the consumption is as high as 2,219 LPCD to 2,721 LPCD — about 10 times the average water used daily by a person in the rest of the city. The average usage of Westend Colony is 443 LPCD, state records. In another area in Vasant Kunj, Shanti Niketan, the consumption is as high as 1,600-2,041 LPCD — about 8.5 times the average usage. The average usage of the area is 277 LPCD, records show. The DJB is trying out 24x7 water supply on a trial basis in this area. “During meetings with the residents, we have raised the issue multiple times that their usage is really high. Many have large houses, lawns, multiple cars, and pets. They wash their cars using a hose and even the road outside their houses. They are ready to pay the bills. But just because you can pay doesn’t mean that you can waste this much water,” a DJB official said. The official said the DJB officials inspected the area after employees who go to take readings reported about high bills from the area, raising suspicion of commercial activities. “We have provision to fine people if their overhead water tank is overflowing, but it is again difficult to find out these things. But in these areas, people are educated and they should be saving water instead of wasting it,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/many-in-posh-areas-using-10-times-more-water/article36264903.ece
