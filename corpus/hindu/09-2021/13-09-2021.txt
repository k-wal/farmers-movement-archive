13 September 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Bhupendra Patel to be next Gujarat CM||In a surprise choice, first-time legislator Bhupendra Patel was on Sunday elected the new Chief Minister of Gujarat. Mr. Patel, 59, is a protege of former Chief Minister and current Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel. The BJP Legislature Party meeting, conducted by central observers Narendra Singh Tomar and Pralhad Joshi in the presence of MLAs and other senior leaders, unanimously endorsed Mr. Patel’s name after it was proposed by the outgoing Chief Minister, Vijay Rupani. Mr. Rupani, a protege of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, abruptly resigned on Saturday, paving the way for a change of guard. Mr. Patel’s name was cleared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to replace Mr. Rupani, belonging from the numerically insignificant Jain community, with a leader from the dominant Patidar caste ahead of the Assembly election likely to be held in November 2022. Patel thanks Modi, Shah After his election, Mr. Patel expressed his gratitude to Mr. Modi, Mr. Shah and the party leadership for reposing their faith in him. State BJP chief C.R. Paatil said, “Bhupendra bhai is a dynamic leader and the party under his leadership will sweep the next Assembly polls.” Mr. Patel will be sworn in on Monday in the presence of top leaders, including the Prime Minister, who will attend the event virtually. In the 2017 Assembly election, Mr. Patel succeeded Ms. Anandiben Patel as legislator from the Ghatlodia Assembly segment in Ahmedabad. He was earlier the chairman of the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority and also the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Mr. Patel studied engineering and is a builder. He is active in the Patidar community’s social service outfits in Ahmedabad and is the first leader from Ahmedabad city to be elected Chief Minister. His selection trumped several contenders for the top post, including outgoing Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel and Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya. “The name was a complete surprise even to MLAs. It came from Delhi and possibly Anandiben had a critical role in his selection,” a senior party leader told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bhupendra-patel-to-be-next-gujarat-cm/article36423258.ece
13 September 2021||New Delhi,||Nearly 16 lakh students write NEET||Nearly 16 lakh students wrote the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) on Sunday, attempting to secure admission into undergraduate medical and dental programmes across the country.

13 September 2021||MYSURU,||Row over demolition of religious structures||The district administration’s move to allegedly demolish unauthorised religious structures as part of Supreme Court directions has sparked off a row, with political leaders, cutting across party lines, objecting to the drive. BJP MP Pratap Simha found fault with the administration’s approach, which, he claimed, was not in line with the spirit of the Supreme Court directions on unauthorised religious structures. Arguing that the apex court, in its order in 2009, had not issued directions for forthwith demolition of such structures, Mr. Simha pointed out that authorities had been told to consider each structure on an individual basis by first exploring possibilities of regularising it if they did not pose any hurdles to the public. If regularising it was not an option, the next course, as per the court order, was to relocating the religious structure. When both options had been exhausted the authorities could demolish the same, but not before making alternative arrangements, he claimed. “But, the authorities in Mysuru, who have drawn up a list of 93 unauthorised structures in the city in their drive, are going about razing the temples to the ground without consulting the managements of the religious structures and hurting the people’s sentiments,” Mr. Simha regretted. He urged the State government to withdraw its order issued in 2010 following the Supreme Court directions of 2009 and file a review petition in the apex court. Mr. Simha was speaking to reporters at the 101 Ganapathi Temple at Agrahara in Mysuru, which is among the religious structures identified by the authorities under its drive. He also claimed that the district administration had spared a dargah on the footpath of D. Devaraj Urs Road and accused the administration of “selectively” targeting Hindu places of worship. JD(S) MLA representing Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency G.T. Deve Gowda too voiced concern over the drive. Contending that the demolition of religious structures would hurt the sentiments of the people, Mr. Gowda wondered why such an action against religious structures had been taken up only in Mysuru district. He pointed out that similar orders had been passed by the Supreme Court to evict encroachers from lake areas and asked the reason behind the district administration not taking up a drive against the land-grabbers. Congress leader Siddaramaiah too took to Twitter on Saturday to condemn the demolition of an ancient temple in Nanjangud by the BJP government. “The demolition is done without the consultation of the people of the region and has hurt the religious sentiments. Concerned officials have not followed due process. An alternative site should have been provided if demolition was deemed necessary,” he had tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/row-over-demolition-of-unauthorised-religious-structures/article36423538.ece
13 September 2021||Belagavi,||Students affected as KMDC stops Arivu education loan renewals||With the Karnataka Minorities Development Corporation (KMDC) abruptly stopping student loan renewals under the Arivu scheme, thousands of students from the minority communities across the State are forced to drop out of higher education institutions. The stated reason is the reduced grants to the corporation due to the epidemic. Several students from across the State have written to the Department of Minorities Welfare complaining against the decision of the State-run corporation to discontinue the scheme. Copies of the letter are available with The Hindu . Some students have also begun an online campaign, tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Minister for Minority Welfare Shashikala Jolle. “I am being forced to drop out of MBBS course, as I am unable to pay fees,’’ said Mohammad Mustafa, a student from Belagavi who is studying medicine in a college in Udupi. I joined the course after assistance came from KMDC. It helped me pay my fees in the first year of MBBS. But the KMDC stopped releasing loan instalments two semesters ago and I am contemplating dropping out of college,’’ he said. “It is obvious, from the rules of the scheme, that each beneficiary is a meritorious student who has excelled in his studies. Such students can join professional and other colleges only due to the kind and generous gesture of the State government. But due to the abrupt reduction of funds, the beneficiaries are on the streets. Most of them are constrained to drop out of college and take up menial jobs,’’ Mr Mustafa said. This is not a solitary case, however. Students of various minority communities are suffering due to the non-renewal of education loans and non-sanctioning of new education loans. They have written several letters to the KMDC and the Department of Minority Welfare seeking revival of the scheme. In letters to the Managing Director, KMDC, and the Secretary, Department of Minority Welfare, Haj and Waqf, the students said that in the name of modification, the KMDC had stopped releasing further instalment of education loans. It had also stopped accepting new applications, they added. The KMDC website says that under the Arivu Education Loan Scheme, only renewal applications already submitted will be considered for sanction during 2021-22, as the grant has been reduced due to COVID-19 situation and new applications will not be invited. “However, despite this assurance, the State government has not renewed loans since 2019. This is such a grave problem that several thousands of bright students will be forced to drop out of college as they are unable to repay loans. They will also be left with a burden of huge loans, which they will not be able to repay even after working all their lives,’’ said a letter from a student. Joshua Johnson, a student from Bidar, said that his application was not processed despite he submitted it in 2017. “The corporation has also stopped receiving new applications, shattering the dreams of innumerable meritorious students. This is not acceptable in a welfare State,’’ the engineering student said. He said that between 30,000 students and 50,000 students have been affected by this decision. “We request the KMDC to protect the future of these students by sending them back to college,’’ he said. KMDC is under the legal obligation of continuing the scheme it has started. It is an established tenet of a welfare society that any welfare scheme or project shall not be modified to the disadvantage of the beneficiaries. “We are, therefore, exploring legal challenge,’’ Mr Johnson said. “KMDC is part of State as defined in Article 12 of the Constitution. Therefore, the corporation has deprived the citizens of their rights with its move. The KMDC, and by implication, the State government, is bound to protect the interests of the minority community. A conservative estimate is that there are nearly 50,000 beneficiaries in the State. This means that the future of so many poor families is at stake. We urge you to resume the scheme in its original format and assist the youth from minority communities to get educated and become part of the process of nation building,’’ another letter from a female student from Ballari said. Arivu educational loan support scheme was started in 2014-15 to help meritorious students from various minority communities get quality education in professional and other colleges. As per the scheme, Muslim, Christian, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh and Parsi students are eligible for benefits. Loans of up to Rs. 5 lakh can be sanctioned with the applicant paying 10% of the loan amount along with a 2% fee for grant.  Students of various minority communities have written several letters to the KMDC and the Department of Minority Welfare seeking revival of the scheme||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/students-affected-as-kmdc-stops-arivu-education-loan-renewals/article36423704.ece
13 September 2021||Bengaluru,||Degree colleges in city see a huge demand for seats||With all second year pre-university (II PU) students being declared as pass for the 2020-2021 academic year, degree colleges have seen a huge demand for seats. As a result, most popular colleges — government and private — have decided to enhance the number of seats. D.S. Prathima, principal, Government First Grade College, Malleswaram, said while their intake capacity is 720 seats, 1,200 students have applied. “We are supposed to complete admissions by the end of the month and 50% of the seats are already full. Owing to the high demand this year, we are planning to increase the number of seats,” she said. She added that the Department of Collegiate Education has allowed colleges to enhance their intake and has said that colleges will have to submit a letter to the department, which will then ask the respective universities to enhance their intake. D. Kiran Jeevan, Public Relations Officer of St. Joseph’s College, said as they have seen a significant increase in the demand for seats in their colleges, they have started several new programmes this year. Cut-off marks In some colleges, the cut-off marks for a seat have increased as the number of students who bagged above 90% is higher this year, as the Department of Pre-University Education (DPUE) graded II PU students based on their SSLC and I PU marks, which were given 45% weightage each. Internal assessments accounted for the remaining 10%. Students were given 5% grace marks on their I PU scores. Lingaraja Gandhi, Vice-Chancellor of Bengaluru City University, said many colleges have applied for enhancement of seats and they can enhance the number by 20%. “If they want to enhance the number of seats further or add an extra section, we will have to inspect the colleges and look at their infrastructure and staff requirements,” he said. He added that commerce courses were the most sought after so far and the demand for B.Sc. courses will also increase after the results of the Common Entrance Test (CET) are announced. Principals too said that many students tend to opt for B.Sc. courses after they realise that their CET ranks may not be adequate to get a good engineering seat. B. Chandrashekara, principal, Government R.C. College of Commerce and Management, said they have an intake of 1,250 seats but 1,600 students have applied and they have now sought enhancement of 360 seats in the BCom, BBA Aviation, and BCom Tourism courses. He also said that the cut-offs in the colleges have increased as the number of students who bagged high scores is much higher this year. Harshitha S., who enrolled for a BBA course in a government college, said that there is a lot of demand for certain courses. “As all students have been declared as pass this year, getting courses of our choice is slightly more difficult. As colleges have decided to enhance the number of seats, it would help students - particularly those who want to enroll themselves in BCom and B.Sc. courses,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/degree-colleges-in-city-see-a-huge-demand-for-seats/article36423490.ece
13 September 2021||HUBBALLI,||BJP re-inducts expelled party worker in Hubballi-Dharwad||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has no candidate belonging to Scheduled Castes (Woman) category in the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation, on Sunday re-inducted an expelled party worker, as his wife has won the election as an Independent. BJP office-bearer Shashikanth Bijawad rebelled against his party after his wife was denied party ticket in the municipal election from Ward No 69. He fielded his wife Durgamma as Independent, leading to his expulsion from the party. Holding a press conference in Hubballi along with district unit president and MLA Arvind Bellad, the former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar announced that the party’s core committee meeting on Saturday decided to welcome the expelled party worker back into its fold. “Mr. Bijawad had approached the party soon after his wife’s victory. Discussions were held in the party circles and the core committee decided to re-induct him. His wife Durgamma will formally join the party soon,” he said. When reminded about the party’s earlier decision of not revoking the expulsion of Mr. Bijawad for the next six years, Mr. Shettar clarified that in politics, certain decisions are taken keeping the developing situation in mind. He also defended that the expulsion was needed to maintain discipline among party workers. Mr. Shettar also said that two or three Independent candidates who won the election too have approached the party. However, a decision on whether to induct them into the party will be taken only after consulting the local party workers of the respective wards, he said. The former Chief Minister clarified that the decision on Mayor’s post has not been taken as the notification on mayoral election has not been issued yet. Discussions will be held and the candidate chosen only after the notification, he said. He said that while the party has not won the expected number of seats, it should not be seen as a setback to the party leaders in the district. The election was held in a hurry and there were a lot of issues with the electoral roll which consequently led to low polling percentage. Despite these things, the party has emerged as the single largest party and is set to come to power, he said. BJP State general secretary Mahesh Tenginakai was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bjp-re-inducts-expelled-party-worker-in-hubballi-dharwad/article36423706.ece

13 September 2021||Patna,||Chirag warms to party reunion on father’s death anniversary||Amid a tug of war to claim the Lok Janshakti Party legacy, Chirag Paswan, MP, appeared to warm to a reunion in the family and the party. Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a two-page message on the first death anniversary of party founder Ram Vilas Paswan on Sunday, while his estranged uncle and Union Minister Pashupati Kumar Paras attended an event in Patna on the occasion. Mr. Modi also spoke to Mr. Chirag Paswan, remembering his father’s contribution to politics. Several leaders cutting across party lines visited Mr. Chirag Paswan’s residence to offer tributes to the departed soul, but Chief Minister Nitish Kumar chose to offer his condolence in a one-line message. Mr. Chirag Paswan is said to have tried to meet Mr. Kumar to extend him an invitation for the event but the MP said he was not given time by the Chief Minister. Mr. Chirag Paswan and Mr. Kumar apparently had a rift in relations since the last Assembly election, when the LJP fielded candidates against the JD(U) nominees, causing defeat to many. However, Mr. Chirag Paswan thanked the Prime Minister for his letter, saying, “May his affection and blessing to us always remain like this.” “He [Ram Vilas Paswan] always has his own place in the history of independent India and how he reached the top from a modest background and remained firmly attached to his roots. Whenever he met me, he always spoke about his experiences about the welfare of the deprived sections of the society. He entered politics in the 1960s when the political scenario in the country was completely different and there was predominantly just one ideology in the country. Yet, he chose a different path for him and surprised everyone by winning the Lok Sabha poll in 1977,” wrote the Prime Minister, while terming the first death anniversary of Ram Vilas Paswan an emotional day for him as he not only remembered him as a close friend but also “feels the void he had left in Indian politics”. Mr. Chirag Paswan’s estranged uncle and Union Minister Mr. Paras turned up at the event but remained silent. Leaders of several other parties too offered tributes to Ram Vilas Paswan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/chirag-warms-to-party-reunion-on-fathers-death-anniversary/article36423254.ece
13 September 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||Doctors stress need for correct diagnosis of seasonal diseases||A young nephrologist had to pay with her life after taking anticoagulants in order to prevent excessive clotting, thinking that it was due to COVID-19. She was later diagnosed with dengue, and it is believed that the anticoagulant had rapidly destroyed her already low platelets. “Such patients have to be monitored closely in a hospital setting by an interdisciplinary team of doctors,” Dr. Manila Gaddh, Associate Professor of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, said when Dr. S.N.R. Naveen, a pulmonologist, brought the incident to her notice during a webinar on ‘Anticoagulation in acute COVID-19’, organised by Andhra Medical College (AMC) recently. “It is here that we (doctors) have to use our clinical judgment. Anticoagulants are not without side-effects and they should be used judiciously. In our enthusiasm to correct only the parameters rather than treating the patient holistically, we sometimes end up harming the patient,” Dr. Gaddh said. Doctors were busy treating COVID-19 and they had little time to think of other diseases. A majority of the cases of COVID-19 and dengue are asymptomatic and some patients may be infected by both viruses at the same time. In such cases, one disease might enhance the severity of the other. “It is difficult to distinguish symptoms and signs in ‘co-infections’ due to the overlapping clinical presentations. False positivity is also reported among patients with co-infection, which may create a diagnostic challenge,” says Dr. Naveen, who is also secretary of the Visakhapatnam chapter of Association of Physicians of India (API).  “There is an acute shortage of platelets and patients need to be educated that not all dengue patients need to be given platelets,” says Dr. A. Sugandhi, Medical Director of A.S. Raja Voluntary Blood Bank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/doctors-stress-need-for-correct-diagnosis-of-seasonal-diseases/article36424015.ece
13 September 2021||New Delhi,||Nearly 16 lakh appear for NEET||Nearly 16 lakh students wrote the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on Sunday for admission to undergraduate medical and dental programmes across the country. The examination was held at more than 3,800 centres in 202 cities in India and abroad, with the COVID-19 safety protocol in place. At several centres, separate rooms were provided for students who tested positive. Single offline session The National Testing Agency conducted the examination in a single offline session, through the pen-and-paper mode, with papers available in 13 languages. In Tamil Nadu, more than 1.10 lakh students had registered themselves for the test, which was conducted at 224 centres. Sources in the School Education Department said nearly 7,000 students took the test in Tamil. The COVID-19 protocol was followed strictly.

Most first-time test-takers found physics challenging.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nearly-16-lakh-students-write-neet/article36423262.ece
13 September 2021||Bengaluru,||Rowdy-sheeter hacked to death on football stadium premises||A rowdy-sheeter was murdered on Sunday evening on the premises of the Bangalore Football Stadium (BFS), causing panic among spectators, who had come to watch a match scheduled for the day, and the players who were about to enter the field. A group of armed men chased the victim, a habitual offender, onto the pitch, followed him into the referees’ room where he attempted to lock himself, and hacked him to death. Following this attack, the KSFA ‘A’ division women’s football league was postponed. Around 3.45 p.m., minutes before the match between Roots FC and GRK Football Youth Club (FYC) was to begin, people saw the armed assailants chasing the victim, identified as Aravind, a rowdy-sheeter from Bharathi Nagar. Aravind jumped the stand gallery to escape and locked himself up in one of the referees’ rooms nearby, but the assailants broke open the door and killed him before fleeing from the spot. According to the police, Aravind, who was being chased by his alleged rivals, entered the BFS premises in an attempt to escape. The Ashok Nagar police arrived at the spot shortly after the murder. Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) M.N. Anucheth said that Aravind had come to the area to play a football match at the BBMP grounds opposite the BFS. “He was also managing one of the teams there,” Mr. Anucheth said. Karnataka State Football Association secretary M. Satyanarayana said the victim was not affiliated to any club. “Women players from Roots FC and GRK FYC, who were getting ready to enter the pitch, witnessed the chase and not the murder. The players were quickly escorted out of the stadium by tournament officials. The police arrived at the stadium in quick time to investigate the case,” he said. The police suspect old rivalry as the motive behind the murder. Aravind had multiple cases pending against him and had been arrested under the Goonda Act. He came out of prison on bail two months ago, a police officer said . The police have taken up a case of murder and formed two special teams to track down the assailants. They are questioning eyewitnesses at both the BFS and the adjoining BBMP ground. “We have obtained CCTV footage to identify the accused and have some clues,” the police added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rowdy-sheeter-hacked-to-death-on-football-stadium-premises/article36423494.ece
13 September 2021||Srinagar,||Centre seeks report on Geelani’s burial||The Ministry of External Affairs has sought an elaborate report from the Jammu and Kashmir police on the burial of former Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who died aged 92 on September 1 in Srinagar. A senior police officer confirmed to The Hindu that a report was being prepared on the “sequence of events” between 10.30 p.m. and 5 a.m. on the intervening night of September 1 and September 2, when the final rites of Geelani took place in the Hyderpora area of Srinagar under heavy security. Sources said a Geneva-based rights organisation has raised the issue of Geelani’s burial with the Indian government. The family has alleged that policemen barged into their house around 2 a.m. and took away the body “forcibly” and buried it in haste “against the wishes of the family”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-seeks-report-on-geelanis-burial/article36423260.ece
13 September 2021||New Delhi,||Youth should be aware of social realities and challenges: CJI||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Sunday said the unity and sacrifice of young people across faiths, beliefs and communities, who took to the streets to challenge authoritarian figures, gave the country democratic rights which were being taken for granted today. “The democratic rights that we take for granted are a result of the struggles of thousands of young people who took to the streets fighting authoritarian figures either during the freedom struggle or the dark days of Emergency. Many lost their lives, sacrificed lucrative careers, all for the greater good of the nation and society. Trust the youth to check the deviations in a society’s journey towards peace and progress,” Chief Justice Ramana said in his address on the 128th anniversary of the historic Chicago address of Swami Vivekananda. Chief Justice Ramana, quoting Swami Vivekananda, said the youth did not tolerate injustice, either to themselves or against others. They did not compromise with their ideals. They were not only selfless but also adventurous. They were willing to sacrifice for the cause they believed in. It is these unadulterated minds and pure hearts which formed the backbone of our nation. He said it was necessary for youth to be aware of social realities and challenges. “Remember, any change in the nation’s trajectory always stems from its youth and their participation. It is for you to build the ideal nation and society that you desire to witness,” he said. He reminisced how Swami Vivekananda, long before the churning brought about by the Independence struggle which led to the framing of an egalitarian Constitution, had prescribed secularism. “He firmly believed that the true essence of religion was the common good, and tolerance. Religion should be above superstitions and rigidities. To fulfil the dream of making resurgent India through the principles of common good and tolerance, we should instil the ideals of Swamiji in today’s youth,” he told his audience at the virtual event which also marked the 22nd Foundation Day of the Vivekananda Institute of Human Excellence in Hyderabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/youth-should-be-aware-of-social-realities-and-challenges-cji/article36423618.ece
13 September 2021||MANGALURU,||Arecanut plantations in Puttur, Bantwal too report diseases||Farmers have reported more cases of bud rot and crown rot diseases prevalent in arecanut plantations in Puttur and Bantwal taluks in addition to such incidences reported from Kadaba and Moodbidri taluks in Dakshina Kannada a few days ago. A scientist at the Vitla Regional Station of the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) Bhavishya told The Hindu that after reports on these diseases in an arecanut garden at Perabe village in Kadaba taluk came, more farmers from Puttur and Bantwal have informed him about the diseases prevailing in their plantations. The scientist, who is among a three-member team of CPCRI scientists that visited one of the affected plantations in Kadaba taluk on Tuesday last, said that the diseases, including fruit rot, could be prevalent in more number of plantations. But farmers have not reported them yet. He said that unless rain continues, the chances of the diseases spreading to a vast track of plantations are less. But it will depend on the intensity of rainfall during September. The scientist said that this year these diseases have been spotted early. It might be because certain tracks have been experiencing rainfall since this April. Fruit rot disease/Mahali/Koleroga caused by the pathogen Phytophthora meadii is the primary enemy of arecanut in high rainfall condition. This year, the incidence of fruit rot is observed in many arecanut gardens; however, the intensity has not been high, he said and added that in case of fruit rot only crop is lost, while the other two diseases can wipe out palms. The pathogen also affects crown and bud of arecanut palm to cause crown rot and bud rot, respectively. “The pathogen is present in infected bunches/plant parts for many years. It becomes active under favourable conditions. Hence, phyto-sanitation (removal of the infected plant part or whole plant) followed by spraying Bordeaux mixture (1%) on crown or bud region of the affected and neighbouring palms is very important to prevent further spread,” Mr. Bhavishya said. “Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2g per litre) can be sprayed immediately on the crown and bud region of infected and neighbouring palms and then, while spraying on bunches, applying Bordeaux mixture (1%). Drenching the crown of affected palms with 1% Bordeaux mixture and smearing with 10% Bordeaux paste after removal of affected tissues is effective in saving bud rot affected palms. Regular monitoring of treated palms is needed for checking further advancement of symptoms,” said scientist R. Thava Prakasa Pandian, another member of the team. In newly planted gardens and secondary nurseries, the fungus causes collar rot. Recently, it was observed in many arecanut growing areas, especially in water logged and poorly drained fields. Infection by the pathogen enters through collar region and it may lead to rotting of the infected region and the entire seedling may collapse. Whereas, infection through roots may result in seedling wilt. Providing good drainage, phytosanitation, soil drenching with 0.2% Copper oxychloride or 1% Bordeaux mixture will reduce the disease incidence.

13 September 2021||MANGALURU,||Probe sought into food kit distribution||Mangaluru MLA U.T. Khader on Sunday said that funds meant for distribution of food and other kits to workers have been misappropriated and sought a probe into it. Talking to reporters here, Mr. Khader said that the Labour Department was using funds available under Labour Welfare Fund to provide food, immunity and safety kits to workers. The food kit worth about Rs. 3,000 each was being provided in which rice was of poor quality, he said. The immunity kit worth Rs. 700 and safety kit worth Rs. 600 were also of poor quality and are not helpful to workers, he added. Mr. Khader said that on an average about 15,000 kits have been given in each Assembly constituency in the State. And, in Ullal Assembly constituency, 5,000 kits have been provided, he said. The funds meant for labourers welfare has been misappropriated and poor quality kits have been distributed, he said. The way kits have been distributed shows the lack of concern of the State government to workers, he added. The food kit issue will be raised during the legislature session that commences on Monday. Questioning the hurried manner in which the State government is implementing the National Education Policy (NEP), Mr. Khader said that the government has gone ahead with the implementation without addressing the fundamental requirements, including making people aware of this policy. With NEP, foreign education firms will have their establishments in India and this will further increase the cost of education, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/probe-sought-into-food-kit-distribution/article36423850.ece

13 September 2021||HUBBALLI,||Shrimant does a U-turn||A day after he made a statement that the BJP had offered him money to quit Congress and join the saffron party, former Minister Shrimant Patil did a “U-turn” on Sunday, saying that no such offer was made to him. The statement had caused huge embarrassment to the BJP. Speaking to presspersons at Ambdagatti village near Kittur in Belagavi district, Mr. Patil clarified that nobody made the offer and he himself had gone to meet BJP leaders, including Amit Shah, to discuss about joining the party. Mr. Patil’s changed stance came after other BJP leaders distanced themselves from his statement and the Congress hinted at raising the issue in the legislature session, with KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar thanking him (Mr. Patil) for revealing the truth. ‘Wanted a good position’ “I met BJP leaders on my own. When I met them, they sought to know what expectations I had from the party. I told them that I had none but only wanted a good position,” Mr. Patil said. He also said that he wanted to join the BJP after seeing the good work of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and after considering BJP’s views on the nation’s development. However, his change in the stance is being seen in political circles as a damage-control exercise by the BJP ahead of the legislature session beginning on Monday On Saturday, speaking to presspersons at Ainapur in Kagwad taluk of Belagavi district, Mr. Patil said he was offered money during ‘Operation Lotus’. “They asked me how much money I wanted. But I told that I didn’t need money and asked them to give a suitable position after government formation. I have come to BJP without taking any money,” he said. Meanwhile, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, while welcoming Mr. Patil’s earlier statement on the offer made by BJP leaders, said that although it was a bit late, Mr. Patil had revealed the truth at least now. Reacting to Mr. Patil’s earlier statement, former Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi said it needed to be verified who had made the offer to Mr. Patil. In Hubballi, former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar said he did not know in what context Mr. Patil had made such a statement on the offer made to him. However, he clarified that the BJP had not made any such offers to leaders to join the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/shrimant-does-a-u-turn/article36423491.ece

13 September 2021||New Delhi,||CJI says youth should be aware of social realities and concerns||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Sunday said the unity and sacrifice of young people across faiths, beliefs and communities, who took to the streets to challenge authoritarian figures, gave the country democratic rights which were being taken for granted today. “The democratic rights that we take for granted are a result of the struggles of thousands of young people who took to the streets fighting authoritarian figures either during the freedom struggle or the dark days of Emergency. Many lost their lives, sacrificed lucrative careers, all for the greater good of the nation and society. Trust the youth to check the deviations in a society’s journey towards peace and progress,” Chief Justice Ramana said in his address on the 128th anniversary of the historic Chicago address of Swami Vivekananda. Chief Justice Ramana, quoting Swami Vivekananda, said the youth did not tolerate injustice, either to themselves or against others. They did not compromise with their ideals. They were not only selfless but also adventurous. Social realities They were willing to sacrifice for the cause they believed in. It is these unadulterated minds and pure hearts which formed the backbone of our nation. He said it was necessary for youth to be aware of social realities and challenges. “Remember, any change in the nation’s trajectory always stems from its youth and their participation. It is for you to build the ideal nation and society that you desire to witness,” he said. The CJI’s words have significant import even as the past few years have seen young activists, academicians and journalists being jailed for sedition and students chased and beaten up by the police in university campus. He reminisced how Swami Vivekananda, long before the churning brought about by the Independence struggle which led to the framing of an egalitarian Constitution, had prescribed secularism. “He firmly believed that the true essence of religion was the common good, and tolerance. Religion should be above superstitions and rigidities. To fulfil the dream of making resurgent India through the principles of common good and tolerance, we should instil the ideals of Swamiji in today’s youth,” he told his audience at the virtual event which also marked the 22nd Foundation Day of the Vivekananda Institute of Human Excellence in Hyderabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/youth-should-be-aware-of-social-realities-and-challenges-facing-country-says-cji/article36423256.ece
13 September 2021||New Delhi,||BJP changes highlight Congress inertia||The change of guard in Gujarat has once again brought into focus the high-stakes battle for not just the ruling party but also the Congress. Though the party identified poll-bound Gujarat as a “priority” State, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) is yet to appoint an in-charge for the State after Rajeev Satav passed away in the middle of May from COVID-19 complications. Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Amit Chavda and Congress Legislature Party (CLP) chief Paresh Dhanani resigned in March after the party’s rout in the local body election. Death and a public spat They were asked to continue until their replacements were found and the party had started the process of taking the feedback from workers. However, Mr. Satav’s demise was a major setback and then the party’s top leadership got entangled in a very public factional war in the Punjab Congress between Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu. Even now, the delay could be linked to the Congress high command working out a solution to resolve infighting in one of the Congress-ruled States, said a senior party functionary. The last word on the Chhattisgarh leadership tussle has not yet been spoken and former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi is said to be keen on honouring his ‘promise’ that Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel will make way for his colleague, T.S. Singh Deo, after completing two-and-a-half years in the top post. If the high command can effect a change in leadership in Chhattisgarh, Mr. Baghel could then be given the responsibility of overseeing the Congress campaign in Gujarat, given his previous experience in States such as Assam and Bihar. Mr. Baghel, however, has been far from willing to step down and has, in fact, displayed his strength in terms of support from MLAs on a number of occasions. In the past, there has also been speculation about drafting Rajasthan Congress leader, Sachin Pilot, to take on the BJP government. During the 2017 Gujarat Assembly election, in which the Congress won 77 seats and had restricted the BJP to 99 seats, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had played a key role in devising strategy to put up a credible fight. AAP factor Since then the Congress party’s strength has come down to 66 MLAs, with several MLAs switching over to the BJP. And to add to Congress’ discomfort, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) too is emerging as a political alternative in a State where the BJP has dominated since the mid 90s. The Congress may now have to try out younger leaders like Hardik Patel, whose agitation to seek reservation for the Patidars or Patels under the umbrella of Patidar Anamat Adolan Samti (PAAS) in the last election had threatened to dent the BJP’s traditional support base. “Hardik is now a working president of our State unit and has a proven mass base. The party should definitely better utilise his potential,” said the senior leader quoted above.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-changes-highlight-congress-inertia/article36423198.ece
13 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nursing syllabus gets a major revamp||The B.Sc. nursing programme in the country has undergone its first major overhaul after 1947, making it a competency-based curriculum. To be implemented from January 2022, the revised curriculum has been standardised, updated and aimed at bringing in uniformity in nursing education across India. Medical ethics has been introduced for the first time. The new system now adopts a credit-based semester pattern with more emphasis on acquiring competency in each area of study. Also, forensic nursing and nursing informatics have been introduced in the syllabus. Satendra Singh, who teaches in a medical college and is among the guest faculty at Florence Nightingale Nursing School at GTB Hospital in Delhi, said the Indian Nursing Council (INC) had revised and developed the syllabus under Section 16 of the INC Act to ensure uniform standard of nursing education in the country. “The revised syllabus, which is the first major overhaul after 1947, has the word ‘dignity’ in at least six places which is a welcome addition and the introduction of ethics is also an enhanced addition,” Dr. Singh said. Disability ignored He added that unfortunately the revised curriculum did not include disability rights as well as disability competencies. “It still includes the pejorative expressions ‘handicapped’, ‘mentally challenged’ and ‘physically challenged’. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act mandates inclusion of disability rights in the higher education. The curriculum also excludes gender expression and identity components which the Transgender Persons Act mandates be included,” he said. Member of the Indian Nursing Council and Professor Roy K. George said the revamped syllabus would add quality and standardisation to the programme. He said that the new curriculum’s simulation-based training is given importance in the practical component of the course. “So students will go to the clinical area after the compulsory training in the simulation laboratories. Also, the gazette does not permit the admission for non-science background students for the B.Sc. Nursing programme and minimum qualifying marks for entrance test shall be 50%. In the university theory paper pattern ( for 75 marks), multiple choice questions have been added,” said Dr. George. He added that internal assessment guidelines will now see continuous assessment based on attendance, written assignments, seminars, microteaching, individual presentation and group projects and reports. “The new system has also brought in mandatory modules for each specialisation and the student has to pass in all mandatory modules placed within courses. The pass mark for each module is 50%,” he said. Hospital norms As per the new norms, colleges of nursing should mandatorily have 100-bedded parent or own hospitals. The trustee/ member/ director of the trust or society or company should not allow the hospital to be treated as the parent/ affiliated hospital to any other nursing institution and the arrangement will be in place for a minimum of 30 years. The beds of a parent hospital shall be in one unitary hospital, that is, in the same building or campus. The revised rules also state that no institution or university can modify the syllabi prescribed by the Council for a course or programme. However they can add units or subjects if required. “It is mandatory that an institution shall have its own building within two years of its establishment,” the revised rules state.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nursing-syllabus-gets-a-major-revamp/article36423213.ece
13 September 2021||New Delhi,||LCA-Mk2 to roll out next year||The configuration for the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA)-Mk2 has been frozen and steel cutting is expected to begin soon while configuration for the fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) has been frozen and preliminary design completed, a senior scientist from the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) has said. “The detailed design is complete. In fact, we are in the critical design review stage and metal cutting should start very shortly. Roll-out of the aircraft (Mk2) is planned next year and the first flight in early 2023. We are well on track to achieve these goals,” Girish S. Deodhare, Programme Director (Combat Aircraft) & Director, ADA, said at an event by the Centre for Air Power Studies and Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers. Enhabced range The aircraft features enhanced range and endurance including an onboard oxygen generation system, which is being integrated for the first time, Dr. Deodhare said. Heavy weapons of the class of Scalp, Crystal Maze and Spice-2000 will also be integrated on the Mk2. The LCA-Mk2 will be a heavier and much more capable aircraft than the current LCA variants. The Mk2 is 1,350 mm longer featuring canards and can carry a payload of 6,500 kg compared to 3,500 kg the LCA can carry. In February, the Defence Ministry signed a Rs. 48,000-crore deal with Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) to supply 83 LCA-Mk1A to the Indian Air Force. In August, the HAL signed a $716 million deal with GE Aviation of the U.S. for 99 F404 aircraft engines and support services to power the Mk-1A. The Mk2 will be powered by a more powerful GE-414 engine. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has one squadron of the LCA in initial operational clearance and deliveries of the second squadron in final operational clearance configuration are under way. The HAL has already set up a second assembly line to ramp up production from eight aircraft a year to 16. Order for 83 Mk-1A is expected to be completed by 2028-29, Dr. Deodhare said. Stealth aircraft Stating that the initial design of the AMCA was started way back in 2009, Dr. Deodhare said that it would be a twin engine stealth aircraft with an internal weapons bay and a diverterless supersonic intake, which has been developed for the first time for which the design is complete. It will be a 25-tonne aircraft with internal carriage of 1,500 kg of payload and 5,500-kg external payload with 6,500 kg of internal fuel. On the current status of the AMCA, Dr. Deodhare said the configuration had been frozen, preliminary service quality requirements finalised and preliminary design review completed. “We are moving to critical design review by the middle of next year with the roll-out planned in 2024 and first flight planned in 2025.” The AMCA will have stealth and non-stealth configuration and will be developed in two phases, AMCA Mk1 with existing GE414 engine and an AMCA Mk2 with an advanced, more powerful engine to be developed later along with a foreign partner, Dr. Deodhare added. The manufacturing and production of the aircraft will be through a special purpose vehicle, which will also have participation of private industry. Simultaneously, the project for development of a twin-engine deck-based fighter jet meant to fly from the Navy’s aircraft carriers is also making progress. On the various programmes under way, Dr. Deodhare said there was commonality of systems and technologies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lca-mk2-to-roll-out-next-year-first-flight-in-2023-says-scientist/article36423168.ece
13 September 2021||New Delhi,||NCLT, ITAT get new members||The government has appointed 31 people as judicial, technical and accountant members at the NCLT and the ITAT, amid the Supreme Court flagging concerns about vacancies in various tribunals. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) deals with matters mainly related to companies law and the insolvency law, while the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) deals with income tax matters. SC’s remarks The appointments also come at a time when the Supreme Court has flagged concerns, saying the Centre was “emasculating” tribunals by not appointing officials to the quasi-judicial bodies that are facing a staff crunch. There are around 250 posts lying vacant at various key tribunals and appellate tribunals such as NCLT, DRT, TDSAT and SAT. As many as eight judicial and 10 technical members have been appointed to the NCLT while 13 judicial and seven accountant members have been appointed to the ITAT, according to separate communications issued by the Department of Personnel and Training on September 11 based on decisions taken by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet. Andhra Pradesh High Court judge Justice Telaprolu Rajani, Bombay High Court retired judge Justice Pradeep Narhari Deshmukh, Madras High Court retired judge Justice S. Ramathilagam and District Court judge Deep Chandra Joshi are among those appointed as the judicial members to the NCLT.

13 September 2021||Pune,||NCW slams police over Mumbai rape||A team of the National Commission for Women (NCW), which visited the relatives of the woman who died after being brutally raped in Mumbai’s Saki Naka area on Friday, criticised the Maharashtra government on Sunday for not having constituted the State Women’s Commission till date and not doing enough to ensure the safety of women in Maharashtra. NCW member Chandramukhi Devi hit out at Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale's statement on the inability of the police to be present at every crime location. “The statement is extremely unfortunate. Police can't run away from their responsibility,” Ms. Chandramukhi said, adding that the State government ought to make serious efforts to improve the situation regarding the safety of women in the State. Asserting that the Mumbai police had done their best, Mr. Nagrale had said that the police had reached the spot within 10 minutes of the crime. “It can’t be present at every crime location. They will reach only after getting the information. The police did their best,” the Mumbai Police Commissioner had said. NCW probe The NCW on Saturday had said that it had taken suo moto cognisance of the crime and would start a probe into it. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said the Commission will also extend help to the victim’s family. The 32-year-old woman had died while undergoing treatment at a hospital early on Saturday. Based on CCTV footage, the police arrested a 45-year-old man in connection with the crime, who has been booked for murder and rape among other charges and remanded to police custody till September 21. Terming the crime as “a blot on humanity”, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday has promised a fast-track trial in the case. The Opposition BJP and the Republican Party of India (RPI) staged protests against the government, criticising the rising incidents of crimes against women in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ncw-slams-police-over-mumbai-rape/article36423189.ece
13 September 2021||Srinagar,||Policeman killed in militant attack in Srinagar||A police sub-inspector, Arshid Ahmed, died after a militant opened fire on him from a close range here on Sunday. Preliminary reports suggested that militants fire at Ahmed at a checkpoint set up near the Khanyar police station in the city. As evident from a video footage, the attacker pulled out a pistol and fired at the head of the policeman from a close range. “I would not like to disclose about the outfit or module behind today’s attack but the perpetrators have been identified and will be brought to justice soon. All the previous modules of militants involved in pistol shooting were wiped out, while it seems that a new group has been formed,” Director-General of Police Dilbag Singh said. The attackers managed to flee from the spot after a brief exchange of fire. The nearby areas are being searched to apprehend the attackers. The SI, fatally injured with bullet wounds, was earlier shifted to the city’s main Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital, where a doctor said he was “brought in a critical condition” and treated by doctors. Parties flay attack Political parties condemned the attack. Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti said she was saddened to hear of Ahmed’s death. “May his soul rest in peace and condolences to his family,” she said. “The terrorists have yet again made an addition to the army of orphans,” Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone said. A Congress spokesperson said, “The ghastly act is very unfortunate, mindless and inhuman.” Apni Party president Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari termed the incident “extremely barbaric that can yield nothing except for more miseries to the people”. “The Khanyar incident is an addition to the senseless bloodshed that has made another Kashmiri family a victim of violence,” Mr. Bukhari said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/policeman-killed-in-militant-attack-in-srinagar/article36423180.ece
13 September 2021||Ahmedabad,||Bhupendra Patel, BJP’s surprise choice of Gujarat CM||When Vijay Rupani headed to the Raj Bhavan to submit his resignation as Chief Minister at the instruction of the BJP high command on Saturday, many party leaders and workers and media persons began speculating immediately on the names that could be the next Chief Minister. Animated discussions here have mainly centred on outgoing Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, and the Administrator of the Union Territories of Daman and Diu and Lakshdweep, Praful Patel. But first-time legislator Bhupendra Patel, 59, never figured in any of this speculation, including by the top BJP leadership in Gujarat. Even the otherwise always well-informed top corporates in the State were in the dark till Mr. Patel’s name was announced at a meeting at the BJP’s headquarters in Gandhinagar. Before he became a legislator from the Ghatlodia seat in 2017, which earlier was held by former CM and now Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, “Bhupendrabhai” held the important positions of Chairman of the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority, and Chairman of various committees of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, including its top decision-making Standing Committee. Yet he always remained a low-profile party worker who preferred to work silently. It’s possible that his low profile and Ms. Anandiben’s trust earned him the coveted position of the Chief Minister of the home State of both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Always soft-spoken and mild-mannered, Mr. Bhupendra Patel is a party leader who prefers not to be a part of either the limelight or controversy. “When Anandiben was Chief Minister, he was the chairman of the very powerful urban development authority, and had the direct trust of and access to the CM, but he never bragged about it,” a prominent realty player in Ahmedabad said. A builder by profession, Mr. Bhupendra Patel has been able to keep his image and name clean of any controversy. “His name was not dragged in any land deal or any realty project in the city, even when he was holding important positions in the relevant authorities,” a BJP leader from Ahmedabad city said. His surprise selection as the Gujarat Chief Minister 15 months ahead of the crucial Assembly polls in 2022 suggests that the party’s top leadership has reposed its faith in his untested abilities as a State-level leader. The party seems to have banked upon two factors in catapulting him to the CM’s chair — first, he is a Patidar leader and has strong associations with the community’s social service outfits in Ahmedabad, and second, as a builder with long experience in civic and urban management, he can ensure cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara remain BJP bastions in the coming polls. “Instead of selecting a rural face like R.C. Faldu or even Praful Patel, the party leadership has gone with Bhupendrabhai, who is an urban face, the first leader from Ahmedabad city who has been made the CM,” a party leader said, adding, “it suggests that the main focus of the party will be on urban cities in the elections.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhupendra-patel-bjps-surprise-choice-of-gujarat-cm/article36423191.ece
13 September 2021||New Delhi,||SC to hear pleas for Pegasus probe today||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday a batch of pleas seeking an independent probe into the alleged snooping on some people in India using Pegasus, the Israeli spyware. A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice N.V. Ramana had on September 7 granted more time to the Centre to decide on filing a further response on the petitions after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that due to some difficulties, he could not meet the officials concerned to take a decision on the filing of a second affidavit. The Centre had earlier filed a limited affidavit in the top court saying the pleas seeking an independent probe into the Pegasus snooping allegations are based on “conjectures and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material”. On August 17, the court had issued notice to the Centre on the pleas, making it clear that it did not want the government to disclose anything which compromised national security. In its short affidavit filed in the court earlier, the Centre had said the position on the issue had been clarified in Parliament by Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. With a view of dispelling any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests and examining the issues raised, the government said it would constitute a committee of experts. The court, while issuing notice on the pleas, had asked the Centre what the “problem” was if the competent authority filed an affidavit before it on the issue. “Our considered response is what we have respectfully stated in our last affidavit. Kindly examine the issue from our point of view as our affidavit is sufficient,” the law officer had told the Bench.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-hear-pleas-for-probe-into-snooping-scandal-today/article36423178.ece
13 September 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC questions Bengal’s handling of transfer requests||The Delhi High Court has questioned West Bengal over its handling of the requests of All India Service (AIS) officers seeking inter-cadre transfer to other States. A Bench of Justice Rajiv Shakdher and Justice Talwant Singh said that the West Bengal government was trotting out shortage of officers as the reason for rejecting the request of inter-cadre transfer, without placing the relevant material on record. “We are noticing that, this approach has been taken, in matter after matter, by the petitioner (West Bengal government) where officer(s) have sought inter-cadre transfer to other State(s) on account of their marriage, and which has been refused on a similar ground,” the court remarked. “Unless the reasons set out in the order of refusal for inter-cadre transfer are backed by relevant material, it cannot pass muster of this court,” it added. The court’s remark came while dismissing the West Bengal government’s appeal against an order passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal directing it to relieve a 2013 batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer of West Bengal cadre. The IAS officer, in her application filed over five years ago on April 5, 2016, had sought transfer to Uttarakhand as she had married an Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer of the 2012 batch of Uttarakhand Cadre on November 26, 2015. Citing this development, she submitted representation to the Central government on April 5, 2016, with a request to change her cadre from West Bengal to that of Uttarakhand. The High Court concurred with the tribunal’s decision noting that the IAS officer was entitled to seek inter-cadre transfer, in terms of Rule 5(2) of the Indian Administrative Services (Cadre) Rules, 1954, which provides for change of cadre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-hc-questions-bengals-handling-of-transfer-requests/article36423184.ece
13 September 2021||LUCKNOW,||Varun asks Adityanath to resolve farmers’ grievances||After speaking in support of the protesting farmers recently, BJP MP from Pilibhit, Varun Gandhi, on Sunday wrote a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath demanding a resolution to the grievances of farmers. Mr. Gandhi demanded that the Uttar Pradesh government hike the MSP of sugarcane in the 2021-22 season to at least Rs. 400 per quintal and immediately pay the farmers their pending arrears. Varun Gandhi, who met a delegation of farmers from his constituency recently, also demanded that the State government consider declaring an additional bonus of Rs. 200 per quintal on the purchase of wheat and paddy. The electricity rates should also be reduced and effective measures be taken to tackle the menace of stray cattle, he said. ‘State should pitch in’ Mr. Gandhi, while praising the efforts of the Yogi Adityanath government on various fronts, also demanded that the amount under the PM KISAN scheme be doubled to Rs. 12,000, with the State government contributing Rs. 6,000 from its own funds. "I hope the voice of the sons of the soil will be heard," Mr. Gandhi tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/varun-asks-adityanath-to-resolve-farmers-grievances/article36423193.ece
13 September 2021||Pune,||Change of Gujarat CM is BJP’s internal matter, says Raut||The resignation of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vijay Rupani as Gujarat’s Chief Minister and the process of choosing the next CM was the BJP’s internal matter and no other party’s concern, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Sunday. “This [resignation of Mr. Rupani] is their internal matter. The high command of any party which has a majority and which is a national party has the right to change the Chief Minister of a particular State [where the party has power] as they please…earlier, the CMs of Uttarakhand and Karnataka were changed, and now it is Gujarat’s turn,” he said. Mr. Raut opined that the change may have been effected by the BJP with an eye on future electoral preparations or some other reason. Sanjay Raut, who is the party’s chief spokesperson and the executive editor of the Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana , further said that the Shiv Sena would be contesting the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Goa slated to be held in February 2022. He said the Sena planned to field candidates in 80-100 seats in U.P. (which has a 403 member Assembly), while it will contest 20-21 seats in the 40-seat Goa Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/change-of-gujarat-cm-is-bjps-internal-matter-says-raut/article36423201.ece
13 September 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC nod for marriage registration via video link||In a landmark decision, the Delhi High Court has ruled that marriages can be registered in the virtual presence of parties, noting it “cannot allow a rigid interpretation of the statute to prevent citizens from exercising their rights”. Justice Rekha Palli remarked that the Delhi (Compulsory Registration of Marriage) Order, 2014, which made registration of marriages solemnised in Delhi compulsory, needed reinterpretation to “encourage parties to easily get their marriages registered”. “In a little over half a decade, since the Registration Order was notified, the universe has undergone a sea change but the Registering Authority, while exercising its power and jurisdiction under the Registration Order is refusing to recognise the reality that with the technology as is available today, web portals and video conferencing have become almost the norm,” the High Court said. “In fact, if not for the acceptance of video conferencing as the norm, this court and the judicial system in this country would have come to a grinding halt,” it added. The High Court’s observation came while allowing a U.S.-based Indian couple’s plea seeking to register their marriage here through video conferencing. The couple got married at Delhi on December 6, 2001 as per Hindu rites and ceremonies. The couple said they now required a marriage registration certificate for grant of a green card in the U.S., but due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic they were unable to travel to India. The High Court clarified that the parties seeking registration of their marriage under the Registration Order, will have to submit a physical copy of their application through their attorney and enter personal appearance, as and when required, through video conferencing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-hc-nod-for-marriage-registration-via-video-link/article36423202.ece
13 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Saudi, Iranian Foreign Ministers to visit India||A week after hosting intelligence and security chiefs of U.S. and Russia, New Delhi is preparing for visits by the Saudi and Iranian Foreign Ministers, officials confirmed, as part of a series of engagements aimed at “broad-basing” discussions on Afghanistan with partner countries. According to sources, newly appointed Iranian Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian was due to travel to Delhi on Monday, but his visit has been “postponed” due to scheduling issues and the upcoming summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, where he is expected to meet External Affairs Minister S. Jaishanakr, with a visit to India at an “early date” in the future . Meanwhile Saudi Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud is expected in New Delhi this weekend, for his first visit to India as Foreign Minister. While both engagements are expected to focus on bilateral issues, the developments in Afghanistan will be a key component, as they have been in bilateral conversations with partners in Europe and Australia in the past few weeks. Officials said the outreach by the rival countries in West Asia indicates that all partner countries want to speak to India and vice versa. While the new Iranian government has been keen to send its minister to discuss taking the relationship ahead, particularly on connectivity projects, the Saudi government and the UAE have “much common ground” with the Modi government on both bilateral and regional issues. Unlike in the previous Taliban regime in 1996, this time around Saudi Arabia and UAE have not recognised or kept embassies open in Kabul after the Taliban takeover, while Iran has maintained its embassy in Kabul and has maintained close contacts with the Taliban. Speaking to the Iranian Foreign Minister over the telephone last week, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had spoken about the situation in Afghanistan and their shared position on the need for an inclusive and representative government in Kabul, a message aimed at the Taliban that announced an interim cabinet including many designated terrorists. Mr. Jaishankar also thanked Iran’s facilitation of India’s evacuation flights from Afghanistan that had needed to overfly Iran and bypass Pakistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/saudi-iranian-foreign-ministers-to-visit-india/article36423181.ece

A number of Trinamool Congress leaders took to social media accusing Mr. Adityanath of “stealing images from infrastructure seen in Bengal”. “Transforming UP for @myogiadityanath means stealing images from infrastructure seen in Bengal under @MamataOfficial’s leadership and using them as his own! Looks like the ‘DOUBLE ENGINE MODEL’ has MISERABLY FAILED in BJP’s strongest state and now stands EXPOSED for all!,” Trinamool Congress general secretary Abhishek Banerjee tweeted. A number of Ministers of the West Bengal government, including Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim, said that the Maa Flyover, which had been shown in the advertisement was the pride of Kolkata and completed under the Trinamool Congress regime. “Previously, the BJP used photos from failures of law and order of their States to spread misinformation about West Bengal. Now they use photos of the flyover built under the leadership of #MamataBanerjee and under my chairmanship of KMDA to advertise for the ‘development’ in U.P.,” Mr. Hakim said. The advertisement “Transforming Uttar Pradesh Under Yogi Adityanath” carried on Sunday in an English language publication has a cutout of Mr. Adityanath and in the background is the Maa flyover. Publication’s apology As the controversy raged on social media, the publication that carried the advertisement admitted the error and added that the image had been removed in all digital editions of the paper. “A wrong image was inadvertently included in the cover collage of the advertorial on Uttar Pradesh produced by the marketing department of the newspaper. The error is deeply regretted, and the image has been removed in all digital editions of the paper,” a tweet by the publication said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-govt-ad-uses-photo-of-flyover-in-kolkata/article36423220.ece

In 2016 when Anandiben Patel had suddenly resigned as Chief Minister, then BJP President and now Home Minister Amit Shah was authorised to choose her successor and he had picked Mr. Rupani, who was also a first time legislator then. “The message is loud and clear: it’s Anandiben who has prevailed and got a person of her choice at the helm as Rupani did not inspire confidence in the party leadership to face the polls with him at the wheel,” a senior party leader and former minister said. He added that the Patidars have been placated by the party now. The Patidars form the backbone of the BJP in Gujarat as the party’s first Chief Minister in 1995 when it came to power for the first time was Keshubhai Patel, a Patidar leader from Saurashtra region. The BJP is also expected to make drastic changes in the new cabinet and field fresh faces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhupendra-patel-to-be-next-gujarat-cm/article36423170.ece

However, the police have released a series of videos that showed proper ablution and the burial of the Hurriyat leader being carried out by locals, policemen and a few relatives. There are no independent pictures of the funeral as photojournalists were barred from covering the event.

He entered politics in the 1960s when the political scenario in the country was completely different and there was predominantly just one ideology in the country. Yet, he chose a different path for him and surprised everyone by winning the Lok Sabha poll in 1977.” The Prime Minister termed the first death anniversary of Ram Vilas Paswan an emotional day for him as he not only remembered him as a close friend but also “feels the void he had left in Indian politics”. High praise “In the six years as a Minister in the NDA government, he took many effective steps in the field of consumer rights and public distribution system,” Mr. Modi said, describing Ram Vilas Paswan as a “great son of the nation, Bihar’s pride and a strong voice for social justice”. “For the young who wish to join politics or serve the nation through politics, Ram Vilas Paswan’s life can teach them a lot. He always relied on communication and cordiality and that was the reason he maintained good relations with all leaders across party lines. He was a man of the masses,” the Prime Minister added in his letter, which was shared by Chirag Paswan on social media. “You have epitomised my father’s entire life in your words to honour his contributions to the society and demonstrated your love for him. May the affection and blessings always remain like this,” wrote Mr. Chirag Paswan. Mr. Chirag Paswan’s estranged uncle and Union Minister Mr. Paras turned up at the event but remained silent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chirag-warms-to-lok-janshakti-party-reunion/article36423182.ece
13 September 2021||new Delhi,||NEERI transfers RT-PCR tech to MSME Ministry||The Nagpur-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has transferred the know-how of indigenously developed Saline Gargle RT-PCR technique to the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) for commercialising it, a statement said on Sunday. The Saline Gargle RT-PCR technology is simple, fast, cost-effective, patient-friendly and comfortable. It also provides instant test results and is well-suited for rural and tribal areas, given minimal infrastructure requirements, the institute said. NEERI is an institute under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). “The know-how has been transferred to the Union Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), on a non-exclusive basis. This would enable the innovation to be commercialised and licensed to all capable parties, including private, government and various rural development schemes and departments,” the statement added. The licensees are expected to set up manufacturing facilities for commercial production in the form of easily usable compact kits. In the light of the prevailing pandemic situation and a possible third wave of COVID-19, CSIR-NEERI fast-tracked the know-how transfer process to potential licensees for its wider dissemination across the nation. The ceremonial transfer of the standard operating procedure and know-how of the Saline Gargle RT-PCR technique was done in the presence of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on September 11. “The Saline Gargle RT-PCR method needs implementation across the nation, especially in resource-poor rural and tribal areas. This would result in faster and more citizen-friendly testing,” Mr. Gadkari said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/neeri-transfers-rt-pcr-tech-to-msme-ministry/article36423218.ece

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Nammazhvar’s primacy||Nammazhvar is referred to as prapanna jana kootasthar, which means chief of all prapannas, that is Sri Vaishnavas. There were other Azhvars who preceded Nammazhvar. Why was not one of them called so? A simple example would help one understand the logic behind this. We talk of gotras like Viswamitra for instance. These sages, obviously, would have had ancestors. Why then do we not name the gotra after them? A person’s name is used only when he has brought great honours to his family. So a kula, or a gotra is named after the most illustrious person of that clan. In the case of the Azhvars, all of them had composed verses in praise of Lord Narayana. But their works were lost to the world and were rediscovered only because of Nammazhvar, elaborated M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse. Vaishnavite Acharya Nathamuni once heard pilgrims sing ten verses of Nammazhvar’s in praise of the deity Aravamudhan of Kumbakonam. In Nammazhvar’s Thiruvaimozhi, at the end of every decad, there is an 11th verse, which mentions Kurugur Sadagopan as the author. Nammazhvar was also known as Sadagopan and belonged to Kurugur. So Nathamuni knew that Kurugur Sadagopan was the author of the verses. The eleventh verse also says that these ten verses are part of Nammazhvar’s 1000 verses. So now Nathamuni knew that Kurugur Sadagopan had composed 1000 verses. So he went to Kurugur. There he met a descendant of Madurakavi Azhvar, who in turn had been Nammazhvar’s disciple. And when he recited Madurakavi’s verses in praise of Nammazhvar, the latter taught him not only his Thiruvaimozhi, but the works of the other Azhvars as well. Thus the Divya Prabandham was brought back to light. No wonder Nammazhvar is called chief of the Sri Vaishnavas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nammazhvars-primacy/article36423214.ece

13 September 2021||New Delhi,||NCAER head predicts 10% growth||The Indian economy is expected to grow around 10% during the current financial year on the likelihood of fewer COVID-linked supply disruptions and buoyancy in the global economy, said Poonam Gupta, Director General of the economic think tank, the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER). The real challenge, however, would be to sustain a growth rate of 7-8% in the years to come, Ms. Gupta said. “We could see annual growth in the ballpark range of about 10%. The reasons for this perceived optimism are: fewer supply disruptions; increased pent-up demand in the traditional and contact-intensive services; and a buoyant global economy,” she said. “Even so, if two pandemic years are taken together, there would be a very small net growth. In other words, the economy at the end of 2021-22 would be only slightly larger than at the end of 2019-20,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ncaer-head-predicts-10-growth/article36423165.ece

Identified as Sahidul Ali, a resident of Roumari in the district, he was the 24th suspected or confirmed criminal to have been shot since May 10, when the Himanta Biswa Sarma government took charge in Assam. District officials said the local police had received a tip-off about a six-member group travelling on three motorcycles from Bongaigaon to Bilasipara. Barricades were laid at several places on the highway accordingly. The group of dacoits were caught between a barricade in the Chapar area and a police team chased them. “Our men fired nine rounds after the dacoits opened fire. One of them fell from a motorcycle after being shot. He was taken to the hospital where he was declared brought dead,” a sub-inspector of the local police station said. The five others managed to flee. A 9 mm pistol, two live bullets and two shells of bullets fired were recovered from the spot where Ali had fallen from the motorcycle, police said.

13 September 2021||Guwahati,||Assam groups plan protest against dam||More than 20 organisations have announced a joint movement against a mega hydropower project being built by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) on the Arunachal Pradesh-Assam border. Work on the 2000 MW Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project at Gerukamukh was started in 2006 but halted in 2011 following protests amid fears of ecological damage and loss of livelihoods. Construction had resumed more than a year ago during the COVID-19 lockdown. “We have decided on a string of protests, including blockade of the project site, against the NHPC from September 20. So far, 22 organisations have expressed support,” Asom Jatiyabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad (AJYCP) leader Palash Changmai said. The AJYCP on Saturday organised a public meeting where geological and hydrological experts underlined the threat to areas downstream of the NHPC project. Leaders of the 22 organisations attended the meeting. According to the AJYCP, work on the project was resumed without consulting 965 villages across four districts downstream of the project, as had been agreed upon in 2014.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-groups-plan-protest-against-dam/article36423217.ece
13 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Only 54% public buildings are disabled-friendly, govt. tells HC||The Director for the Welfare of the Differently Abled has informed the Madras High Court that of the 49,550 public buildings in Tamil Nadu, only 26,769 had ramps and hand-rails at the main entrance. Further, only 21,063 had accessible vehicle parking space and just 13,035 buildings had been provided with accessible staircase. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu were informed that data collected from government departments as well as the State-run universities revealed that 24,060 public buildings alone had drinking water facilities accessible to the disabled and only 22,339 had the disabled-friendly toilets. Though 40,476 buildings had doors that could be accessed freely by the disabled, only 1,209 had elevators with Braille raised numbers on the control panel. A small number of 1,470 buildings had tactile floors and 2,362 buildings had been provided with signage, read a status report filed before the first Division Bench. The report was filed in response to a public interest litigation petition filed by visually challenged lawyer M. Karpagam of Chennai through her counsel R. Prabhakaran. It stated that the Police Department had claimed that all its 839 buildings had ramps, hand-rails, parking space, accessible staircase and drinking water facilities. Director Johny Tom Varghese said some departments and institutions like Anna University were to provide the data and steps were afoot to collect responses from all public offices. At present, the Public Works Department (PWD) maintains the maximum number of 45,782 government buildings, the court was informed. Of those PWD buildings, only 23,856 had ramps and hand-rails; 18,024 had accessible parking space; 10,376 had accessible staircase; 36,031 had accessible doors; 21,064 had drinking water facilities; 333 had Braille raised number on elevator control panels; 20,130 had the disabled-friendly toilets; 934 had tactile floors; and 1,522 had signage. Old buildings The Director said he had issued a notice suo motu to the PWD on August 19 and received a reply on August 31 highlighting the practical difficulties faced by it in retrofitting buildings constructed before 2017. The PWD had said provision of accessible ramps and toilets with sliding doors would disrupt the stability of the old buildings. “In some buildings, the 1:12 ratio for construction of ramps cannot be satisfied, leading to the construction of steep and narrow ramps, which are difficult for the disabled to use,” the report read. It, however, stated that 85.3% buildings constructed after 2017 had accessible toilets, 89.5% had ramps and 88% had accessible doors. In a nutshell, Mr. Varghese said, 54% of the public buildings could be accessed by the disabled and about 45% of the buildings constructed before 2017 had been retrofitted with the disabled-friendly toilets. In buildings where retrofitting was not possible, officials had been requested to attend to the needs of the disabled at the entry point. It was also brought to the notice of the court that the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, came into force only on April 19, 2017. The law requires all old public buildings to be made the disabled-friendly within five years of its coming into force, and accordingly, the deadline for retrofitting the buildings was June 15, 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-54-public-buildings-are-disabled-friendly-govt-tells-hc/article36423587.ece

13 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Work on Metro phase II project picking up pace||As the construction of phase II project of Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) picks up pace, the process to procure material has been initiated. CMRL has initiated the acquisition of hardened rails for laying tracks in two corridors — Madhavaram to Sholinganallur and Madhavaram to SIPCOT. Separate contracts According to officials, while the contractor chosen for this work would only provide the rails, another contractor would execute the work of laying tracks along these two corridors. “We have called for tenders for buying the rails. Once the process is completed and after the contract is awarded, the selected firm will begin manufacturing the rails according to our specifications and deliver them just before the work begins. Subsequently in a few weeks, we will float tenders for finalising a contractor for carrying out the work too,” an official said. The contractor would have to supply rails to cover 91.8 km for upward and downward track for the stretch between Madhavaram and SIPCOT and another 94 km for both tracks to cover the stretch from Madhavaram to Sholinganallur. Funding by JICA Sources said these hardened rails might be of Japanese make as funding for these two corridors came from Japan International Cooperative Agency (JICA). An MoU was signed to this effect sometime ago. Apart from this, the State and Union governments too would be providing funds for this project whose cost was estimated to be Rs. 61,843 crore. Construction work of the phase II project was first taken up on the Light House-Poonamallee stretch.

13 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Visually impaired students get a taste of the beautiful game||Footballers know that they need to keep their eye on the ball, at all times. But what if they cannot see? The sound of the ball and goalkeepers and coaches alerting from both ends of the pitch is what the visually-impaired work with on a football field. A three-day football residential camp organised for visually-impaired participants came to an end with football matches for both boys and girls held between Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra teams. The residential camp was organised for the first time by the Tamil Nadu Blind Football Association in Montfort School, St. Thomas Mount, near Guindy, and saw more than 80 students participating in it. P. Chandrasekar, Secretary, National Association for the Blind, said the camp had helped create opportunities to play football for visually impaired children, who usually do not get a chance to play the game. S. Rajkumar, Vice-President, Tamil Nadu Blind Football Association, said the game of football for visually impaired was played using the multi-pronged audio stimulation called ‘whoy’ (I’m coming) with the players being guided by the clinging sounds arising from the specially-made football and guided by goalkeepers and coaches to attack and defend. Francis Sebastian, head, physical education, Montfort School, and senior football coach, said the residential camp gave the students a taste of the beautiful game. The office-bearers of the Tamil Nadu Blind Football Association, wanted the State government to create sports amenities specially for visually challenged students in all blind schools in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/visually-impaired-students-get-a-taste-of-the-beautiful-game/article36423579.ece

Nagaland Governor R.N. Ravi, who will replace Mr. Purohit, is expected to assume office later this week. “Yes, there were many issues that tested everybody’s patience and perseverance as well as the sense of commitment and goodwill, but the result was always positive for all sections,” Mr. Purohit said in his message released by the Raj Bhavan. “There were points at which different sections stood on the opposite sides of the divide.” The Governor said his mind was filled with a sense of gratitude to Tamil Nadu where he found “unmitigated love” and appreciation from people in general, the bureaucracy, the academia, and most importantly the political community across a wide spectrum. “Basking in that experience, I express my most sincere gratitude towards people of all walks of life for having accepted me as an integral part of the larger society in Tamil Nadu.” Major battles Tamil Nadu saw major battles for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, he recalled. “Despite all that political acrimony, I found the State of Tamil Nadu and its people very warm and welcoming.” As a custodian of the Constitution in the State’s context, “I took certain positions as per the word of the statute. But I am very happy to place on record that the people of all walks of life... — from the streets of Tamil Nadu to the haloed chambers of politics — understood the correct position and lent their support to my decisions in whatever manner”. Recalling his tenure as the Chancellor of the State universities, he said he had taken certain decisions in the larger interest of consolidating the system of higher learning and received full cooperation from all quarters. His stint gave him an opportunity to know the State’s rich cultural, religious and historical traditions. He concluded: “ Jai Hind, Jai Tamil Nadu .”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/banwarilal-purohit-bids-farewell-to-tamil-nadu/article36423588.ece

With support from The Energy and Resources Institute, the civic body plans to reduce the flow of plastic waste from the city into the ocean. The civic body has already created barriers in Cooum and Adyar rivers to trap plastic waste, cleaning these stretches at regular intervals. However, plastic waste continues to flow into the sea. River banks, including those of the Cooum, have huge quantities of plastic waste trapped in the soil and these are washed into the sea whenever there is flood. As a first step to prevent this, the civic body is planning to resume strict enforcement of plastic ban in all divisions. Shopkeepers had been warned about illegal use of plastic bags last week. The civic body will create awareness about plastic pollution among city residents. “We will sensitise communities near the beaches. A massive drive to prevent dumping of plastic waste in the sea will begin shortly. Residents will be asked to stop dumping waste in the Buckingham Canal, the Cooum, the Kosasthalaiyar and the Adyar,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-draws-up-plans-to-stop-flow-of-plastic-waste-into-the-sea/article36423572.ece

And this is apart from the time S. Roshini spends for studies. The 17-year-old resident of Kannagi Nagar has just returned from New Delhi with two gold medals in silambam at the Youth Games Federation of India. She performed under the silambam single stick and silambam weapon categories and had to showcase her skills in twirling the stick and sword for a minute-and-a-half each. The judges gave marks based on stance, speed, bhavala (the way she does it), face reaction and the stamina of the participant. And despite time spent on practice, she excels in academics as well. “My school teachers and HM understand and sanction leave when I require for competitions. My mother, Maheshwari, has been encouraging me to do whatever I want. She works as a domestic help and has been managing to spend on my passion for eight years now,” said the Class XII student of Thoraipakkam Government Higher Secondary School, who has now begun coaching for boxing too. However, leave from school and support at home are not enough for children from such difficult backgrounds. Her masters M. Ayyanar and M. Shankar said this year not many of their students were able to participate in the national level due to lack of sponsors. “The children are capable enough to go on to the international level, that too would require sponsorships. Unfortunately, nobody takes this traditional sport seriously. It keeps their body and minds fit and helps when it comes to sports quota seats in colleges,” said Mr. Shankar. It would be great if Chief Minister M.K. Stalin can create a common fund for such purposes. “Without support from any government agency, we are forced to seek financial assistance to teach children the traditional martial arts of the Tamils,” they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-girl-wins-two-gold-medals-in-silambam/article36423577.ece

For two days now, they have been seeing dead fish, including madava, keluthi and kendai floating in the murky water. R. Ranganathan, a resident, said the water was frothing and had a chemical smell about it. “Some 30 families from our village go fishing in the canal and we are worried about this. The canal joins the Palar near our village, which means this murky, polluted water will pollute the river too,” he said and added that two years ago crabs at the crab fattening facility put up by the villagers had died because of this pollution. M.D. Dayalan of the Indhiya Meenavar Sangam said that there were a couple of aquaculture farms in the neighbourhood and these were letting out untreated cleaning liquids on a regular basis. “These chemicals are causing the deaths of fish in the canal,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishkill-worries-residents-of-uyyalikuppam/article36423591.ece

13 September 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||State govt. urged to take over sand distribution||The Tamil Nadu government should take complete responsibility for distribution of sand to consumers and prohibit private parties from lifting sand from the riverbed - a resolution to this effect was passed at the ninth CITU State conference of Construction Workers’ Federation of India (Tamil Nadu) held here on Sunday. Various other resolutions were passed at the conference which was inaugurated by Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan. The meeting said that only when the State government took over distribution, the price of the construction material (sand) would become affordable to consumers. Presently the prices had not only touched a new high, but also encouraged private players to indulge in illegal acts and malpractices. By stocking the sand in depots, smuggling activities could be curbed. Moreover, the government could also promote alternatives to sand. Opposing the Union government vehemently, the conference, in another resolution, said that under the guise of inviting a ‘lot of industries’ to invest, the BJP-led government supported only some business houses at the cost of the working class. The laws, which were worker-friendly, have turned in favour of employers. Under the guise of streamlining the public sector, it had been selling off profit-making and navratna units. In his address, Mr. Venkatesan said that the role played by the construction workers was important, as their skills could be seen at the excavations at Keeladi and other sites. Other speakers appealed to the State government to revive the welfare boards for different categories of workers, as they had remained idle for almost a decade during the AIADMK rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-government-urged-to-take-total-control-of-sand-distribution/article36423843.ece

It has a seive to let out excess water and a portion of the tank, including the bund, lies in the neighbouring Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu. Legend has it that on hearing that famine was prevalent in those days in the area, Bangari, a dancer in the area, constructed the canal at her expense while her sister Singari bore the expenses to raise the bunds. In the 1970s, the lake served an ayacut of 1,740 hectares (1,664 hectares in Puducherry and 76 hectares in Tamil Nadu). Now, the tank has hit dead storage. A large part of the lake’s 1,756 acres has turned into grassland due to uncontrolled encroachments and farming activities. Its maximum depth has declined from 3.60 m a few decades ago to 0.10 m because of human intervention. According to V. Chandrasekhar, president of the Bangaru Vaikal Neerathara Kootamaippu, “The lake has now almost dried up due to inadequate maintenance of feeder channels. The lake has not been properly desilted since 1980. Water hyacinth has spread on the northern parts of the canal while villagers have been diverting water to irrigate their fields on the lake. The entry point of the canal joining the lake has been encroached at several places.” He alleged that the Revenue Department had issued pattas inside the water spread area of the lake. As many as 136 persons were using the water spread area for farming, raising single and multi-harvest crops. This unbridled rise in encroachments by the patta holders posed a serious threat to the lake. The patta holders were illegally diverting water through the Nathamedu channel to increase their cropping pattern, resulting in serious damage to the sluices and weirs of the tank, he said. “Though the government inaugurated a project to strengthen the bunds near the Aranganur sluice last year, no action has been taken to repair the sluice gates. A sum of Rs. 1.27 crore allotted by the government for the construction of a bridge over the surplus weir also remains unutilised. The rampant encroachments have already resulted in the lake losing its identity and illegal fishing has only compounded the problem,” says Vivekanandan, a farmer of Karaimedu. The auctioning of fishing rights in the lake was stopped around seven years ago. But a section of locals have been indulging in illegal fishing by damaging the sluices and violating the ban order. Though repeated representations have been made to authorities concerned, it has failed to evoke any response, say farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-years-of-neglect-bahour-lake-is-on-its-last-legs/article36423964.ece
13 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Venkaiah Naidu lays stress on tapping solar energy||Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday advocated the need to make solar rooftop plants, solar water heaters and rainwater harvesting mandatory for government organisations and large buildings. Dedicating to the nation the 1.5 MW rooftop solar power plant commissioned at Jipmer, Mr. Naidu suggested greater adoption of rooftop solar plants, along with ensuring sufficient light and ventilation, in industries and big establishments like universities and government buildings. In this regard, he appealed to all States and local bodies to consider adopting the model building by-laws for new constructions. He also called upon large institutions and public sector organisations to strive towards sustainability in their operations by using renewable energy. Noting that India was fast moving towards becoming the global leader for ‘energy transition’ and had set the recent landmark of 100 gigawatt of installed renewable energy capacity, the Vice-President called for State, Central and Union Territory governments to work together as Team India to popularise the tapping of solar energy and bring about greater awareness among people on the benefits of installing solar panels on their rooftops. He highlighted the significance of rooftop solar plants in continuing the momentum of this energy shift by virtue of their use of idle spaces on buildings, generating power close to the point of consumption and reducing transmission losses. He called for massive campaigns to publicise the subsidy programmes for solar rooftop systems and the resultant electricity savings. Referring to the lessons from the pandemic, Mr. Naidu underscored the importance of ventilation and air circulation in buildings and the need to create living and working spaces with ample ventilation and natural light in order to maintain good health. “Sunlight is a natural disinfectant. Our ancestors understood this – it reflected in their planning and construction of houses,” the Vice-President said. These principles used to be part of our architecture but unfortunately the borrowing of Western models led to a practice where “everything is closed, including the mind also”. He also pointed to the health consequences of people living in congested clusters shut out from natural sunlight and fresh air. Mr. Naidu commended medical institutions like Jipmer for showing extraordinary resolve during the pandemic and rising to the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/venkaiah-naidu-lays-stress-on-tapping-solar-energy/article36423590.ece

13 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||DMK submits demand to Vice-President seeking Statehood for Puducherry||The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on Sunday submitted a memorandum to Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu about granting Statehood to Puducherry. In his representation, Opposition leader and DMK convenor R. Siva said the demand for Statehood was the democratic right of the people of Puducherry. “It is a travesty to democracy that the Union Territory has not been accorded Statehood even after years of continuous demand by its people and unanimous resolutions passed by the Assembly,” he said. During the time when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, a committee headed by former Union Minister Sushma Swaraj had looked into the issue of Statehood for Puducherry. “In a meeting, she even went on to describe the pathetic powerless state of the Legislature Assembly as ridiculous,” the memorandum said. The DMK also urged the Vice-President to prevail upon the Centre to stop the move to privatise the Electricity Department. Its privatisation would deprive the local people from getting job opportunities in the department. The party also sought a waiver of legacy loans, 25% reservation for local students in Pondicherry University, employment for local people in the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) and support for industrial activity in the Union Territory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-submits-demand-to-vice-president-seeking-statehood-for-puducherry/article36423954.ece

13 September 2021||SALEM/Chennai,TAMIL NADU||19-year-old student found dead at home hours before NEET||A 19-year-old boy allegedly killed himself at his home near Mettur in Salem district on Sunday, hours before the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), which he was preparing to attempt for the third time. However, no suicide note was found among his belongings. The police said the deceased was identified as Dhanush, 19, who lived with his family at Koolaiyur. He had cleared the Plus Two examination in 2019 and attempted to clear NEET in the past two years. Dhanush could not clear the previous two attempts and was preparing for the examination until late on Saturday, police sources said. When his parents went to wake him up in the early hours of Sunday, they found him dead. The Karumalaikudal police rushed to the spot, recovered the body and sent it to the Mettur government hospital. They have registered a case. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin condoled the death and appealed to students against taking the extreme step. He said the Assembly would pass a Bill seeking a “permanent exemption for the State from NEET” on September 13. In a statement, he said, “Students need not be disheartened. This government has the responsibility to ensure your future is better. It will continue the legal struggle until the Union government withdraws NEET.” Mr. Stalin said the student took the extreme step because he was unable to clear the test even after two attempts, a plight of several rural and poor urban students. He said the Union government’s “indifference and obstinacy” were driving students to death. Irregularities in the conduct of NEET did not help to change its stand. “This further strengthens the case for bringing education to the State list.” Homage paid Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami, along with AIADMK leaders and MLAs, paid homage to Dhanush at his residence. On Twitter, Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK government had pushed the student to death and asked what had happened to the party’s election promise to get NEET cancelled. Mr. Palaniswami said he had continuously demanded that the government clarify whether or not NEET would be held this year and prepare the students for the test if it was to be held. But the government never gave a clear reply. Had proper training been given to students, Dhanush’s life could have been saved, he said. DMK MLA and Youth Wing leader Udhayanidhi Stalin, along with Ministers Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, S. Raghupathy and V. Meyyanathan and party MLA R. Rajendran, paid homage to Dhanush. Mr. Udhayanidhi Stalin offered a solatium of Rs. 10 lakh to the family. He told journalists that while students were protesting against NEET, the Union government was adamant on conducting it. Both students and parents were severely affected by NEET. Actor-politician Kamal Haasan spoke to the family on the phone and conveyed his condolences. BJP blames DMK BJP State president K. Annamalai blamed the DMK for the death of the student. In a tweet, he said the DMK was politicising the issue. “This exam has passed the Supreme Court scrutiny and in 2020, had seen the highest number of Tamil students passing. @Arivalayam [DMK] which is playing politics with NEET is directly responsible for his death.” He said the DMK should stop its false propaganda that was causing confusion and fear among students. PMK Youth Wing leader and Rajya Sabha member Anbumani Ramadoss said the Union government must give consent to the Bill passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly that seeks exemption of the State from NEET. He urged the State government to exert continuous pressure on the Centre. In a statement, he said he was saddened by the death of Dhanush and pointed out that 14 students had so far died in the State. “Last year, at least three students committed suicide the day before NEET. Dhanush had written NEET twice and could not get a seat. “It is understandable how much stress the exam must have caused him. NEET has become a killer of students,” he said. Tamil Maanila Congress president G.K. Vasan expressed shock over the death and said students should be strong-hearted and should not take any drastic step.

13 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||Inner party tensions to fore at BJP meet||Intra-party tensions reportedly reignited at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s core committee meeting in Kochi on Sunday. By some accounts, at least two leaders, purportedly P.K. Krishnadas and Sobha Surendran, pushed for a leadership change in the State to repair the party's tattered image. No BJP leader was available for comment. But the closed-door conference triggered media speculation that the two leaders tore into the State leadership for the poor showing in the 2021 Assembly elections. They also demanded an organisational revamp based on merit and not on factional loyalties. The meeting was of some political import as the committee convened in the wake of BJP vice president A.N. Radhakrishnan's fact-finding report on the party's dismal electoral performance. The report remained largely confidential. Nevertheless, some insiders claimed that "over-reliance" on the Bharatiya Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) votes, which gravitated overwhelmingly to the LDF, had put paid to the NDA's hope of increasing its vote share despite contesting in 115 seats. Role of Nair community Moreover, they felt the BJP's election strategy had offered little incentive for the Nair community, the party's traditional base, to choose the NDA over UDF electorally. For one, the BJP could not capitalise on the Centre's extension of reservation in jobs and seats in publicly funded educational institutions for economically weaker sections among the forward castes. BJP leaders from the Vishwakarma and Nadar communities also reportedly felt sidelined. The party could not reap significant political dividends from the Central Travancore Christian community, despite its "newfound affinity" with the security and economic agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Campaign failure Consequently, despite the sizeable treasure and national effort invested in campaigning, the BJP was beaten into third place by the incumbent LDF and "shaky" UDF. Except for recurrent and blunt attacks on the LDF and parroting about protecting Sabarimala tradition, the BJP's campaign had little else to offer. Often, the party's electioneering appeared strident. “A Vajpayee kind of moderateness as reflected in the candidature of technocrat E. Sreedharan might have resonated more among Kerala voters,” a party person said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/inner-party-tensions-to-fore-at-bjp-meet/article36423232.ece
13 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||BJP seeks Central protection for Bishop||The Bharatiya Janata Party has sought Central protection for Mar Joseph Kallarangatt, Bishop of Pala. The prelate had come under the spotlight for his “cautionary sermon” on radical Islamists “using narcotic drugs” to corrupt Catholic and non-Muslim youth. In a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP State general secretary George Kurian said the metropolitan had earned the ire of the ruling front and the Opposition for speaking out the truth and voicing the growing insecurity among Christians and Hindus about the rise of radical Islam in Kerala. Mr. Kurian said neither the Bishop nor the Christian-Hindu community could get any relief from the government or Opposition in the State. “Many of the jihadist elements are active workers of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Congress in Kerala,” he said. Mr. Kurian alleged that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheeshan had warned the Bishop of “consequences” for speaking the truth. He said former State Police Chief Loknath Behera had flagged the growing presence of Islamists in Kerala and said the State was a recruiting ground for terrorists. March taken out Emboldened by the support, a group of Muslim extremists had marched to the Bishop House at Pala to “attack the prelate,” he alleged. The developments have “rendered the situation volatile,” he said. He requested Mr. Shah to take necessary steps to protect the “Bishop and the Christian community.”  Bishop can get no relief from the government or Opposition in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-seeks-central-protection-for-bishop/article36423233.ece
13 September 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||TMB celebrates centenary, wins Finance Minister’s praise||Digitisation in the banking sector would result in a rapid growth and use of greater technology would enhance ease of doing business for the banks and its customers across the country, Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said here on Sunday. Speaking at the inauguration of the centenary year celebrations of Tamilnad Mercantile Bank Limited (TMB) here, she said digitisation could not be avoided and private banks such as the TMB, which had a rich tradition, should adapt to the next generation technology. Gone were the days when people asked for opening of new bank branches. With digitisation, the entire business could be done irrespective of the geographic location, she said. The Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan programme had made it possible for the marginalised people in society to lead a meaningful life today. Quoting the Prime Minister, she said that no matter whether he/she had money, the government should help them open an account first. With the Rupay card and insurance cover, the scheme had become a reality that several thousands of people selling on road-side approached the banks for loans. The Jan Dhan programme, Ms. Sitharaman said had greatly helped the micro-segments avoid borrowing from private money lenders and thus the economically weaker sections benefited in a big way. “Business is not just the prerogative of the rich, but should be possible even for the poor,” she stressed and lauded the role of the TMB in uplifting the poor by giving them small advances at nominal rates. Showering encomiums on the TMB’s growth, the Finance Minister said doing business in the right way for 100 years was a big challenge. Even when the bank faced some issues and which appeared like a storm, it sorted them out amicably. “I wish TMB many more 100 years,” she noted. Praising the Nadar community for their financial discipline in doing business, she said the TMB, which was started as a Nadar Bank, had universal acceptance today in the banking sector. Started in Raja Veedhi in 1921 in Thoothukudi, the bank has Rs. 41,000 crore as deposits and Rs. 32,000 crore in advances. Referring to TMB MD and CEO, K.V. Ramamurthy, who in his welcome address, touched upon the bank’s focus on priority sector advances and its tradition in catering to the farmers, small traders and MSMEs, the Finance Minister said the TMB stood as an example to other banks in Tamil Nadu. She said that after 2014, when many public sector banks were faced with problems such as NPA (non-performing assets), the Centre stepped in. Today, prompt corrective action had restored normalcy in the PSBs. The policies of the Centre such as the Emergency Credit Guarantee Liquidity Scheme for the MSMEs during the pandemic had made them come out of the crisis. Quoting the Prime Minister, she said, banking was the right of every individual and hence she appealed to all the banks to focus on giving advances to the economically weaker sections as the economy would grow in an even pattern. Vaccine dose Ms. Sitharaman said that in the last 8 to 9 months, the nation had administered the vaccine to 73 crore people, who had taken at least one dose. This was a big achievement and the Centre focused on the hospitals in smaller cities for enhancing bed strength and oxygen availability and among others. TMB vice-president A. Chidambaranathan proposed a vote of thanks. On the occasion, the Finance Minister released a postal card and a stamp marking the centenary year celebrations. She also flagged off a mobile vaccination campaign vehicle and a mobile digi-lobby vehicle which would go to customers’ doorsteps.  Private banks such as the TMB, which have a rich tradition, should adapt to the next generation technology||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tmb-celebrates-centenary-wins-finance-ministers-praise/article36423567.ece

Social Welfare Minister Geetha Jeevan, who laid the foundation for the proposed park in the presence of Collector K Senthil Raj, Corporation Commissioner Charu Shree and other officials, said the park would be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs. 29.31 crore. The officials said the mega park would be built under the Smart Cities Mission. It would have a mini-theatre, science zone, energy zone, Mathematics zone, engineering and material science, space zone, evolution park models, indoor exhibits, science on a sphere and among others. It would be a good revenue generating model and also attract visitors, especially students from other neighbouring cities. Moreover, for a city such as Thoothukudi, the STEM Park and the learning centre would be a boon as it lacked any worthy entertainment for residents, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stem-park-to-come-up-at-a-cost-of-rs-2931-crore/article36423684.ece
13 September 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Civic body issues ultimatum to fish traders||Tiruchi Corporation has gone ahead with its decision to demolish the existing fish cum meat market behind the Gandhi Market so as to construct a modern building, by issuing an instruction to traders to shift with effect from Monday. The Corporation has made it clear that fish and mutton stalls will no longer function at the existing building, which was said to have been constructed about 50 years ago, by putting up a notice that the traders could henceforth conduct business at Diamond Jubilee Bazaar. Those among the traders who have had a long-standing association with the fish market, are a worried lot. “It is hard to digest that the 20 square feet stall that fed my family for five decades will be razed down. I am sentimentally attached to it,” says a 60-year-old fish trader. Though it was announced that the market would not function from Monday none of the traders have so far shifted operation to the alternative site as yet. However, some agree that they have no other option but to shift their business to a new location in a few days. “We cannot drag the issue further. We want an assurance that all existing traders will be accommodated in the new building. Though we have been demanding it for long, the officials have not given any assurance,” says another trader. A senior Corporation official told The Hindu that the new modern meat market to be built at an estimate of Rs. 13 crore would address all issues faced by customers and traders. The existing market had served the people for more than 50 years and it was in a dilapidated condition. It would be demolished any time so as to start the construction work. Alternative arrangements have been made for the fish and meat traders to carry out their routine business until completion of the building work. While the fish traders have been asked to move to Diamond Jubilee Bazaar, poultry and meat traders have been allotted space at the Corporation’s abattoir. The new meat market would be built on 25,000 sq ft at the same spot, where the current market was located. There would be 148 stalls and it would have two floors with separate provisions made for fish, mutton and chicken traders. An arrangement would be in place for parking 200 two-wheelers.

13 September 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Mega vaccination camps receive overwhelming response||The mega vaccination drive held in Tiruchi district on Sunday, in line with efforts taken across the State was a mega success. While the district had set a target of 75,000 vaccinations, it exceeded the target with 1,10,332 people taking the jab, making the coverage the fourth-highest among the districts in the State on a single day. Of the over one lakh people, 82, 575 took the first dose of the vaccine, while 27,757 took the second.

In some camps in the city limits, the allotted doses ran out by noon. Announcement of prizes and the extensive awareness undertaken by the civic body may have had a role to play in the turnout, officials suspect.

Two silk saree worth Rs. 8,000 each was the first prize, an Android phone worth Rs. 7,000, a three-burner gas stove worth Rs. 3,000 and dinner vouchers worth Rs. 2,500 each for five persons were the other prizes. “We prepared for over one lakh people to take the jab, but did not expect such a good response,” Mohammed A. Hakkim, Coordinator of the city's vaccination drive told The Hindu . The details of all beneficiaries who took the jab were uploaded on Cowin in real-time and vaccination certificates were generated immediately, he added.

The priests in their representation appealed to the State government to ensure that there were no interruptions or hurdles to them as well as to their heirs in continuing their ‘kainkaryams’ at the temples. They further appealed to Mr. Nehru to take their plea to the notice of Chief Minister M. K. Stalin. Speaking to reporters later, Selvakabila Sivachariyar of Kabilarmalai said that there were more than one lakh ‘sivachaariyars’ and ‘bhattachaariyars’ who were performing poojas and rituals in temples all over the State.

13 September 2021||TIRUNELVELI/RAJAPALAYAM,TAMIL NADU||Mega campaign may take T.N. vaccine tally to 4 cr.: Minister||Health Minister Ma. Subramanian on Sunday said the day-long State-wide inoculation campaign for administration of COVID-19 vaccine was likely to take the grand tally to four crore in Tamil Nadu. The Minister, who was here to oversee the arrangements and progress in delivering the vaccine shots to the people in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Tenkasi districts, told reporters that along with the district administration and Corporation officials, the elected representatives also contributed in mobilising the public to reach the designated vaccine centres on Sunday. So far, the State had vaccinated 3.74 crore people and, with the day-long campaign, it could touch the four-crore mark. In Tirunelveli district, 951 camps were held and 62,650 vaccine vials were available. Officials were doubly cautious in at least nine districts in screening people arriving from Kerala. Kanniyakumari, Theni, Coimbatore, to name a few, and other districts were taking extra prevention methods. “As per Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s advice, we are planning to achieve 100% vaccination in the nine districts,” Mr. Subramanian said. On admission of students to AIIMS from the current academic year, he clarified that the pros and cons were explained in detail to the Centre. It would not be possible to admit students and allot them classrooms in Madurai Medical College or in any arts or private medical college. At the same time, students who came with big dreams after getting admission in AIIMS should be given fair space and infrastructure. Hence, the only way would be to expedite construction on the premises at Thoppur in Madurai district. ‘Adequate infrastructure’ The Health Minister also inspected the mega vaccination camps along with Revenue Minister, K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran, in Rajapalayam taluk in Virudhunagar district. He said the State had adequate infrastructure to pass on any number of vaccine doses supplied by the Central government to Tamil Nadu. Mr. Subramanian said the camps in Virudhunagar district received the best response among the southern districts. While the target for the district was 55,207 doses, the district managed to exceed it by around 8,000 with the available stock of vaccines. On the suicide of a medical aspirant, Mr. Subramanian said that while BJP was bent upon continuing with NEET, the AIADMK’s double standard on the issue had been exposed. ‘Resolution on NEET’ “The DMK had made the poll promise of taking all-out effort to scrap the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). After forming A.K. Rajan committee to study the impact of NEET among socially backward class students in Tamil Nadu, it has been discussed with experts,” the Minister said. “The Chief Minister will move a resolution seeking to scrap NEET in the Assembly on Monday and put pressure on the President seeking his assent to it,” Mr. Subramanian said. The Minister recalled that the then Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi, scrapped entrance examinations in the State following the recommendations of Ananthakrishnan committee. “On the same lines, we expect to do away with NEET in the coming yeas,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mega-campaign-likely-to-take-states-vaccine-tally-to-4-crore/article36423594.ece

13 September 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Mega vaccination camps held in Vellore and nearby districts||The district administrations in Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Ranipet and Tirupattur vaccinated around 2.80 lakh persons in 3,134 camps as part of the mega vaccination camp that was held on Sunday. Sunday’s coverage of 2.80 lakh persons is less than the actual projection of 3.5 lakh persons that was estimated. The difference is mainly due to the shortage of vaccines. However, alternative arrangements have been made for persons who were unable to get vaccinated on Sunday. “As our vaccine stock was exhausted, we have issued tokens for persons who missed their chance. They can get vaccinated at special camps that will be organised at the same spots for the next three days in the district,” B. Murugesh, District Collector, Tiruvannamalai, told The Hindu . Among the four districts, Tiruvannamalai organised the highest number of camps with 1,004, vaccinating 1,04,325 persons, including 26,403 who took second dose. At the mega camp, around 10% of the total population had been vaccinated. In Vellore, 978 camps were set up covering 247 villages, four town panchayats and two municipalities. Apart from government staff, more than 6,000 teachers were roped in. At the Sunday’s camp, 50,750 persons were vaccinated. Apart from this, the Vellore Corporation organised 200 camps, vaccinating 12,495 persons. District Collector, P. Kumaravel Pandian, inspected the centres in Gudiyatham, Katpadi, Anaicut and Pallikonda. The newly formed Tirupattur and Ranipet districts had 522 and 630 camps, covering 40,000 and 42,603 persons respectively. In order to ensure that all are vaccinated in the district, Tirupattur Collector Amar Kushwaha instructed officials to go for door-to-door to request people to get the jab. Only 4.4 lakh persons had been vaccinated in Tirupattur prior to the mega camp. “Of over 42,000 who were vaccinated at the mega camp, Wallajah had the highest with 7,900 persons, followed by Arakkonam,” said T. Bhaskarapandian, Collector, Ranipet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mega-vaccination-camps-held-in-vellore-and-nearby-districts/article36424014.ece
13 September 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Overwhelming response to mega vaccination camp||People above 18 years turned up with enthusiasm in large numbers on Sunday for the mega vaccination camps held across the district. The response to the camps held at 1,067 places was so overwhelming that in people had to return disappointed as the stock of vaccines got over sooner. Virudhunagar district administration had geared up to administer 1 lakh COVID doses during the mega vaccination camp, but only 65,000 doses were supplied to the district, said District Revenue Officer R. Mangalaramasubramanian. “We got good response from the people for the vaccination. They started to throng the all camps in good numbers,” said Joint Director of Health Services R. Manoharan. With the residual stocks of vials already available with the district and administering the vaccine to 11 persons with each vial, the district was able to cater to around 70,000 persons, the DRO said. The officials at the camps have collected the name and contact details of people who could not get the vaccine on Sunday. “We will give priority to these people in the coming days as more vaccine doses are expected,” the DRO said. Earlier, Collector J. Meghanath Reddy inaugurated a camp at Desabandhu grounds in the presence of Virudhunagar MLA A.R.R. Seenivasan. The camps that began around 7 a.m. were scheduled to go on till 7 p.m. However, in many places, the camps were wound up much earlier on exhaustion of doses. In some places, prizes were announced to encourage people to come forward for the vaccination. Managing Director of SIPCOT, T. Anand, who is the special officer to monitor mega vaccination camp, inspected the camps in few places in Allampatti and Soolakkarai. Those manning the camps were asked to get all details of the people coming for vaccination. Similarly, they were told to inform the people coming for first dose of vaccination about the schedule of the second dose. Dindigul Many people in Palani complained that there was no stock of the vaccines in major centres in Palani and its peripheries. According to the public, when they turned up at the Urban PHC in Palani, the staff said that there were insufficient stocks. “We had received only 20 vials of Covishield and another 20 vials of Covaxin.” Even on normal days, the PHC had 500 to 1000 vials, but on the mega campaign day, it had very little stock of less than 50 vials, they alleged. However, Health department officials said that they had organised the designated centre in a spacious area and hence, the PHC was kept open exclusively for elderly people, who could not travel long. Out of 1,225 centres in Dindigul district, Palani had 60 vaccine centres, they added. Ramanathapuram Ramanathapuram district had so far administered vaccines to 52% of the eligible population, said Collector J.U. Chandrakala on Sunday. After inspecting the vaccination programme at a centre, she told reporters that door-to-door mobilisation had helped in a large people turning up at the vaccination centres from early morning. “We are planning to have similar camps every Sunday...” she added. The district, she hoped, would achieve 100 % soon in giving the doses to all the eligible people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/overwhelming-response-to-mega-vaccination-camp/article36423695.ece

She was talking to reporters after reviewing the progress in implementation of development works under Aspirational District programme, along with Union Minister of State for Fisheries, L. Murugan, and officials from district administration here on Sunday. When asked about the turmoil fireworks industry was going through in recent years, she said that as a Union Minister she had intervened when the industry complained about illegal flooding of Chinese crackers in the country. With regard to ban on sale and usage of crackers in various States imposed during last Deepavali, Ms. Nirmala said that it had nothing to do with the Centre as the order was issued by the court of law. To a question on reported increase in number of school dropouts, the Union Minister said that assessment of school dropouts was difficult under the lockdown conditions where schools were closed for students of most classes. The Union Minister has advised the district administration to show progress on transactions of farm produce in the district through e-nam facility. “The farmers can find out the best price for their produce from any part of the country and sell their produce. I have asked the administration to merge 7 marketing committees in the district with e-nam,” she said. Similarly, much has to be done with creating awareness on Atal Pension Scheme and Prime Minister’s Jeevan Jyoti Bima scheme and Prime Minister’s Jeevan Suraksha Bima Scheme. Niti Ayog has promised that funds would not be a constraint in rectifying underweight issue among new born babies, the Minister said.

13 September 2021||Virudhunagar/DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Physics questions in NEET tough: students||Students who appeared for NEET on Sunday felt that while questions of Biology and Chemistry were easy, they found it difficult to answer the questions in Physics. Similarly, they felt that on those who had taken up NEET coaching could score high marks to be able to secure a medical seat. M. Balasubramanian, a student of a matriculation school of Rajapalayam, said that questions on Biology and Chemistry were a tad easier for him. “However, it was not the same case with Physics. Many questions had been from those areas which were thought not so important,” said. Balasubramanian had undergone online NEET coaching through a private institute. A female candidate said that except for Biology, both Chemistry and Physics were tough. Questions from Biology were direct and from textbook examples and for physics many were difficult to solve. She was making her second attempt after having gone through the online coaching. “Physical classroom learning could have made all the difference,” she said. Out of 2,566 candidates for whom hall-tickets were issued to sit for the examination held in nine centres, a total of 108 candidates absented themselves. In Dindigul district, 2,280 students took the examination and 91 were absent from three centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/physics-questions-in-neet-tough-students/article36423685.ece
13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Nearly 16 lakh students write NEET||The seven centres in Tiruppur district recorded 97.06% attendance. In Salem, NEET was held at 28 centres and arrangements were made for about 15,067 students to take it. In Tiruchi, the test was held at 21 centres. Of the 9,105 candidates, only 8,753 took the three-hour test. The district reported 96.1% attendance. According to an official, around 18,000 candidates had registered themselves in Chennai and around 800 were absent. As in the past, many candidates found the physics component tough, chemistry moderate and biology easy. Most first-time test-takers found physics challenging. S. Swetha, a CBSE student and first-time test-taker, said, “The questions were indirect and we spent a lot of time on that part alone. Biology and chemistry were easier and preparing with the NCERT textbooks helped.” Several State board students said they used the NCERT textbooks, besides their own textbooks and coaching classes. A group of girls from the Government Higher Secondary School at Red Hills came with their parents to a centre at Kelly’s. The girls, who took the test in Tamil, went to the centre around 11 a.m., said Sujatha Kumaravel, a parent. Last year, the school trained 60 students, but none got admission, said Elangovan, whose daughter Kanimozhi said she found biology easy. The school began online classes in July. K. Bhavani, a parent, said the school advised the students to buy the required books, which they did from Tiruvallur. The students started preparing in earnest only in the last few weeks owing to the uncertainty about NEET scores being used for admission in the State. With schools and coaching centres being shut for a large part of the 2020-21 academic year, the bulk of the preparations took place online.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nearly-16-lakh-students-write-neet/article36423563.ece

Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu, who inspected the drive at a few places in Chennai along with Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, said the campaign was meant to bring vaccination closer to people, besides creating awareness. Following the tremendous response, the State might organise similar camps once a week to significantly improve the coverage by October. Around 40,000 special camps were organised across the State. More attention was paid to the nine districts bordering Kerala, which is reporting a high number of cases. The State had supplied 29 lakh doses across all districts. A number of non-governmental organisations partnered with the government. Addressing journalists, J. Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare, said the drive demonstrated Tamil Nadu’s ability to administer a high number of doses. Apart from administering five to seven lakh doses a day, Tamil Nadu had shown that it could administer over 25 lakh doses a day through such special drives, he said. Mr. Subramanian said the Nilgiris became the first district in Tamil Nadu, and probably in the entire country, to achieve 100% coverage of the first dose. “The district has 5.14 lakh people, aged above 18. With the mega drive, the entire population has got the first dose.” The district administered 29,760 doses, according to the data available at 8.45 p.m. Chennai topped the list with 1.88 lakh doses, followed by Coimbatore with 1.52 lakh doses.

Both the BJP and the Congress are courting the regional party even as the JD(S) is keeping its option close to its chest. While the national parties have offered the post of Deputy Mayor to the JD(S), the regional party has sought the post of Mayor for the first term. Though the BJP is confident of stitching together an alliance with the JD(S) after the meeting of Revenue Minister R. Ashoka and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, JD(S) sources confirmed that the party is in talks with the Congress. The entry of former Union Minister Mallikarjuna Kharge, who has spoken to JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda, seems to have provided options to the regional party. “Though we wanted to keep an equal distance from both national parties, the fractured mandate is forcing our hands. We have asked for the post of Mayor for one term and two standing committees. Besides, we are asking for funds to develop wards being represented by our councillors,” JD(S) spokesperson T.A. Sharavana said. “Mr. Kharge has urged for the secular forces to remain together.” Similarly, he said that the hung Doddaballapur CMC where the Congress has emerged as the single largest party, is also being discussed. Meanwhile, BJP sources said that though the party was confident of coming to power in Kalaburagi, the party is cagey over Mr. Kharge’s relationship with Mr. Gowda. “Both parties have made a similar offer to the JD(S). We are hopeful of JD(S) leaning towards us,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kcc-suspense-continues-over-jds-move/article36423531.ece
13 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19: Two different areas in State see opposite trends||As Karnataka continues to report below 1,000 COVID-19 cases, much to the relief of citizens, the government, and the health machinery alike, two parts of the State are sporting opposite trends. While some districts in north Karnataka are reporting few or no cases, those in the coastal belt are making up for much of the total cases, along with Bengaluru Urban. As of Sunday, of the total 803 new cases, 255 were reported from Bengaluru Urban. Dakshina Kannada recorded 153, Udupi 90, and Kodagu 63. The number of active cases were also higher in these districts: 7,371 in Bengaluru Urban, 1,732 in Dakshina Kannada, 1,747 in Udupi, and 511 in Kodagu. In addition, though Mysuru had only 36 new cases, the number of active cases was 700, and Chikkamagaluru had 629 active ones. On the other hand, Yadgir, Vijayapura, Gadag, and Bidar had no new cases, while those like Kalaburagi, Bagalkot, Raichur, and Ballari had fewer than 10 cases. In Bidar and Gadag, there were fewer than 10 active cases, while Yadgir and Vijayapura had fewer than 20 active cases. There were other districts, such as Chickballapur, Chamarajanagar, Davangere, and Haveri, which reported below 10 new cases. Haveri also had only 12 active cases. Experts say the swing in numbers is mainly owing to the location. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, told The Hindu that for activities, such as education and commercial, Mangaluru and other neighbouring districts were an extension of places like Manjeshwar and Kasargod, leading to higher positivity rates as Kerala continues to report a high number of cases. In north Karnataka, with cases in Maharashtra being lower and owing to lesser traffic between the two regions, numbers are lower, he said. However, experts have warned that it is too soon to celebrate the low rate of infection in the northern districts over the last few days, as the vaccination rate and seroprevalence in these districts remain low.

13 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Remove ‘do not sit’ stickers from metro seats, commuters tell BMRCL||Namma Metro passengers have demanded that Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) do away with alternate seating arrangements on trains. With ridership touching 2 lakh every day on both lines, commuters argue that it is futile to insist that some seats be kept vacant, especially during peak commuting hours. They want the ‘do not sit’ stickers, currently on every other seat, removed as the State government has allowed full occupancy in metro trains. Regular commuters said that conflicting announcements on the trains add to the confusion. “While travelling in the metro, often a recorded announcement gets played informing passengers that they can occupy all seats. But some commuters do not allow others to sit next to them because of the stickers. They show the sticker and say one has to sit on every alternate seat. Many passengers even keep their bags on the seats beside them to prevent others from occupying it. BMRCL needs to address this issue,” said Navya R., a regular metro commuter. On June 21, when the second wave of the pandemic was on the wane, BMRCL resumed metro services in a staggered manner and increased the frequency of trains over time. Initially, to maintain social distancing, passengers were instructed to leave every alternate seat empty. At the time, people were not allowed to stand either. However, after a couple of weeks, when cases continued to decline, social distancing norms were relaxed and passengers were allowed to occupy all the seats as well as stand if there was no seating space. But not all commuters are aware of this and the stickers have yet to be removed. Increase in ridership With more people using metro services to commute to work, this is becoming a sore point. When services resumed in June, only around 42,000 people used it. Since then, ridership has increased to nearly 2 lakh per day. Prashanth Nair, another regular commuter, said he even reached out to BMRLC’s customer care centre asking for an explanation. “The customer care employee told me they had received many complaints from passengers about this. Some commuters are not allowing others to sit next to them even during peak hours. I was told a decision would be taken at the management level” When contacted, Chief PRO of BMRCL B.L. Yeshwanth Chavan said, “Passenger complaints on non-removal of stickers will be brought to the notice of the department concerned, and necessary action will be taken in the coming days.”  Often a recorded announcement gets played informing passengers that they can occupy all seats. But some commuters do not allow others to sit next to them because of the stickers Many people even keep their bags on the seat beside them to prevent others from occupying it” said Navya R, a regular metro commuter||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/remove-do-not-sit-stickers-from-metro-seats-commuters-tell-bmrcl/article36423509.ece
13 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Autonomous health system for city will be instituted soon, says Bommai||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who also holds the Bengaluru Development potfolio, said the State government will soon institute an autonomous health system for the city. “Presently, health infrastructure and responsibilities have been spread out among multiple agencies creating confusion. All health services will be brought under one system,” he said. He was speaking at Govindaraj Nagar after inaugurating a slew of development works, worth Rs. 89.5 crore, including five school works, two hospitals, one primary health centre, and three playgrounds/parks on Sunday. “The recent pandemic has exposed us to gaps in the health infrastructure in the city. Several assembly constituencies have added ICU beds and other facilities, which we will continue. We will ensure all wards have a PHC soon. Public health infrastructure will be augmented under the aegis of the new health authority,” he said, indicating that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will be stripped of its public health function to be given to a parastatal. The move, first announced during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic, has faced stiff opposition from several quarters. Notably, Housing Minister V. Somanna, MLA of Govindraj Nagar, in his speech at the event on Sunday, also appealed to the Chief Minister to augment PHCs and government school infrastructure in the city, under the aegis of BBMP. “It is thanks to the PHC network that the city fought the pandemic. I would request the CM to add all PHCs and government schools in the city to the civic body,” he said. Mr. Bommai said he had a vision for the city and was working towards realising it. The government will soon come out with concrete programmes. “The city has grown, but mostly in an unplanned way. We need to ensure planned development of the city, which is the challenge before us. For this we need to have a long term vision of 30-50 years and start working towards that from today,” he said. “We need to leverage technology to ensure the ease of living for the citizens. I am working on a programme that will bring all citizen services in the city to to our mobile phones. In an Information Technology city like ours, we should be able to do this,” he said. The CM also said he had discussed with Union Ministers and officials, during his recent Delhi trip, to clear all hurdles for regularisation of development in the city. “I have asked the Revenue Minister to chart out a programme to clear all confusions on land issues in the city. We will soon announce a scheme to give land documents to those who do not have them,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/autonomous-health-system-for-city-will-be-instituted-soon-says-bommai/article36423504.ece
13 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NEET: Students find physics tough||Thousands of students across Karnataka wrote the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for medical courses in the State on Sunday under the shadow of COVID-19. The exams passed off without any major glitches, sources said. Aashish S. Raman, one of the students who wrote the exam, told The Hindu that COVID-19 safety precautions at examination centres were “very good”. “Not only did we sanitise our hands before entering the centre, they made us sanitise again while recording our fingerprints. There was more than six-feet distance between students and only nine in one room in my centre,” he said. However, there was some confusion at some centres in the distribution of question papers and answer sheets. “Some invigilators were confused about the procedures and at my centre the papers were distributed at least 10 minutes late, which we lost. This delay affected us, especially because there were 200 questions this time, compared to 180 earlier. Choosing which questions to answer took more time,” said another student. She also said there were issues with the Aadhaar card verification of some students, where there was a mismatch in the date of birth on their Aadhaar card and other documents. Such students were asked to produce the original documents to prove their date of birth through their parents after the exam, causing some panic. However, later it was rectified, she said. Multiple students The Hindu spoke to said while questions in chemistry and biology were easy, those in physics were tricky and tough. “I would say overall the question paper was moderate. Most chemistry and biology questions were based on the NCERT syllabus, while physics questions were relatively tough,” said Madhu Murali Krishna, another student who wrote the exam. The competitive examination for medical, dental and AYUSH seats was conducted in 13 languages, including Kannada, by the National Testing Agency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/neet-students-find-physics-tough/article36423507.ece
13 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Traffic police seize luxury car being driven at night||The Sadashiva Nagar police seized a high-end car after they caught a group of people allegedly taking it out on a spin in violation of curfew hours on Saturday night. The group were driving around with the top open and blaring music, said the police, adding that the driver of the car had affixed an ‘on duty essential service’ sticker. The police seized the car and booked the owner under Section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and Section 336 ( rash or negligent act to endanger human life or the personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code. Ever since the accident that killed Karuna Sagar, son of Hosur MLA Y. Prakash, and six of his friends in Bengaluru barely two weeks ago, the police have been extra vigilant as they received flak for not enforcing night curfew. Since then, personnel have been instructed to be extra vigilant and crack down on youngsters partying at night. According to the police, the car belonged to a well-known businessman who was out of the city at the time of the incident. “Someone in his family had used the car and we are investigating to take necessary action,” said a police officer. He added that they had taken the car for a joy ride and were causing nuisance among residents in the neighbourhood that they were playing music loudly, and shouting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/traffic-police-seize-luxury-car-being-driven-at-night/article36423510.ece
13 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||20 ambulances added under Arogya Kavacha||As many as 120 advanced life support (ALS) ambulances have been added under the Arogya Kavacha — 108 service in Bengaluru. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai inaugurated the new ambulances on Sunday. Speaking at the programme, Health Minister K. Sudhakar said, “There are about 710 ambulances operating under Arogya Kavacha — 108 and 155 among them are ALS ambulances. All the 120 flagged off by the CM today are ALS ambulances.” The Minister said ambulance service is an integral part of the healthcare delivery system and plays a vital role in saving lives during emergencies. “Our government is committed to expanding its network and to enhance the quality of services,” he added. According to a release, the Arogya Kavacha, which was introduced in 2008 by the then Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and then Health Minister Sriramulu, will be given a facelift. “If technologies like GPS, mobile app are adopted, then we can ensure that the ambulance reaches the patient within 10 to 15 minutes. The mapping of hospitals helps to identify the nearest available hospitals and also brings in transparency. Now it takes about 30 to 45 minutes for an ambulance to reach the patient in urban areas and in rural areas, it is even more. We are working to bring down the turnaround time to 10 to 15 minutes by using technology and also increasing the number of ambulances,” he said. At present, there is one ambulance for a population of 1 lakh and the government wants to increase it to one for every 45,000 to 50,000, he said. “We also provide training to drivers and paramedical staff to make the service more people-friendly,” said the Minister. The Health Minister also said the State government is administering about 3.8 lakh doses of vaccine each day on an average, which is more than the number of doses that is administered in all of Russia. “We are a few lakhs short of completing 5 crore doses and we will soon reach this big milestone,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/20-ambulances-added-under-arogya-kavacha/article36423516.ece

13 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Banning online gambling easier said than done?||Karnataka will join its southern neighbours in bringing in a legislation to ban online betting and gambling in the upcoming Legislature session starting on Monday. While the law will provide stringent punishment for those flouting the ban if they are caught, enforcing such a ban and monitoring the Internet is easier said than done, senior police officers admitted. Another hurdle is limited resources to tackle cyber crime. “The only way we can enforce a ban is to write to the Union government to block gambling websites and apps. Karnataka will also write to them with a list of portals and apps to be blocked once the law is in place,” said a senior police official. However, online gambling has not been banned across the country yet. Telangana was one of the first States to ban online gambling with a law in 2017. So far, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh brought laws and amendments to ban online gambling in the last one year alone. However, the Madras High Court in August this year scrapped the amendments the Tamil Nadu government had brought in to ban online gambling. The proposed ban in Karnataka is also expected to face a legal challenge by a host of rummy and poker portals that have mushroomed recently. Unless there is a national policy on the issue, blocking these portals will be difficult. If they are not blocked, the laws by State governments will only help them penalise and punish gamblers and organisers, not completely free the State of the menace, a senior police official with a long experience in fighting economic and cyber crimes said. “Moreover, the Indian experience of blocking porn websites has been instructive: most of them resurface with other URLs or are accessible using VPN servers even today. So enforcing a complete ban on all gambling in cyberspace is almost impossible. It will be a continuous fight to pull down these mushrooming portals. However, such action can make these portals difficult to access, protecting several people from losing vast sums of money,” the officer added. HC nudge Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy acknowledged that the State government decided on the ban with a nudge from the High Court of Karnataka, which has been hearing a PIL on the issue by Davangere-based activist D.R. Sharada. Horse racing and lottery will be exempted, the Minister said. The draft amendments expands the definition of gambling to include both offline and online gambling and makes indulging, organising, and advertising for the same a cognizable and non-bailable offence. The draft Bill defines online games as “involving all forms of wagering or betting including in the form of tokens valued in terms of money paid before or after the issue of it, or electronic means and virtual currency, electronic transfer of funds in connection with any game of chance.” The draft Bill provides for punishments varying from one month to five years imprisonment and a penalty from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 5 lakh.  The only way we can enforce a ban is to write to the Union government to block gambling websites and apps. Karnataka will also write to the Centre with a list of portals and apps to be blocked once the law is in place A senior police official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/banning-online-gambling-easier-said-than-done/article36423503.ece

Addressing presspersons in Hubballi on Sunday, Mr. Shivakumar said that many people lost their lives in the pandemic, while several others were facing hardships due to huge hospital bills and lakhs of people had become unemployed. There was need for mitigating their sufferings by providing requisite compensation. The party would raise the issue, he said. On Mahadayi and Mekedatu, he said that former CM Jagadish Shettar and CM Basavaraj Bommai often speak a lot about both the projects and now that their own party was in power, he would wait to see what they do, he said. On the debacle faced by Congress in the municipal election, he said that because of the wrong decision by party leaders, the Congress failed to win an adequate number of seats in Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC). Instead of giving tickets to winnable candidates, others were fielded yielding to pressure. Consequently some workers contested as Independents and won, he said,adding that they were in contact with the party and had promised to continue as per the party’s ideology. Mr. Shivakumar challenged Union Minister Pralhad Joshi and Mr. Shettar to make a statement that the results were satisfactory for their party. He alleged that being in power, the senior leaders ensured delimitation of wards and fixed reservations as per their requirements.

Addressing a gathering after paying tributes to forest martyrs during the National Forest Martyrs Day in Dharwad, he said that a country with abundant natural resources would automatically become the wealthiest country if everyone made their contribution. Mr. Adiga asked the people to recall the worst situation during the second wave of COVID-19, when people faced hardships while arranging for oxygen. “For various reasons, man is chopping trees and consequently, green cover is shrinking. However, to ensure that the ecological balance is maintained, more trees should be grown and water discipline should be inculcated,” he said. Elaborating on the sacrifices made by forest officials and guards who lost their lives while trying to protect forest wealth from being looted, he said that it was everyone’s duty to honour the sacrifices of the brave and take a pledge to protect forest wealth. Chief Conservator of Forest Manjunath Chauhan said that while September 11 was the day to remember and pay homage to forest officials who laid down their lives in the protection of natural resources, the Forest Department alone could not save forests.

Yadapadithaya told The Hindu that the university is planning to hold the final semester examinations, sixth semester in case of undergraduate courses and fourth semester in respect of post-graduate courses, from September 30 or during October. The dates are yet to be finalised. No online examinations will be held for the final semesters. Registrar (Evaluation) P.L. Dharma said that about 40,000 students will have to appear for the final semester undergraduate examinations and between 4,000 and 5,000 students will have to write the final semester post-graduate examinations. The Vice-Chancellor said that after evaluating the answer scripts of Kannada and English papers of undergraduate odd semester examinations, the evaluation of answer scripts of other subjects was stopped on August 4 after the Deputy Commissioner asked the university not to go ahead with the examinations. Once evaluation resumes, priority will be given for evaluating answer scripts of fifth semester examinations. It is because unless the results of fifth semester examinations are out, the final semester students cannot complete their three-year degree course. If some students have failed in any subject of the fifth semester examinations, they can appear for the supplementary/special examinations to be conducted shortly and pass them, along with the final (sixth) semester examinations. The university will announce the results of other odd semester (first and third) examinations in due course, as there is no hurry as these students will be continuing their studies, he said. The Vice-Chancellor said that even-semester examinations for second and fourth semesters will not be conducted and the students will be promoted if they have passed all subjects of first and third semesters. Mr. Yadapadithaya said that the university will be able to commence the academic year 2021-22 only in November.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangalore-university-special-meeting-today/article36423860.ece
13 September 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Drill to check preparedness against chain-snatching||A select team of city police personnel and a social activist on Sunday conducted a drill of a chain-snatching incident to test the response of people and police to the incident. While a team of four police personnel acted as chain snatchers, social activist Shobhalatha Kateel, who has trained women in unarmed combat skills, played the role of the victim. Most of the police officers and police personnel were kept in dark about the drill. Except the chain snatchers and the victim involved in the drill, none knew that it was a mock exercise. How it unfolded At 11 a.m., the four-member team of chain snatchers came in a car, which did not have a number plate, and stopped near St. Agnes College after seeing the woman walking past them. One of the men got out of the car and tried to snatch the bag of the woman, who fell on the road in the melee. The person snatching the bag also fell and the woman tried to overpower him. Just as passers-by ran towards the victim, the chain snatcher managed to wriggle out and boarded the car which sped away. Two motorists chased the car for a few metres and quickly passed the information to 112 Emergency Response Support System. Unaware that it was a mock drill, a person who was driving a car on the same road tried to block the car in which the chain snatchers were speeding away. Also, a few people on the spot rushed to console the woman. The ERSS vehicle came to the spot by 11.08 a.m. and by 11.15 a.m. senior police officers were at the spot. The image of the CCTV capturing the incident and video captured by a bystander was widely circulated on social media. Online address At 3 p.m., Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar came on social media to state that the incident was a mock exercise to check the response of people and police to such crimes. “Such true tests go a long way in making people better prepared to face such incidents,” he said. While asking people to effectively combat such crimes without compromising their safety, Mr. Kumar expressed satisfaction over the quick response of the police in tracing the vehicle and those involved. Criticism However, there was criticism over the mock exercise with one person saying on Facebook that such acts will prevent people from coming forward to help when such crime really happens.  Most of the police officers and police personnel were kept in dark about the drill. Except those posing as chain snatchers and the victim involved in the drill, none knew that it was a mock exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/drill-to-check-preparedness-against-chain-snatching/article36423863.ece

13 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Mysuru now set for vertical growth||The Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) is set to give thrust to vertical growth of the city with the launch of group housing scheme on the lines of BDA apartments. The high-rise apartments of MUDA will be designed to be G+13 or G+14 buildings and will be the tallest for a city where the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) was kept low to discourage vertical growth all these years. FAR or floor space index is the maximum permissible area on which construction is allowed on a given plot of land The low FAR encouraged the horizontal sprawl of Mysuru which now extends beyond 15 km to 20 km or more from the heart of the city. The horizontal sprawl is perceived to be inimical to the urban conglomeration in the long run as it will encourage the rampant conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. Besides, lack of transportation network connecting the outskirts of Mysuru to the city-centre has resulted in a scenario where vacant plots or sites have become an instrument for long-term investment. But the end-users keen to have a house of their own, are increasingly prefer to live within the city limits. This is to minimise daily commuting apart from access to civic amenities including schools, colleges, banks, ATMs, healthcare facilities and recreation. The private players in the construction sector perceived the changing trend and mood of the end-users and went ahead with apartment construction which is now gaining traction. But the MUDA’s low FAR was also a deterrent for the private players to construct beyond the existing norms of G+6 or G+8. Now this is set to change as the MUDA itself is planning G +14 units. The decision to opt for vertical growth also stemmed from the growing realisation that land around Mysuru commanded a premium price and was increasingly difficult to come by and the waiting list of MUDA site aspirants threatened to get longer. To ascertain public feedback, the MUDA is nowconducting a demand survey for its group housing scheme under which it intends to construct 1,960 flats in the city on the lines of BDA apartments. The aim is to assess the public response to the concept besides ascertaining the area preferred by them so that the bulk of the construction could be concentrated in such places. The survey was launched recently and the app (Mysuru UDA) can be downloaded from the MUDA website ‘mudamysore.gov.in besides being available for download from Playstore. MUDA chairman H.V.Rajeev said that the proposal is to construct quality apartments in three localities of the city including 2-BHK houses at Dattagalli and Vijayanagar while 1-BHK units will be constructed at Sathgalli. The project cost has been pegged at Rs. 452.60 crore and the MUDA members have already given their concurrence to the project. It entails constructing 1,008 1-BHK apartments as well as 952 2-BHK. The 1-BHK units will cost around Rs. 14.83 lakh, and 2-BHK units will cost between Rs. 29.94 lakh and Rs. 33.80 lakh, according to the MUDA authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-now-set-for-vertical-growth/article36423892.ece
13 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||‘Katha Mania’ stimulates creative thinking||Imagine a lion befriending a rat! Well, one can’t. But moving forward the two decide to visit a hotel and end up savouring the famed Davangere Benne Dose! May sound far-fetched but not so in the imagination of children. This is just one of the storylines among 600 such tales rendered by children across Karnataka in a contest. An initiative of Mysuru-based 4C – Centre for Communication, Culture and Creativity – and Natana, a theatre group, the contest was held to encourage children to give vent to their imagination, foment creative thinking, help develop communication skills. ‘Katha Mania’ asks the children to tell a story of no longer than four minutes. The entire narration had to be video recorded and sent to organisers who are now in the process of adjudging winners. The participants were grouped into two categories: those between 3 and 6 years; and between 7 and 12 years. Stories could be anything they had heard from their parents or gleamed from the Ramayana, Mahabharatha or the Panchatantra. Niranjan Vanalli, one of the founders and honorary president of 4C, said the tradition of storytelling is ingrained in every culture but of late was increasingly getting diluted due to the emergence of digital media that pushes children to be passive consumers, more so in these pandemic times. Children were encouraged to be more dramatic while rendering tales, said Mr. Vanalli, who is also a professor in the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Mysore. Siri Vanalli, a law student, and M.N. Srivathsa, Secretary of 4C, along with Natana theatre artistes, viewed each of the 600 short stories and short-listed 30 – 15 from each group. They have been sent to writer and columnist Jayanth Kaikini who will pick the winners. Katha Mania drew a good response from across Karnataka while there were four participants from the USA and Canada. Brought up in a different milieu, these four – whose parents are from Karnataka – made efforts to be more proficient in Kannada, according to Mr. Vanalli. Some schools took particular interest and helped their students take part in the contest. Given the enthusiasm of the parents and immense response to the concept, the organisers say ‘Katha Mania’ will be an annual affair henceforth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/katha-mania-stimulates-creative-thinking/article36423887.ece
13 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Tiger remains elusive despite intensive combing operation||The tiger, which killed a teenaged boy in the Muddanahalli forest reserve attached to the Nagarahole National Park last week, continues to be elusive despite 360 degree combing to nab it since the last four days. Ganesh of Ayynakere Haadi in Hunsur taluk was killed in the tiger attack on Wednesday and scores of Forest Department personnel are scouring the region to track the animal. Besides combing on the ground, the department personnel has used normal drone for aerial surveillance during day and a thermal drone to monitor movement at night but to no avail. What is intriguing is that the tiger had approached the same spot where the boy was killed and though a cage was kept, it did not fall for the bait and disappeared. “It was then that the tiger was camera trapped and its identity established,” said Mahesh Kumar, director, Nagarahole Tiger Reserve. He said the camera trap images indicated that the tiger had sustained injuries, visible on its body, and this could have led it to stalk and attack the boy. Though 25 camera traps were laid on day one followed by another 70 on day 2, the tiger has not been sighted in the vicinity, Mr. Kumar added. At least three images of tigers have been recorded in the traps but an analysis of their stripe pattern indicated that they were different tigers. Meanwhile, the authorities suffered a setback when at least three camera traps were stolen. “We do not know if any of the three stolen camera traps contained the tiger’s image,” said Mr. Kumar.   Golden hour lost He said the tiger’s capture also calls for cooperation from the local community but they were not forthcoming as they created problems while installing the cage on the night the boy was killed. The resultant delay could have helped the animal slip away and the golden hour was lost, said the official. A cattle kill was reported close to Ayanakere Haadi where the boy was killed and the authorities and locals are on tenterhooks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tiger-remains-elusive-despite-intensive-combing-operation/article36423536.ece
13 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Birdwatching at Thippayyana Kere||Thippayana Kere lake near Sardar Vallabhai Patel Nagar along the Outer Ring Road in Mysuru, which was recently restored, is now home to more than 40 varieties of birds. The water body, which was on the verge of extinction due to dumping of waste, was taken up for rejuvenation by the district administration about five years ago. It was not only a valuable contribution to maintaining the eco-system of the region, but was also attracting a wide variety of birds. More than 25 bird watching enthusiasts turned up for the second bird-watching session organised by the Mysuru Science Foundation along with the Aranya Outreach on Sunday. “We were here last time in January this year. But, this time the number of birds are more”, said the Foundation’s G.B. Santosh Kumar. The birds they found roosting included Spot billed duck, Pond heron, Grey hornbill, Large billed crow, Black headed white ibis, Asian Koel, Painted stork, Indian robin, Oriental darter, Night Heron, and Brahminy Kite. Spread across 9.5 acres of land, the water body is now being maintained by the Mysuru zoo authorities. The bird watching enthusiasts, who participated in the session under the guidance of wildlife photographer M.K. Sapthagirish, were asked to observed the wings, neck, colour, tail, beak, legs etc. of the birds closely through the binoculars. The participants were also advised to refer to a bird guide. Mr. Santosh Kumar emphasised the need for people to conserve lakes for future generations. He called upon the authorities to ensure that sewage water and underground drainage (UGD) is not let into Thippayyanakere. The environmentalists expressed concern over the possible decay of the water body if sewage and UGD pipelines are let into the lake. In the coming days, similar bird watching sessions will be held in other water bodies of the city of the City that needs immediate attention. Mr. Santosh Kumar said their organisation will consider holding a programme at Devanur Lake next.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/birdwatching-at-thippayyana-kere/article36423890.ece

Around 20,000 cattle and buffalo calves will be vaccinated this year. As many as 3,000 calves have already been vaccinated in the first round which will be on till September 21. The second round will be carried out after four months and the third will be after eight months from the end of the first round, respectively. “Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. Once cattle or buffalo is infected with brucellosis disease, it will cause abortion or loss of re-productivity,” Assistant Director of Animal Husbandry Department Sharanabhupal Reddy told The Hindu . The government has chosen to vaccinate cattle and buffalo calves first because it intends to prevent the spread of the disease from animals to human beings and also to prevent economical loss to farmers, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/brucella-vaccine-being-given-to-calves-in-yadgir/article36423712.ece

Reacting to Mr. Patil’s earlier statement, former Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi said it needed to be verified who had made the offer to Mr. Patil. In Hubballi, former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar said he did not know in what context Mr. Patil had made such a statement on the offer made to him.

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||Former Minister S.R. Mahesh(in picture)is at loggerheads with IAS officer Rohini Sindhuri, who has accused him of indulging in land-grabbing in and around Mysuru. It appears that the JD(S) MLA representing K.R. Nagar Assembly segment, who also dabbles in real estate ventures, finds them a blessing in disguise. He believes that the media attention that began coming his way ever since Ms. Sindhuri (who had served as Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru till she was transferred earlier this year) accused him of land encroachment, had surpassed the publicity accorded to him even when he served as Minister in the JD(S)-Congress coalition two years ago. The icing on the cake, however, is the increase in demand for renting his marriage hall in Mysuru, which is at the centre of the IAS officer’s allegations. Mr. Mahesh claimed that the hall has been written about and shown so much in the print and electronic media in recent times that there has been a substantial rise in inquiries about its availability.   Officials find many ways to avoid the public and not listen to their grievances, switching off mobile phones being one of the most effective. Officials put this strategy to test recently in Hassan. The State government has imposed restrictions on drilling new borewells for private use. Officials received a call complaining about someone drilling a borewell and the officer stopped the man on that day. This angered the person, who sent out a word that he would not allow anyone to stop him from drilling the borewell. Officials were not ready for further confrontation, given the political influence the person enjoyed. So, on the day he was to resume drilling the borewell, they switched off their mobile phones in order to avoid receiving public complaints. One of them even conceded off the record: “The public can blame us only if we don’t act on receiving complaint. But nobody can blame us if we don’t receive it in the first place.”   Two politically dominant castes – Lingayats and Vokkaligas – seem to be united in opposing Karnataka Backward Classes Commission’s report on caste census conducted during the Siddaramaiah-led government. The Congress is believed to be divided on the issue, and within the party, legislators belonging to the Lingayat and Vokkaliga communities have expressed their opposition to acceptance of the report. They claim that the party would lose the support of both communities if it made a demand for acceptance of the report. JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy too has opposed the report and asked why Mr. Siddaramaiah(in picture)did not accept it when he headed the government. Apparently, the two communities have been against the acceptance of the report by the BJP government now or making the data public, reportedly for the fear of losing their dominance in politics. A few have claimed that population of other backward castes, SC/STs and Muslim community is greater than what is estimated and official announcement of data would make hitherto dominant communities vulnerable in the political domain. More than Rs. 150 crore tax payers’ money spent on conducting the caste census would go waste if it is not made public. Laiqh A. Khan Sathish G.T.

13 September 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||SHRC takes up case against hospital authorities||The Kerala State Human Rights Commission (KSHRC) has registered a suo-moto case after the authorities of Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Alappuzha, incorrectly notified the family of a man from Bharanikavu, admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital with COVID-19, that he had died. KSHRC member V.K. Beenakumari on Sunday served a notice to the MCH superintendent Dr. Sajeev George Pulikkal and directed him to submit a report in two weeks. A person named Ramanan, 72, of Krishnapuram, died on Friday afternoon. The MCH authorities intimated his relatives about his death, but also wrongly informed the family of a person from Bharanikavu with the same name. The relatives of Ramanan from Bharanikavu reached the hospital on Saturday morning to receive the body and cremate it, only to find that he is alive. In a related incident, the MCH authorities on Friday mistakenly handed over the body of Ramanan to another family. The mix-up According to sources, both Ramanan and Kumaran, the latter from Cherthala, died at the MCH on Friday. Kumaran’s family was wrongly given the body of Ramanan. When Ramanan’s relatives reached the hospital to take the body, it was nowhere to be seen. When informed about the mix-up, the relatives of Kumaran brought Ramanan’s body back to the MCH on Friday night and returned with Kumaran’s body. Ramanan’s body was later handed over to his relatives. The KSHRC has also sought a report from the superintendent on the mix-up. It is not the first time the MCH has landed in trouble. In August, the MCH authorities failed to inform relatives about the death of two patients. After a probe into the incident, MCH Superintendent R.V. Ramlal was removed from the post.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shrc-takes-up-case-against-hospital-authorities/article36423827.ece

13 September 2021||CHENNAI,KERALA||HC apprised of elephant corridors||The Forest Department has apprised the Madras High Court of the laborious process and difficulties in identifying, notifying and restoring elephant corridors in the Nilgiris district. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) and Chief Wildlife Warden also informed the court about corridors that had been identified but were yet to be notified, and how any move to evict encroachers leads to displacement of many people and triggers serious law and order issues. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu were told that three forest divisions (Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, the Nilgiris and Gudalur) in Nilgiris district had elephant corridors. Of them, MTR division had one notified corridor — Sigur Plateau; and two identified but yet to be notified corridors — MTR-Mukurthi National Park-Silent Valley National Park and MTR-Moyar Valley-Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. A G.O. was issued on August 31, 2010 notifying the Sigur Plateau corridor spread over 3,413.73 hectares and it was upheld by the High Court. However, since a big chunk of the notified corridor consisted of private lands on which resorts and guest houses had been built, the matter was taken on appeal to the Supreme Court which appointed an inquiry committee. The three-member committee, led by retired High Court judge K. Venkataraman, received 226 claims/objections to the notification. While those objections were being scrutinised, the tenure of the committee ended on July 31. The committee has now requested the government to extend its tenure up to April 2022 to complete the inquiry and based on its recommendations, appropriate action would be taken, the PCCF said. The status report was filed in response to a PIL petition filed by activist S. Muralidharan. As far as the two identified but yet-to-be notified corridors were concerned, the PCCF (and chief wildlife warden) Shekhar Kumar Niraj said the MTR-Mukurthi National Park-Silent Valley National Park corridor was approximately 3 km wide and 17 km long. The migrating pachyderms encounter multiple tea estates, villages and towns while travelling on this corridor. Similarly, the 35-km-long MTR-Moyar Valley-Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve corridor too passes through villages. High tension electricity lines traverse through this corridor between Moyar village and Bhavanisagar dam posing grave threat to animals. Though the residents had been demanding a bridge across Moyar river in the border of Mudumalai and Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserves, its effect on the ecosystem and elephant migration had to be analysed, the officer said. Providing a list of interventions required with regard to the two identified corridors, the PCCF said a committee on the lines of one that had been formed for finalisation of Sigur plateau corridor could be formed for notifying these two corridors too. As far as the Nilgiris forest division was concerned, Mr. Niraj said the Wildlife Trust of India, in its research study titled ‘Right of Passage: Elephant Corridors of India’, had not officially recorded any corridor in this division because the corridors here were fragmented and discontinuous in status due to plantations . Stating that heavy vehicular traffic on two main ghat roads (Coonoor and Kotagiri ghat roads), the steep cuttings that had been made for laying the roads and the occupation of the land on either side of the road were the main obstacles for the movement of the elephants, the PCCF said better access could be provided in the shape of a corridor for the elephants to use the Coonoor and Kallar rivers in this forest division. “Hence, a detailed research study is need in the upper Nilgiris to identify the elephant migratory routes and seasonal migratory paths,” his status report read. On Gudalur forest division, he said, it had as many as 11 local elephant corridors. However, since Gudalur taluk lies in the foothills of the Nigiris and was sandwiched between MTR and New Amarambalam Sanctuary in Kerala, the demand for land had led to fragmentation of Gudalur forests spread over 2,544.626 hectares. . “Since forests in Gudalur are fragmented and the habitat degraded, elephants roam in search of food and water outside forest areas. The major factor for quality degradation is encroachment in forest lands,” the PCCF said. Stating that fresh attempts to encroach forest lands were being prevented through constant monitoring by special teams of the Forest Department, Mr. Niraj told the court that necessary action had been initiated by the respective District Forest Officers for restoring the elephant corridors in Coimbatore and the Nilgiris districts in co-ordination with the respective district administration and voluntary organisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/necessary-action-being-taken-to-restore-elephant-corridors-hc-told/article36423585.ece
13 September 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||A place where Idukki tells its story||On the banks of the Periyar, there once was a thriving society, so hints the Pattanam excavations. Testimony to this pre-historic era in the High Range of the Western Ghats are the burial urns (nannangadies,), dolmens (muniyara), hero stone, and cave paintings that still remain unexplored. The district panchayat is now on a mission to showcase this heritage of the region and plan to open up a museum that would be a window to the bygone times. The museum, which will be near the Idukki dam, will be called the Kolumban Theatre and Museum after Chemban Karuvellyan Kolumban, the tribal chieftain who was instrumental in the making of the Idukki dam. District panchayat president Jiji K. Philip told The Hindu on Sunday that the excavations conducted on historical sites in Tamil Nadu had unearthed valuable information on the early period of a civilised society along the border areas. “The historical evidences accidentally explored from the district has similar features as in the Tamil Nadu excavations,” he says. The current project is to make the new generation aware of the region’s history. The Kolumban Theatre and Museum is also a tribute Chemban Karuvellyan Kolumban who is famously said to have paved the way to the Idukki dam site. In 1922, he took a hunting party led by Malankara estate superintendent W.J. John and his friend A.C. Thomas to the area between the Kuravan and Kurathi hills where the Periyar flowed. It later became the site for Asia’s largest arch dam. The theatre-cum-museum, modelled on a burial urn, also has two big statues of the Kuravan and the Kurathi, says Mr Philip. The theatre will host the tribal art forms. The Rs. 2-crore project also aims to explore tribal heritage. The foundation stone for the project will be laid by Water Resources Minister Rosy Augustine on September 14. Sculptor K.R. Harilal will work on the burial urn-shaped building and Kuravan and Kurathi structures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-place-where-idukki-tells-its-story/article36423831.ece

Ramesh, driver, Mananthavady Excise Range, were returning from the Tholpetty Excise check post on the Kerala-Karnataka border around 8 p.m. on Friday, when the lone tusker attacked their vehicle, said T.M .Maju, Assistant Excise Commissioner, Wayanad. The elephant attacked the vehicle just after the driver had given way for another vehicle coming in the opposite direction, Mr. Maju said. The animal tried to lift the vehicle after piercing the windowpane using its tusk. The presence of mind of the driver saved the team, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/excise-sleuths-escape-wild-tusker-attack/article36423770.ece
13 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Behera: Will not allow KMRL to become another KSRTC||Allaying fears that the approximately Rs. 1-crore loss per day will result in Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) becoming yet another KSRTC, Loknath Behera, the metro agency’s managing director, said a whole lot of new initiatives were on the anvil to improve footfall in the system of mass rapid transport by wooing youth, elderly people, and marginalised sections. Rationalising the fare structure, offering concessions to frequent travellers, introducing day pass system and discounts to NCC and student police cadets and senior citizens as in Singapore were under consideration. Every effort will be made to ensure the safety and well-being of people aged 70 years and above. All this is important, since people must feel “at home” in the metro system. Low footfall Expressing dismay at finding just a handful of people in the metro train that he boarded after being placed at the helm of the agency, the former State Police Chief said the metro system could not afford to operate with such low patronage and incur loss. “Why can’t the metro, which offers a fast, reliable and clean service, attract satisfactory number of people when other commuting modes are overcrowded. I will go the full way to ensure that the metro system attains the target that I have fixed, of carrying over a lakh people each day by year-end. For this, I have the government’s full support,” Mr. Behera said. Survey findings by Oct. 2 Assuring that systemic changes were on the anvil, Mr. Behera said he had received a lot of encouragement and support from different sections of society in Kochi. Close on the heels of the substantial reduction in parking charges at metro stations from Monday, tangible and sustainable measures will be rolled out to increase footfall in metro trains. This will be done after taking a holistic view of public feedback received for the fortnight-long survey that was commissioned recently. Its findings are expected to be consolidated by October 2. Public disconnect On the daily patronage for metro trains hovering below 25,000, he said most trains were running near empty. “On coming to know of the metro agency’s disconnect with the public during the past couple of years, I set up an in-house team to reach out to different sections of commuters and operators of other modes of public transport. The opinion of the members of the team will be collated while revising the fare structure, readying first and last-mile connectivity etc. I am confident that all this would see Kochi Metro out of the red,” he added. Aimed at reaching out to the public, out-of-the-box ideas like hosting cultural programmes and music concerts at metro stations are under consideration. This is because Kochi has a unique and profound culture that extends beyond the arrival of the Portuguese. All this will go a long way in lessening the gap between the cup and the lip, a confident Mr. Behera said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/behera-will-not-allow-kmrl-to-become-another-ksrtc/article36423781.ece

Junction-Thripunithura extension, it is learnt. This was after office-bearers of Thripunithura Rajanagari Union of Residents Associations (TRURA) met KMRL managing director Loknath Behera recently and submitted to him a memorandum seeking a 22-metre-wide road linking S.N. Junction and Hill Palace Road. “We apprised him of the need for proper road connectivity from both S.N. Junction and Thripunithura Hill Palace Road to the metro’s terminal station at Thripunithura. This is crucial for the metro’s patronage as well, since commuters from Kottayam, Idukki, and towns in the eastern side of Thripunithura will have to otherwise commute through the congested Irumpanam Junction and the narrow bridge off S.N. Junction to reach the metro’s upcoming station at S.N. Junction,” said TRURA chairman V.P. Prasad. Mr. Behera said he would inspect the corridor to get a first-hand account of the situation. He also sought a report on the road proposed beneath the metro viaduct, it is learnt. Land acquisition “We apprised Mr. Behera of how TRURA helped the metro agency get the consent of land owners for advance possession of 15 plots for the Pettah-SN Junction extension. The apex body of associations is willing to help KMRL in this regard for the subsequent extension too,” Mr. Prasad said. “We convinced him of how the metro’s ongoing extension work to its terminal station near the Thripunithura railway station would be futile, unless road connectivity is established to the station from both sides,” TRURA convenor V.C. Jayendran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kmrl-revives-proposal-for-corridor-below-metro-viaduct/article36423777.ece
13 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||App to empower patients during emergency situations||How often have families rushed their dear ones to nearest hospitals during emergencies with little consideration about the quality and cost of services, only to be left devastated both emotionally and economically? ShopDoc, a healthcare solution app for patient referral services developed by a start-up and incubated by the Kerala Startup Mission at its Technology Innovation Zone at Kinfra Hi-tech Park, Kalamassery, aims at addressing this specific issue. Rather than limiting to a virtual outpatient consultation, the app guides patients in their journey from primary care to multi-specialty hospital treatment and medical procedures in a cost-effective and time-bound manner by negotiating with hospitals. ShopDoc was founded by an experienced expatriate entrepreneur in the healthcare domain, Shihab Makaniyil, along with Razik Ashraf and Zahid Makaniyil. Launched in November last year, the app is now operational in Kerala and Karnataka with a pan-India roll-out planned shortly. “Often, patients are in the dark about the care needed and charges involved at various hospitals, and we target to address that gray area and empower them. Based on the user requirement, we browse through and refer the most efficient and cost-effective service. An unsatisfied user can approach us, and we will intervene on their behalf,” said Mr. Makaniyil, founder and chief executive officer of ShopDoc. The service is now 50% automated, while manual intervention with patients account for the rest during the interim period of full-scale technology adaptation. The start-up has so far facilitated over 18,000 patient referrals, while the app, available in Play Store and App Store, has registered over 12,000 downloads. The start-up has also tied up with 175 hospitals across Kerala and Karnataka and is still counting, while 2,545 specialist doctors have subscribed to it. “Our three-tier smart referral system will help patients connect the right healthcare providers ensuring transparency and accountability in the private healthcare sector,” said co-founder and chief operating officer Razik Ashraf. An independent medical board of qualified healthcare experts is also on the anvil to determine the treatment specifications required and post-treatment analysis. “We are also planning to launch by November a service, whereby children settled abroad will be able to monitor the treatment of their elderly parents back home remotely through the app,” said Mr. Makaniyil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/app-to-empower-patients-during-emergency-situations/article36423784.ece
13 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||‘Time to inculcate a sense of responsibility in councillors’||Residents of Thrikkakara have called for creation of awareness among elected representatives in the municipal council about their duties and responsibilities against the backdrop of the civic administration getting disrupted by a controversy that led the Opposition LDF to submit a no-confidence motion against Municipal Chairperson Ajitha Thankappan. The motion against the chairperson is the culmination of several controversies and is expected to be considered on September 23. The disruption in administration in the name of democracy has landed ordinary people in trouble. The municipal administration has been seriously disrupted for over a decade now, and citizens are at the receiving end of the political fracas, said M.P. Sukumaran Nair, a resident of Thrikkakara and special secretary to former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan. He added that the municipality had substantial income and was in a position to implement several measures to improve infrastructure and other facilities for people. However, the municipal council is always engaged in fights that have seen matters like waste disposal and water supply being totally ignored. Salim Kunnumpuram of Thrikkakara Residents Association said the only activity taking place in the municipality, which had an annual income of over Rs. 140 crore, was the construction of living complexes like flats, while issues like waste disposal and drinking water supply were being totally ignored. He called on the ordinary citizens to raise their voice against the situation, so that the resources mobilised by the municipality could be fully utilised for the benefit of the people. He also said that an awareness campaign should be organised for municipal councillors about their responsibilities under the Panchayati Raj Act, which appears to have not been read by members of the council. Meanwhile, Ms. Thankappan alleged that the Opposition had created such a situation that the ruling council under the UDF had not been able to attend to any of the pressing issues facing the municipality. The allegation was denied by Opposition Leader M.K. Chandrababu of the CPI(M). He claimed that development works in the municipality were not in accordance with the suggestions of Opposition councillors. He claimed that projects were not being implemented in a time-bound manner, and that municipal employees’ absence had landed people in trouble, who wanted several certificates from the municipality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/time-to-inculcate-a-sense-of-responsibility-in-councillors/article36423786.ece

In a statement here on Sunday, he said the Bishop had only sought to shed light on drug abuse as a social evil. Highlighting the need for building social resistance against the drug rackets, he said those who had been abusing the bishop for his statement were indeed attempting to break the atmosphere of religious harmony. “There is no doubt that drugs are the biggest threat to society,” he said, adding that any attempt to abuse the prelate for his words should be opposed. Significance The response of Mr. Mani assumes significance as he is regarded as one among the few politicians to hold strong ties with the Bishop House at Pala.

All the newly cleared 1,739 title deeds will be distributed at a district-level Pattaya Mela to be held on September 14. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will open the event through videoconferencing. There will be separate events to facilitate simultaneous distribution of cleared deeds in Kozhikode, Koyilandy and Vadakara taluks. According to officials, COVID-19 protocol will be strictly followed at the events. It will be the second district-level title deed distribution fair in Kozhikode this year. In the first drive on February 15, the department distributed 1,300 deeds. There were even people who had been waiting for the documents for over 20 years. The applications which were set apart for various technical reasons last time were also considered for the latest fair. Revenue officials said the government’s target to distribute 2 lakh title deeds could be a reality by the end of 2021. During the last term of the LDF government, 1.77 lakh title deeds were distributed across the State. In Kozhikode district alone, the department distributed nearly 10,000 title deeds after a joint inspection by a team of specially assigned officers. They included various categories of documents such as forestland title deeds, land tribunal title deeds, colony title deeds, surplus land title deeds, and puramboke title deeds. A senior Revenue official said the Bhumithra project launched in Kozhikode by the district administration had helped clear a number of technicalities on the fast track for beneficiaries. A number of special adalats were held in the district to receive complaints and address them in a time-bound manner, he added. The main achievement of the project was the clearance of decades-old complaints over title deeds. Several rural families who were in crisis owing to unavailability of title deeds emerged as beneficiaries of the special purpose project. Legal issues pertaining to various documents were also addressed effectively though the project which was managed by a group of senior officers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/over-1700-title-deeds-to-be-distributed/article36423775.ece

Those who complete a three-year postgraduate course in medicine are appointed as senior residents in the MCHs. Senior residents belonging to the 2017 batch are completing their tenure this week. Though final results of the 2018 batch were out on August 26, they are yet to be appointed as senior residents. The 2021 batch of students are yet to join medical colleges because of the delay in the conduct of the NEET for postgraduate courses. That means, right now only two batches of postgraduate students are there in government medical colleges. Functionaries of the Kerala Medical Post Graduates Association (KMPGA) said the number of those awaiting posting in government medical colleges across the State after completing speciality courses would be around 750. ‘Overburdened’ Sources said the delay in appointment had crippled the functioning of the MCHs, especially the treatment of COVID-19. A KMPGA functionary from Government MCH, Kozhikode, told The Hindu on Saturday that most of the junior residents were overburdened. Another PG student said the dithering was also violative of an advisory of the Postgraduate Medical Education Board of the National Medical Commission, issued in the wake of disruption of PG examinations. In a meeting on August 10, Health Minister Veena George had directed the Director of Medical Education to streamline the functioning of hospitals and and the duty schedule of PG doctors so as not to disrupt their academic work.

Blood clots The World Stroke Organisation’s 13th World Stroke Congress honoured Dr. Subir with the Young Investigator Award for his study, which underscored the importance of expanding thrombolytic therapy or dissolving blood clots for stroke patients in rural areas. “Within four-and-a-half hours after a stroke, we can address the condition by dissolving the blood clot through thrombolysis. What we need to have is an increased awareness among people, especially those in rural areas, about stroke symptoms and the methods to address them,” said Dr. Subir. Although he has been doing thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy on stroke patients, Dr. Subir said early identification and treatment could be vital. Though thrombectomy, a modern surgical procedure through which a blood clot can be removed by inserting a catheter through the blood vessel, can be done in 24 hours after the stroke, the earlier the better. “We have done a thrombectomy on a patient after 18 hours of stroke,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/global-recognition-for-neurologist/article36423765.ece

Ms. Thabsheera was elected to the block panchayat council from Thirurkad in the 2020 local body election on the IUML banner. She was the one who spearheaded the recent face-off with the party over an allegation of sexual harassment against State leaders of the Muslim Students Federation (MSF). Haritha is the women’s wing of the MSF. The IUML dissolved the Haritha State committee led by Ms. Thabsheera after she refused to abide by the party’s demand to withdraw the complaint that she and nine other members had filed before the State Women’s Commission against MSF leaders.

Although they will continue to be members of the party, they are unlikely to be given any significant role by the party.

13 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Deaths due to delayed hospital admission on the rise||The critical gaps in the State’s care initiatives for COVID-19 patients in home isolation need to be identified and rectified urgently as deaths due to incremental delays in reaching these patients to hospitals at the appropriate time have been going up, adding to the State’s COVID-19 mortality. According to the Health Department’s data presented before the Chief Minister on August 28, the proportion of COVID-19 deaths due to admission delays was 22.39%. However, beyond flagging the issue, at the field-level, little seems to have been done as two weeks later, this figure has gone up. The data presented at the Chief Minister’s review meeting on September 10 shows that of the 9,195 deaths which happened between June 18 and September 3, 30.44% or 2,995 deaths could be attributed to delays in hospital admission and care. The fact that nearly 3,000 persons who died of COVID-19 stood a chance at a better outcome had they received care at the appropriate time, calls for the Health Department doing a detailed analysis on the nature of the delays and why these could not be avoided. Hospital care The government’s conclusion is that all COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities should be treated at hospitals and not left for home care. But, given the high prevalence of diabetes (over 20%) and hypertension (32%) in the population, admitting everyone with these conditions in hospitals would lead to a strain on the health system, indirectly impacting COVID-19 mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has reached a stage wherein the virus will maintain a steady, low level of transmission in the community, with occasional waves. In this situation, the State’s single agenda should be a reduction in deaths. Focusing on preventing deaths amongst those in home care should be the first step towards that goal. “Having good guidelines will not help if at the field-level, health workers are not trained properly. A doctor or trained nurse should talk to the patient on day 5, 6 and 9. Rather than leaving the decision-making to the families, a medical officer should direct the patient on when he/she should get admitted and which hospital to go to. It is crucial that the patient is transported to the hospital in an ambulance with oxygen support, or else the patient could go worse while in transit,” a Health Services doctor said. Follow-up “Regular follow-up of COVID patients in home care through tele-consult over a period of 10 days, patient education on self monitoring and encouraging those with persistent symptoms over five days to come to the hospital has helped us pick up many cases where the outcome could have been unpredictable. We have had over 3,500 cases in our home care package, of whom 5-10% were admitted following early warning signs and they have all done very well,” said Rajalekshmi Arjun, senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, KIMS hospital. The State, which has a good tele-medicine network and e-health support, should have no problem in setting up a remote care model to monitor home-care COVID patients||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/deaths-due-to-delayed-hospital-admission-on-the-rise/article36423798.ece

The Kerala State Chalachitra Academy had earlier scheduled the 13th edition of the IDSFFK to be held from September 25 to 30. But with the test positivity rate still remaining above 15%, it remains to be seen whether the theatres will be reopened before that date.

13 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Over a lakh attend NEET in State||Braving heavy rain that lashed most parts of the State on Sunday, over a lakh candidates appeared for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET – UG) 2020 for admissions to undergraduate medical and dental courses. The examination went on smoothly without any major glitches being reported from any centre. A total of 1,16,010 students had registered for the examination from the State and the centres reported only few absentees. The number of registered students increased marginally from last year’s count of 1,15,959. Each candidate was thoroughly screened prior to their entry to the 320-odd examination centres in the State. Staggered entry and exit were enforced by school managements to ensure minimal crowding outside the centres. Nevertheless, some centres, including those in suburbs of the capital district, reported crowding especially when parents had come to pick their children after the examination concluded. Candidates were permitted to carry only masks, gloves, face shields, water bottles and sanitisers in addition to their admit cards and identification documents to the examination rooms. Separate isolation rooms were reserved for COVID-19-infected candidates, those who had high temperature, and for differently-abled students. Gouri Nayar, who coordinated the examination in Thiruvananthapuram where 14,495 had registered across 35 centres, said most venues had COVID-19-positive candidates who turned up in personal protective equipment. Less than 10% absentees Only less than 10% of the total number of registered students were reported to be absent, going by preliminary information. For the first time, candidates were provided the option to appear for the examination in Malayalam. Many candidates felt the examination was slightly difficult compared to last year’s. Among subjects, most felt biology to be fairly easy. However, physics remained a hard nut to crack for many similar to last year when some questions were found to be time-consuming. Chemistry was found to be of moderate difficulty with numerical questions outnumbering theoretical ones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/over-a-lakh-attend-neet-in-state/article36423797.ece
13 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||After Nipah, a call to study eco-impact of exotic plants||As Kerala is hoping to have seen the end of a third spell of Nipah outbreak in three years, scientists have recommended studies into the ecological impact of exotic plants in wake of emerging zoonoses. While plant import is being regulated in the country with measures, including plant quarantine, it is important to assess the interaction of imported plants with indigenous species, especially since the former has found a good market here. Ecological physicist R. Jaishanker, chairperson of the School of Informatics, Digital University of Kerala (DUK), says much effort is invested in containing zoonotic diseases, but not enough on analysing the root cause. While studies following the 2018 Nipah outbreak had concluded that the virus was first transmitted from fruit bats (Pteropus spp), the route of the spillover remained unknown. In the recent outbreak, experts have raised suspicion about the infection’s link to rambutan, an exotic fruit, which along with mangosteen, pulasan, durian, and dragon fruit, is gaining popularity in Kerala. Import regulated Currently, the import of exotic plants is regulated under Plant Quarantine (Regulation of Import into India) Order, 2003, that mandates phytosanitisation and quarantine measures to ascertain whether they carry any pest, fungi, or other microorganism. “However, there is no mechanism to track the long-term ecological impacts of large-scale cultivation of exotic plants. Aspects such as their interaction with native species and alterations in the food web remain overlooked. Imported plants bypass the naturalisation process that normally happens over many years,” Prof. Jaishanker says. Sooraj N.P., a researcher at the C.V. Raman Laboratory of Ecological Informatics, DUK, advocates studies to check whether the abundance of exotic fruiting plants attracts fruit bats or leads to the increased presence of the bat population in human-inhabited areas. Monitoring system He points out that a proposal for an integrated system for monitoring exotic species had figured in the lapsed Agriculture Biosecurity Bill tabled in the Lok Sabha in 2013. The One Health concept is the key in tackling zoonotic diseases, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/after-nipah-a-call-to-study-eco-impact-of-exotic-plants/article36423803.ece

Sunday’s turnout consisted mostly of Russians residing in Varkala and Kovalam in Thiruvananthapuram district. “'Usually we have around 30 to 40 voters.

We had it for the Russian presidential elections in 2013 and 2018 and once for the 2016 elections to the State Duma,” Ratheesh C. Nair, Honorary Consul of the Russian Federation, said. The ballots would be despatched to Moscow via the Consulate General of the Russian Federation, Chennai, and counted after the elections are over.  “We are glad to note that despite all the difficulties due to the pandemic, people have fulfilled their civic duty,” said Sergey Lagutin, Consul, Russian Consulate, Chennai. “This is the first time I'm voting in India,” quipped Alla Muravyeva, a psychologist from Volgograd, after casting her vote on Sunday.

13 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||School land cannot be alienated: child rights panel||Any land belonging to government schools should not be sold, mortgaged, assigned or leased or used for any other purpose other than educational, the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has said. Acting on petitions from students of Government Lower Primary School, Nedumangad, in connection with construction of a public toilet on the school premises, the commission asked the General Education Secretary and the Director of General Education (DGE) to ensure that its direction was followed strictly. The students had complained that the construction of the public toilet inside the school would create difficulties for them, and affect their safety. The construction had resulted in loss of trees and medicinal garden on the school compound, they said, seeking an end to alienation of school land. In the report to the commission, comprising member K. Nazeer, the Deputy Director of Education, Thiruvananthapuram, said the Nedumangad municipality began construction of the toilet by demolishing the school compound wall and taking over the land where a biodiversity garden had been set up. Denying the complainants’ charge, the municipal chairperson said the land had been identified for setting up refreshment centre and toilet as per a government order. It had also been inspected by the District Collector, and accordingly 2.2 cents of land had been sanctioned for building the toilet. The Principal contended that the classrooms for students were located very close to the toilet. The well that was the source of drinking water for students and staff and used for cooking mid-day meals was also located nearby. If toilets for the public had to be built, there were many suitable facilities of the municipality itself that were available. The commission observed that as per the Kerala Education Act, 1958, school land could be used only for educational purposes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/school-land-cannot-be-alienated-child-rights-panel/article36423986.ece

13 September 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bickering in Anantapur TDP comes to fore as leaders resort to war of words||The internal bickering in the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) camp in Anantapur came to the fore as party MLA representing Uravakonda Payyavula Keshav, Hindupur district president B.K. Parthasarathy and Anantapur Urban former MLA Vykuntam Prabhakar Chowdary launched a tirade against Tadipatri Municipal Chairman J.C. Prabhakar Reddy and his family members at a public meeting on Saturday, in an apparent reply to the former Tadipatri MLA targeting party’s Polit Bureau member Kalava Srinivasulu . Mr. Prabhakar Chowdary took strong exception to some followers of Mr. Prabhakar Reddy holding him responsible for the defeat of the TDP candidates in all municipal wards and the margin of defeat increasing from 28,900 during the Assembly elections to more than 50,000 during the municipal polls. “It was your brother J.C. Diwakar Reddy, who as the Anantapur MP, had been poking his nose into the affairs of all MLAs since 2014 to build his own private army of the people disgruntled with the TDP, which should not be continued. The Saturday’s meeting was not the party’s private forum to discuss internal differences on opinions,” said Mr. Prabhakar Chowdary. He alleged that he had left the Congress in 1995 due to ‘such autocratic behaviour’ of the JC brothers in the district. Retorting to the comments made by Mr. Prabhakar Reddy at Saturday’s meeting, the former MLA said the in-charge persons in each Assembly constituency were taking care of the party cadres, and that he needed to bother about the Tadipatri cadres only. At Uravakonda, Mr. Payyavula Keshav held a meeting with the party leaders. He told the media that the Saturday’s meeting was held specifically to discuss the issues pertaining to the rights of the State on the Krishna water with the top leaders and it was supposed to be held as per party president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s direction. Party image “All the constituency in-charges are taking care of the party cadres. Mr. Prabhakar Reddy targeting Kalava Srinivasulu was in bad taste as everyone in the party was happy with Mr. Srinivasulu,” he said. Mr. Parthasarathy too took objection to Mr. Prabhakar Reddy’s comments and wanted him to exercise restraints while speaking in public so that the party’s image was not maligned. “There are differences of opinions in any party and those need to be resolved democratically,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bickering-in-anantapur-tdp-comes-to-fore-as-leaders-resort-to-war-of-words/article36423919.ece

13 September 2021||Bengaluru/Belagavi,ANDHRA PRADESH||Karnataka Assembly set for stormy start||The monsoon session of the Karnataka Legislature commencing from Monday is expected to be stormy as the principal Opposition Congress is expected to attack the BJP over handling of floods and COVID -19. Though Shrimant Patil, BJP MLA, has made a U-turn by claiming that the BJP had not made cash offer to him to switch sides from the Congress, his statement of cash offer is bound to embarrass the BJP as the Opposition parties are set to raise the issue in the session. Mr. Patil has given the Congress ammunition to fire at the BJP by stating on Saturday that he had been offered money to switch over to the BJP, but had sought a ministerial post. On Sunday, speaking to reporters at Ambdagatti village near Kittur in Belagavi, Mr. Patil retracted his statements and claimed that he had voluntarily gone to meet BJP leaders, and that nobody made the offer. “The BJP leaders wanted to know my expectations, and I told them I only wanted a good position. I joined the BJP seeing the good work of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. Though the BJP legislator retracted his statement, the damage had been done. KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar thanked Mr. Patil for speaking the truth though it had come a bit late. “We have been saying that the Congress legislators were induced with money. It shows that the BJP has made an entry from the back door by removing a democratically-elected government through Operation Kamala,” Congress working president Ishwar Khandre told The Hindu . “We will ask the BJP government to resign on moral grounds,” he added. Mr. Patil was among the 16 Congress-JD(S) legislators, who switched sides resulting in the fall of the 14-month old JD(S)-Congress coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy in July 2019. Elected on Congress ticket from Kagwad constituency in Belagavi district in the 2018 elections, Mr. Patil was re-elected on BJP ticket in the byelection in December 2019 after he resigned from the Congress to contest again on BJP ticket. Though he was made the Minister for Textiles and Minority by then Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, he has not been inducted into the Basavaraj Bommai Cabinet. Mr. Khandre said: “With our stand vindicated, the Chief Minister should resign and go for elections.” The JD(S), which lost three of its legislators, said it was known to the world that Operation Kamala brought down its government. Mr. Patil made the statement out of disappointment on losing the Cabinet post,” JD(S) spokesperson T.A. Sharavana said. Meanwhile, Mr. Shivakumar told presspersons at Hubballi that the party would raise the issue of the government not compensating COVID-19 victims, and estimated that about four lakh people have died of COVID-19 in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-assembly-set-for-stormy-start/article36423227.ece
13 September 2021||Benglauru,ANDHRA PRADESH||8 killed in road accident in Chintamani taluk||Eight persons were killed and more than six seriously injured in a head-on collision between a passenger vehicle and a truck near Marinayakanahalli in Chintamani taluk of Chickballapur district on Sunday. According to the police, the overcrowded passenger vehicle, carrying 17 people, including two children, was heading towards Chintamani from Rayalpaadu in Srinivasapura taluk. “While approaching Marinayakanahalli, the vehicle collided with the truck, which was heading to Bengaluru. The truck driver was coming from Andhra Pradesh,” said the police. Eyewitnesses said that owing to the impact, the vehicle was tossed in the air. Six passengers — two of whom were women — were killed instantaneously. Senior police officers visited the spot and shifted the injured to Chintamani and Kolar hospitals. However, two more passengers later succumbed to their injuries. Fortunately, the two children inside the vehicle survived the accident, and are said to be recovering in the hospital, according to the local police. “The accident has been attributed to overspeeding by the truck driver, and the rash and negligent driving by the vehicle driver, who is among the deceased,” said a police officer. The police have taken up cases of rash and negligent driving and death due to negligence against the truck driver who has been taken into custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/eight-killed-in-road-accident-in-chintamani-taluk/article36423506.ece
13 September 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||T.N. vaccinates more than 28 lakh people||With a total of 28,36,776 COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in Tamil Nadu through a mega drive on Sunday, the State exceeded the target of 20 lakh doses it had set for the campaign. The administration of 28.36 lakh doses took the total number of doses administered so far in the State above the 4-crore mark. While the State had administered 3,74,08,989 doses till Saturday, including 22.8 lakh doses administered through the private sector, the total went to 4,02,57,287 doses. Apart from the 28.36 lakh doses administered through the government-run centres on Sunday, 11,522 doses were administered at private hospitals. Addressing journalists, J. Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare, said the actual number of doses administered on Sunday might slightly go up as data were coming in from all the districts. Health Minister Ma. Subramanian, who toured a few southern districts to inspect the drive, said the drive again proved the State’s ability to administer a high number of doses and highlighted the increased awareness among people. “Tamil Nadu is likely to be the only State to administer such a high number of doses on a single day. I think Uttar Pradesh administered more than 20 lakh doses once. However, its population is nearly thrice ours,” he told the media in Madurai.  Chief Minister congratulated Mr. Subramanian and all the personnel of the Department on the “Himalayan achievement”. He said the government had made vaccination a mass movement and appealed to all to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu, who inspected the drive at a few places in Chennai along with Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, said the drive was meant to bring vaccination closer to people, besides creating awareness. Following the tremendous response, the State might organise similar camps once a week to significantly improve the coverage by October. Around 40,000 special camps were organised across the State. More attention was paid to the nine districts bordering Kerala, which is reporting a high number of COVID-19 cases. The State had supplied 29 lakh doses across all districts for the drive. A number of non-governmental organisations partnered with the government. Rotary Club members were deployed at many centres in Chennai for assisting members of the public. Dr. Radhakrishnan said the drive demonstrated Tamil Nadu’s ability to administer a high number of doses by tapping into the services of various Departments. Apart from administering five to seven lakh doses a day, Tamil Nadu had shown that it could administer over 25 lakh doses a day through such special drives, he said. Mr. Subramanian acknowledged that there was a shortage at some centres owing to the overwhelming response. “At these centres, we have collected the phone numbers of those who could not get the shot so that they can be followed up tomorrow,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tn-vaccinates-more-than-28-lakh-people/article36423521.ece
13 September 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||NGOs raise awareness on COVID etiquette among schoolchildren||The volunteers of the Rural Organisation for Poverty Eradication Services (ROPES), with the support of the NGO Children Believe, have launched a week-long awareness programme to educate schoolchildren on COVID-appropriate behaviour in 40 panchayats in Bangarupalem mandal. As part of the programme, they would also distribute facemasks and sanitisers to 5,000 children. Mandal Educational Officer Nageswara Rao and headmasters of the ZP High Schools of Ragimanupenta, Vepanapalle, Keeramanda and Jothalamadugu took part in the campaign. With the reopening of schools in the State amid the threat of a third wave of the pandemic, there is an immense need to educate children on the importance of following social vaccine--wearing masks, physical distancing and hand washing, said ROPES chairman K. Dhanasekhar. “Every student, from class I to class X, would be supplied with a kit containing facemasks, sanitizers and soaps, while girls would be given sanitary wear in addition to the above items. Over 1,000 members of the children’s clubs administered by the ROPES would be involved in the awareness campaign in the remote areas,” he said. Mr. Nageswara Rao said that all steps were being initiated to ensure maintenance of physical distancing in the classrooms, besides adherence to safety norms.

13 September 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Privatising assets will do no good to country: Chinta||Former Union Minister and Congress Working Committee (CWC) member Chinta Mohan sobserved that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government’s strategies to privatise the vital sectors of railways, airports, seaports, space research and public sector units would prove detrimental to the country’s spirit of democracy. Speaking to mediapersons at Tirupati, Mr. Chinta Mohan alleged that the BJP was destroying the socialistic fabric of India by serving the interests of the corporate companies by selling away the country’s assets to them by taking bribes. The CWC member said the UPA government had made the Tirupati airport an international entity. “But, the NDA government wants to privatise the Rs. 5,000 crore worth Tirupati airport at a throwaway price to serve its vested interests. The fate of Tirupati railway station is no different,” he said. Mr. Chinta Mohan said it was high time the intelligentsia came forward to question the NDA government’s move to privatise the assets of the country. “The skyrocketing of prices of oil, gas and essential commodities has unnerved the common man in India, contributing to large-scale poverty and unemployment,” he said. Predicting leadership change in the State, the Congress leader said that it would be difficult for Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to continue beyond Sankranti in 2022. Caught in a deep frustration, the Chief Minister was resorting to ridiculous schemes such as selling of cinema tickets. “Search is on for a new Congress president for Andhra Pradesh and a person with an unblemished character would be taking over the party cudgels soon,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/privatising-assets-will-do-no-good-to-country-chinta/article36423264.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy for coming to their rescue. “We would like to thank Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy for paying back the money that we had invested in AgriGold,” said a victim. MLC and convener of AgriGold Victims’ Committee Lella Apireddy said that the government disbursed Rs. 905.57 crore to those who deposited amounts less than Rs. 20,000 in AgriGold chit funds. “Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy showed a big heart by coming to the rescue of those cheated by AgriGold, a firm floated during the TDP regime,” said Mr. Appireddy. This marks a crucial stage in redressal measures ever since the scandal broke out in 2017. The firm was floated in 1995 and drew 32 lakh depositors from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andaman and Nicobar islands. The firm drew Rs. 6,380 crore from the depositors. As the deposits were not returned even after the expiry of the due date, the depositors lodged police complaints across the State. The YSRCP had supported the victims who had taken to the streets demanding justice. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had met the victims during his padayatra and included their demands in the party manifesto. In the first Cabinet meeting, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the government would sanction Rs. 11,500 crore to the AgriGold victims and the latest GO sanctioning aid to them was part of it, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/agrigold-chit-fund-victims-thank-cm/article36423920.ece
13 September 2021||Hassan,ANDHRA PRADESH||Areca nut farmers upbeat as prices rise||Arecanut growers have reason to cheer with prices going up and growers who have stock getting good money. Farmers, who are yet to harvest the yield, are hopeful that the current prices will continue for a few more days. As per the latest reports, a kilo of red arecanut is being sold for as high as Rs. 545. The average price was around Rs. 530. Similarly, the price of old white arecanut went up to Rs. 505 per kg and fresh arecanut at Rs. 460 a kg. This trend is leading growers to recall the days of 2014, when a quintal of arecanut was valued at Rs. 90,000. “The arrival of fresh red arecanut has begun, hence the price which had gone up to Rs. 600 a kg, came down recently,” said Jaya Bhandari, who works with Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd. (CAMPCO). People who have been following the arecanut market opine that the price has been going up because of increase in demand. “There is no stock of arecanut in north India. Growers and traders who have stock are making profits,” said Bhandari. Growers get around eight to 10 quintals of arecanut per acre. Those with even two or three acres of plantations could earn a considerable sum, given the prevailing rates. But, small growers have hardly benefited as they had sold their stock long ago. Rich farmers benefit As many parts of arecanut growing areas in Karnataka continued to receive rain, harvest was delayed, contributing to increase in price. “We sell the yield soon after harvest. This time, we will earn well provided the current prices continue till we harvest,” said Chandrashekar, a grower at Holehonnur. The plight of areca growers in parts of Sringeri and Tirthahalli is different. The yield in the plantations has fallen drastically over the years due to yellow leaf disease. Some planters get yield as low as a few kilos per acre. “The price rise does not benefit us. We are fighting against yellow leaf disease to protect our plantations,” said Srinivasamurthy, who has a plantation near Sringeri. He also opined that an abnormal increase in price would cause social problems. “It will widen the gap between big and small growers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/arecanut-farmers-upbeat-as-prices-rise/article36423222.ece

The government will appeal to the court to allow immersion as usual this year as it was not possible to construct separate ponds for the purpose right now which was directed in the verdict, Animal Husbandry Minister T. Srinivas Yadav told media persons when he offered prayers at the mega Ganesh idol at Khairatabad on Sunday. He recalled that about 35,000 Ganesh idols of plaster-of-paris had been installed in GHMC limits. It was not possible to create alternative water bodies to Hussainsagar for so many idols at short notice. Keeping the religious sentiments of people in mind, the government would appeal to the court to allow immersion in Hussainsagar with a broader perspective. The people had been participating in government-enabled festivals in a grand manner after the formation of Telangana state. It would be no exception when the immersion procession was held with participation of lakhs of people. Hyderabad had earned a special reputation for the occasion countrywide, he said. The Minister assured that the government would take all precautions to check environmental issues on account of dumping of large quantities of plaster of paris in the lake. The debris would be cleared from the lake within 48 hours. Mr. Yadav was accompanied by Khairatabad MLA D. Nagender.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-to-challenge-hcs-immersion-curbs/article36423229.ece

P.H. Ayisha Banu from Malappuram is the new president and Rumaisa Rafeeq from Kannur is the new general secretary. Nayana Suresh from Malappuram is the new treasurer.

Fayisa (Thiruvananthapuram), and Akheela Farsana (Ernakulam) are the secretaries. In a press release on Sunday, IUML general secretary (in-charge) P.M.A. Salam said that this followed deliberations with various district committees of the party. Harassment plaint The IUML had dissolved the Haritha State committee after its functionaries approached the State Women’s Commission accusing State MSF leaders of making indecent and sexually vulgar remarks against them. The complaint lodged by Haritha former State general secretary Najma Thabsheera and nine others against MSF State president P.K. Navas and Malappuram district general secretary V.A. Wahab had kicked up a row. The complaint of sexual harassment was seen by many as a flashpoint in a long-drawn stand-off between MSF leaders and the Haritha. As part of finding a solution, Muslim Youth League State president Syed Munawwarali Shihab Thangal had held several rounds of talks with the Haritha leaders. The IUML had frozen the Haritha State committee and sought an explanation from the MSF leaders. Though the Haritha leaders were asked to withdraw their complaint, they did not oblige. Navas was arrested on Friday and released on bail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/iuml-reconstitutes-womens-wing-of-student-organisation/article36423228.ece

Metal chains, cogs, wheels, rods, nuts, bolts, sheets and other broken unusable metal pieces were also used in the art. “For Mr. Modi’s statue, we used GI wire also for a better look. His spectacles, hairstyle and beard needed material like GI wires,” he said. Mr. Ravi said that a team of 10 members helped them with welding and other work, and it took more than 600 hours to sculpt the Prime Minister’s statue. “Usually, statues with perfect features are not made in scrap art unlike in bronze statues. It is difficult to bring out the facial features with available scrap. Our efforts began with a statue of Mahatma Gandhi. Around 75,000 nuts and bolts were used in Gandhiji’s statue. Prime Minister Modi’s is the second such statue. About two tonnes of scrap, which includes gear wheels, washers, bolts and nuts, was used to make the statue,” he explained. Mr. Ravi, who has a master’s degree in fine arts, said that their scrap art has already made its way into Bengaluru. The artwork was installed at Car Park at Bommanahalli. A 16-feet veena was installed on a road divider in Bengaluru city. BJP corporator Mohan Raju placed the order for the statue of Mr. Modi, he said. “We mostly depend on shops in Guntur as all varieties of scrap are available there. We have to sift through mountains of junk to find suitable pieces,” he said. Mr. Venkateswara Rao, a fifth-generation sculptor in his family, said that their forefathers used to work only on temple sculptures. “My father went off-track and began making small idols/statues. It diversified further and began making bronze statues. My son introduced scrap art,” he said. Models of the Hindustan Ambassador car, auto-rickshaws, tractors, national emblems, elephant, bison and bullock cart are some of the scrap artworks that can be seen at Surya Silpasala of the duo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/statue-of-pm-made-from-scrap-by-father-son-duo/article36424028.ece
13 September 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||APERC permits DISCOMs to recover ‘true-up’ charges of Rs. 3,669 crore||The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has permitted the DISCOMs to recover the ‘true-up’ charges amounting to Rs. 3,669 crore by taking into account their financial distress, according to the CMDs of the power utilities. They conveyed the steps taken thereof to Energy Secretary N. Srikant during a teleconference on Sunday, according to an official release. It stated that the power utilities had laid focus on capacity additions, strengthening the transmission and distribution networks, undertaking customer-centric initiatives and etc. and were undertaking a capacity building programme for the overall development of the power sector. “Andhra Pradesh has become a role model for other States in procuring cost-effective power. Unless and until the utilities ensure operational and economic stability, they cannot gain consumer confidence,” said Mr. Srikant. He said that the power purchase arrears and operating expenses stood at Rs. 12,500 crore as on June 2, 2014 and it reached Rs. 32,000 crore by April 1, 2019. The State government came to the rescue of DISCOMs by releasing Rs. 28,166 crore in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years. The DISCOMs have paid Rs. 64,007 crore towards power purchase costs to the generators in 2019-20 and 2020-21 fiscal years. Cost-effective power Mr. Srikant pointed out that Andhra Pradesh was the first State to introduce the concept of cost-effective power. The power utilities could save Rs. 2,342 crore by procuring power in the open market through a host of cost-effective measures in the last two years. AP-Transco Joint Managing Director (HR & vigilance and security) K. Venkateswara Rao, Directors K. Praveen Kumar and K. Muthupandian and DISCOMs’ CMDs J. Padma Janardhana Reddy, H. Haranatha Rao and K. Santhosh Rao were among those who took part in the deliberation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aperc-permits-discoms-to-recover-true-up-charges-of-rs-3669-crore/article36423724.ece

13 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pvt. school managements decry ‘unilateral decisions’ of govt.||Representatives of private and unaided schools managements’ associations, who were part of a two-day conference held in Vijayawada city to discuss the implications of the recent developments in the school education sector and their impact on their functioning, resolved to collectively oppose them with a slogan ‘Save Education, Save Schools’. The conference, organised by the Andhra Pradesh Private and Unaided Schools’ Managements’ Association (APPUSMA), was attended by representatives of the National Independent Schools’ Alliance (NISA), the Telangana Recognised School Managements’ Association (TRSMA) and other organisations from Haryana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Taking strong exception to the new fee structure, they said that when compared to the average money spent on each student in government schools, the private schools impart quality education for reasonable fees. Citing the set of rules and regulations followed by private schools, they said the same norms did not apply to the government schools. They also took objection to certain changes like the reintroduction of the practice of awarding marks to students, instead of grades. Regulating fee structure for private schools without consulting the managements was not right, they said, adding that a uniform fee policy for schools of different categories was ‘irrational’. NISA president Kulbhushan Sharma, TRSMA president Sekhar Rao, APPUSMA president M.V. Ramachandra Reddy, and general secretary Tulasi Vishnu Prasad spoke at the conference. Meanwhile, members of the Private Recognised Aided School Managements Association (PRASMA) expressed grave concern over reports of the merger of their schools. At a meeting held in Guntur on Sunday, school correspondents from Guntur, Prakasam, Kurnool and Nellore districts cited reports suggesting the proposed merger. The Association’s State leader M. Anjaiah, however, allayed their fears saying that GO 50 stated that only schools that did not have sufficient number of children would be merged with the consent of the management.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pvt-school-managements-decry-unilateral-decisions-of-govt/article36423924.ece

13 September 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP pushed State into debt trap, says Yanamala||TDP Politburo member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu on Sunday slammed the YSRCP government for ‘turning Andhra Pradesh into a debt-ridden State with no new sources of revenue generation to carry out welfare and development activities’. He said development had come to a standstill in the State and that the poor had received lesser benefits under the YSRCP regime . In terms of poverty rate, the State had leapfrogged to second position from sixth place in the past, ‘creating a record’ as a State without any income, he alleged. “Contrary to the claims made by Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy that out of the loans worth Rs. 2.68 lakh crore borrowed in the last two and half years, Rs. 1.05 lakh crore was distributed to the poor under welfare schemes, the government had distributed only Rs. 68,632 crore under the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes. The Chief Minister owes an explanation to the people on the remaining money,” he said. Mr. Ramakrishnudu said that even if the government had used the entire loan for revenue expenditure, it would be tantamount to violation of financial agreements. “The government’s budget accounts show that only Rs. 68,632 crore has been spent on welfare . The fact that Andhra Pradesh stands in 19th position in spending on welfare schemes, proves Mr. Rajendranath’s claims wrong,” he argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-pushed-state-into-debt-trap-says-yanamala/article36423926.ece

13 September 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||VSP staff, trade union activists take part in ‘Maha Padayatra’||Scores of employees of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), displaced persons and their families and trade unions’ representatives participated in the ‘Maha Padayatra’, organised under the aegis of the Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee and the displaced persons’ association at Gajuwaka here on Sunday demanding the continuation of the VSP in the public sector. The participants raised slogans denouncing the decision of the BJP government to privatise the VSP and sought its continuation in the public sector. The union leaders recalled that the VSP was established after several struggles and 32 persons had lost their lives in the agitations that were held for its establishment in Visakhapatnam. Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao demanded that the Centre revoke its decision on the privatisation of the VSP. He called upon the BJP leaders from the State to draw a cue from Telangana where leaders of all parties had joined hands for a separate State by setting aside their political differences. The Minister said it was unfortunate that the BJP leaders in the State had no interest in prevailing upon the Central leadership on the operationalisation of Visakhapatnam-headquartered South Coast Railway Zone (SCoR), which was announced before the last general elections, setting up of a steel plant in Kadapa and other assurances, which were given in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. After failing to keep those promises, the BJP government was adding insult to injury by announcing its decision to privatise the VSP, he said. Calling for unity among all political parties, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said, “The future generations will not forgive us if we fail to protect the VSP, which was achieved with great sacrifices. The YSR Congress Party government and the party will stand by the workers and the people in their struggle against the privatisation of VSP.” He said that Gajuwaka MLA T. Nagi Reddy would represent the party in the struggle. Mayor G. Hari Venkata Kumari, Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath, Porata Committee leaders Mantri Rajasekhar and Ch. Narasinga Rao were among those who spoke on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vsp-staff-trade-union-activists-take-part-in-maha-padayatra/article36423917.ece
13 September 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Delay in generation of COVID test reports hits air passengers||Delay in the generation of RT-PCR test reports by labs and insistence by the airline companies on their production for issue of a boarding pass to travel in the country, in view of the mandatory guidelines, are getting the passengers on their nerves. A young official, employed in a bank in Goa, came to see his parents in Visakhapatnam. He gave his blood sample at a lab in the city for the test last Saturday. It is taking no less than 48 hours to generate the report. He was scheduled to return to Goa on August 23 (Monday). He booked the 1 p.m. flight to Hyderabad as he had to take another flight from there to Goa later in the evening. He was worried as did not receive the report on his mobile even after the issue of boarding passes. The airline, which initially issued the boarding passes for the flight from Visakhapatnam to Hyderabad and for the onward journey to Goa, took back the Hyderabad-Goa boarding pass as he did not receive the test report till the last minute. The airline was willing to allow him to travel up to Hyderabad but the onward journey would be subject to the passenger receiving the report by the time he reached Hyderabad. His parents were worried as he would have to return to Visakhapatnam or stay at a hotel in Hyderabad, if the report was not received by then. The banker is not alone, there are a number of others, who are facing such problems in going to States like Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa. The health and safety protocols vary at airports in different States in the country and it is always advisable for passengers to check out the official website of the airline concerned before booking the tickets. The guidelines for travel to different airports within the country differ. The RT-PCR test should have been taken not more than 72 hours before the journey at most airports. But those going to Andaman and Nicobar Islands the test should have been taken not more than 48 hours before the journey. “The airport authorities can arrange RT-PCR or Rapid Antigen Tests at the airport and issue the report to the passenger in a time-bound manner, after collecting the requisite fee from the passenger. In some States like Assam, RAT is done mandatorily on arrival and RT-PCR test is also done on arrival after collecting Rs. 500 from the passenger. Such measures will save passengers of the hassle and save them from unnecessary tension,” says a passenger.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/delay-in-generation-of-covid-test-reports-hits-air-passengers/article36424047.ece

13 September 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘NEP guidelines detrimental to primary education set up’||Andhra Pradesh Primary Teachers’ Association State president A.G.S. Ganapati Rao on Sunday urged the government to withdraw its decision to merge classes of primary schools with nearby high schools, warning that it would lead to an increase in dropouts in villages. He said that the State government’s plan to implement guidelines of National Education Policy (NEP) would be detrimental to the interests of children as they would be forced to travel long distances to reach the high schools. “Many States in the country are keen on not disturbing the primary school set-up as the psychology of children of primary schools and those of high schools is different and they cannot easily mingle with each other. The government’s decision will lead to the closure of many primary schools. So, the government should consult various association before implementing the NEP guidelines which are not feasible at the ground-level,” said Mr. Ganapati Rao. He said that the issue would be discussed with representatives of All India Primary Teachers’ Federation to step up pressure on the government to issue fresh guidelines to the respective States to strengthen primary education in villages and other places across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nep-guidelines-detrimental-to-primary-education-set-up/article36423454.ece

13 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Tougher NEET baffles aspirants||Defying expectations of students that the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test-2021 would be easy due to pressures related to COVID-19 pandemic, a lengthy paper, tougher and time-consuming questions greeted aspirants this year. For the first time, internal choices were given that led to consumption of additional time for students, thus affecting their performance. “Overall, the scoring may reduce this year but ranking may not be affected much as it was tough for everyone,” explained D. Shankar Rao, dean of Medical stream at Sri Chaitanya institutions in Kukatpally. It was tougher this time due to tougher questions than last year and also the fact that students were mentally prepared for an easier exam due to the pandemic. Unlike 180 questions with 45 questions allocated to each subject last time, this year students had to go through 200 questions as each of the four subjects — Zoology, Botany, Physics and Chemistry — had additional five questions as choice. Section A had 35 compulsory questions while Section B had 15 questions of which they had to attempt 10 only. So, studying 20 questions additionally and deciding on the easier questions also consumed time. Generally, Biology is easier compared to Chemistry or Physics but this time Biology had a lot of matching questions that forced students to spend more time on them, Mr. Shankar Rao said. Chemistry was moderate with 5 to 10 questions being difficult. In the Physics section, the questions related to calculations were lengthy and students had to miss out some questions as they were pressed for time. Last year, there were several students who scored above 700 out of 720 marks but this time touching even 700 could be difficult, said students. Mr. Shankar Rao expects the marks to drop by at least 20 compared to previous year. He said those who scored 500 out of 720 in Telangana last year could get a free seat in government colleges or ‘A’ category seats in private colleges. This time, those who score 475 to 480 could also get the same seat. In any case, teachers have asked students not to be stressed over the tough paper as the ranks may not change much despite drop in marks as the paper was tough for all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tougher-neet-baffles-aspirants/article36423743.ece
13 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Reading the warning signs to save a life||Different people react to stress and trauma differently, but when it ends in suicide, it can be devastating for that person’s family and friends, who are left with an overwhelming sense of regret, guilt, helplessness, confusion and even anger. Was there a sign or symptom that they failed to read? Could they have done something to prevent it? For the bereaved, there are many questions that arise. Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health has never been more important, and the focus is on people’s role in preventing suicide. And the theme of this year’s World Suicide Prevention Day (September 10) calls for just that — ‘Creating hope through action’. Distress calls Trained volunteers of Hyderabad-based NGO Roshni, which provides free emotional support to people battling depression between 11 am and 9 pm daily, suicidal thoughts or any crisis in their lives, attend 45-50 distress calls every day, giving them hope of a better tomorrow. Director of the Roshni, Ushasree categorises signs of depression as changes in three aspects — physical, emotional and cognitive. She said even a lay person can identify the symptoms and extend help to the person in distress. “Family and friends are often the first line of defence in the fight against depression. Hence, it is important to understand the signs and symptoms,” she says. Spot the changes The physical changes include contrasting signs such as sleeping too little or too much, lack of appetite or overeating, sudden loss or gain in body weight, and/or excessive fatigue. Emotional changes, on the other hand, include persistent sadness or unhappiness, lack of interest or concentration, chronic anxiety, low self-esteem and/or uncontrollable anger. Finally, cognitive changes cover feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, helplessness and worthlessness, excessive guilt, suicidal thoughts, withdrawing or feeling isolated, displaying extreme mood swings, substance abuse, talking about wanting to die or to kill oneself, looking for a way to kill oneself such as searching online or obtaining a weapon or collecting pills etc. Power of empathy “If a person has four or more of the symptoms for more than two weeks, it is recommended to consult a mental health professional. If one recognises any or few of the symptoms in their loved ones, they can help by extending unconditional love and support, paying undivided attention and listening to them without judgement. Remember never to leave them alone, and instead, talk to them and encourage them to express their feelings and emotions, all the while showing empathy and compassion,” Ms Ushasree suggests. The categories of calls that the Roshni volunteers receive are wide-ranging — relationship trouble, love failure, financial issues, mental health illness or depression, and even those related to education. Some of the calls are made by family members or friends of the person in distress, and some are made to express gratitude.  Family and friends are often the first line of defence in the fight against depression||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/reading-the-warning-signs-to-save-a-life/article36423734.ece
13 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Congress to attend CM’s meet||Telangana Congress has decided to attend Chief Minister K. Chandrsekhar Rao’s meeting with MLAs on the implementation of Dalit Bandhu scheme but at the same time the party would demand its implementation in all the constituencies and adding some more sections among the economically downtrodden. A meeting of Congress MPs and MLAs held online came to the conclusion that since Congress party believed in democracy it should attend the meeting called by the Chief Minister. MPs and MLAs felt that in previous Telugu Desam Party (TDP) governments too they had meetings with the Chief Minister and also recalled that opposition MLAs were invited by successive Congress governments on developmental issues. Congress Lelislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka would attend the CM’s meeting and he would also raise the party’s demand that the scheme be implemented seriously and not floated as an election gimmick. Mr. Bhatti would, while welcoming the scheme on behalf of the Congress, put forward the party’s demand that backward classes and economically poor among other sections including the minorities be extended the same benefit. Party MPs and MLAs also suggested raising the issue of Chief Minister avoiding the opposition leaders to meet him for discussion on developmental activities in their constituencies. The same should be conveyed to the CM at the meeting, the party leaders said. It was attended by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee chief A. Revanth Reddy, Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, MLAs T. Jayaprakash Reddy, D. Sreedhar Babu, Poden Veeraiah while T. Jeevan Reddy, Seethakka and Rajgopal Reddy conveyed their views through phone call.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-to-attend-cms-meet/article36423758.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao said on Sunday that the State government had so far given priority to irrigation projects and agriculture but has now, decided to give top priority to health and education sectors. Therefore, he asked authorities to pay special attention to complete the construction of multi-super speciality hospitals and medical colleges on a war footing and put them to use. Mr. Rao ordered construction of two high rise towers in the campus of Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) to expand healthcare services. He also ordered a special drive to vaccinate three lakh people for COVID everyday, a release said after a meeting of KCR to review the functioning of medical and health department. Mr. Rao recalled reports that people who were alert about COVID symptoms and took remedial steps saved their lives. But, people who neglected the virus symptoms lost lives. The meeting discussed vaccination programme for youth above 18 years. Officials brought to his notice that there were 2.80 crore eligible youth in the State of whom 1.42 crore were already vaccinated for first dose. Another 53 lakh of them were administered second dose. This left 1.38 lakh youth who were still to get their single dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/top-priority-to-health-education-kcr/article36423746.ece
13 September 2021||hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Vadderas, Kummaris way behind’||Just 0.3% among the Vaddera community, traditionally engaged in stone crushing and 1.9% of the Kummari community, traditional pot makers, have completed their post graduation, reflecting that the years of government support have not percolated to the most backward communities among the Backward Classes. These figures were reflected in the report on the life and livelihoods of these two communities prepared by the Centre for Economic and Social Studies (CESS). The study was initiated with the support of Marri Rajashekhar Reddy, Secretary of Marri Lakshman Reddy Institute of Technology (MLRIT). The study revealed some startling statistics with regard to their education and lack of support from the government on their livelihoods. The study was submitted to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao by the State Planning Board vice-chairman B. Vinod Kumar and TRS Malkajgiri Lok Sabha constituency incharge Marri Rajashekhar Reddy. The study of the Vaddera community covered six representative districts while 10 mandals and 10 villages and urban wards from these districts were identified on the basis of availability of the Vaddera households. Similarly, study of the Kummari community covered five representative districts, 10 mandals and 10 villages. The Vaddera community is far behind with just 17.5% reaching up to 5th class and 5.8% up to Intermediate. While 0.5% have studied diploma or Polytechnic only 3.7% could reach up to graduation level. Among the Kummari community, 21.7% could complete secondary education and 11.3% graduation. “I initiated the study of these two communities after receiving several representations from these communities for financial help. Realising their backwardness, I wanted to take it to the notice of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao with a proper research document,” said Mr. Rajashekhar Reddy, acknowledging the guidance of Mr. B. Vinod Kumar. He said the study came out with some interesting recommendations for improving Kummari community like amending WALTA 2002 to give them access to raw materials such as clay and firewood to which they had unrestricted access before the enactment of the WALTA 2002. Electric or gas-fired mobile bhattis should be provided along with power subsidy. The study recommended amendments to the WALTA 2002 and GO 15 (2015) of Mines Department to enable the community to access local hillocks and stone quarries, reserves and sand in the water bodies and streams. Social security pensions should be given to them on a par with other backward castes pursuing their traditional occupations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vadderas-kummaris-are-way-behind/article36423752.ece

He also wanted the government to help the families financially by recognising them as freedom fighters. He also asked KCR to include the Telangana Liberation struggle and the life of greats who participated in the struggle in the curriculum. He requested the government to protect the structures that were a witness to the counter-attack against the Razakars at Byranpalli, Warangal Fort, Renikunta, Kadavendi, Kamareddygudem, Parakal, Suryapet, Bibinagar, Balemla, Perumandla, Sankeesa and others.

Director of Roshni, Ushasree says since the academic process is not being implemented as per schedule, it has left students anxious. Postponement of exams meant going through their lessons all over again. Challenges in adapting to the online education and lack of electronic devices or internet connectivity also posed a problem to students. During the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic when people were restricted to home, youngsters did not have scope for usual interaction with friends. Those living in small houses faced privacy issues when they got on a call with friends during the lockdown. These calls reduced after restrictions on movement were lifted. However, Ms Ushasree says that uncertainty about the future continues to bother students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/students-navigating-through-uncertainty/article36423737.ece

13 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CM made aware of perils of closure of boiled rice mills||A meeting on Sunday to discuss agriculture brought to the notice of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao the danger of closure of boiled rice mills in the State in the wake of the Centre’s refusal to buy even a kilogramme of boiled rice. Officials told KCR that they apprehended farmers coming to the view in these circumstances that it was no longer advisable to cultivate paddy crop. They also informed him about Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Piyush Goyal talking about Centre having boiled rice enough to meet the requirements of the country for the next five years. On Mr. Goyal fixing a cap of 60 lakh tonnes for procurement of foodgrains in the current kharif, the meeting decided not to exceed the limit while lifting stocks through the Indira Kranthi Patham centres. At a separate meeting, Mr. Rao asked officials to take decisions on security of drinking water reservoirs, development of greenery in forest and real estate growth around Hyderabad in view of its emergence as a global city. There was one lakh acres of forest land around the city that needed to be protected. Since the government required time to take a decision on GO 111 preventing undue industrialisation and construction activity near Osmansagar and Himayatsagar reservoirs, it was decided to appeal to the court to give as much relief.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cm-made-aware-of-perils-of-closure-of-boiled-rice-mills/article36423747.ece

Sharmila||The separate State of Telangana became a reality because of the constitutional provision for reorganisation of States made by B.R. Ambedkar. Also, without the participation of Dalits in the movement for statehood, Telangana would not have been achieved. “However, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao continues to dislike Dalits. His promise of Dalit CM during the movement and Dalit Bandhu now in the wake of Huzurabad byelection are to woo them, use them and later get rid of them,” YSR Telangana Party founder YS Sharmila said on Sunday. Addressing ‘Dalit Bheri’ public meeting at Tirumalagiri, in the reserved Thungathurthy Assembly constituency in the district, she said CR’s love for Dalits was fake and his true love was winning elections. She observed that KCR’s government owed Rs. 61 lakh to each Dalit household as against the Rs. 10 lakh direct benefit transfer declared, in the name of Telangana Dalit Bandhu scheme now. She calculated the figure at Rs. 10 lakh per acre for the promised three acres, average agricultural output per season and the past underutilised budgetary allocations of Rs. 85, 000 crore. “He keeps Dalit IAS/IPS officers away, his redesign of B. R. Ambedkar Pranahitha-Chevella project to Kaleswaram Lift Irrigation Scheme, for commissions, also did away ‘B.R. Ambedkar’. How many times did KCR pay tributes to B.R. Ambedkar? Why has the rate of atrocities against Dalits in the State increased several times? Why are Dalit lands grabbed for government offices and other facilities in villages?” she wondered. Ms. Sharmila also faulted the Opposition parties in the State, the Congress and the BJP, for not questioning KCR about the many failed promises, including making a Dalit Chief Minister. At the ‘Dalit Bheri’, Ms. Sharmila declared Yepuri Somanna, a Tirumalagiri native and prominent folk artiste since the statehood movement, YSRTP’s Thungathurthy candidate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcrs-love-for-dalits-fake-says-y-s-sharmila/article36423750.ece
13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Gossip-mongers turn busy||The sudden return to the Telangana cadre of a senior IPS officer from Central deputation has made gossip-mongers busy. In the backdrop of a few key transfers, including former Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V. C. Sajjanar, many are expecting that the officer who returned to the parent cadre got assurance from the top political bosses of a top post in the capital. Following the ongoing Ganesh festival, there is a buzz in the corridors of power that there could be important reshuffle at the top level, including transfer of a long-standing unit officer. If sources are to be believed, the top brass have also assured a woman IPS officer of a key post in the capital. However, officials say that in the current situation nothing is assured until Government Order is issued and the newly appointed officers take charge since many in the past have bitten the dust. And, ironically there is no buzz about the reshuffling of Superintendents of Police and Commissioners of Police (elsewhere in the State).     Some of us may agree, and some may not, with what some wise men say, that everything in life has a price tag. However, most of those who follow the present-day politics may agree on it when it comes to politics as one politician or other proves it right time and again. In the run-up to the Huzurabad byelection, which is yet to be announced by the Election Commission, one prospective candidate of a party has made her intentions clear that she could think of entering the fray only after getting a clear assurance from the party high command, that two others of her family too would be given party ticket to contest the next Assembly elections. The ball is in the party leadership’s court now to take a call (shot). Another party has offered a nominated post to one leader for switching loyalties. Switching of loyalties with a ‘price’ is also going on till village level, all for holding on to the MLA term for less than 2 years!   When speaker after speaker lavished praise on Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan at a media interaction organised by her at Raj Bhavan last week, quite a few interesting facets of duties of incumbents in the Constitutional post came to fore. One of them disclosed how a Governor related to him that he had no work and whiled away time reading newspapers. Another spoke about a Governor telling him that one of his major duties was to host At Home to invitees on the occasion of Independence Day and Republic Day. Everyone was unanimous that Dr. Soundararajan was far different as she gave the public easy access to Raj Bhavan. The grievance redress mechanism that was missing in the government was found here. Dr. Soundararajan herself said she herself wrote letters and called up the Chief Minister and got positive response.  (Abhinay Deshpande, B. Chandrashekhar, N.

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Reader’s Mail - Hyderabad||I request the GHMC to start a 24-hour dedicated website for taking up emergency and urgent grievances from the citizens to tackle issues like flooding, tree fall, road cave-ins, potholes, stormwater drains overflow, clogging, etc., for taking up immediate repairs before a major tragedy unfolds. It should also indicate complaints received, pending works and completed works with photographs along with the respective mobile numbers of the teams to be contacted in case of any need. P.S. Nivriti Sreelekha, Boudhnagar    The Telangana High Court’s decision of not allowing the immersion of Plaster Of Paris idols in Tank bund is welcome. Any material which harms humans and the environment should be banned. Earlier, to get a clay idol of Ganesha, one had to wait in queue for long as only a few outlets used to sell them, but now after the court order, many clay idols are available in the market. Next year, there should be only clay idols, however big they may be. There should be no more PoP idols. T. Kailash Ditya, Barkatpura   The road from Paradise Metro station towards Sunshine Hospital that was intended predominantly for two-wheelers has become a nightmare with cars and heavy vehicles using it and clogging the thoroughfare for hours. The road also runs through the area fire station and it is quite likely the fire engine cannot come out quickly in case of an emergency call. I request the authorities concerned in the traffic department and the GHMC to look into this issue. Shiju Thalikunju, Secunderabad   In response to my letter “Horrible roads” published under Reader’s Mail on September 6, the local authorities have started filling potholes on the main roads. As people are celebrating Ganesh festival, officials hurriedly started road repairs, thereby giving some relief to citizens. I really hope the quality of works is maintained to make them long lasting. J.P.

13 September 2021||GURUGRAM,||Haryana says ‘Gair Mumkin Pahar’ outside Gurugram not Aravalis||The Haryana government has advised the district committees for ground-truthing of National Conservation Zone in the districts falling in the National Capital Region to not consider “gair mumkin pahar” (uncultivable land), outside Old Gurugram district, as Aravalis. This, said the environmentalists, was contrary to decisions taken at NCR Planning board meetings and would wrongly benefit the real estate players and farmhouse owners, especially in Faridabad. In a State-level meeting held last month under the chairmanship of A.K. Singh, Principal Secretary, Town and Country Planning Department, regarding ground-truthing of NCZ in Haryana Sub-Region of the NCR, the district-level sub-committees, comprising Deputy Commissioners, among others, have been advised to identify the Aravali strictly as per the 1992 Aravali notification of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, thus, effectively keeping “gair mumkin pahar” outside the National Conservation Zone. In the meeting, a reference was made to a meeting under the chairmanship of then Chief Secretary on March 3, 2017, wherein it was said “only ‘specified areas’ in old Gurugram existing on May 7, 1992, may be part of “confirmed NCZ” by virtue of being Aravali and such areas of other districts may be excluded from the NCZ category”. Lt. Col (retd.) Sarvadaman Oberoi, an environmentalist, said the move would effectively mean that “ghar mumkin pahar” outside old Gurugram would not be considered Aravali and would be open for real estate activity. “A special meeting of the NCR Planning Board on December 20, 2016, had decided that ‘specified areas’ under Aravali 1992 notification be included while identifying Aravalis in NCR making it clear that ‘gair mumkin pahar, rada, beher’ fall under NCZ, and it was reiterated in 37th NCR Planning Board meeting in December, 2017, but the Haryana government, in its recent SLC meeting, has again made an attempt to keep these areas out of the NCZ by asking the DLSCs to consider the notification only for Old Gurugram. It is yet another blatant attempt by the State government to take away the protection to the Aravalis and serve the interests of real estate players in the state, especially Faridabad,” said Mr. Oberoi. He added that all the farmhouses in Faridabad Aravali were in violation of the NCZ regulations, which limit construction to 0.5% of the total area of the plot and they would benefit from it. A message and phone call to Mr. Singh to seek his reaction did not elicit any response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/haryana-govt-says-uncultivable-land-outside-old-gurugram-not-aravalis/article36423655.ece
13 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Night tourism at revamped Chandni Chowk on the cards||The redeveloped Chandni Chowk, which was inaugurated by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday, is set to become a major tourist destination not just during the day but after sunset as well with the Delhi government planning to allow street food stalls to stay open till midnight so that visitors can enjoy the “famous market to the fullest”. During the inauguration of the redeveloped and beautified stretch, done by the Delhi government over three years, Mr. Kejriwal said: “Chandini Chowk is famous across the world but when tourists would visit, they would find broken roads, traffic jams and hanging electric wires which would leave an overall dirty image. Now, after the redevelopment works, the people of Delhi are proud of the 1.4-km stretch from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Mosque.” He added that the stretch has been beautified, the traffic problem has been resolved, CCTVs have been installed, and all the hanging electrical wires are now underground. Speaking about future plans to develop Chandni Chowk as a tourist spot, Mr. Kejriwal said it has been noticed that people come to the market at night to experience the “deep-rooted legacy of the streets”. The Delhi government will extend services of street food stalls to develop the area into a night tourism spot, the CM said, adding that people would be able to enjoy themselves till midnight. Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain said the main road of Chandni Chowk is now one of the most beautiful places in Delhi and that the redevelopment work was a glimpse of how the Delhi government would make the entire Capital the most beautiful city in the world. The Delhi government said the proposal for redevelopment of Chandni Chowk was approved in August 2018 and the Public Works Department started work on the main project in March 2019. Many amenities It said that zones have been demarcated and traffic (non-motorised and pedestrian) has been channelised by placing sandstone bollards along the length of the Chandni Chowk corridor. Four toilets and two police posts have also been built for public convenience. The area also has water ATMs, dustbins and seats made out of sandstone. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP workers along with a section of traders in the area staged a “silent protest” during the inauguration and said they were facing issues with loading and unloading of goods.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/night-tourism-at-revamped-chandni-chowk-on-the-cards/article36423661.ece
13 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Light rain continues, more showers expected today||Light showers continued in the Capital on Sunday afternoon — a day after parts of the city were left waterlogged as it received over 100 mm of rainfall. The Met Department said the Capital recorded 0.8 mm of rainfall between 9 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. at Safdarjung — the official weather station of the city. Other areas like Ayanagar, with 36.3 mm, received heavier rainfall during the same period. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the government was working on a plan to ensure that the drainage system in the Capital works efficiently. “We have inherited a drainage system with several flaws and are working on creating a system that works efficiently. This, however, cannot happen overnight and it will take time,” Mr. Kejriwal said. The maximum temperature settled at 33.4 degrees Celsius, which is normal for the season, while the minimum at 23.4 was two degrees cooler than the normal. The forecast for Monday reads “generally cloudy sky with light rain/thundershowers”. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover between 33 and 25 degrees Celsius.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/light-rain-continues-more-showers-expected-today/article36423656.ece

13 September 2021||New Delhi,||‘AAP forced BJP to change CMs in Gujarat, Uttarakhand’||Delhi MLA Raghav Chadha on Sunday claimed that the BJP was “forced” to change chief ministers in Uttarakhand and Gujarat after facing a challenge from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the two States. The AAP national spokesperson also criticised the Congress while terming it an “ineffective, compromised and unsuccessful opposition”. “The AAP challenged the BJP by saying ‘perform or perish’, which forced the BJP to change its CMs in both the states. Such is the power of the AAP and Shri Arvind Kejriwal. I want to tell the people of the BJP that changing nameplates will not change the anger and resentment that the people of Uttarakhand and Gujarat have for you,” Mr. Chadha said during a press meet. He added that a “convenient game of musical chairs” was being played by the BJP and the Congress. “When one party is in power, the other helps from outside and upon a power switch, they return the favour. There is an understanding in these parties, which has resulted in Uttarakhand and Gujarat both, being devoid of a strong opposition and a strong government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-forced-bjp-to-change-cms-in-gujarat-uttarakhand/article36423653.ece
13 September 2021||Washington,||FBI releases document on 9/11 attacks||The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Saturday released a newly declassified document related to its investigation of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S. and allegations of Saudi government support for the hijackers, following an executive order by President Joe Biden. The partially redacted 16-page document released by the FBI on the 20th anniversary of the attacks detailed contacts between the hijackers and several Saudi officials, but it did not draw a definitive conclusion whether the government in Riyadh was complicit in the attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. Earlier this month, Mr. Biden ordered the Department of Justice to review documents from the FBI’s probe into the attacks for declassification and release. Relatives of the victims have been pushing for years for more information about what the FBI discovered in its probe and have contended that the documents would show Saudi authorities supported the plot. Riyadh denies role Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom has long said it had no role in the attacks. The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. investigated some Saudi diplomats and others with Saudi government ties who knew hijackers after they arrived in the U.S., according to previously declassified documents. Still, the 9/11 Commission report in 2004 found “no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded” the attacks that al-Qaida masterminded, though it noted Saudi-linked charities could have diverted money to the group. The families of roughly 2,500 of those killed in the attacks, and more than 20,000 people who suffered injuries, businesses and various insurers, have sued Saudi Arabia seeking billions of dollars. In a statement issued on September 8, the Embassy said Saudi Arabia has always advocated for transparency around the events of September 11, 2001, and welcomes the release by the U.S. of classified documents relating to the attacks. “As past investigations have revealed, including the 9/11 Commission and the release of the so-called ‘28 Pages,’ no evidence has ever emerged to indicate that the Saudi government or its officials had previous knowledge of the terrorist attack or were in any way involved,” the Embassy’s statement said. In a statement on behalf of the organization 9/11 Families United, Terry Strada, whose husband Tom was killed on September 11, said the document released by the FBI on Saturday put to bed any doubts about Saudi complicity in the attacks. “Now the Saudis’ secrets are exposed and it is well past time for the Kingdom to own up to its officials’ roles in murdering thousands on American soil,” it said. Mr. Biden has taken a tougher stance with Saudi Arabia than his predecessor Donald Trump, criticising the Kingdom over its human rights record while releasing a U.S. intelligence report implicating the Kingdom’s de-facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in the 2018 killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Prince denies any involvement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/fbi-releases-document-on-911-attacks/article36423153.ece
13 September 2021||Kabul,||Taliban: women can study in gender-segregated varsities||Afghan women will be allowed to attend university as long as they study separately from men, the Taliban’s new Higher Education Minister said on Sunday. Women’s rights in Afghanistan were sharply curtailed under the Taliban’s 1996-2001 rule, though since returning to power last month the hardline Islamists have claimed they will implement a less extreme rule. But speaking to reporters about the new regime’s plans for the country’s Education Minister Abdul Baqi Haqqani was unapologetic about bringing an end to mixed sex classes. “We have no problems in ending the mixed-education system,” he said. “The people are Muslims and they will accept it.” The Taliban announced earlier this month that women could still study at university if they wore an abaya robe and niqab covering most of the face, with classes segregated by sex — or at least divided by a curtain. Haqqani said that the education system had changed greatly since the Taliban’s last time in power, when women were barred from schools and universities. “Compared to the past the number of educational institutions have increased dramatically,” he said. “This gives us hope for a future, prosperous and self-sufficient Afghanistan... we will continue from where they were left.” Some fear the new rules will exclude women because the universities do not have the resources to provide separate classes. But Haqqani insisted there were enough female teachers and, where they were not available, alternatives could be found without breaching rules. “It all depends on the university’s capacity,” he said. “We can also use male teachers to teach from behind a curtain, or use technology.” The Taliban say they want to distance themselves from the harsher policies of old, when half the population was excluded from work and education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-women-can-study-in-gender-segregated-varsities/article36423155.ece
13 September 2021||Dhaka,||Cartoonist, journalist charged under Bangladesh Internet law||A high-profile cartoonist and a Sweden-based journalist were among seven men charged on Sunday under Bangladesh’s Internet law that critics say is being used against opposition figures. A court in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka accepted formal charges laid out by police under the Digital Security Act against cartoonist Ahmed Kabir Kishore and rights activist and journalist Tasneem Khalil, prosecutor Nazrul Islam Shamim said. The men were charged with publishing offensive and false information, defamation and intentionally publishing digital content that creates unrest or disorder. They face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. “The court has also issued warrants of arrest against four of them who have been absconding,” Mr. Shamim said. Rights groups, including Amnesty International, say the law is being used to silence and intimidate critics of the government in the country of 169 million people. Mr. Kishore, 45, said he was a “victim of injustice”. “Drawing cartoons isn’t a crime,” he said via a phone call after the charges were announced. Following street protests, Mr. Kishore was granted bail in March after he was detained in May last year on preliminary charges under the Internet law. Mr. Kishore said he was tortured before police detained him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/cartoonist-journalist-charged-under-bangladesh-internet-law/article36423156.ece
13 September 2021||STAVANGER,||Norway goes to polls with climate on agenda||North Sea oil and gas has helped make Norway one of the wealthiest countries in the world. But as Norwegians head to the polls on Monday, fears about climate change have put the future of the industry at the top of the campaign agenda. The ruling Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Erna Solberg, and the Opposition Labor Party, which is leading in opinion polls, both advocate for a gradual move away from the fossil fuels that continue to underpin the economy. But the larger parties rarely rule alone in Norway; smaller players are usually required to build a majority coalition. Some are demanding a more radical severing with the country’s dominant industry and income stream. “Our demand is to stop looking for oil and gas, and stop handing out new permits to companies,” says Lars Haltbrekken, climate and energy spokesman for the Socialist Left party — a likely coalition partner for Labor. He claims that the government is protecting a status quo at a time when the country is thirsty for a post-oil future. With their hydro-powered energy grid and electric cars, they are among the world’s most enthusiastic consumers of green power, but decades of exporting oil and gas means this nation of 5.3 million enjoys a generous welfare buffer, and sits on the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Tina Bru, the Oil and Energy Minister, says it’s unthinkable that the country should force an end to its biggest industry, which is responsible for over 40% of exports and directly employs over 5% of workforce.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/norway-goes-to-polls-with-climate-on-agenda/article36423158.ece
13 September 2021||Budapest,||Pope Francis calls for ‘openness’ after meeting Hungary’s Orban||Pope Francis met Hungary’s anti-migration Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Sunday before calling on pilgrims to be “open” and “considerate” at an open-air Mass in Budapest. The head of 1.3 billion Catholics has often urged help for the marginalised and those of all religions fleeing war and poverty, in contrast to Mr. Orban who styles himself as a defender of “Christian Europe” from immigrants. The Pope told tens of thousands thronging the vast Heroes’ Square in Budapest that he wanted them to be “grounded and open, rooted and considerate”. Thousands more crowded a nearby main boulevard, while others watched from nearby balconies and other buildings. “I think the Pope never says anything without reason. His words are well chosen and carry a subtle message,” Zsuzsanna Pusztai, a 75-year-old retiree, said. ‘Anti-Christian’ jibes The Pope, in Hungary to close the International Eucharistic Congress, met Mr. Orban and other senior politicians behind closed doors in Budapest’s Fine Arts Museum. Pro-Orban media and political figures have launched barbs at the pontiff calling him “anti-Christian” for his pro-refugee sentiments. The Pope spent just seven hours in Hungary before flying off to Slovakia for a trip that lasts four days in total. The Pope regularly reminds “old Europe” that its culture and society was built on waves of new arrivals. Earlier in the day, he told Hungarian bishops that various ethnic and religious groups had “transformed this country into a multicultural environment”, presenting a “great opportunity”. In contrast, Mr. Orban’s signature crusade against migration has included border fences and detention camps for asylum-seekers. Mr. Orban’s supporters point instead to State-funded aid agency “Hungary Helps”, which works to rebuild churches and schools in war-torn Syria, and sends doctors to Africa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pope-francis-calls-for-openness-after-meeting-hungarys-orban/article36423162.ece

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||What the Q1 GDP numbers say||India’s GDP data for Q1 of 2021-22 was released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on August 31, 2021. Real GDP growth at 20.1% in Q1 of 2021-22 is largely because of the contraction of 24.4% in the corresponding quarter of the first COVID-19 year, that is, 2020-21. Even with this high growth, the magnitude of real GDP fell short of the corresponding level in 2019-20 by a margin of Rs. 3.3 lakh crore. A growth rate of 32.3% was required in Q1 of 2021-22 for achieving the same level of real GDP as in Q1 of 2019-20. Annual growth prospects The Indian economy would have done better in Q1 of 2021-22 had its performance not been beset by the adverse impact of COVID-19’s second wave which largely affected the months of April and May 2021. The Q1 2021-22 output and GDP growth data reflect a strong base effect since the corresponding levels of Q1 of 2020-21 were significantly adversely impacted by the first wave of COVID-19. While the economic impact of the first wave was more severe, the health impact of the second wave was more serious. This occurred because of the difference in the nature and scope of lockdowns in the two waves. An interesting issue is to utilise the Q1 national income data to formulate views on how much additional growth would be required for the Indian economy in the remaining three quarters of the current year in order to clock the annual growth of 9.5% as forecast by both the Reserve Bank of India and the International Monetary Fund. We estimate that an average growth of 6.8% in the remaining part of the year would enable the Indian economy to meet this target. This should easily be feasible in Q2 since there would still be the benefit of a base effect, considering a contraction of 7.4% in Q2 of 2020-21. The task would become relatively more demanding in Q3 and Q4 considering that the real GDP growth was positive at 0.5% and 1.6%, respectively, in the corresponding quarters of 2020-21. The largest segment of GDP viewed from the demand side is private final consumption expenditure (PFCE). Its average share over the last three years (2018-19 to 2020-21) was 56.5%. In Q1 of 2021-22, PFCE grew by 19.3%, which is marginally below the overall GDP growth. At the same time, it is notable that the contraction in PFCE in the corresponding quarter of 2020-21 was relatively larger at 26.2%. Thus, if PFCE were to reach back the 2019-20 level, it should have grown by 35.5% in this quarter. The recovery in private consumption demand is lagging behind the overall GDP growth. Since private consumption depends largely on income growth and its distribution, it would be useful to focus on further supporting income and employment levels for the MSMEs and informal sectors of the economy which have a higher propensity to consume. On the demand side, noticeable positive outcomes in Q1 of 2021-22 came from exports and to some extent, from investment as reflected by gross fixed capital formation (GFCF). Exports grew by 39.1% over a contraction of 21.8% in Q1 of 2020-21. This differential is reflected in a positive growth of 8.7% over the export level in the corresponding quarter of 2019-20. In the case of GFCF, the base effect was quite large. Despite a growth of 55.3% in Q1 of 2021-22, its magnitude was still 17.1% lower than the corresponding level in Q1 of 2019-20. The only demand segment which contracted even with reference to Q1 of 2020-21 was government final consumption expenditure (GFCE). This contraction was by a margin of (-) 4.8%. The output side The performance of the economy when viewed from the output side largely points to the adverse impact of COVID-19’s second wave which dragged the performance of the key service sector — namely trade, transport, storage et al. This sector grew by 34.3% in Q1 of 2021-22 as compared to a contraction of 48.1% in Q1 of 2020-21. However, relative to its level in Q1 of 2019-20, the output of this large service sector was significantly lower by 30.2% in Q1 of 2021-22. Though public administration, defence and other services showed a growth of 5.8% in Q1 of 2021-22 over Q1 of 2020-21, they actually reflected a contraction of 5.0% as compared to Q1 of 2019-20. The key positive news came from the agricultural sector which showed a growth of 4.5% in Q1 of 2021-22, in continuation of annual growth of 3.6% in 2020-21. Given agriculture’s positive growth in all the quarters of 2020-21, further contribution from this sector to the overall growth may not be expected. Its average weight to the overall output is also low at about 15%. It is the high weight manufacturing sector and the two substantive service sectors — trade, transport et. al and financial, real estate et al. — which will have to support growth in the remaining part of the year. Construction and electricity, gas, water supply and other sectors have already started showing a robust recovery. These may respond further to the government’s emphasis on expanding investment in infrastructure. Fiscal prospects The government’s intervention in the economy is reflected by the performance of GFCE on the demand side, and the public administration, defence and other services sector on the output side. In both cases, as noted earlier, the growth in Q1 of 2021-22 was less than desirable given the improvement in the Centre’s tax revenue performance. Fiscal data of the Controller General of Accounts released on August 31, 2021 shows that the Centre’s gross tax revenues (GTR) grew sharply by 83.1% in April-July of 2021-22 over the corresponding period of 2020-21 and by 29.1% over the corresponding period of 2019-20. The Centre’s fiscal deficit in the first four months of 2021-22 amounted to only 21.3% of the budgeted target as compared to the corresponding average level of 90% over the last four years. Clearly, a significant policy space is opening up for the government to raise its demand and its contribution to output in the remaining part of the current fiscal year. Attempts should be made either to bypass or at least curb the adverse impact of COVID-19’s likely third wave. Given the fiscal room, both the coverage of vaccination and the pace of investment in health infrastructure should be accelerated within the strategy of expanding the overall infrastructure investment. As revenues improve, expenditures can be increased. There is no need to reduce the fiscal deficit below the budgeted level of 6.8% of GDP. Even a growth rate of 9.5% in the current year will mean that over two years, the Indian economy had an annual growth rate of 1.1%. The real test will come in 2022-23. Will the Indian economy get back to a higher growth path of 7%? We need a faster rate of growth to make up for the loss of output in the previous two years from the trend rate. We must lay the foundation for a faster growth in this year itself. C. Rangarajan is former Chairman, Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, and Former Governor, Reserve Bank of India.

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||A global war on terror with no tangible results||On the day the United States marked two decades since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Taliban triumphantly hoisted their flag over the Afghan presidential palace to start off their new regime. The unprecedented 9/11 attacks prompted the U.S. not only to invade landlocked, strategically located Afghanistan but also to launch a global war on terror. Yet, the U.S.-led war on terror has yielded no tangible results. A President’s ‘blunder’ If anything, it has made the world less safe. The scourge of transnational terrorism has only spread deeper and wider in the world. In fact, the U.S. President Joe Biden’s blunder in facilitating the terrorist takeover of Afghanistan raises the nagging question whether the seeds of another 9/11 have been sown. Mr. Biden will be remembered in history for making the world’s deadliest terrorists — the Pakistan-reared Taliban — great again. Historians will be baffled that the U.S. expended considerable blood and treasure in a protracted war to ultimately help its enemy ride triumphantly back to power. The war killed 2,448 American soldiers, 1,144 allied troops, more than 66,000 Afghan security personnel, and countless numbers of civilians. The Taliban’s defeat of the world’s most powerful military represents the greatest victory of violent Islamists in the modern history of jihadism, with the Taliban calling it “the most joyful day of our existence”. The triumph over the “Great Satan” is certain to inspire other Islamist and terrorist groups across the world. It is worrying allies America’s close partner, India, with its location right next to the Afghanistan-Pakistan belt, is likely to be one big loser from Mr. Biden’s Afghan debacle. The rejuvenated epicentre for terrorism next door could leave India less space to counter an expansionist China at a time when Indian and Chinese forces remain locked in multiple border standoffs since last year. Despite the Afghan fiasco, Mr. Biden plans to withdraw from Iraq this year, in keeping with what he declared in his August 31 address to the nation: “This decision about Afghanistan is not just about Afghanistan. It’s about ending an era of major military operations to remake other countries. (https://bit.ly/2VyfZfu)” This realignment of strategic objectives is rattling allies — from Taiwan to Ukraine — who fear being abandoned the way the U.S. threw the Afghan government under the bus. Afghanistan may not be the last blunder of the Biden presidency. Robert Gates, who served as Secretary of Defense under U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, wrote in a 2014 memoir that Mr. Biden “has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades”. Mr. Gates has proved right. In fact, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, in a May 2010 letter found in his Pakistan compound after he was killed by U.S. forces, advised al Qaeda not to target then-Vice President Biden, hoping he would one day become President. “Biden is totally unprepared for that post, which will lead the U.S. into a crisis,” bin Laden wrote. He too has proved correct, to the delight of all jihadists. Misleading distinctions Mr. Biden, like his predecessors since 2001, has disregarded the lessons of 9/11. This is apparent from Mr. Biden’s attempts to paint the Taliban as “good” terrorists and ISIS-K (Islamic State Khorasan), al Qaeda and the Haqqani Network as “bad” terrorists. He even claimed that “ISIS-K terrorists” are “sworn enemies of the Taliban”, ignoring the Pentagon’s acknowledgment that one of the Taliban’s first actions after conquest was to free thousands of ISIS-K prisoners from Afghan jails. The misleading distinctions Mr. Biden has sought to draw between interlinked terrorist groups are part of his administration’s public relations campaign to downplay the implications of the Taliban conquest. Indeed, extending its good-terrorists-versus-bad-terrorists thesis, Team Biden has sought to court the Taliban as America’s new partner to help contain the “bad” guys, with United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying publicly that the U.S. is ready to work on “counterterrorism” with the Taliban. This flies in the face of a key 9/11 lesson — that the viper reared against one state is a viper against others. Drawing distinctions between those who threaten U.S. security and those who threaten others is a sure recipe for failure, as terrorist cells and networks must be targeted wherever they exist on a sustained basis in order to achieve enduring results against the forces of global jihad. Terror interconnections In reality, the Taliban are closely entwined with other terror groups. As a United Nations Security Council report has said, “the Taliban and al-Qaida remain closely aligned” and cooperate through the Haqqani Network. Since their victory, the Taliban have not only refused to utter a critical word about al Qaeda but also have claimed there is “no proof” that bin Laden was responsible for 9/11. The Taliban and Haqqani Network are not “two separate entities,” as the State Department has claimed, but closely integrated, as the line-up of the new Cabinet ministers shows. And, although Mr. Biden sought to insulate the Taliban from the Kabul Airport bombing (August 26) by quickly pinning the blame on ISIS-K, the fact is that ISIS-K has little relationship with the ISIS founded by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Rather, as part of Pakistani intelligence’s deception operations to build plausible deniability in terror attacks, ISIS-K draws its cadres largely from the Haqqani Network. Afghanistan is set to again become a haven for transnational terrorists under an all-male regime dominated by former Guantanamo inmates and U.N.-listed or U.S.-designated terrorists, including the interim Prime Minister who was instrumental in the 2001 destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas. The world is reaping the bitter fruits of a geopolitics-driven war on terror. On the anniversary The 20th anniversary of 9/11 should have been an occasion to reflect on the forgotten lessons of those attacks, including the importance of not coddling terrorism-supporting regimes. With the global war on terror having gone off the rails, the anniversary was also a reminder of the imperative to build a new international consensus to help drain the terrorism-breeding swamps. It is not too late for western powers to absorb the lessons from national policies that gave rise to Frankenstein’s monsters.

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||September 11 — a brief personal reflection||February 14, 1989 and September 11, 2001 have stood like bookends in my occasional writing on contemporary politics as it relates to Muslims. A rite of passage, a personal education. But the personal here reflects something wider in American, more generally western, public life. Critical undertakings When the fatwa against Salman Rushdie was pronounced on the first of those dates, I had written critically of the absolutist stances taken by some Muslims in the aftermath of the publication of The Satanic Verses and in support of the commitments to free expression that I had been accustomed to in all the societies (India, England, America) I had inhabited. The long aftermath of the atrocities on September 11 found me withdrawing from these critical undertakings — not out of any funk but, curiously, out of a sense that it was the only self-respecting thing to do. My reason was just this: one does not make criticisms on demand. And there was an expectation, occasionally even explicitly voiced to me, that a Muslim living in a society that had been subjected to such an atrocity, should be declaring his anti-Jihadi credentials. It soon became clear, in fact, that criticism of extremist Islamist politics had become a sort of career-path for Muslims in this part of the world and it was not a path I was willing to tread, even though a certain recognisably zealous type — some among my friends — thought my reaction to be too rarified in its scruple. Speaking truth This raises a wide range of issues about truth, speech and location. The cliché ‘Speak Truth to Power’ contains an indirection. It would be a pointless instruction if it was intended to convey what it directly seems to say since, as Chomsky has pointed out, those in power already know the truth and often withhold it or deny it so that others more distant from power — but on whom power depends in a democracy — do not get to know it. Still, as an instruction, it is worth retaining, I think, because it really seems to be saying something more indirect: ‘Speak the truth, which is critical of those in power.’ It is regarding this instruction that the question of location arises. What scope should we give it? Should one, giving it very wide scope, just speak the truth that is critical of anyone who is in power anywhere and abuses it? Or should one speak it to and of the power in one’s own location, the power that one is living under? Such a restriction has sometimes been proposed in the spirit of another instructional cliché, ‘Choose your Battles’. The point here is about the consequences of speaking the truth. Since our breath is finite, we should focus our airing of critical truths to those in power in one’s own political vicinity because that is what is likely to have some good consequences. Speaking truth that critically addresses remote occupants of power is not likely to have much effect. The wrongs This is true enough, but in the long aftermath of September 11 — during which American power invaded and indiscriminately bombed towns in Afghanistan and Iraq, imposed and renewed murderous embargoes, caused an interminable cycle of violence of sectarian strife in the entire Middle East, and generated and fanned a phobia of Islam in its own people (while, as a power, it lay in bed with the most repulsive Islamist regime in history) — proposed the restriction to myself on grounds that were not really consequentialist in this sense. Perhaps the way to put it, if there are really such things as moral sentiments, is that the restriction, for me, owed to something more sentimental. To put it at its simplest, I felt the restriction is called for because it comes at greater risk to oneself. I find it not necessarily more sound but far more honourable that someone domiciled in America should be critical of the wrongs of the United States government rather than about the wrongs done by Muslim terrorists said to be supported by those in power in distant lands, whether in Iran or Pakistan or Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia.... Of course, were they to be invited to speak in Tehran or Peshawar or Kabul or Riyadh, the honour lies in the reverse. Many had accused Sartre of hypocrisy for not being critical of the Soviet Union, while repeatedly chastising European imperialism with great eloquence. But why should he, sitting in Paris (not Moscow) during the long Cold War, do anything different? What honour does it reflect to join — as was demanded of him — the constant chorus of anti-communism all around him? It is said that the Soviet government would reprimand Sakharov for his nagging criticism of their tyrannies, without saying a word about the deep racism in the American South. I would hope that all of us, living and writing and speaking here in the United States, can show the seemingly perverse and rarified form of courage shown by these locational asymmetries in Sartre and Sakharov.

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Not dropping the vase||This is my last column as the Readers’ Editor (RE). Of the various farewell write-ups I have read over the last four decades, Alan Rusbridger’s reflections after he stepped down as the editor of The Guardian are what resonate deeply with me. He wrote that he was overawed by the responsibility when he was entrusted with it. His fear was: “Please, please let me not drop the vase.” This was my fear, too, when I was invited to become the RE. I agree with Mr. Rusbridger that editors “just pass through” but readers are the “real carriers of the flame”. I thank each one of you for your constant engagement and arguments, which were an integral part of my role over the past nine years. I was ably assisted by A. Shankar and R. Lakshminarayanan in running this office. I thank Srinivasan Ramani, Murali Krishnaswamy and Radhika Santhanam from the editorial pages for their constant support. Role of Readers’ Editor One of the issues I tried to address upfront in my weekly columns is the nuanced relationship between a news ombudsman and the newspaper. It is neither adversarial nor promotional. When I was appointed as the RE, some readers asked: “Will you have the courage to rock the boat?” My answer was nuanced. I agreed with the boat analogy, but agreement stopped there. I said my role was not to rock the boat and undermine journalists working for this paper but to be an effective tailwind that ensures high quality journalism. I said I would be fearless in pointing out mistakes, shortcomings and inaccuracies but would refrain from naming the individual journalists. I said that there would be no gain in stigmatising individuals for their inadvertent mistakes and occasional lapse of professionalism. I said that the RE should exemplify the idea of a soft touch mechanism, which is central to self-regulation. The second issue that came up for discussion was that of visible mending. The visible mending process is a sign of accountability and transparency. When this office was created, it was widely seen within the profession as an enviable job. But soon, I realised that I had to battle perceptions too. As the pointsperson to receive complaints, to effect redress, and to ensure adherence to core values, I had to not only be fair but also be seen to be fair. The first RE of The Guardian, Ian Mayes, once said: “Being visible and accessible means you are a sitting duck”. It took time for me to understand the real import of Mr. Mayes’s statement. Everyone involved in journalism appreciates a mechanism for course correction. But when the mistake is laid at someone’s door, the person feels hurt. Reporters, sub-editors, designers, data journalists, and readers share this perception. Some readers always asked me whether the RE was with the section of readers who opposed the editorial or with the editors who authored it. When I found some of the readers’ objections to be unfair, they felt that I was justifying the newspaper. One of the pithiest comments I received read: “You are employed by the newspaper and it is quite natural not to bite the hand that feeds one.” An active listener Drawing from the wise saying of Elbert Hubbard, I learned to endure criticism without resentment. I knew that an evaluatory job would never fetch admirers. Being a custodian of readers’ interest does not mean, by any stretch of imagination, endorsing one view and rejecting others. I would like to share what Jeffrey A. Dvorkin, former executive director of the Organization of News Ombudsmen, said about this conundrum: “Until there is some disinterested party who is willing to pay, all news ombudsmen are obliged to receive their paychecks from their newspapers or broadcasters. The onus is on the ombudsman to prove to the listeners that he/she can still be equal opportunity shin-kicker — going after the journalists, the management and occasionally the listeners, as appropriate, even though we take the King's shilling.” An ombudsman is an active listener. I was not relying only on the mails that we receive daily. I read the comments that appear below the line for most of the stories online, to understand the readers. My task was to not only listen to the readers but to also convey their opinions with all their textures, layers and complexities to the editorial team. I hope I have not dropped the vase. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/not-dropping-the-vase/article36423146.ece
13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||A selective nuclear policy||The resumption of North Korea’s largest fissile material production reactor, after operations were ceased in December 2018, has sparked speculation about its real and symbolic significance. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has underlined that the restart of activity in Yongbyon constitutes a violation of UN Security Council resolutions. This is the same reactor that the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in a bilateral summit in 2019 with then U.S. President Donald Trump, offered to fully dismantle in exchange for securing complete relief from international economic sanctions, but to little avail. The ageing five-megawatt reactor at the Yongbyon complex has been central to the North Korean reprocessing of spent fuel rods to generate plutonium, besides the production of highly enriched uranium for the development of atomic bombs. But observers also point to the diversification of the country’s nuclear weapons and missile programmes to covert locations over time. Hence, they are cautious not to exaggerate the importance of the recent reopening. Confusion over motives Indeed, the opaque nature of Pyongyang’s nuclear programme partly accounts for the current confusion over the motives behind the restart of the reactor. In June 2008, in order to buttress its denuclearisation commitment to the U.S. and four other countries, Pyongyang blew up the cooling tower at the Yongbyon complex. The move did little to assuage the concerns of critics, either regarding the plutonium stockpile the regime had amassed or its engagement in clandestine nuclear proliferation. But it nevertheless led former U.S. President George W. Bush to ease some sanctions against North Korea, which he had in 2002 dubbed part of the “axis of evil”. More controversial was Washington’s decision to revoke, less than two years after Pyongyang’s first nuclear explosion of 2006, the designation of “state sponsor of terrorism”. North Korea was placed on the terrorism list after the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airplane. A few months after blowing up the cooling tower in 2008, Pyongyang barred IAEA inspectors access to its reprocessing plant in the Yongbyon complex and eventually expelled them the following April. In November 2010 American scientist Siegfried Hecker confirmed accounts that North Korea had rapidly built a uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. The above sequence of developments was almost a rerun of events nearly a decade earlier. In 1994, Pyongyang barred IAEA access to the Yongbyon complex amid suspicions that the country was generating plutonium from spent fuel. The U.S. had initially planned pre-emptive precision strikes on the nuclear sites, but was deterred against such a misadventure by a blueprint for a peace deal brokered by President Jimmy Carter. The so-called 1994 Agreed Framework, an executive agreement signed by President Bill Clinton, required Pyongyang to freeze all nuclear activity and allow inspection of its military sites in return for the construction of two light water reactors. The accord broke down in 2002. Pragmatic path The Biden administration has adopted a pragmatic path of declaring its readiness to resume negotiations with Pyongyang without the grandiose distractions of the Trump era that amounted to exerting little diplomatic leverage. Meanwhile, Mr. Kim has spurned all such overtures until he can win concrete relief from sanctions, especially those relating to raw materials exports. Apart from the punitive impact of such measures on an impoverished people, the protracted stand-off over North Korea reinforces the hollowness of the doctrine of deterrence and begs the question whether proliferation can ever be prevented just because nuclear weapons states want to perpetuate their dominance. The UN treaty on complete abolition of atomic arms, whose deliberations were boycotted by all nuclear weapons states, is the morally superior alternative.

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||A Patel at the helm||Effecting the fourth change of guard in a State this year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) replaced Vijay Rupani with Bhupendra Patel as Chief Minister in Gujarat on Sunday. Though the decision came out of the blue, intrigues that led to it had been gaining momentum for a while. To keep it all under the wraps, the government in Gujarat went so far as arresting and sending to jail, in May, a journalist under sedition charges for reporting that a change of guard was on the cards. Patels or Patidars have been the backbone of the BJP in Gujarat, but the elevation of Narendra Modi as Chief Minister in 2001 unsettled the cozy relations between the community and the party. Anandiben Patel succeeded Mr. Modi after he became Prime Minister, but she did not last in office for long. A partial ejection of Patels to accommodate a wider range of caste groups in its tent was the BJP approach under Mr. Modi and Amit Shah, and their national strategy mirrored this Gujarat experiment. The Patels in turn rebelled against the Modi-Shah axis several times in the last two decades. Mr. Rupani was less than impressive in administrative tasks or management of the social coalition. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed his failures starkly. With the Assembly elections looming, the Patels getting more restive, and the Aam Aadmi Party trying to emerge as a more viable opposition than the rudderless Congress, the BJP had to act. The Chief Minister-designate is a first-time MLA who was elected from the constituency vacated by Ms. Patel. The change also underscores the high command culture that is now entrenched in the BJP. The return of a Patel at the helm indicates a reversal of the BJP strategy of building coalitions of diverse caste groups under a leader from a marginal caste. Mr. Modi projected himself as a backward class leader in 2014, and subsequent choices in leadership at various levels largely followed this trend. There have been exceptions, such as Yogi Adityanath, a Rajput, who was elected Chief Minister in Uttar Pradesh. Within the party and outside of it, dominant castes have been resenting this and the BJP has now begun to feel the pressure. When it had to replace veteran warhorse B.S. Yediyurappa, a member of the dominant Lingayat community as Chief Minister in Karnataka, the BJP ensured that his successor was from the same community. The ongoing stand-off between the party and the Jat farmers in U.P. and Haryana is also indicative of the tension between the BJP and a dominant social group. The party’s Chief Minister in Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar, is facing the heat. These communities are bargaining for a bigger share of power in the BJP’s Hindutva tent. The BJP is partially acting under pressure, but it may also be feeling more confident of the support of the marginal communities and poorer sections to accommodate its traditional supporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-patel-at-the-helm/article36423131.ece
13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Foreclosure||Indian cricket’s English summer that commenced with a touch-down at London’s Heathrow on June 3, dished out riveting fare before being hastily concluded in a pandemic-induced cloud of doubts and controversy. During the beginning of this long tour, India lost the World Test Championship final to New Zealand at Southampton but subsequently made amends against England. Virat Kohli’s men were leading 2-1 after four Tests with Manchester’s Old Trafford all set to host the climactic fifth Test from September 10 before COVID-19’s long shadow precipitated a no-show. It all started with Indian coach Ravi Shastri, referred to as patient zero in the emerging cluster, testing positive during the fourth Test at the Oval in London. Later, bowling coach Bharat Arun and fielding coach R. Sridhar tested positive and while the trio was quarantined, the rest of the squad travelled to Manchester when second physio Yogesh Parmar also tested positive. A team that has been on the road for three months had enough and senior players, especially with their families around, were apprehensive. The danger that an infection would be a threat to their participation in the lucrative IPL must also have weighed on their minds. The match got cancelled and questions arose about how the bio-bubble got breached. Shastri’s book launch before the Oval Test, in which health protocols were not adhered to, was seen as a tipping point and drew scrutiny. In an era leaning towards digital events, Shastri should have bided his time. If the Indian coach is part of the coronavirus matrix, other factors played a role too as England had opened up from July 19. Having temporarily lost its talismanic all-rounder Ben Stokes to mental fatigue, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) preferred a bubble with relative freedom. The persistent forays of Jarvo, a fan, into the playing arena during the previous Tests, were an avoidable breach. A series that could have wound down at its own pace, is now searching for closure. India leads 2-1 but the series verdict is in limbo. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has offered to later schedule a lone Test while the ECB has written to the International Cricket Council (ICC) to adjudicate on the fate of the cancelled game. The players have leapt into another bubble in the United Arab Emirates ahead of the IPL from September 19. Lost in this fog of no-play and frantic travel, is the remarkable performance that Kohli’s men offered through the series despite a loss at Leeds. Five decades ago, India registered its maiden Test series triumph in the Old Blighty. Cut to the present, India is trying to figure out whether it is merely leading an unfinished series or has won it or drawn it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/foreclosure/article36423132.ece
13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Support for new Constitution in Egypt||Cairo, Sept. 12: Egyptians have voted virtually unanimously in support of a new permanent constitution promising them full personal freedoms in a socialist society. The Interior Minister, Mr. Mamdouh Salem, announced that 7,862,617 people in yesterday’s referendum said ‘yes’ to the country’s first permanent constitution since the monarchist laws of the late King Farouk. This represented a percentage of 99.98. Votes against were 1,363, he said. The referendum was the second in Egypt in less than two weeks. An equally massive majority — 99.96 per cent — gave their approval in the earlier vote to Egypt’s joining a new tripartite federation with Libya and Syria. The Constitution contains 193 Articles and is Mr. Sadat’s major move at internal reform after taking over from the late President Nasser. It takes effect a few days before the first anniversary of Mr. Nasser’s death on Sept. 28. Following the referendum, the Cabinet of Prime Minister Mahmoud Fazwi resigned to-night and the Middle East News Agency said that President Anwar Sadat asked Mr. Fazwi to form a new Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/support-for-new-constitution-in-egypt/article36423143.ece
13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||ASK US||Q.I am 23. I want to have a good long-term investment plan. Is it good to invest in LIC or any other insurance plan? I do not want to invest in mutual funds and stocks. What should be my strategy if I need a good sum of money once I retire? MRITHUL M. A.Starting your retirement planning early is a great idea. An even-paced accumulation over a long period can lend your retirement income both volume and stability. A variety of annuity plans and policies of LIC and private life insurance firms are available. An alternate, or supplement, to this can be joining the National Pension Scheme (NPS). The structure of a typical annuity plan is as follows. There will be an accumulation stage when you make payments. Then comes your chosen vesting date, the date on which you stop paying premium and your accumulated corpus is applied towards an annuity policy. Then comes the period when you receive annuity payments, that is, the pension. You can choose how long and how much you are going to invest, in your case from age 23 to, say, age 60. How much you invest depends on the premium required for your target annuity, moderated by your ability to invest. You can check the annuity amounts you will get for this investment in the premium calculator available on most life insurance company websites. If it is NPS, the corpus in your NPS account on the vesting date will be used to buy an annuity policy on your behalf from a life insurance company of your choice. The contributions you make are invested by the life insurer or the NPS, so the corpus on your vesting date will be principal plus returns. For NPS, you can choose the profile of investment and the asset manager also through the decades up to retirement. You have the flexibility to change them as often as you wish. In the case of unit-linked annuity plans of an insurance company, you can choose between fund options on offer. If you are likely to retire with a pension, take that into account and plan any independently-funded annuity as the next level building block. Similarly, include employee and voluntary provident fund contribution options. On the other hand, you may opt for a public provident fund account which has a basket of advantages in the form of tax breaks and compound interest.  Q.I am 31-year-old Central government officer. I started saving late and am about to get married this November. As of date, I have a RD of Rs. 10,000 for one year, PPF investment of Rs. 1.5 lakh, SIP (ELSS) of Rs. 3,000 a month and about Rs. 3 lakh debt. I come under CGHS health scheme. Should I opt for other health insurance and term insurance? I have no dependants except for my future wife. CHANDRAKANT HANSDAK, BIMAL HANSDA A.You have the foundations of a good financial plan in place already. Please study the eligibility under your CGHS scheme for you and your future family members and keep supplementing it as you go along. A few years before retirement, you can opt for individual hospitalisation policy. This will establish a track record and work off your waiting period for some kinds of treatments and also serve to enhance your coverage to make up for any drop in coverage or scope of coverage after retirement. Right away, you can start a term-life policy which is the most cost efficient of life policies. This is targeted at the risk of your family losing the bread-winner and the sum assured for this policy should be tuned to this requirement. Ideally, the interest from the sum assured should support your family. For example, today, the best interest available in super-safe investments is roughly 7% for Government of India bonds. So, for a sum assured of Rs. 50 lakh, this translates into Rs. 30,000 per month before taxes.  Q.I am a senior citizen of 68 years and I have taken a health insurance plan of Rs. 3 lakh and top-up of Rs. 6 lakh. I was hospitalized for COVID in a reputed hospital and discharged after six days. As this hospital is not approved, I paid Rs. 1.24 lakh and got reimbursement. But the insurer deducted Rs. 33,000 towards cost of medicines, x-ray, room and boarding charges stating that this was above my eligibility. In exclusions, nothing mentioned about the medicine [cost] limit, consultation, laboratory charges etc. Being a COVID patient, tests have to be done regularly. Please advise whether there is any limit or cap on these charges? L. BALAKRISHNAN A.In most hospitalisation policies there are sub-limits. This means under your overall sum assured there is a limit on various heads of expenses starting with your room rent. The choice of your room type cascades on many other hospital charges and this is what you have faced as a short payment of your claimed amounts. Having been treated for COVID, you may also face many non-medical expenses like sanitisation costs and cost of personal protection equipment kits excluded from your claim. As for sub-limits on the other expenses you mention, please read your policy and talk to your insurance company representative to understand the status. Pre- and post hospitalisation expenses will be covered as per your policy for specified periods.

13 September 2021||New York,||Qualifier Raducanu wins battle of teens to be crowned queen||British teenager Emma Raducanu completed the greatest underdog title triumph in tennis history on Saturday, becoming the first qualifier to capture a Grand Slam title with a straight-set defeat of Canada’s Leylah Fernandez in the US Open women’s final. Raducanu, 18, was the first British woman in 44 years to win a Slam crown after beating 73rd-ranked 19-year-old left-hander Fernandez 6-4, 6-3 to take the $2.5 million top prize. It was a stunning achievement for the unheralded 150th-ranked teen, who didn’t drop a set in three qualifying matches and seven main draw matches over two weeks on the New York hardcourts in producing a stunner for the ages. Not since Virginia Wade in 1977 at Wimbledon had a British woman taken a Slam singles title, with Raducanu the first Briton to claim the US Open crown since Wade in 1968. Royal salute Queen Elizabeth II was among the first to pay tribute to Raducanu’s remarkable win. “It is a remarkable achievement at such a young age, and is testament to your hard work and dedication,” the British monarch said in a statement. Wade and British men’s tennis legend Tim Henman were among a sellout crowd of 23,700 that created an electric atmosphere at Arthur Ashe Stadium in the first-ever women’s Slam final between unseeded players. Fernandez, who turned 19 on Monday, had ousted defending champion Naomi Osaka, second-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, fifth seed Elina Svitolina and three-time Slam winner Angelique Kerber in her epic run to the final. “I’m very proud of myself the way I played the last two weeks,” Fernandez said. “I hope to be back here in the finals and having the right trophy,” added a tearful Fernandez, before paying tribute to New York as the city marked the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Raducanu is the youngest US Open champion since Serena Williams in 1999 and the first US Open women’s champion not to drop a set since Serena in 2014. The showdown of prodigy talents was the first all-teen Slam final since 17-year-old Serena Williams beat 18-year-old Martina Hingis for the 1999 US Open crown. Reflection of the future “Both of us were playing fearless tennis for two weeks,” Raducanu said. “I hope we play each other in many more tournaments and hopefully finals. “It shows the future of women’s tennis and the depth of the game right now is so great.” Raducanu has had the fewest Slam starts of any women’s Slam winner, reaching the fourth round in July at Wimbledon in her only prior Slam appearance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/qualifier-raducanu-wins-battle-of-teens-to-be-crowned-queen/article36423245.ece
13 September 2021||Chennai,||Arun has Vijay CC in a spin||Off-spinner B. Arun took his second five-wicket haul of the season to help UFCC (T. Nagar) bowl out Vijay CC for just 171 in the TNCA first division league match here on Sunday. At Nelson-Wahe Guru, S. Aniruda slammed a brilliant 162 off just 139 balls (21x4, 5x6) to power Globe Trotters to a massive 413 against Nelson SC. It was heartbreak for R. Sathyanarayan at SSN College as he missed out on a century by one run after he helped Young Stars to get to a modest total of 199 against India Pistons. He was the last man to be dismissed.

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Juniors may tilt the scales in India’s favour||With the FIDE online chess Olympiad reaching the homestretch and the margin of error shrinking, there will be no room to experiment as an upbeat India takes on an unpredictable Ukraine in the two-match quarterfinals on Monday. The teams appear evenly matched on the two men and two women boards but the juniors — in-form Nihal Sarin and R. Vaishali — promise to tilt the scales in India’s favour. Probable line-up Viswanathan Anand, Vidit Gujrathi/P. Harikrishna, K. Humpy, D. Harika, Nihal Sarin and R. Vaishali make the probable starting line-up in the first set of six games. Showing encouraging form, seasoned campaigners Anand and his old foe Vassily Ivanchuk (3 points from 6 games) seem set to resume their rivalry that began from their teens in the 1980s. Anton Korobov (2.5/4) — the strongest player in Ukraine’s line-up — could pose a serious threat on the second board. Humpy will face either Iulija Osmak (4.5/7) or Nataliya Buksa (4.5/6), but Harika is almost certain to meet an in-form Natalia Zhukova (4.5/5). In the junior section, Nihal could play Yevgeniy Roshka (2/3) while Vaishali anticipates a clash against Mariia Berdnyk (4.5/6). Here, India appears the favourite to strike the decisive blow. The winner of the India-Ukraine clash will take on the winner of the Kazakhstan-USA match. In the other two quarterfinals, Russia meets Hungary and China plays Poland.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/juniors-may-tilt-the-scales-in-indias-favour/article36423240.ece
13 September 2021||London,||‘ECB has written to ICC on outcome of cancelled Test’||The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has officially written to the ICC to decide the fate of the cancelled fifth Test against India at Old Trafford, indicating that the two boards are far from reaching a settlement. The series-deciding fifth and final Test in Manchester was called off after a COVID-19 outbreak in the Indian camp forced its senior players to express their apprehensions to both the BCCI and ECB on going ahead with the match. “Yes we have written to the ICC,” an ECB spokesperson said when asked if they want the global body to decide on the fifth Test. The ECB wants the ICC’s Dispute Resolution Committee to address the issue and expects a forfeiture be granted so that it can claim insurance as it is going to lose £40 million if the match is declared abandoned due to COVID.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ecb-has-written-to-icc-on-outcome-of-cancelled-test/article36423241.ece

13 September 2021||Leeds,||Elliot injury overshadows Liverpool’s win over Leeds||Liverpool moved alongside Chelsea and Manchester United at the top of the Premier League table with a 3-0 win at Leeds overshadowed by serious injury suffered by teenage star Harvey Elliott. The hosts’ midfielder Pascal Struijk was sent-off for a challenge that appeared to break the 18-year-old’s left leg midway through the second-half. By that point Liverpool was already comfortably ahead thanks to Mohamed Salah’s 100th Premier League goal and Fabinho’s 50th minute strike. Sadio Mane rounded off the scoring in stoppage time. Thomas Lemar drove in a 99th-minute winner as Atletico Madrid came from behind to beat Espanyol 2-1 on Sunday and ensure Antoine Griezmann’s first game back with the club ended with a victory. Inter Milan’s perfect start to the defence of its Serie A title ended on Sunday when it was held to a 2-2 draw at Sampdoria but still moved up to second. The champion is two points behind league leader Napoli, which heaped more misery on a struggling Juventus with a 2-1 victory.  The results: Premier League: Leeds 0 lost to Liverpool 3 (Salah 20, Fabinho 50, Mane 90).

Heroes gathered 73 for eight in the allotted 11 overs. After the target was revised to 75 as per the VJD method, Dazzlers fell short by one run. Wicketkeeper-batsman Gandhi — who top-scored for the side with 25 and effected two run-outs — plundered 22 runs, including two sixes and as many fours, in the Super Over.

13 September 2021||KOLKATA,||Gokulam Kerala held by Army Red||Defending Champion Gokulam Kerala started its title defence with a draw as it was held by regimental side Army Red 2-2 in a Group D match of 130th Durand Cup football at Kalyani Stadium on Sunday. Gokulam Kerala started on a positive note and secured an early lead when Ghanaian attacker Rahim Osumanu found the Army Red net with a spectacular long-range attempt. Things became difficult for the Kerala side when its first-choice goalkeeper Rakshit Dagar had to be replaced after a nasty collision with Army Red’s Mukesh Kumar. With substitute P.A. Ajmal under the bar, Gokulam Kerala’s citadel fell soon. Army Red equalised at the half-hour mark through P. Jatin before Bikash Thapa secured the lead just before the interval. Gokulam Kerala regrouped in the second half but had to wait till the 70th minute when its Afghanistan recruit Sharif M. Mohammad scored from a penalty.  The results: Group D: Gokulam Kerala FC 2 (Rahim Osumanu 9, Sharif M. Mohammad 70-pen) drew with Army Red 2 (P. Jain 30, Bikash Thapa 43).

13 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sriram Balaji keen to build on latest title he won in France||It has been a struggle post the pandemic for Sriram Balaji in the doubles circuit to retain his composure and confidence, as he slipped from a career best doubles rank of 96 to 183. The 31-year-old from Coimbatore, Balaji had won nine matches in all from 19 tournaments in the season. Thus, the doubles title with Ramkumar Ramanathan in France on Saturday came as a whiff of fresh air for Balaji to strengthen his resolve to climb the slippery ranking ladder.  “This title is special. It has been more than two years since I won a title. I was one of the first players to get out of the country after the lockdown last year to compete in tournaments,” recalled Balaji. For the most part, Balaji had partnered Luca Margaroli of Switzerland. The rest of the time he teamed up with compatriots Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan, Arjun Kadhe and Ramkumar. “When you don’t win many matches, like in the last two or three months, it is mentally difficult,” conceded Balaji. Help from coaches When he was finding it hard to win two matches in a row, it was the coaches who kept Balaji’s morale high, helping him stick to the basics and stay focused on the process. “Big thanks to my coaches Alexander Waske and Bastian Suwanprateep. They were always with me in every situation,” acknowledged Balaji. Next week’s plan With Ramkumar having joined the Davis Cup team for the tie against Finland in Helsinki, Balaji will be competing the next week in Istanbul with Hiroki Moriya of Japan. “After that I am taking a week off and will play three Challengers with Ram,” said Balaji.  Balaji has tried to strike the right combination in doubles so as to get back to the Grand Slam circuit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sriram-balaji-keen-to-build-on-latest-title-he-won-in-france/article36423478.ece

13 September 2021||Kochi,||Sreeshankar vows to come back stronger||He was virtually flying in April, producing some big jumps, but something went wrong for long jumper M. Sreeshankar in early May. He felt weak, it was tough to push himself and with the Olympics close, desperation set in. For someone who had leapt to a National record 8.26m in the Federation Cup in March, there was a shocking slump in Sreeshankar’s form in June and July. The 22-year-old could only manage 7.74m (Indian GP) in June and 7.69, his poorest jump this year, at the Tokyo Olympics. “My body felt very weak then. To get the sort of jumps I produced (at recent meets), I don’t even need a short approach. During training, there have been sessions when I felt disappointed after jumping 8.10m,” said Sreeshankar in a chat with The Hindu from JSW’s Inspire Institute of Sport (IIS), Vijayanagar in Karnataka. “I don’t know whether it was the COVID vaccine, I had gastric issues after my first shot on May 4 and everything was slow after that. I had to abandon six training sessions because I wasn’t really well. “Some doctors said I may have had asymptomatic COVID during this period,” he said. Tests conducted at the IIS over the last few days reveal that Sreeshankar had suffered muscle imbalance, the reason for his misery. “The medial part of my left leg was very weak, that’s why the strength imbalance. So the whole mechanism of my running and jumping was affected. “And strength and conditioning experts say my body has become deconditioned owing to health issues,” explained Sreeshankar. He is now undergoing four weeks of intensive rehabilitation, which includes a daily morning session with strength and conditioning coach Spencer Mackay, at the IIS. He also consulted orthopedic surgeon Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala, who had set right Neeraj Chopra’s elbow in 2019, when he came for the JSW function to honour Olympians on Saturday. “He told me there was nothing but biomechanical issues involved. The strength imbalance in some part of my glutes or back needs rehabilitation. Within a few weeks, I should be fine,” he said. Sreeshankar is now keen to return stronger. “In April, I was in great form. If we had continued that, definitely I would have hit 8.30m-plus range. I thought Tokyo’s fast Mondo track would have been the perfect stage to hit my best. But it was completely different. “I am now confident that I will come back to my 8.30m form.

13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Actor Nani opens up on ‘Tuck Jagadish’ and asserts that he will be ready with theatrical releases when things return to normal||“We made a film for family audiences. Given the pandemic where families might hesitate to come to theatres, we are making it easier by taking our film into their homes on a festive day,” says actor Nani. The Shiva Nirvana-directed family drama stars Nani, Ritu Varma, Aishwarya Rajesh, Jagapathi Babu, Thiruveer, Nasser and Rohini. The trailer of Tuck Jagadish indicates a mainstream emotional family drama. Nani asserts that Shiva Nirvana’s story goes beyond scratching the surface of family dynamics: “We are looking at complex issues. Often, we see films where the on-screen characters turn emotional but viewers don’t relate to it. This is a film where, we hope, the viewers will also get emotional. At the same time, we took a commercial approach intending to draw whistles in theatres.”  Tuck Jagadish is set in Bhudevipuram, a fictional village, and was filmed in Pollachi in Tamil Nadu and the East Godavari region in Andhra Pradesh. A few years ago, Nani became synonymous with films where he scored high on comic timing. Then came the sports drama Jersey (2019) where alongside the cricket scenes, he was lauded for his performance in the emotional segments. He reflects, “I entered cinema as an outsider in 2008 and had the opportunity to take up films with diverse storylines. Each time I was part of a fun film, people liked it. After a point, I decided it was time to do something else. Nag Ashwin had faith in me for Yevade Subramanyam ( where the protagonist learns to look at life beyond the corporate rat race), Gautam Tinnanuri could see me as cricketer Arjun in Jersey and Shiva Nirvana could see me in an intense role in Ninnu Kori , all of which worked.” The complete actor Nani recalls a discussion among family members he had overheard in his younger days, about what made Kamal Haasan and Chiranjeevi stand out: “They said an actor is someone who should make you laugh when he laughs and make you cry when he cries. When I began acting, I wanted to see if I could do that. To me, being a complete actor is more important than sporting six pack abs, riding horses or looking stylish.” In Tuck Jagadish , his character believes that men don’t cry. “Jagadish believes boys shouldn’t cry; I don’t subscribe to that personally. The story explores the journey of a sensitive guy who ultimately breaks down, and has beautiful moments.” Nani debuted as an actor 13 years ago and he says is ready for the next stage. He describes Shyam Singha Roy as a supernatural thriller with multiple elements and Ante Sundaraniki as a “mad, mad film” from director Vivek Athreya. Taking stock of his career, Nani says, “I didn’t think I would last this long.” An unfulfilled wish is to act in a Mani Ratnam film and he believes it will happen if it is meant to. Right now, he wants to be a part of the change that Telugu cinema has been witnessing in recent times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/actor-nani-opens-up-on-tuck-jagadish-and-asserts-that-he-will-be-ready-with-theatrical-releases-when-things-return-to-normal/article36423808.ece
13 September 2021||September 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Off the beaten track||I am from Tamil Nadu and have graduated in B.Sc. Agriculture. I am interested in learning music and dance and want to make dance my profession. Should I opt for B.A in Music and Dance? Deebika Dear Deebika, What form and style are you interested in? Do you have a prior base or is it something that you wish to start now? There many accredited universities across the country that offer academic courses — degrees, post-graduate certifications and more. Also, there are many well reputed schools and centres for preforming arts and specialised academies that conduct these courses. Identify the style and level you want to establish first and then start your research and shortlist a dedicated teacher and good school. I am currently in the first year of B.Sc. Geology. I want to work in a meteorological station. Will I be eligible for this? What course do I have to take in my Masters for this? Also which institutes offer meteorological sciences? Kalvi Dear Kalvi, The basic prerequisite to become a meteorologist or a climatologist is a three-year B.Sc or four-year B.Tech degree in Meteorology or Atmospheric Sciences or Oceanic Sciences from a recognised university. Some roles such as teaching, research, management positions require a Masters degree or even a Ph.D.’You can do an M.Sc after your degree. CUSAT Kochi, ABVHV Bhopal, Kalinga University, Raipur, Jain University, Bangalore are a few institutes that offer the course. I completed B.Com CA in 2018 and joined a top MNC. I resigned in February this year to pursue higher education. I have a few courses in mind: MA Public Policy Law, MBA or Interior Design. I want to become an entrepreneur. What would be appropriate? Hussain Ali Dear Hussain, A MBA would be a straight choice. I would suggest a Masters in Entrepreneurship from a recognised well-established B School as it is a course that is specifically designed for graduate students who want to set up highly impactful, innovative businesses and become entrepreneurs. It will also give you an edge and some great interning opportunities. My son has completed Class 12 and is applying for his engineering courses. He wishes to know which is the preferred course in engineering of all the available ones. My preference is for Mechanical but I would not force it on him. He shows preference for Computer Science Engineering. How does CSE stand in comparison to Mech? Ishaq Dear Ishaq, Good to know that you do not want to force your choice on him. As you must be aware, Mechanical Engineering is all about machines — design, structure, working; and that has great scope. CSE is about computers and coding. Since he likes that, his ownership to do justice will be way higher. It is also a very highly sought-after course. Both branches have good job opportunities. Let him make an informed choice.

13 September 2021||New Delhi,||Cleaning the Yamuna A story of missed deadlines||The draft NCR Regional Plan-2041 prepared by the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) has fixed 2026 as the new deadline to ensure ‘zero discharge of untreated sewage and industrial discharge into the Yamuna’. The story of cleaning up the Yamuna has so far been that of missed deadlines. The first Yamuna Action Plan (YAP), for which a loan agreement was signed in 1992, was for “improvement of water quality conservation in the river, and hygiene environment in the cities in the river basin”. After the first and second plans, YAP-III is presently under way, but the Yamuna is not even fit for bathing in the Delhi stretch, except for Palla — the point where the river enters Delhi — according to city government data. On January 19, 2020, in the run up to the Assembly election, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a 10-point guarantee card and said: “The Yamuna will be cleaned and made pollution-free. We promise that after five years, anyone will be able to take a dip in the Yamuna without fear of diseases due to dirty water.” But currently, levels of fecal coliform (microbes from human and animal excreta) is beyond the desirable levels in all points except for Palla. At some points, the concentration is 760 times the desirable level. On March 9, during his budget speech, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said: “The Yamuna can now be cleaned completely within the next three years.” Officials say the Yamuna can be cleaned, but experts say it cannot be done with “business as usual” attitude. “We can clean the Yamuna and I will say that with a very big ‘but’. The way things are right now, it is not going to happen, but it can be done if the government really wants to do it,” said Manoj Misra, convener of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, a civil society initiative for the river’s rejuvenation. The Yamuna originates in the Yamunotri glacier in the Himalayas and travels through Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi before its confluence with the Ganga. Though only 2% of the 1,400-km river flows between Wazirabad and Okhla in Delhi, the city accounts for 76% of the pollution load on the river, as per one of the reports of a monitoring committee formed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The Supreme Court and the NGT have also pulled up various authorities responsible for cleaning the river for their laxity. According to the experts and the committee, two of the major causes of pollution are less water in the river in Delhi and 22 drains dumping sewage and industrial effluents into it. To solve the first issue, the water flow has to be increased. The second one can be addressed by treating the sewage and effluents generated in the city. Missed deadlines In 1994, the Supreme Court took cognisance of a newspaper article “Quiet Flows Maily (dirty) Yamuna” and summoned the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to explain the issue. Later, various stakeholders, including the Delhi government, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), the Delhi municipal corporations, and the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments became part of the case. In a judgment on January 13, 2015, on a case filed by Mr. Misra, the NGT formed the ‘ Maily se nirmal (from dirty to clean) Yamuna Revitalisation Plan, 2017’, which was set to be completed by March 31, 2017. But that did not happen and the NGT, in July 2018, formed a monitoring panel headed by two retired bureaucrats to primarily implement the 2015 judgment. The NGT dissolved the committee in January 2021 and directed Chief Secretaries of various States monitor the progress. Sewage problem In Delhi, it is the duty of the DJB to treat the city’s sewage. Though the city generates 720 million gallons per day (MGD) of sewage, the Sewage Treatment Plants have a capacity of 597.26 MGD. Of the total capacity, 514.2 MGD is utilised (86%), leaving about 123 MGD of untreated sewage into the river, according to the DJB. Multiple deadlines have been missed by the DJB too, though there is progress. The DJB had told the NGT’s monitoring panel that it will increase the utilisation of the existing STPs to 99% by June 2019, but more than two years after the deadline, it stands at 86%. Similarly, the Interceptor Sewer Project (ISP), which has been in the plans since 2006, has been delayed multiple times. “Entire flow (of sewage in drains) shall be trapped and treated by March 2023 after construction/rehabilitation of Coronation Pillar, Rithala and Kondli STP under YAP-III,” reads a July report of the Delhi government, which states that the project is “completed”. Similarly, there are around 1,700 unauthorised colonies in Delhi with a total population of around 40 lakh. Currently, only 561 of these colonies have sewer lines; in the other localities, sewage is dumped directly into the Yamuna via drains. In 595 colonies, work is in progress on laying sewage pipes. Mr. Misra, however, said untreated effluents from industries are more toxic. “The government counts only the industries in the industrial area when they say all of them have Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), but there are hundreds of illegal industries in residential areas and all across Delhi, whose waste ends up in the Yamuna,” he said. More water If there is more water in the river, it can dilute the pollutants. To assess the minimum required environmental flow of the Yamuna for the stretch between Hathinikund in Haryana to Okhla in Delhi, a study was assigned by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) to the National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), Roorkee, in December 2018. As per the final draft report of the NIH, a flow of 23 cusecs is needed in the lean season, but increasing the flow is not that easy due to existing interstate water treaties. “Ministry of Jal Shakti has observed that the water-sharing agreement of 1994 between Uttarakhand, H.P., U.P., Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi is due for revision in 2025 unless any of the States so demand, implying that no revision of water sharing will be possible to achieve the environmental flow in the Yamuna,” the July report reads. “Zero untreated discharge into Yamuna is a tall order, considering that the DJB is notorious for giving deadlines and then extending it. But it can be done. For instance, to increase the flow of water, all States have to come together and think about the river and not them, but it needs political will,” Mr. Misra said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cleaning-the-yamuna-a-story-of-missed-deadlines/article36423648.ece

13 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||An ASI’s novel way to make diary entries in Hindi easier||Delhi Police is officially using speech-to-text software to ensure that documentation work is not hampered due to officers facing difficulty in typing in Hindi. The initiative was formally taken up by Assistant Sub-Inspector Lavkesh Kumar, posted in Karol Bagh police station. On September 10, he received an appreciation letter from Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Jasmeet Singh. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Kumar said many officials had been facing problems in uploading entries to the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System (CCTNS) in Hindi as they are not accustomed to typing in the language. Explaining the process, the ASI said he uses a speech-to-text feature on WhatsApp that can transcribe spoken Hindi into Devanagari script. “After the message is typed, one can open WhatsApp Web on their system and copy-paste the message on to the CCTNS portal,” he said. Mr. Kumar said he has been using the process for a long time and it has now been formalised in the police station. The ASI said that about a week ago, concerns were raised about general diary entries — an essential part of policing — not being uploaded on the CCTNS. Officials told seniors that they find it tough to type in Hindi on a keyboard. Mr. Kumar suggested his method and it was accepted by the senior officers. “I was always interested in learning new technology. I keep asking seniors to teach me new methods of policing with respect to technology and they help,” said the 50-year-old who joined the Delhi Police in 1990 as a constable. In his appreciation letter, Mr. Singh wrote: “I would like to place on record my deep appreciation for the excellent work done by you [Mr. Kumar] in connection with the process of filling details of FIRs, case diaries, etc. in Hindi font in CCTNS through voice system using apps viz. Intel Remote Keyboard Version 1.14 and Mobile Version 1.4.0 in Karol Bagh police station.” Fewer errors A senior police officer said many elderly head constables and constables relied heavily on CCTNS data operators to upload the information as they were unable to type in Hindi. Many officers also wrote down the information on paper and shared it with the data operators, increasing scope of error. “The speech-to-text system will cut down errors,” the officer said, adding that even the young officers find it tough to type in Hindi as they are used to typing in English. Another advantage of the system is faster turn around of documentation work and reduction in use of paper. DCP Singh said the technology is currently being used only at Karol Bagh police station. If it is successful, the system will be implemented in other stations, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/an-asis-novel-way-to-make-diary-entries-in-hindi-easier/article36423644.ece
13 September 2021||Chandigarh,||Cancel FIRs against farmers, Sidhu writes to Punjab CM||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday wrote to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, seeking action on farmers’ demands, including cancellation of “unfair” FIRs registered against them during their agitation. Asserting that the Congress stood by farmers’ against the farm laws at every stage, Mr. Sidhu, however, asked the State government, “we must do more” and “not let the three black laws be implemented in Punjab at any cost.” He wrote to the Chief Minister two days after meeting representatives of 32 farm bodies which had raised their demands with him. In a meeting with representatives of all political parties except the BJP, the farmer leaders had told them not to carry out electioneering till the Punjab polls are announced. In a letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Sidhu wrote, “This is to bring to your attention and request for necessary action, upon the demands raised by 32 farmer unions at the meeting called by them.” He said farmer leaders demanded “the cancellation of unjust and unfair” FIRs registered against the farmer unions due to cases of violence during the agitation in the State.” Noting that the Congress and the State government provided support to farmers protesting against the Centre’s farm laws, Mr. Sidhu said, “Yet, some FIRs have been registered due to untoward incidences,” adding that the government could set up a mechanism to consider each case on compassionate grounds and cancel all “unfair” cases. Referring to farmers’ fear of demand for land records by the Centre before the crop procurement, Mr. Sidhu asked the State government to fight against the Centre’s “injustice”. “I personally believe it is unfair,” he said, adding that partition of land had not happened in many parts of the State for decades. Centre flayed “This is also an attack on the resilient system of procurement by MSP through Arthiyas and to push the farmers away from APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committees) mandis towards private markets where no such records are being demanded. Thus, I strongly feel that the Central Govt is actually creating ‘One Nation, Two Markets’ with different rules for APMC and private markets. This injustice we must fight against,” wrote Mr. Sidhu.
