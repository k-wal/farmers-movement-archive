04 September 2021||MANGALURU,||People urged to follow weekend curfew norms||While Deputy Commissioners of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi K.V. Rajendra and M. Kurma Rao, respectively, on Friday, urged people, particularly businessmen, to strictly adhere to weekend and night curfew norms being imposed to contain COVID-19, people’s representatives from the region demanded lifting of weekend curfew in Dakshina Kannada. During a virtual meeting with officials on COVID-19 control on Friday, Dr. Rajendra said that merchants should follow all COVID-19 control norms. The district administration will take legal action against those who did not comply with them, he said and added that he would hold a meeting with merchants shortly. While asking health workers to make use of allocated vaccine doses on the same day, he said that focus should be on vaccinating all those in the border areas who run the risk of getting the infection. About 15,000 tests should continue to be carried out in the district everyday. Health workers were also asked to keep a close tab on those in home quarantine. Private hospitals were asked to do COVID-19 test of all those having symptoms of cold, cough and fever and shift them to COVID Care Centres if they are tested positive. Speaking to reporters in Udupi, Mr. Kurma Rao said that weekend and night curfew were being imposed in the district as it was closer to Kerala where positive cases were on the rise and the district receives a large number of students from that State. Weekend curfew would be in force from 9 p.m. on Friday till 5 a.m. on Monday. However, people could buy essentials between 5 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, he said. Demand Minister for Social and Backward Classes Welfare Kota Srinivas Poojari and Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath on Friday met Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai in Bengaluru and urged him to lift weekend curfew in the coastal region. In a memorandum, they said that merchants have demanded the withdrawal of weekend curfew as it was posing problems for workers, autorickshaw drivers and small businessmen in earning a living, more so in Mangaluru, which is a commercial centre. At the same time, people should strictly follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour to contain the spread of the pandemic, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/people-urged-to-follow-weekend-curfew-norms/article36284436.ece
04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Edible oil prices likely to ease by December: official||Soaring edible oil prices are likely to soften by December as international commodity futures show a declining trend and along with the arrival of domestic oilseed crops, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said on Friday. However, he indicated that the government would be constrained from further import duty cuts to reduce oil prices as it needs to augment its own resources affected by COVID-19. Average retail prices of major edible oils have risen by up to 48% over the last year, driven by surging global prices and lower domestic production of soybean which is India’s largest oilseed crop. However, Mr. Pandey expressed confidence that the spike is over. Global decline “December futures for soybean and palm oil are showing marginally declining trends. So at least we can expect that there will be no more rise in prices,” Mr. Pandey told journalists, adding that the arrivals of domestic soybean crop and the rabi season mustard crop would also help to soften prices. “Hopefully, prices should remain under control. There will be a decline, but not a very dramatic decline because global commodity pressures are still there.” China factor Officials say that one of the reasons that global prices have surged is excessive buying of edible oil by China. Another reason is that many major oil producers are aggressively pursuing biofuel policies and diverting their edible oil crops for that purpose. That includes oil palm in Malaysia and Indonesia as well as soybean in the United States, the two oil types that make up 50% of India’s domestic consumption. India currently imports about 60% of its edible oil needs, leaving the country’s retail prices vulnerable to international pressures. However, governmental taxes and duties also make up a major chunk of the retail price of edible oils. Two months ago, the Centre cut import duties on crude palm oil from 15% to 10%, saying that the reduction would remain in effect till the end of September. However, effective duties, which include cess and other charges, are still at 30.25% on crude palm oil and 41.25% on refined palm oil. Asked whether any further tax cuts were likely, Mr. Pandey only noted that the “pandemic has affected the resources of everyone ... and the government also faces constraints. But still, whatever the government could do, they have done.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/edible-oil-prices-likely-to-ease-by-december-official/article36283995.ece
04 September 2021||Vijayawada,||Rs. 1,124 cr. credited into accounts of MSMEs, spinning mills||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday credited Rs. 1,124 crore towards incentives for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and textile and spinning mills, benefiting a total 97,423 units and over 12 lakh employees. The textile and spinning mills got Rs. 684 crore and MSMEs Rs. 440 crore, including rebate on electricity bills payable by them. With this, the expenditure incurred by the government on MSMEs so far amounted to Rs. 2,086 crore. It consisted of Rs. 1,588 crore arrears left over by the TDP government. A large number (62%) of the beneficiary industries are run by BCs, SCs, STs and minorities and 42% by women. On the occasion, Mr. Jagan said supporting MSMEs was crucial to save the economy which took a severe beating owing to the COVID pandemic as it sent growth rates crashing around the world, and India was no exception to the downward curve. In the last 27 months, he said, the government provided over 25 welfare schemes to the people without any discrimination and corruption even in difficult times, due to which the purchasing power had been sustained and it helped in the survival of industries. The Chief Minister said that 68 major industries had invested Rs. 30,175 crore and provided direct employment to 46,199 people since the YSR Congress Party formed the government in 2019. Besides, 62 mega industries were being set up with an employment potential for 76,916 people. Mr. Jagan said emphasis had been laid on Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMCs). One such major EMC was coming up at Kopparthi in Kadapa district at a cost of Rs. 730.50 crore, wherein investments amounting to Rs. 10,000 crore were targeted to be attracted. Mr. Jagan said the State government had stepped in to set up the integrated steel plant (named YSR Steel Corporation Limited) envisaged in the A.P. Reorganisation Act, in Kadapa district as the Central government’s commitment thereof did not materialise. The estimated cost of YSR Steel Corporation was about Rs. 13,500 crore. Bhogapuram airport Focus was also laid on construction of the greenfield airport at Bhogapuram in Vizianagaram district at a cost of Rs. 3,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jagan-credits-rs-1124-crore-into-bank-accounts-of-msmes-spinning-mills/article36284000.ece
04 September 2021||CHENNAI,||Veera Vasantharayar mandapam to be restored within a year, says Minister||The restoration of Veera Vasantharayar Mandapam of Sri MeenakshiSundareswarar Temple in Madurai would be completed within a year, Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments P.K. Sekarbabu informed the State Legislative Assembly on Friday. A part of the mandapam was destroyed in a fire in 2018. Addressing concerns raised by AIADMK legislator R.B. Udhayakumar (Thirumangalam) in the House, Mr. Sekarbabu said stones brought from Namakkal district for that purpose were being used. "It was suspected that if the stones were carved in Namakkal, they might be damaged while in transit. So, we decided to bring the stones to Madurai and do the work there." To a statement made by Mr. Udhayakumar that steps were taken by the erstwhile AIADMK regime towards the restoration of the mandapam, Mr. Sekarbabu pointed out though a committee was constituted in this regard in 2018, it never met until the change of the government this year. "It is we who have taken steps to ensure that the restoration is complete." While replying to another query raised by CPI (M) legislator M. Chinnadurai (Gandarvakottai), who sought to know whether the government would come forward to consecrate Sivan Thirukkoil at Mangalaakoil in Gandarvakottai union in Pudukkottai district, the Minister assured: "Our CM is someone, who will take along both believers and atheists hand in hand. On his advice, we are taking several steps to consecrate many temples."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/veera-vasantharayar-mandapam-to-be-restored-within-a-year-says-minister/article36284415.ece
04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Directed by SC, Delhi Police traces minor girl within days||Barely 48 hours after it was put on the job by the Supreme Court, the Delhi Police traced a minor girl to Kolkata and arrested a man accused of kidnapping her. The speed with which the Delhi Police acted on the case came out in direct contrast to the Uttar Pradesh Police’s inability to trace the girl, who is from Gorakhpur, for two months. “This is certainly a reflection of the U.P. Police,” a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar remarked orally. Exasperated by the U.P. Police’s attitude, the court, which was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 13-year-old’s mother, had turned to the Delhi Police on September 1. In fact, the last straw for the court was when the U.P. Police asked for another two weeks to crack the case.  The court said the U.P. Police seemed to have not realised the urgency and seriousness of the case. In the last hearing, the court asked the Delhi Police Commissioner “to ensure that prompt further investigation, as may be necessary, is directed in tracing out the missing girl and report compliance at the earliest”. On Friday, the Delhi Police counsel said the girl would be handed over to the mother, represented by advocate Amit Pai, on Saturday. It said the relevant evidence, including medical, have been placed on record. The girl had last been seen by her younger sister on the morning of July 8 before she had gone missing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/directed-by-sc-delhi-police-traces-minor-girl-within-days/article36284492.ece

In an official communication, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad and District Returning Officer Nitesh Patil said that polling concluded peacefully and 53.81% voters had cast their votes. In all, there are 420 candidates fighting it out in 82 wards of the municipal corporation. The total number of wards increased to 82 from 67 after delimitation and there are 8.17 lakh voters in the twin cities. In the last municipal council elections, 66% polling was recorded. Polling began at a very slow pace with only 7.73% voters casting their votes in the first two hours. Chairman of the Legislative Council Basavaraj Horatti, Hubballi-Dharwad West MLA Arvind Bellad and the former MLA Chandrakant Bellad were among those who cast their votes early.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/polling-ends-peacefully-in-hubballi-dharwad/article36284241.ece
04 September 2021||Chennai,||Delhi’s excess deaths twice the official COVID-19 toll||The number of “excess deaths” registered by the Civil Registration System (CRS) in Delhi ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit (from April 2020 to June 2021) was an estimated 55,239, which is 2.2 times the official reported figure of 24,977 COVID-19 deaths for the same period. The undercount factor increased to 3.4 if only the January to June 2021 period is considered, rising due to a surge in mortality during the second wave in May and June 2021. Data on deaths registered from January 2020 to June 2021 in Delhi were sourced by The Hindu via multiple Right to Information (RTI) queries filed with five urban local bodies. Data for the previous years were sourced from the annual reports on the registration of births and deaths in Delhi. The excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the month-wise total number during the pandemic period and the average of deaths registered for the same months during the pre-pandemic period (2018 & 2019). If only 2020 is considered, the excess deaths are considerably fewer than the COVID-19 deaths. Thus, the undercount factor was below one. This might be due to the sudden drop in the number of patients from outside Delhi due to a stringent lockdown and border closings during the first wave. The CRS includes deaths among the migratory population too, while the death estimations done by the Sample Registration System considers only the fatalities among the domiciliary population. Back in 2001, the number of registered CRS deaths in Delhi was only 1.1 times that of the estimated SRS deaths. By 2018, registered CRS deaths were more than double (2.25 times) the estimated SRS deaths. This shows the significant increase in patients from outside Delhi who come to the city’s hospitals to access its superior healthcare facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhis-excess-deaths-twice-the-official-toll/article36283997.ece

There is no permission for erecting pandals, organising pujas at public places, distributing ‘prasadams’, using loud speakers, arranging lighting systems, organising processions, performing ‘nimajjajams’ and conducting cultural programmes. “Utsav committees, apartments and residents’ welfare associations and temple managements have been requested to celebrate festival in adherence to COVID-19 norms,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-nod-for-ganesh-festival-in-public-places/article36283998.ece
04 September 2021||JAIPUR,||Footprints of 3 dinosaur species found in Thar desert||In a major discovery, footprints of three species of dinosaurs have been found in the Thar desert in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer district, proving the presence of the giant reptiles in the western part of the State, which formed the seashore to the Tethys Ocean during the Mesozoic era. The footprints, made in the sediment or silt of the seashore, later became permanently stone-like. They belong to three species of dinosaurs — Eubrontes cf. giganteus , Eubrontes glenrosensis and Grallator tenuis . While the giganteus and glenrosensis species have 35 cm footprints, the footprint of the third species was found to be 5.5 cm. Virendra Singh Parihar, assistant professor, Jai Narain Vyas University, Jodhpur, a member of the team of palaeontologists that made the discovery recently, told The Hindu on Friday that the footprints were 200 million years old. They were found near Jaisalmer’s Thaiat village. All carnivorous The dinosaur species are considered to be of the theropod type, with the distinguishing features of hollow bones and feet with three digits. All the three species, belonging to the early Jurassic period, were carnivorous, said Dr. Parihar. Eubrontes could have been 12 to 15 m long and weighed between 500 kg and 700 kg, while the height of the Grallator is estimated to have been 2 m, as much as a human, with a length of up to three metres. Careful geological observations enabled the scientists to interpret ancient environments in which the rocks of the footprints, which were once soft sediments, were deposited. Fieldwork in the Kutch and Jaisalmer basins has suggested that after the main transgression during the early Jurassic period, the sea level changed several times. Dr. Parihar said some features of the Grallator tenuis footprint, involving a wide angle of digits, very narrow toes, and long claws, had strong similarities to the early Jurassic ichnogenus of Stenonyx. Jan Schlogl of Comenius University in Slovakia and Grzegorz Pienkowski from Warsaw University in Poland were the first to discover dinosaur footprints in India after the ‘Ninth International Congress on the Jurassic System’ was held in Jaipur in 2014. Dr. Parihar said the possibility of finding more evidence of dinosaurs in the Jaisalmer and Barmer districts is very strong. “It is just the beginning of the findings of dinosaur remains in Rajasthan. More such discoveries will be made in the near future,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/footprints-of-3-dinosaur-species-found-in-thar-desert/article36284151.ece

The accident occurred when water suddenly gushed in at the causeway, 3 km from the Anantapur-Kadapa border at 3 a.m., following a breach in the Yerragunta tank, the police said. According to the Kadiri police, Hussain Basha, a Kadiri resident and former TDP councillor, along with his son Babjan, 19, was travelling to Vijayawada in the car being driven by Rafiq, 30. Hussain managed to jump out of the vehicle before the water swept away the car. The bodies of Rafiq and Babjan have been retrieved. They are residents of Moorthypalli in Kadiri. The Kadiri-Pulivendula Highway was washed away at four places due to heavy rain and communication has been totally cut off. Talupula mandal in Anantapur district recorded 142 mm of rain in 24 hours till 8.30 a.m. on Friday, while Kadiri mandal recorded 83 mm. This is the second time this monsoon that Kadiri has received such heavy rain. On the earlier occasion, Kadiri received 21cm of rainfall in 12 hours on July 18. Traffic affected In another incident at Gajulollapalli in Gandlapenta mandal, a motorcyclist slipped into the stream, but people saved him. Meanwhile, traffic was affected as the road network was damaged at several places. Several acres of standing paddy and groundnut crops got inundated in Talupula, Kadiri and Gandlapenta mandals in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-persons-die-in-ap-flash-floods/article36283951.ece

04 September 2021||Bengaluru,||Breakthrough infections: Experts divided on need for booster dose||With an increasing number of breakthrough infections being reported in the State, some public health experts are of the view that a third (booster) dose of COVID-19 vaccine is required, especially for healthcare workers. However, opinion is divided on the issue. Breakthrough infections are those that occur among people who have contracted COVID-19 despite being vaccinated. Till August 26, Karnataka had recorded 14,421 breakthrough infections and 126 succumbed to the disease. According to data from the State Health and Family Welfare Department, while 11,881 infections and 109 deaths were reported among those who have taken the first dose, 2,540 infections and 17 deaths were reported among those who have been fully vaccinated till August 26. M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said that in his personal opinion healthcare workers, who were inoculated in the first phase after vaccination was rolled out on January 16, need a booster shot now. “This is especially in the wake of a possible third wave hitting the State in October-November as predicted by the TAC in May 2021,” he said. Pointing out that the issue was yet to be taken up for discussion in the TAC, Dr. Sudarshan said, “I personally feel a third dose will boost the confidence of healthcare workers to manage the third wave confidently. The State should write to the Centre in this regard.” However, he was quick to add that it is a policy decision. “It will be based on need assessment and vaccine availability. With a major chunk of the population yet to be fully vaccinated and vaccination of children yet to begin, availability is limited. But a decision has to be taken at the earliest because even if the process of administering a third dose begins now, it will take two-three months,” Dr. Sudarshan asserted. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) also has similar views. It has even written to the Centre on the need for a booster shot for healthcare and frontline workers. Srinivasa S., chairman of National IMA Standing Committee for Child Health, said a third dose is required as there are reports about waning vaccine immunity. “Healthcare workers, who were prioritised for vaccination in the first phase, should get a booster dose,” he said. ‘Not the solution’ However, TAC member Giridhar R. Babu, who also heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at Indian Institute of Public Health in Bengaluru, said, “Breakthrough infections after two doses is more of a reason why booster dose is not the solution.” In a series of tweets on Friday, Dr. Babu said, “Vaccine efficacy is established against preventing death and reducing hospitalization. It will be mostly met with two doses. The assumption that a third dose will prevent infection when the first two doses have not is an untested one... Trial data and real-world effectiveness data can tell what proportion are breakthrough infections. This can be monitored as background rate and see trends. In areas with many breakthrough infections, very few need hospital care and ICUs... Most health care workers who have breakthrough infections have been either detected due to routine/mandatory testing or with minor illness. Their immune response has worked effectively with two doses. That is why they do not need hospitalization. How will a third dose help them?”  Meanwhile, the State-run Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences in Bengaluru will soon start a study to assess the need for a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.  With a major chunk of the population yet to be fully vaccinated and vaccination of children yet to begin, availability is limited. But a decision has to be taken at the earliest because if the process of administering a third dose begins, it will take two-three months. M.K.

The gang had poached a couple of deer. Upon receiving information from forest watchers, the squad rushed to the spot and tried to nab the poachers. It transpired that the gang members opened fire, forcing the forest guards to retaliate in which one of the poacher was injured. Three other members of the gang escaped. The injured has been identified as Venkatesh of Gollaradoddi village and he has been admitted to the government hospital in Mandya. Wildlife activists, who expressed concern over the incident, said poaching for animal meat was rampant on the fringes of Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. Hence, they called for strengthening intelligence gathering and ramping up anti-poaching camps. In the past, poachers armed with guns and moving around in the area in search of prey have been photographed by the camera traps set to capture the images of wild animals in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/forest-guards-fire-on-poachers-one-injured/article36284465.ece

Ramana has, in yet another first, recommended 68 names in one stroke for elevation as judges of various High Courts. The Collegium, in back-to-back meetings on August 5 and September 1, considered 112 candidates for High Court appointments. Sixty-eight of 112 names have been recommended for appointments to 12 High Courts. Of the 68, there are 44 from the Bar and 24 from the Judicial Service. Scripting history in gender representation in the judiciary yet again, the Collegium recommended a woman judicial officer belonging to the Scheduled Tribes, Ms. Marli Vankung, as judge of the Gauhati High Court. If the government approves the recommendation, she would be the first ever High Court judge from the State of Mizoram. Even otherwise, the Collegium’s recommended names have 10 women. Meanwhile, the Collegium has sought further details about 16 candidates whose names were considered in its meetings. The 12 High Courts for which the names have been recommended are Allahabad, Rajasthan, Calcutta, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Madras, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab and Haryana, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Assam. These recommendations come close on the heels of the three-member Collegium consisting of Chief Justice Ramana, Justices U.U. Lalit and A.M. Khanwilkar recommending seven names for the Telangana High Court on August 17. August 17 was also the day on which the five-member Collegium had recommended nine names for elevation to the Bench of the Supreme Court. Their appointment by the government soon after the recommendation by the Collegium has seen the Supreme Court’s judicial strength rising to 33, just one short of its full capacity. The quickening of the pace of judicial appointments process both in the Supreme Court and the High Courts by the Chief Justice Ramana-led Collegium sends a strong message that the judiciary is determined to resolve the problem of vacancies with utmost priority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-collegium-recommends-68-names-for-hc-judges-in-one-go/article36283677.ece

04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Supreme Court rejects Bengal’s petition on DGP appointments||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a West Bengal plea questioning the authority of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to shortlist the names for Director of Police (DGPs) based on a judgment of the court. One of the seven directives of the Prakash Singh judgment in 2007 is that a Chief Minister has to choose from among the three most senior police officers empanelled by the UPSC for the DGP post. These officers should have a guaranteed tenure as DGP for a minimum two years. The judgment was a conscious reformative step to thwart attempts by State governments to appoint pliant officers at the top. However, West Bengal argued that the power granted to the UPSC, a Central body, to prepare the panel was a direct attack on the federal structure of governance. The subject of ‘police’ belonged to the State list. The State’s plea came at a time when the CBI has written to the West Bengal DGP office for information about the alleged incidents of murder and rape in the post-poll violence in the State. The court was not impressed by West Bengal’s submissions. “Why are you bringing such matters and wasting time? On one hand, you yourself say urgent matters of bail, etc. are not being heard by the court, and then you come with such petitions... Is this not abuse of the law,” Justice L. Nageswara Rao, who headed a three-judge Bench, told senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, for West Bengal. The court, however, allowed the State to implead itself in the main case on police reforms. Noting that the main case in which the court is monitoring compliance by States “has not seen the light of the day for years,” the Bench, also comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and B.V. Nagarathna, said it would take up the main matter for hearing in October. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for former IPS officer Prakash Singh, submitted that in most States, directions of the court remained unimplemented. In its application, West Bengal said the 2006 judgment was “not in consonance with extant constitutional and legal framework”. The State government has the autonomy to select the DGP, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supreme-court-rejects-bengals-petition-on-dgp-appointments/article36283977.ece
04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||India and Russia friendship has stood the test of time, says Modi||The India-Russia friendship has “stood the test of time”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Friday while virtually addressing the Far Eastern Economic Forum 2021, currently under way in the Russian port city of Vladivostok. Mr. Modi’s remarks came days after Russia abstained from a crucial Afghanistan and terrorism-related resolution at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), where India served as the President for August. He mentioned a number of areas spanning connectivity, space research and ship-building, which, he stated, were redefining the strategic bilateral partnership. “The friendship between India and Russia has stood the test of time. Most recently, it was seen in our robust cooperation during the COVID-19 pandemic, including in the area of vaccines. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of the health and pharmaceutical sectors in our bilateral cooperation. Energy is another major pillar of our strategic partnership,” he noted and asserted that the India-Russia energy partnership could stabilise the global energy market. Mr. Modi announced that an energy and trade bridge from Vladivostok to Chennai was taking shape. The speech, however, did not mention the situation in Afghanistan even though substantial consultation had taken place between the two sides on the deteriorating security situation in the war-torn country. Mr. Modi called up Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 24 to discuss Afghanistan among other issues. While India is concerned about the fallout of the Taliban takeover of Kabul on Kashmir, Russia is worried about a similar spillover along its southern borders. During the discussion on the UNSC Resolution 2593 on August 31, Russia claimed that the draft statement divided terrorists as “ours versus theirs” and abstained alongside China. Mr. Modi said Vladivostok was the confluence of Eurasia and the Pacific. “In Indian history and civilization, word, the term ‘ sangam ’ has a special meaning. It means confluence or coming together of rivers, people or ideas. In my view, Vladivostok is truly a ‘ sangam ’ of Eurasia and the Pacific. India will be a reliable partner of Russia in realising this vision,” he observed. The modern ship-building facility at Zvezda and the Mazagaon Docks Limited would work together for the “construction of some of the most important commercial ships in the world”. The Eastern Economic Forum is being attended by Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri. The forum was set up by a decree of Mr. Putin in 2015 to support the economic development of Russia’s far east and “expand international cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-russia-friendship-has-stood-test-of-time-says-modi/article36283702.ece
04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC faces virtual hearing woes||Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana on Friday expressed his dissatisfaction in open court over the software newly put in place in the Supreme Court for virtual hearings. “Take out this software and bring the old one. I am very unhappy with this one,” Chief Justice Ramana was heard telling the court officials and technicians present in the courtroom. While the court stoically transformed from physical to virtual mode nearly two years ago without losing a single day’s work in the face of a debilitating pandemic, it seems to have not settled into a suitable software. Though the court began hybrid physical-virtual hearings from September 1, the virtual mode continues to be in vogue amidst reports of a third wave. The CJI’s remark has come within days of the court moving to Cisco from the previous one - Vidyo. In fact, a few days ago, some senior lawyers, who had been unhappy with Vidyo, were seen commending the shift to Cisco. Judges voice concerns Months of virtual court hearings through Vidyo had seen lawyers complain of poor connectivity, echoes and other disruptions. On several occasions, judges too had recorded their unhappiness about the technical interruptions during hearings. In fact, in January, a Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul took an exasperated poke at the virtual court system. “We, at the inception, must note our exasperation at the inability of the virtual court system to work satisfactorily in the Supreme Court while there are no such problems in the Delhi High Court next door! We have been since yesterday trying to cope with the problem of disconnections, resonance of voices, even when there is single person arguing… The only voice we hear is the resonance of our own voices!,” it observed. The court’s mobile app for journalists to view virtual hearings, which was launched in May keeping in mind the health and convenience of reporters during the pandemic, has unfortunately been patchy. There were days when several courtrooms were not accessible on the app. No. of courts shrink After the introduction of Cisco, the number of courtrooms available through the mobile app have diminished with each passing day. Reporters have gone back to depending on lawyers for virtual court links in order to cover crucial hearings. Chief Justice Ramana, while launching the mobile app, had highlighted the need for transparency. “The role of the media assumes importance in the process of disseminating information,” he stressed. The initiative to launch the mobile app for journalists came after he had heard that reporters were depending on lawyers for video links of virtual hearings, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-faces-virtual-hearings-woes/article36283933.ece
04 September 2021||CHENNAI,||IT rules framed to regulate unlawful content, says govt.||The Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on Friday told the Madras High Court that it had “lawfully” notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules of 2021 to regulate publishers of news and current affairs on digital media and publishers of online curated content on Over the Top (OTT) platforms from publishing “unlawful” content. The submission was made in a counter affidavit before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu, who were seized of two writ petitions filed by Carnatic vocalist T.M. Krishna, the Digital News Publishers Association, and former Editor of The Hindu Mukund Padmanabhan, challenging the constitutional validity of the statutory rules that were notified on February 25. The counter, served upon senior counsel P.S. Raman and advocate Suhrith Parthasarathy, representing the petitioners, said the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution was not absolute and that it was subject to limitations under Articles 19(2) and 19(6), which empower the State to make laws imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right. “A common threat that runs across all reasonable restrictions is public interest and it is beyond any pale of doubt that restrictions may be imposed on freedoms for the interest of the public at large. The Rules have been clearly enacted bona fide for the benefit of the public,” the counter affidavit read. Claiming that the IT Rules, 2021, were framed after holding public consultations with the stakeholders, the Ministry said the significant expansion of the online intermediary ecosystem, growth of online social media platforms and their influencing capabilities were some of the reasons for framing the new rules. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, too, filed a separate counter affidavit and claimed that the Rules had been brought in to provide an institutional framework for digital media and OTT platforms. The judges decided to commence hearing arguments in the case from September 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/it-rules-framed-to-regulate-unlawful-content-says-govt/article36283692.ece
04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fill up vacancies by Oct.: Pradhan||Central universities have been given a two-month deadline to fill up their 6,000 plus vacancies, which form a third of all sanctioned faculty positions. “Let us work on a mission mode. During Shikshat Parv [Education Festival], let us start a campaign, a mission to fill up these 6,000 seats within September and October,” said Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in his first interaction with the Vice-Chancellors of 45 Central universities on Friday. Mr. Pradhan added that while there may be a few anomalies at some universities, all institutions should advertise their vacant posts by September 10. Vice-Chancellors who participated in the meeting said there was a special focus on backlog vacancies — positions which have not been filled despite having been advertised — as well as on vacant positions which have been reserved for Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Class communities. Out of 6,229 vacant positions, 1,767 were for the OBC category, 1,012 for the SCs and 592 for the STs, Mr. Pradhan said. Mr. Pradhan praised Jawaharlal Nehru University for introducing a new course on counter-terrorism that has come in for criticism for referring to “jihadi terrorism” as the only form of fundamentalist religious inspired terrorism. The course is meant for engineering graduate students specialising in international relations. “Our engineers today are not just engineers. If a course helps engineering students understand the kind of obstacles they could face in developing social products, then I congratulate JNU for introducing such a course,” he said. Focus on mother tongue The Education Minister also emphasised the importance of using Indian languages in education at all levels, as recommended by the National Education Policy. He said he was not opposed to the English language in principle, and accepted that foreign languages helped Indians participate in the global economy, but pointed out that, prime importance had to be given to the mother tongues of learners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fill-up-vacancies-by-oct-pradhan/article36283981.ece
04 September 2021||New Delhi,||Adhir Ranjan mobbed by TMC cadre in Murshidabad||Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Friday was reportedly targeted by mobs of Trinamool Congress workers and supporters when he visited the Murshidabad district in West Bengal. Mr. Chowdhury, who is the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief in West Bengal, was visiting Gudhaipara village under Raninagar II block in Murshidabad to probe the alleged violence against Congress supporters by the ruling party workers. The timing of the confrontation is significant as it comes in the middle of efforts to bolster Opposition unity. The face-off also comes barely 24 hours after Mr. Chowdhury had written to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing Trinamool workers of unleashing violence against Congress workers. Mr. Chowdhury’s office also released videos of his motorcade being chased by a mob, women showing brooms, slippers and black flags in Raninagar II Block. “I am touring this place because yesterday I got calls for help from our mothers and sisters. Yesterday, for an uninterrupted five hours, their homes were attacked, vandalised and looted. Even the fish in their ponds and bamboo plantations were not spared,” Mr. Chowdhury told reporters in Murshidabad. “There is an atmosphere of fear and terror here. These people fear that attacks will restart after we leave the place. I have raised all these issues in my letter to the Bengal Chief Minister,” he added. Mr Chowdhury’s letter, dated September 2, will also give fresh ammunition to the BJP that has been targetting the Mamata Banerjee government over post-poll violence in the State. In his letter to Ms. Banerjee, the Congress leader alleged, “I would like to flag your kind attention to the violence and atrocities committed by the ruling party’s workers in a broad daylight today when houses of Congress party workers were vandalised and looted.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adhir-ranjan-mobbed-by-tmc-workers-in-west-bengal/article36283673.ece
04 September 2021||Kolkata,||Manjula Chellur to monitor probe into post-poll violence||The Calcutta High Court on Friday appointed former Chief Justice of the High Court Manjula Chellur to monitor the Special Investigation Team ( SIT) probe into the post-poll violence in West Bengal. The court, in its August 19 order, had directed that the SIT be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge. “On account of immediate non-availability of a retired Honourable Supreme Court Judge to take up the assignment, we deem it appropriate to modify the aforesaid part of the order, while adding that the working of the SIT is to be monitored by a retired Chief Justice of a High Court. Further we had requested Honourable Ms. Justice Manjula Chellur, retired Chief Justice of this Court, to take up the assignment. She has very graciously accepted our request. We accordingly appoint her to overview the working of SIT,” the order said. The order on Friday was by the court’s five-judge Bench, headed by Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, which had passed the August 19 order. The court also said that it would be the duty of the Chief Secretary of West Bengal “to ensure that all arrangements for Justice (retd.) Chellur’s travel and stay are made, and protocol facilities are extended to her”. On August 31, one of the petitioners had approached the High Court saying that while CBI teams were visiting the families of the victims of post-poll violence cases in districts, the SIT had not started its work. The High Court, in its order on August 19, had deputed three senior IPS officers Soumen Mitra, Suman Bala Sahoo, and Ranvir Kumar to look into cases of post-poll violence. Subsequently, ten more IPS officers have been assigned to the SIT. The CBI has so far registered more than 30 FIRs in the case. On Friday, one more arrest was made by the CBI in connection with a murder at Jagadal, taking the total arrests so far to five.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/manjula-chellur-to-monitor-probe-into-post-poll-violence/article36283679.ece
04 September 2021||Srinagar,||Restrictions, communication shutdown continue in Kashmir||Restrictions on the movement of people and a communication blackout continued in the Kashmir Valley on Friday after the death of separatist leader Syed Shah Geelani on Wednesday and his burial in the early hours of Thursday. Mobile Internet and calling services, except for BSNL fixed lines, remained suspended on Friday. There was negligible movement of people and traffic on the roads. Most markets remained shut. Inter-Kashmir train services were suspended. All post-graduation examinations to be held by the Kashmir University on September 3-4 were also postponed. Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said Internet services on mobile phones would remain suspended till Sunday afternoon in Kashmir. Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh said, “The situation across Kashmir has been peaceful. People are cooperating to ensure peace. There has not been even one single untoward incident. Security forces are exercising utmost restraint.” Additional forces Additional deployments were made on Friday and many sensitive areas sealed in many districts in the Valley to disallow any protests after the noon prayers. No congregational prayers were allowed at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid and the Hazratbal shrine. Security forces also barricaded the graveyard at Srinagar’s Hyderpora, where Geelani, former Hurriyat chairman, was buried. Restrictions were strict in north Kashmir’s Sopore, which was Geelani’s hometown. The closure of Internet service affected online businesses, travellers and students appearing for online exams. “I missed my paper for the engineering course I am pursuing in a Punjab varsity. Due to the pandemic, the exams are being held online,” Nazia Shah, a student from the old city, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/restrictions-communication-shutdown-continue-in-kashmir/article36283688.ece
04 September 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata’s ‘idol’ to share space with Durga in Kolkata pandal||A controversy has erupted in West Bengal after the organisers of a Durga puja pandal decided to put up an idol of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at their marquee alongside goddess Durga’s, provoking angry reactions from the BJP that called the move “nauseating” and one that hurt the sensibilities of the Hindus in the State. Famous clay modeller Mintu Pal is sculpting the fibreglass idol at his Kumartuli studio, draping the “deity” in the Trinamool Congress supremo’s favourite white-coloured tant saree and her trademark flip-flop slippers to boot. “I have studied photographs and videos of the Chief Minister as a reference point, including the way she walks, speaks and interacts with the public, while moulding the face of the idol,” Mr. Pal said on Friday. The ten hands of the deity, instead of holding weapons, would depict the projects taken up by the government. However, the BJP was not amused. “This deification of Mamata Banerjee, who has blood of innocent Bengalis on her hand following the gruesome post poll violence in Bengal, is nauseating. This is an insult to goddess Durga,” said the party’s IT head, Amit Malviya, on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamatas-idol-to-share-space-with-durga-in-kolkata-pandal/article36283695.ece
04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Army conducts exercise with armoured elements in Ladakh||The Army conducted an exercise with armoured elements in the super high altitude area (SHAA) of Ladakh under the aegis of the Leh-based 14 Corps. This comes in the backdrop of the Army’s renewed focus on beefing up armour in high altitude terrain following the deployment of tanks by India and China during last year’s stand-off in Eastern Ladakh. “Lt. Gen. P.G.K. Menon, General Officer Commanding (GOC), Fire And Fury Corps, reviewed the operational preparedness of Snow Leopard Brigade on Thursday through integrated manoeuvre and live fire exercise in SHAA of Ladakh,” the Defence PRO in Srinagar said on Twitter. The Snow Leopard Brigade is located at Nyoma, which is very close to the Chushul range, according to a Defence source. During the stand-off last year, India and China deployed tanks at SHAA on the South Bank of Pangong Tso (lake) at very close proximity, just a few 100 metres apart, with their barrels facing each other. As part of the first phase of disengagement from Pangong Tso in February last, tanks and armoured elements on the South bank were withdrawn along with frontline troops and other equipment. After a major reorganisation in 2017, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was all mechanised, a second Defence source added. “The terrain here permits use of tanks and mechanised elements as there are lots of plains in Eastern Ladakh,” the source stated, pointing to the possibility of tank battles in this area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/army-conducts-exercise-with-armoured-elements-in-ladakh/article36283699.ece
04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Directed by SC, Delhi Police trace minor girl within days||Barely 48 hours after it was put on the job by the Supreme Court, the Delhi Police traced a minor girl to Kolkata and arrested a man accused of kidnapping her. The speed with which the Delhi Police acted on the case came out in direct contrast to the Uttar Pradesh Police’s inability to trace the girl, who is from Gorakhpur, for two months. “This is certainly a reflection of the U.P. Police,” a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar remarked orally. Exasperated by the U.P. Police’s attitude, the court, which was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 13-year-old’s mother, had turned to the Delhi Police on September 1. In fact, the last straw for the court was when the U.P. Police asked for another two weeks to crack the case. The court said the U.P. Police seemed to have not realised the urgency and seriousness of the case. In the last hearing, the court asked the Delhi Police Commissioner “to ensure that prompt further investigation, as may be necessary, is directed in tracing out the missing girl and report compliance at the earliest”. On Friday, the Delhi Police counsel said the girl would be handed over to the mother, represented by advocate Amit Pai, on Saturday. It said the relevant evidence, including medical reports, have been placed on record. The girl had last been seen by her younger sister on the morning of July 8 before she had gone missing. The court scheduled another hearing on September 7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/directed-by-sc-delhi-police-trace-minor-girl-within-days/article36283931.ece
04 September 2021||New Delhi,||RSS-linked publication slams Infosys for GST, I-T portals’ snags||The issues surrounding the Goods and Services Tax (GST) portal and the new Income Tax website, developed by the Bengaluru-based Infosys, has come under scathing attack by RSS associated magazine Panchjanya . Its cover story of its September 5 edition is on how Infosys, being the technology vendor for the government to develop these two portals, has “messed up” the execution. The cover has Infosys founder Narayana Murthy’s picture and the text ‘ Saakh Aur Aaghaat ’ [‘Reputation and a Grievous Harm’]. The story alleges that both the portals and their attendant problems, in terms of public interface and usage, have led to a situation where trust in the government and its tax collecting system has been brought down. The article says that a known software company was given the contract by the government to simplify the system, but it has, rather, made a mess of the matter.

More interestingly, the article alleges that the Infosys Trust finances many “Left wing” outfits, including fact-checking ones, and media portals that are openly against the Modi government.

04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||India, U.S. sign project agreement on air-launched UAV||India and the United States signed a project agreement (PA) on July 30 for an Air-Launched Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (ALUAV) under the ambit of the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI), the Defence Ministry said in a statement on Friday. The PA was inked between the Ministry and the U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) by the co-chairs of the Joint Working Group (JWG) on Air Systems under the DTTI. ALUAV prototype “The PA outlines the collaboration between Air Force Research Laboratory, Indian Air Force, and Defence Research and Development Organisation towards design, development, demonstration, testing and evaluation of systems to co-develop an ALUAV prototype,” the statement from the Defence Ministry said. The PA fell under the Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation Memorandum of Agreement between the Ministry and the DoD that was first signed in January 2006 and renewed in January 2015, the statement added. Significant step It was a significant step towards deepening technology collaboration between the two nations through the co-development of equipment, it stated. The DTTI’s main aim was to bring a sustained leadership focus on promoting collaborative technology exchange and creating opportunities for co-production and co-development of future technologies for the military forces of both nations. Under the DTTI, JWGs on land, naval, air, and aircraft carrier technologies had been established to focus on mutually agreed projects in the respective domains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-us-sign-project-agreement-on-air-launched-uav/article36283700.ece
04 September 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Experts flag diversion of fresh water from Brahmani river||Environmentalists on Friday expressed concern over the massive diversion of fresh water from the Brahmani river basin, which could pose a grave threat to the famous mangrove vegetation in Odisha. Bhitarkanika — a notified Ramsar wetland — is spread over 195 sq. km and is home to 62 mangrove species. Besides, 1,600 salt water crocodiles crawl on the mudflats of the Bhitarkanika mangrove forest. Mangroves grow in brackish water. Proportionate fresh water flow from the Brahmani river basin and the Kharasrota river keep the salinity level of the water along the shore down. The brackish water becomes ideal for the mangroves to grow and stay healthy. Guzzler industries The Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO), an environmental pressure group, had drawn public attention on the excess water allocation for industries, which is likely to reduce fresh water discharge to the sea. “The Talcher-Angul coal mines, steel and power plants as well as the Kalinganagar steel and power hub are drawing enormous quantities of fresh water from the Brahmani river,” said Biswajit Mohanty, secretary, WSO. “Against an available 4,400 mcum of fresh water stored by the Rengali reservoir, 4,318 mcum, that is almost equal to the available water supply shall be withdrawn from the river,” he said. According to the WSO secretary, 105 million litres, as per government claims, would be withdrawn for the mega drinking water project. Mr. Mohanty said, “The reduction in water flow would lead to drastic changes in the water regime of the Bhitarkanika mangroves. The Sunderbans mangrove forest was drastically affected after the Farraka barrage was commissioned.” Stating that the lack of normal flow of fresh water would increase saline ingression upstream, the WSO secretary said it would affect the local flora and fauna as well as the livelihoods of the farmers and fishermen. Besides, there could be a quantum increase in the man–crocodile conflict since the estuarine crocodiles would leave the core sanctuary area and migrate upstream once salinity increases, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-flag-diversion-of-fresh-water-from-brahmani-river/article36283704.ece

BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said farmers and workers were linking the mahapanchayat to their dignity. He said this would be the first time that he would be going to his home district since the agitation had started in November 2020. “I had pledged bill wapsi, nahin to ghar wapsi nahin (I will not return home, till the bills are repealed),” he said. Mr. Tikait said it was the call of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha that compelled him to return to Muzaffarnagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sept-5-mahapanchayat-will-be-historic-says-bku/article36284152.ece
04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||SC rejects Bengal plea on DGP appointments||It said the State had earlier also come to the top court with identical arguments. The court said the State was repeating itself and heedlessly wasting judicial time. “Why are you bringing such matters and wasting time? As it is we have individuals filing the kinds of petitions that should not even be heard, now States are coming up with such petitions... On one hand, you yourself say urgent matters of bail, etc, are not being heard by the court, and then you come with such petitions... Is this not abuse of the law,” Justice L. Nageswara Rao, who headed a three-judge Bench, asked senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, for West Bengal.  The court, however, allowed the State to implead itself in the main case on police reforms. Noting that the main case in which the court is monitoring compliance by States “has not seen the light of the day for years”, the Bench, also comprising, Justices B.R. Gavai and B.V. Nagarathna, said it would take up the main matter for hearing in October. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for former IPS officer Prakash Singh, submitted that “unfortunately, in most States, directions of the court remains unimplemented”. In its application, West Bengal said the 2006 judgment was “not in consonance with extant constitutional and legal framework”. The State has the autonomy to select the DGP, it said. It argued, “The Constitution does not vest the UPSC with the power to assess the respective merit of the officers holding the rank of DGP in the State for determining the fitness to be appointed as the DGP, Head of Police Force of the State... It is the State government which can have the proximate opportunity to assess the fitness of officers...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-rejects-bengal-plea-on-dgp-appointments/article36283684.ece
04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Edible oil prices likely to ease by December||Officials say that one of the reasons that global prices have surged is excessive buying of edible oil by China. Another reason is that many major oil producers are aggressively pursuing biofuel policies and diverting edible oil crops for that purpose. That includes oil palm in Malaysia and Indonesia as well as soybean in the U.S, the two oil types that make up 50% of India’s domestic consumption. Import dependence India currently imports about 60% of its edible oil needs, leaving the country’s retail prices vulnerable to international pressures. However, governmental taxes and duties also make up a major chunk of the retail price of edible oils. Two months ago, the Centre cut import duties on crude palm oil from 15% to 10%, saying that the reduction would be in effect till the end of September. However, effective duties, including cess and other charges, are still at 30.25% on crude palm oil and 41.25% on refined palm oil. Asked whether any further tax cuts were likely, Mr. Pandey only noted that the “pandemic has affected the resources of everyone ... and the government also faces constraints. But still, whatever the government could do, they have done.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/edible-oil-prices-likely-to-ease-by-december/article36283974.ece

04 September 2021||New Delhi,||Sub-inspector took bribe in Deshmukh’s case: CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has alleged that its sub-inspector, Abhishek Tiwari, received bribes from the former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh’s lawyer to share confidential information about the probe against him. Both the lawyer and the sub-inspector are currently in CBI custody. The sub-inspector was part of the team led by a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) which had gone to Mumbai on April 6 this year to conduct a preliminary enquiry against Mr. Deshmukh, as directed by the Bombay High Court. The team members examined several persons, including Mr. Deshmukh. The DSP, as an enquiry officer, submitted the report on April 16. The accused sub-inspector was assisting him in preparing the report and had been in possession of the case-related documents, according to the First Information Report. “Pursuant to the comments and opinion of senior officers, including legal officers, and after the approval of the competent authority”, a case was registered against Mr. Deshmukh and others on April 21, the CBI said. The agency later found out that copies of the documents pertaining to the enquiry had been disclosed to unauthorised persons. The sub-inspector had come in contact with Anand Dilip Daga, the Nagpur-based lawyer of Mr. Deshmukh, and had been in touch with him, the agency said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sub-inspector-took-bribe-in-deshmukhs-case-cbi/article36283675.ece

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Delhi’s excess deaths twice the official toll||Data for the previous years were sourced from the annual reports on the registration of births and deaths in Delhi. The excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the month-wise registered deaths during the pandemic period and the average of deaths registered for the same months during the pre-pandemic period (2018 & 2019). If only 2020 is considered, the excess deaths are considerably fewer than the COVID-19 deaths. Thus, the undercount factor was below one. This might be due to the sudden drop in the number of patients from outside Delhi due to a stringent lockdown and border closings during the first wave. The CRS includes deaths among the migratory population too, while the death estimations done by the Sample Registration System considers only the fatalities among the domiciliary population. Back in 2001, the number of registered CRS deaths in Delhi was only 1.1 times that of the estimated SRS deaths. By 2018, registered CRS deaths were more than double (2.25 times) the estimated SRS deaths. This shows the significant increase in patients from outside Delhi who come to the city’s hospitals to access its superior healthcare facilities. Commenting on the under-count factor falling below one in 2020, Dr. Jugal Kishore, head of the Community Medicine Department at Safdarjung Hospital said, “Our hospital used to receive a lot of patients from Bihar, U.P., Rajasthan, Haryana, and all over the country. But non-COVID patients from other States were very less during 2020. This year, the lockdown was not that strong and we got more patients from other States. So the undercount factor being below one for 2020 could be explained because of this.” “Delhi’s reporting system of COVID deaths initially had some problems and there were some fluctuations,” he said. “Still, there was under-reporting of COVID deaths as tests could not be done or the deaths occurred at home. But Delhi has much better reporting of deaths compared to other States,” he added. ( With inputs from      Nikhil M. Babu )||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhis-excess-deaths-twice-the-official-toll/article36283681.ece

In a positive development, a senior executive of Western Union Co said the firm was resuming money-transfer services to Afghanistan in line with a U.S. push to keep up humanitarian work. The Taliban enforced a radical form of sharia, or Islamic law, when it ruled from 1996 to 2001. But this time around, the movement has tried to present a more moderate face to the world, promising to protect human rights and refrain from reprisals against old enemies. The United States, the European Union and others have cast doubt on such assurances, saying formal recognition of the new government, and the resultant flow of economic aid, was contingent on action. The Taliban have promised safe passage out of the country for any foreigners or Afghans left behind by the huge airlift that ended when U.S. troops withdrew ahead of an August 31 deadline. But, with Kabul airport still closed, many were seeking to flee over land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mullah-baradar-set-to-head-taliban-govt/article36283683.ece
04 September 2021||New Delhi,||‘Chargesheet a figment of police imagination’||Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, arrested in the north-east Delhi riots conspiracy case, told a local court on Friday that the chargesheet against him contained hyperbolic allegations without any factual basis. “The chargesheet is a result of the fertile imagination of the police officer who drafted it and the witnesses are procured ... He is not writing the script of The Family Man [a famous web series starring actor Manoj Bajpayee],” senior advocate Trideep Pais, representing Mr. Khalid, contended while seeking bail. Mr. Khalid, arrested on September 13, 2020, is facing charges under the anti-terror Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for allegedly being one of the ‘masterminds’ and one of the main conspirators as well as instigators behind the riots in northeast Delhi last year. Mr. Pais described the chargesheet as figment of imagination of the police referring to a line which stated that Mr. Khalid kept a safe distance from Delhi as he knew that it would be thrown into the fire. “The last person who travelled with someone and got into this officer’s head was Voldemort from Harry Potter ,” the senior advocate quipped. Mr. Pais further argued that several statements carried in the chargesheet could not be relied upon while considering his bail. “There is no way these statements are consistent with each other and meet the test under the UAPA,” he argued. Mr. Pais said there was nothing in Mr. Khalid’s speech that was seditious, however, public opinion was being shaped by the nature of language and allegations in the chargesheet. The court will hear the bail plea again on September 6. Police’s stance Earlier, the Delhi police had stated that Mr. Khalid cannot claim parity with other accused — Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha — who were released on regular bail. The Delhi police said the Supreme Court, while hearing the appeal filed by them against the judgments granting bail to the three, had clarified that these judgments “shall not be treated as a precedent and may not be relied upon by any of the parties in any of the proceedings.” “So, these judgments cannot be cited and relied upon by the applicant/accused [Mr. Khalid] in the instant case,” the Delhi police said.

Ahmedabad was rocked with as many as 21 blasts across the city, including at the civil hospital’s trauma centre, in a span of 75 minutes. Verdict reserved After the protracted trial that began in December 2009 and lasted almost 13 years, the special trial court judge, A.R. Patel, on Friday concluded the hearing and reserved his verdict. During the trial, the prosecution examined over 1,100 witnesses against the accused, who are allegedly members of the Indian Mujahideen (IM), a faction of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). The Gujarat police during the investigation found that the IM terrorists had planned these blasts as revenge for the 2002 post-Godhra riots, in which several persons from the minority community were killed. FIRs registered Immediately after the blasts in Ahmedabad, the police recovered live bombs from different parts of Surat, following which 20 First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered in Ahmedabad and 15 in Surat. Subsequently, all 35 FIRs were consolidated naming 85 persons, out of which the trial commenced against 78 accused. One of the accused later turned approver, leading to the trial against 77 persons. Seven other accused are still absconding. The accused have been charged with murder, criminal conspiracy and relevant provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/court-concludes-trial-of-2008-ahmedabad-blasts/article36283693.ece

Following Zycov-D by Zydus Cadilla and Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, Corbevax becomes the third India-made vaccine that may be available for use in children. Zycov-D has already received authorisation for emergency use in children, who are over 12 years. Covaxin is being tested in children who are younger and officials have said that the vaccine is likely to be ready by September. Corbevax is based on a vaccine technology of a protein antigen, in this case the spike protein, which binds to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell membrane and facilitates virus entry. The body’s own cells then make more copies of this protein that then stimulates the immune system of the body to produce antibodies to protect against a potential, future infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/biological-e-jab-gets-nod-for-trial-among-children/article36283708.ece
04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The effects of three gunas||In the Devi Bhagavata Purana, many interesting discussions on the character, behaviour and actions of all beings in creation are featured as a dialogue between Janamejaya and Vyasa. The puranas are open and frank about the mistakes committed by all people, including those who are Satvik by nature and uphold righteousness as a way of life. Janamejaya tells Vyasa that he is unable to understand how even Indra, who is supposed to hold the position of a Lokapala, at times can stoop to such levels so as to disturb the penance of sages. What about his own father Parikshit or his forebears the Pandavas, or even Bhishma, who have committed mistakes in their lives? Vyasa draws attention to the important fact that adharma is indispensable in life, said Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. Adharma is an offshoot of the three gunas that are integrated with Prakriti. All created beings, right from Brahma to the smallest ant, are bound by Prakriti and cannot escape the effects of the three gunas — satva, rajas and tamas. These get ingrained as vasanas and instigate people to act in both good and bad ways. The behaviour of any individual thus depends on the permutations and combinations of the gunas. This is the reason why, at times, even the celestials are guilty of mistakes just as the asuras and human beings. When Indra is guided by selfish interest, say, if he feels there is a threat to his position, he goes to any extent to safeguard it. Krishna says in the Gita that Kama, desire, and krodha, anger, and greed are the main motives for people to engage in unrighteous deeds. People in Kali Yuga, who are very vulnerable to faults, have no way except to resort to the path of bhakti, by taking shelter in the feet of God who alone can guide them out of samsara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-effects-of-three-gunas/article36283706.ece

Pictures of Gopal Mandal, who is from the State’s ruling party Janata Dal (United), wearing only minimal clothing on a train journey were shared on social media. He allegedly verbally abused a co-passenger who had raised an objection. A fellow passenger has lodged a complaint against the MLA with the government railway police at New Delhi railway station for “misbehaving and snatching of gold items”. The MLA had been travelling on the Patna-New Delhi Tejas Express in the A-1 coach on September 2, it is learnt. “Yes, I had an upset stomach when I was travelling in the train and there was an urgent need to go to the washroom, so I couldn’t wear anything else. But I was wearing a full brief not the short one, and my vest was long. I do not lie,” said Mr. Mandal, who represents the Gopalpur constituency in Bhagalpur district. During the train journey, Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel and the ticket examiner had to intervene to calm the situation that emerged after passengers objected to the MLA’s clothing. Mr. Mandal said there had been no female passengers in the coach. “I accept that it should not have happened.

It is alleged that directors Raj Singh Gehlot, Dayanand Singh and Aman Gehlot connived with the bank officials to get their loan account declared as a non-performing asset (NPA) to facilitate one-time settlement to the company’s advantage. The accused persons had applied to the bank’s Ansal Plaza branch in Delhi for a loan to set up a Twin Five Star Hotel Project in the Shahdara area of Delhi. The initial cost of the project was Rs. 866.89 crore, which was later revised as Rs. 1,275.71 crore. While the J&K Bank extended a loan of Rs. 277 crore, besides Rs. 15 crore as bank guarantee limit, the rest of the money was raised through other lenders. The bank alleged that the loan account was settled for just Rs. 128.94 crore without taking any legal recourse to recover the dues. According to the First Information Report, the bank officials abused their authority for pecuniary considerations to extend favours to the company and its directors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aman-hospitality-directors-booked/article36283705.ece

Due to a delay in obtaining a solvency certificate, Mr. Rao was released on March 6. From then on, he has been residing with his wife P. Hemalatha at Malad East in the city. Mr. Rao seeks an extension on grounds that he takes 13 medicines daily for neurological problems, and other health issues. He has been suffering from constant headaches, known as cluster headaches, and needs further examinations and constant supervision. A neurologist at Jaslok Hospital said Mr. Rao has asymptomatic Parkinson’s ailment and has retention problems, movement disorders with tremors, and gait instability.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-set-to-hear-raos-plea-on-bail-extension/article36283709.ece

04 September 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||Karnataka Cong. leader denies political agenda||Senior Congress leader and former Minister M.B. Patil has played down the controversial demand for “religious minority” tag for Lingayat–Veerashaivas and said a decision on taking it forward collectively by the community will be taken after the 2023 Legislative Assembly elections. During the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, Mr. Patil was among those in the forefront to mobilise support for a separate religion tag for the Lingayat–Veerashaiva community. The former Minister told reporters here on Friday, “I have not raised the demand for a separate religion tag for the Lingayat–Veerashaiva community. I do not have a political agenda or any motive for seeking the tag.” On other Congress leaders maintaining distance from the issue, Mr. Patil said there was no relation between the Congress and unity of the Lingayat–Veerashaiva community. The community’s unity or the issue would not damage the Congress in any way, he said. Mr. Patil reiterated that minority tag would be of benefit for the community in availing of reservation in State and Central government jobs, and seats in educational institutions. However, the issue would be taken up only after the 2023 Assembly elections in Karnataka and all decisions would be made after arriving at a consensus involving leaders and seers of all sub-sects of the community, he said. There are 99 sub-sects in the community. History of demand The demand for separate religion status, which has a long history, was revived in 2017. The former IAS officer S.M. Jamdaar was also among those who spearheaded the movement for a separate religion tag for Lingayats. The Justice Nagamohan Das committee, which was formed in December 2017 to decide on the matter, had suggested that Lingayats be identified as a separate religion. Prior to the 2018 elections, the Karnataka Cabinet decided to go ahead with the recommendations of the committee. The Congress government sought the Central government’s nod for giving separate religion status for “Lingayat–Veerashaivas (followers of Basavanna)”. The move was opposed by some within the Congress such as former Ministers Eshwar Khandre and S.S. Mallikarjun. The BJP had accused the Congress of playing up the issue for electoral gains. It was believed by a section that the demand for a separate religion tag had gone against the Congress in the 2018 Assembly elections. Parallelly, there has also been demand for bringing the dominant Lingayat–Veerashaiva community under the Central list of other backward classes (OBC). In the State, Panchamashali sect of the community has been demanding inclusion under category 2-A of the OBC list.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/karnataka-cong-leader-denies-political-agenda/article36283941.ece
04 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Wealthy groom’ cheats city doctor||The Cyber Crime Wing of the Central Crime Branch has unearthed a matrimonial fraud involving Nigerian nationals who cheated a doctor based in Chennai. Operating from Delhi, the accused posted fake profiles posing as wealthy bridegroom living abroad and collected huge sums of money from the prospective bride. The city police launched an investigation following a complaint from a doctor living in Perambur in July. After she posted her profile on a matrimony site, a person called her posing as Mohammed Saleem, a doctor based in the Netherlands. He said he was sending her a gift. Subsequently, a woman from Mumbai contacted the complainant and demanded Rs. 28,000 as charges for the parcel. After the amount was transferred online, the woman demanded Rs. 77,000 as penalty as the parcel was found to have foreign currency. The police said even after making the payments, the woman again demanded Rs. 1 lakh to convert the Euro into Indian rupee and then again demanded another Rs. 95,000 for upgrading the bank account. Emotional blackmail When she refused to pay, a man claiming to be the brother of Mohammed Saleem, called her and told her that his brother had attempted to end his life. He threatened her that she would face legal action unless she paid up. Hence, she transferred the money. The complainant alleged that the person posing as Mohammed Saleem called her after a few days and collected more money on the pretext of late fees for the parcel and other flimsy reasons. After a few days, he told her that he could fly to India only if she paid for his travel. When she refused, he scolded her and blocked her on WhatsApp. Later, he unblocked her number and sent a text message asking her to pay for his air fare by pledging her jewellery. After she arranged the money, he told her that he would be in India on July 17. On July 17, a woman told the complainant that Saleem had arrived at the New Delhi airport and Rs. 1.35 lakh was required for him to enter India since he did not have a PIO (Person of Indian Origin) card. Else he had to be under the custody of the airport officials, the caller claimed. Suspecting foul play, the complainant asked the woman to send the location, only to be blocked. After this, the doctor lodged a complaint with the police. Police investigation revealed that a gang of Nigerians operating from Delhi was involved, and a special team nabbed two persons identified as Paulinus Chikeluo, 31, and Cletus Ikechukwu, 23, from Uttam Nagar. The police seized mobile phones, laptops, debit cards and Rs. 4.3 lakh from them. They were brought to Chennai and remanded in judicial custody. The police urged members of the public not to believe profiles and photographs posted on matrimony sites, and not to share mobile phone number/WhatsApp details without verifying authenticity. Commissioner of Police Shankar Jiwal said people should not make any payment without seeing the person or without making a thorough enquiry. They should be extra cautious and should not fall prey to the allurement of “gift parcels”, he said.

He founded Oru Paisa Thamizhan and later ran it as Thamizhan . Tamil Nadu politics was proceeding in the way he had shown, the Chief Minister said. The Pandithar was a multi-faced personality: a writer, researcher, historian, anthropologist, publisher, journalist, doctor, public speaker, linguist, polyglot, ideator, activist and a relentless crusader, Mr. Stalin said. “It was Kandappan, the grandfather of Iyothee Thass Pandithar, who handed over a copy of Thirukkural to Mr. Ellis [British civil servant Francis Whyte Ellis], leading to its publication. We should all bow our heads to his family’s contributions to Thirukkural ,” the Chief Minister said. Periyar E.V.

Health Minister urges Centre to give more doses||Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has assured him that the Centre will provide additional vaccine doses for full immunisation of persons residing in nine districts of Tamil Nadu that share a border with Kerala, Tamil Nadu Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said. “Nine districts of Tamil Nadu have road connectivity with Kerala. Already, several restrictions are in place to monitor the movement of people. There is a need for 100% vaccination of residents of these nine districts. The Union Minister has assured to arrange additional doses for these nine districts,” Mr. Subramanian told reporters after meeting Mr. Mandaviya in New Delhi on Friday. Submitting a petition to the Union Minister, Mr. Subramanian said the State had stressed on the need to provide additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines on the basis of the State’s population. “Vaccination is very important to protect the people from the pandemic...We had emphasised the need for additional vaccines during our last meeting. There has been continuous supply of vaccines to an extent for July and August. The State has medical infrastructure to administer two crore doses a month,” he said. The Centre allotted 19 lakh additional doses for July and 34 lakh doses for August due to the State’s good performance, he said and added that while 1.04 crore doses were allocated for September, the State had asked for two crore vaccines. The need to work out a solution to operationalise HLL Biotech in Chengalpattu and Pasteur Institute in Coonoor was raised during the meeting. “Tamil Nadu requires 12 crore vaccines. Till now, 3.30 crore doses were administered, and nearly eight crore more vaccines was required. We raised the need to immediately operationalise these two units. He has said the State and Union governments will discuss and arrive at a solution,” he said. After vaccination was rolled out on January 16, the pace of vaccination was slow for four months during the AIADMK regime. “The daily average was 61,441 persons. In 103 days, only 63 lakh persons were vaccinated. After the DMK came to power, up to 2.67 crore doses have been administered. The daily average increased to 2.12 lakh,” he said and added that these details were presented to the Union Minister. The Minister said they reiterated the need to immediately start construction work of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Madurai. Already, possibilities of admitting students for AIIMS and accommodating them temporarily in private colleges or Jipmer, Puducherry, was discussed. “The only solution to start admission of students is to start construction work at AIIMS. We have put forward a demand to establish a AIIMS in Coimbatore,” he said. On NEET, Mr. Subramanian said the State government would take 100% measures to get exemption from NEET. With inspection of 11 new government medical colleges completed, he said the Union Minister said he would look into the demand to start admission of students this year. He had assured to take up the State’s three-year-old demand for 25 new primary health centres that remained unaddressed. On a few school teachers and students testing positive for COVID-19 in some districts, he said they would have been infected before schools reopened and were identified promptly due to the monitoring by health officers. “We are breaking the chain of transmission early. There is no need to fear,” he said. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan and Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine T.S. Selvavinayagam were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-doses-sought-to-vaccinate-nine-border-districts-minister/article36284111.ece

04 September 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Kodanad crime: High Court directs police to respond to plea to examine EPS, Sasikala||The Madras High Court on Friday directed the Sholurmattam police in Nilgiris district to file its reply to a plea by three accused in the 2017 Kodanad Estate heist-cum-murder case, to summon and examine former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, former CM Jayalalithaa’s close aide V.K. Sasikala and others, before the trial court. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar directed State Public Prosecutor Hasan Mohammed Jinnah to ensure that the reply was filed by September 27. Accused D. Deepu, M.S. Satheesan and A. Santhosh Samy had filed the revision petition against the refusal of the trial court to summon the former CM and others. Justice Kumar told the counsel for the accused that they had not listed out the reasons to summon certain people for examination as defence witnesses. He asked the counsel to be prepared with reasons during the next hearing. He said, a reading of the trial court order alone gives an idea about reasons for rejection of their plea. In his order passed on April 30, Sessions Judge C. Sanjai Baba had stated that the three accused before the High Court now, had filed a petition before him to summon as many as nine individuals including Mr. Palaniswami and Ms. Sasikala for being examined in connection with the 2017 crime reported at the tea estate jointly owned by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The other seven individuals, whom the three accused wanted to examine, were Ms. Sasikala'; relatives J. Elavarasi & V.N. Sudhakaran, former Nilgiris Collector P. Shankar, former Superintendent of Police Murali Rambha, AIADMK State organiser Sajeevan, estate manager Natarajan and one Sunil under the care of Mr. Sajeevan. Similarly, the prime accused in the case, K.V. Sayan too had filed a petition before the trial court to summon an equal number of nine individuals for examination, and the only common witness between both the petitions was estate manager Natarajan. The other eight witnesses whom Sayan wanted to examine were an Assistant Director of Forensic Sciences Lab, Coimbatore Government Medical College Hospital’s Dean, father of a CCTV operator who had died by suicide in the estate, the Inspector of a special branch in the SP’s office and so on. Passing common orders on both the petitions seeking examination of as many as 17 witnesses in total, the Sessions Judge had allowed the accused to summon and examine only three witnesses: estate manager Natarajan, Forensic Sciences Assistant Director S. Raj Mohan and an Assistant Engineer of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, Kodanad Division. Stating that no reason had been cited to summon and examine Mr. Palaniswami, Ms. Sasikala and her relatives, the Sessions Judge on April 30 wrote: “Mr. Palaniswami being the present Chief Minister of the State, the accused cannot just like that abuse the process of the court to summon the Chief Minister as a defence witness without any relevancy.” The Sessions Judge also wrote: “This attempt made by the accused is highly vexatious and in the absence of any relevancy, this court is of the view that the petitioners/accused no.3,5,8 cannot be permitted to summon them as defence side witnesses.” Aggrieved against the refusal to summon them, the three accused had moved the High Court with the present revision. Though Sayan had not preferred any revision, the other three accused had included him as a respondent to their revision petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kodanad-case-high-court-directs-police-to-respond-to-plea-to-examine-ex-cm-sasikala/article36284115.ece

04 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||They brave all odds to deliver news on time||The COVID-19 pandemic may have changed the city’s lifestyle and rendered the busy streets nearly silent for many days. But a small section of the people continued its daily routine tirelessly, braving the odds. Newspaper vendors and distributors continue to go about their routine of bundling newspapers, fixing routes and racing for delivery before dawn, even while most of the city is in slumber. Ranjithavalli Rajesh, a newspaper distributor in R.A. Puram, has not missed being at the distribution point to receive newspapers along with delivery persons for the past 15 years. What started as a help to a relative has now turned into a career, she recounted on the eve of World Newspaper Distributors Day, which falls on Saturday. “I wake up at 3 a.m. daily. I don’t get to attend early morning functions. But I don’t regret it. I have delivered newspapers during tough situations like floods, cyclones and the pandemic to reach them at doorsteps on time. I started with the distribution of 700 copies; it has grown to 1,700 now,” she said. Vendors recalled the days when they had to wade through knee-deep water during the floods to deliver papers. M. Rahul took up the part-time job as delivery person a decade ago. On average, he delivers newspapers to about 60 houses and sometimes 100 a day. “I don’t need an alarm to wake up and don’t mind the chill mornings or rain. But I am careful that the newspapers shouldn’t get wet.” Over the last decade, several of them have switched over from bicycles to motorcycles for quicker delivery. Dealing with customers’ fears, labour shortage and a drop in readership was a major challenge for newspaper distributors during the pandemic. But patient service and awareness of COVID-19 safety norms have helped many of them win back subscribers. A. Latif Ahmed, a distributor at Nanganallur, said newspapers continued to be an addiction for many readers as it documented events. “Media houses must consider printing QR code for more news reports to attract youngsters to read newspapers on the go,” he said. Many delivery persons and distributors have built a personal rapport with customers, and some of them have even received employment offers through readers. C. Kanthan, a painter-cum-delivery boy, said, “I deliver 200 copies a day by 7.30 a.m. People sometimes invite me home for a cup of coffee or give raincoats. One customer even helped my daughter get school admission. Newspaper delivery has become my morning routine like a cup of tea.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/they-brave-all-odds-to-deliver-news-on-time/article36284070.ece

Ahead of the reopening, the city police and management of colleges had advised students not to indulge in any disruptive activities, such as celebration of bus day. A section of students, however, took out a procession on Wednesday towards Pachaiyappa’s College in violation of COVID-19 norms, and another group from Tiruvallur was about to clash with it. The police intervened and made them disperse immediately. The police booked a case against the students for offences, including unlawful assembly and negligent act likely to spread an infectious disease. Meanwhile, the police on Friday booked yet another case against nine students of the college, who created a ruckus on a moving MTC bus.

Meyyanathan informed the Assembly on Friday. Replying to Tamilaga Vazhvurimai Katchi member T. Velmurugan, who had complained that hydrocarbon and methane projects were being implemented even after the Cauvery Delta region was declared a protected agriculture zone, the Minister said the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had already rejected the application of ONGC for digging 10 hydrocarbon wells in Ariyalur and five in Cuddalore. He said he had also participated in a protest against hydrocarbon projects, and the Chief Minister, the Leader of the Opposition then, had visited the spot and expressed solidarity with the protesters. “Subsequently, he moved a calling attention motion to prevent the projects,” he said. The Minister said the government had also appointed a committee, headed by Ahamed Ismail, to study hydrocarbon projects outside the Cauvery delta districts. “Our Chief Minister is keen on protecting nature,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-prevented-ongc-project-in-mayiladuthurai/article36284093.ece

04 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Rajenthra Bhalaji has 73% of disproportionate assets’||The Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) on Friday claimed before the Madras High Court that 73% of assets owned by former Milk and Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji were disproportionate to his known sources of income between the check period of August 25, 1996 (when he became the vice-president of Thiruthangal Town Panchayat in Virudhunagar district) and March 31, 2018. Appearing before Justice M. Nirmal Kumar, State Public Prosecutor Hasan Mohammed Jinnah said an inquiry by the DVAC had now revealed that the disproportionate assets was not just 5.03% on the basis of which the last AIADMK government had decided to drop all further proceedings against the then Minister and closed the preliminary inquiry without registering an FIR. The matter was being heard by Justice Kumar following a split verdict delivered by Justices M. Sathyanarayanan (since retired) and R. Hemalatha in March this year. While Justice Sathyanarayanan had held that the DVAC must necessarily register a FIR, Justice Hemalatha had held that no fruitful purpose would be served in investigating the case when a detailed preliminary inquiry had already been conducted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rajenthra-bhalaji-has-73-of-disproportionate-assets/article36284112.ece

The matter was being heard by Justice Kumar following a split verdict delivered by Justices M. Sathyanarayanan (since retired) and R. Hemalatha in March this year. While Justice Sathyanarayanan had held that the DVAC must necessarily register a FIR, Justice Hemalatha had held that no fruitful purpose would be served in investigating the case when a detailed preliminary inquiry had already been conducted. Though Mr. Bhalaji had approached the Supreme Court against the reference made by the two judges and had obtained quite a few adjournments before Justice Kumar on the ground that the case was expected to be listed before the top court, the case did not get listed for long and hence the third judge commenced hearing arguments on Wednesday to decide the matter. Senior counsel M. Ajmal Khan, representing the former Minister, contended that his client had been subjected to harassment in the guise of preliminary inquiry for the past eight years. The judge adjourned the matter to September 8 for Mr. Khan to reply to the submissions made by the prosecution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ex-minister-has-73-of-disproportionate-assets/article36284235.ece

Subramanian said the need to vaccinate students aged 17 and admitted to first year of college was discussed with the Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya. “As of now, only those who are 18 and above are vaccinated in the country. There are students who are admitted to college six to seven months before turning 18. We have raised the need to vaccinate this group of students. The Union Minister said we can plan to inoculate them with the vaccine meant for persons aged above 12. We will look into this,” he said. Officials explained that this was in reference to Zydus Cadila’s vaccine (ZyCoV-D) that could be administered for those aged above 12 and had got emergency use authorisation.

04 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Woman undergoes rehab for brain injury following cardiac arrest||A 36-year-old woman was recently treated for a brain injury following cardiac arrest. The woman had delivered a child three months before the injury. During the cardiac arrest, she suffered anoxic brain injury (caused by interruption in blood flow and the consequent deprival of oxygen). The woman, who was on a student visa with her husband, was flown to the city from Dallas, U.S., for treatment. Her family reached out to rehabilitation centres in the State, and they contacted doctors at the Kauvery Hospital. “Arranging the travel, internationally termed as ‘aero-medical evacuation’, was a huge challenge, as the patient was dependent on oxygen support and a bed,” said G. Balamurali, head of the department of spine surgery at the hospital. He is also the managing director of the Hamsa Spine and Brain Rehabilitation Centre. At the hospital, the woman underwent tracheostomy, and is being administered two litres of oxygen a minute. She is able to recognise faces, but her speech and movement are yet to return. The woman was accompanied by an American-Board certified physician, Ilango. There were several challenges in arranging her travel, as she was flown via Doha, Qatar. In Chennai, a trained medical team transported her to Kauvery Hospital, where she was stabilised. She was then transported to the rehabilitation centre, Dr. Balamurali said. Kauvery Hospital’s co-founder and executive director Aravindan Selvaraj said her recovery could be gradual but steady.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/woman-undergoes-rehab-for-brain-injury-following-cardiac-arrest/article36284108.ece

Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, urging him to reconsider the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) scheme and take the views of public sector undertakings that will come under the plan and the State governments before taking any decision on its implementation. “Taking into account the current economic situation of the country, this sort of a massive privatisation activity, no matter what name you call it, will lead to invaluable government assets falling into the hands of a few groups and large private institutions,” he said. He said the assets of public sector undertakings were public assets. Many of these have an important role in positioning India as an industrial and self-reliant nation. To create them, land belonging to State governments and citizens too were given. “Hence, people have pride and rights over these institutions,” Mr. Stalin said in the letter. “We do not know what impact this NMP scheme will have on the Indian economy...,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reconsider-nmp-scheme-stalin-writes-to-modi/article36284109.ece

04 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Catalogue all captive elephants in TN through video recording: HC||The Madras High Court on Friday directed the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) to prepare a catalogue of all captive elephants in the State. It ordered video recording of the elephants together with complete profile of each elephant including its age, sex and also the lineage, if possible. The court wanted every endeavour to be made to indicate how the elephants came to be captured or domesticated. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu issued the directions after Elsa Foundation, an animal protection organisation, gave a power point presentation to the court and claimed that almost all captive elephants in the State were those that had been procured illegally in violation of Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972 and that the pachyderms undergo immense pain and hardship in captivity. As far as the temple elephants were concerned, the PCCF should assign appropriate officials, along with doctors from the relevant areas, to inspect the elephants and ascertain the state of their health. This exercise must be conducted for all captive elephants in the State but it should begin with elephants in the custody of various temples in the State, the first Division Bench ordered. “The number of elephants available with the forest officials should be indicated with similar profile and the history of how the animals came to be captured or used by forest officials. It is also necessary to ascertain whether any practice continues in which elephants are captured today, if only for the purpose of use by forest officials; and the permissibility thereof,” the court order read. Referring to the presentation made by Elsa Foundation which claimed that elephants had been transported illegally from as far as Assam to various temples and individuals in Tamil Nadu with active connivance of government officials, the Bench ordered that the PCCF should respond to such aspect of the matter by September 24 so that the court could pass further orders. The interim orders on cataloguing were passed on a batch of cases, including the one filed by activist Rangarajan Narasimhan of Srirangam, complaining about the cruelty meted out to temple elephants. Natural environment In response, advocate A.K. Sriram, representing Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple management, suggested that it could allot nearly six acres of land for creating a natural environment for two of its elephants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/catalogue-all-captive-elephants-in-tn-through-video-recording-hc/article36284133.ece

04 September 2021||CHENNAI/MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Pandemic has hampered corneal retrieval, transplant||The COVID-19 pandemic has severely hampered corneal retrieval and transplant, forcing eye surgeons to postpone transplants indefinitely, or in extreme cases source cornea from other States. Transplant is the only option for those with eye injuries resulting in corneal blindness. S. Josephine Christy, medical consultant, Cornea and Refractive Surgery Services, Aravind Eye Hospital, Puducherry, said people with diabetes, hypertension or those who had undergone cataract surgery could also donate their eyes. Awareness drives in the State had helped to some extent as even during the pandemic there were heart-warming instances of parents donating their children’s eyes. A mortuary worker at Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai donated the eyes of her 19-year-old son after he died in an accident. A 23-year-old youth, also from Madurai, pledged his eyes on his birthday on August 14 last year. He died in an accident on his birthday this year, and his father fulfilled his wishes. In the last eight months, at least 62 corneas were retrieved from persons aged below 25 years in Madurai, said Venkatesh Prajna, chief of cornea at Aravind Eye Hospital. “Donors are the real heroes who motivate us to provide our services to help solve the problem of corneal blindness,” he said. Tamil Nadu is among the top five high-performance States in the last seven years. “The donors have helped Tamil Nadu remain among the top five high-performance States in eye donation for the last seven years when 50,000-plus corneas were collected and the State accounted for one-fifth of them each year,” Dr. Prajna said. Zero wait-list “Madurai, with close to 800 cornea transplants, was the first district to achieve zero wait-list; a reversal in progress is unfortunate,” he added, pointing to the setback caused by the pandemic. People who died of heart attacks did not have such a test done, said Mohan Rajan, managing director of Rajan Eye Care Hospital, Chennai. He said he sourced corneas from an institution in Hyderabad for an emergency procedure. At Sankara Nethralaya, transplants fell to a third of what the hospital performed in a normal year, vice-chairman T.S. Surendran said. Since 2017, the hospital has performed over 600 corneal transplants annually, but in 2020 it performed only 243 transplants as cornea donations had fallen. In a normal year, the hospital received around 1,200 donations, he said. S.V. Chandrakumar, State programme officer, Tamil Nadu State Blindness Control Society, said the State did not face any cornea shortage for elective surgeries even during the pandemic. “We are getting enough corneas for elective surgeries. The need for therapeutic corneas was lower as the number of injuries also fell,” he said. “We are slowly picking up on cornea retrieval. In another three or four months, it will be in full swing.” The State had created a registry to pledge eyes under the National Health Mission. So far, 6,500 people had registered themselves on the website. “The need of the hour is for hospitals to use the registry to identify potential donors,” he said. The system is simple as in the event of death of the donor his family could use their mobile number and retrieve the donor certificate that hospitals can use, Dr. Chandrakumar said. According to him, roughly 10,000 corneas are retrieved annually under the National Programme for Control of Blindness.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pandemic-has-hampered-corneal-retrieval-transplant/article36284106.ece
04 September 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. to handover 11 roads to Highways Dept. for maintenance||In an unprecedented move, Coimbatore Corporation has decided to handover 11 roads to the State Highways Department for maintenance. In a resolution the Council passed at the August meeting held a few days ago, it said that it was handing over the stretch from Fun Mall Junction on Avinashi Road to Rajalakshmi Mill Junction on Trichy Road , the stretch from Nava India Junction on Avinashi Road to Mettupalayam Road through Chinnasamy Street and 100 Feet Road, the road from Jenneys Residency to Sathy Road connecting Codissia Road, Gandhi Managar Road and FCI Godown Road, and Thanneerpandal Road from Avinashi Road Junction to Vilankurichi Road. The Corporation had also mooted handing over Singanallur Road to Vellalore, the road from Coimbatore Collectorate to Avarampalayam (Huzur Road and Balasundaram Road), the road from Ukkadam to Perur Bypass Road passing through Puttu Vikki bridge, the road connecting Ponnaiahrajapuram to Palakkad Road, the road from SIDCO Junction on Pollachi Road to Sugunapuram on Palakkad Road, Puttu Vikki Road to Kovaipudur, and Sanganoor Road. The resolution also said the civic body was handing over the roads only for maintenance as they were important link roads to National or State highways and other important roads and justified the handing over also citing the Corporation’s financial health. The Corporation sources said this was an unprecedented move, but was subject to the State Government’s approval. In the past, the Corporation had handed over roads to the Highways Department for a limited period for completion of specific projects like bridge over railway tracks or flyovers, but this was for maintenance. Welcoming the move, Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon said the public, Corporation and Highways stood to gain from the transfer of maintenance of roads for the following reasons, the first of them being the 11 roads would see better maintenance. The second reason was that the Corporation had handed over the roads to the agency whose sole work was road construction and maintenance. For the Corporation it was not so as it was one among several works that included water supply, street light maintenance and sewerage service. By saving on the maintenance of the 11 roads, the Corporation could better utilise the money on other civic services. The move was in the pipeline for quite sometime, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said and added that it was discussed in the last Road Safety Committee meeting also. Soon after it was pointed out to Corporation Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, he had immediately passed a resolution to handover the maintenance, which was appreciable. Similarly, the Corporation should also look at handing over N.S.R. Road in Saibaba Colony to the Highways Department, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-to-handover-11-roads-to-highways-dept-for-maintenance/article36284122.ece

The Corporation had joined hands with Environmentalist Foundation of India to clean and rejuvenate the Kalamparkuttai and those near the Kalapatti ward office, Mariamman Temple and Viscose Park. The Foundation volunteers said District Collector G.S. Sameeran inaugurated the work to clean and restore the tanks on September 2. The Foundation would complete the restoration work in the four tanks that were spread over 35 acre in 45 days to keep them ready ahead of the North East Monsoon. The volunteers said they had deployed earth movers to remove the bushes and dredge the tank bed. The Foundation would use the earth dug from the tank beds to form two layers of bunds – an inner bund near the existing bund to prevent soil erosion. Thereafter the Foundation would fence the tanks with wire mesh and plant saplings to protect the rejuvenated water bodies. Though it was yet to arrive at the estimate for the works, it had gone ahead given the limited 45-day window period, the volunteers said and added that the Foundation was also looking at volunteer organisations and sponsors for the work. The Corporation had said that once the Foundation completed the four tanks it would enter into another agreement to handover three more water bodies for maintenance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corporation-to-rejuvenate-four-tanks/article36284136.ece

In a statement, the association’s State general secretary P. Kandasamy said the farmers had moved the Madras High Court against licences given to quarries in violation of law. By hiding the presence of houses, farm lands or water bodies, the authorities concerned had issued licences. Even as the case was pending before the court, the quarries functioned with impunity. And, when farmers near the quarries questioned the irregularities, they were threatened by those who had taken on lease the quarries and those close to them. Issue raised at grievances meet The farmers had raised the issue in the recently held farmers’ grievances redress meet, Mr. Kandasamy said and pointed out that the administration had asked senior officials to look into the matter. Notwithstanding the pending court case and the administration asking senior officials to probe the issue, farmers in Chokkanur village were threatened by a few persons when they objected to the efforts to destroy evidence of illegal quarrying on farm lands. This had caused unrest in and around the village, the farmers’ leader said and drew the administration’s efforts to ensure farmers’ safety and put an end to the illegality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-seek-probe-into-licences-given-to-quarries/article36284123.ece

04 September 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Tiruppur man gets 10 years imprisonment in emu scam||The Special Court for the trial of cases registered under the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interests of Depositors (TNPID) Act in Coimbatore on Friday awarded 10 years imprisonment to a man from Tiruppur who ran an emu farm and cheated depositors of over Rs. 62 lakh. Special Public Prosecutor S. Manickaraj, who appeared on behalf of the State government, said that A.G. Kumar (46) was the proprietor of Sri Kuberan Emu Farms at Rayapuram in Tiruppur city from October 2011 to March 2013. During this period, he advertised two schemes with monetary incentives to lure investors, following which 41 depositors paid Rs. 62.51 lakh in these schemes. The emu farm did not repay the money to the depositors and the accused absconded, he said. Based on a complaint lodged by N. Rajamani from Dharapuram, who was one of the depositors, the Economic Offences Wing, Coimbatore, registered a case against Kumar. On Friday, Judge A.S. Ravi awarded 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 40 lakh on the accused Kumar. As the accused did not appear before the special court, a non-bailable warrant was issued against him, according to Mr. Manickaraj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruppur-man-gets-10-years-imprisonment-in-emu-scam/article36284125.ece

04 September 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Residents of Malliamman Durgham lose their only income due to COVID-19||With no buyers turning up in the last one month to purchase guavas harvested at Malliamman Durgham in Kadambur Hills, the current season has turned disastrous for people as they fear losing their main source of annual income. The settlement is nested in the dense forests of Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) and nine km from a motorable road in Kadambur. Of the total 247 families, only 137 families reside there while others moved to Kadambur and Kalkadambur. Finger millet, broad beans, tapioca and other small millets are usually cultivated throughout the year that serve their own needs. Their only source of income comes from the harvest of guava from August to October every day while jack fruit also provides them an income. About three tonnes of guava and jack fruit are taken in vehicles every day to Kadambur from where traders purchase them. “We sold a box of guava weighing 25 kg between Rs. 500 to Rs. 750 two years ago. But due to the COVID-19 pandemic last year and this year, traders are not purchasing guava,” said M.K. Subramani, a resident. He said since traders did not turn up, people harvested guavas and took them to Kemmanaickenpalayam for sale. “Retail sales were very poor and we earned less than Rs. 100 a day,” he said and added that people stopped selling guavas directly. Since they were unable to meet the expenses in transporting guavas to the market, the fruit was not harvested in the past four weeks. Jack fruits are purchased by traders at price ranging from Rs. 20 to Rs. 50 a fruit while a few people sell the fruit in retail at the Kadambur bus stand. “Most of our annual income comes from selling guavas while less than 25% comes from selling jack fruits,” said Perumal. Mr. Subramani wanted the district administration to purchase the fruits from them directly and market it so that their income was ensured in the year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-of-malliamman-durgham-lose-their-only-income-due-to-covid-19/article36284228.ece
04 September 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Widespread rainfall in Erode district||Widespread rainfall in the district during the intervening night of Thursday and Friday brought down the temperature during the day on Friday. Most of the areas in the district received good rainfall leading to stagnation of water on roads. In the city, water stagnation at the limited use subway at Vendipalayam affected vehicle movement while motorists faced hardship in crossing Cauvery Road and Manikoondu areas where underground sewerage scheme works is in progress. At the Nethaji Daily Vegetable and Fruit Market in V.O.C. Park Ground, water stagnation led to the soil turning slushy, affecting the movement of two-wheelers and pedestrians. The district received a total rainfall of 262 mm while rainfall recorded at various places were Gunderipallam 35 mm, Kodumudi 33 mm, Modakkurichi 30 mm, Bhavani 24 mm, Chennimalai 21 mm, Kavundapadi 15 mm, Varattupallam and Ammapettai 14.4 mm each, Erode 11 mm, Gobichettipalayam 9.3 mm, Kodiveri 9.1 mm, Perundurai, Talavadi and Bhavanisagar 9 mm each, and Sathyamangalam 7 mm. Water level at Bhavanisagar Dam continues to be at 102 feet against the maximum reservoir level of 105 feet. At 8 a.m., the inflow was 3,928 cusecs while the discharge was 3,390 cusecs into River Bhavani and 500 cusecs into Kalingarayan canal. The storage was 30.31 tmc against the capacity of 32.80 tmc.

04 September 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Extend water release in LBP main canal by 25 days: farmers||With water discharge being stopped in Lower Bhavani Project (LBP) main canal due to breach, various farmers associations have urged the State government to extend the water release by 25 days. Water was released from Bhavanisagar Dam into the canal on August 15 to benefit 1.03 lakh acre in the districts of Erode, Tiruppur and Karur for 120 days till December 12. However, a breach in the canal at Malaipalayam village in Nasiyanur Town Panchayat led to inundation of houses and crops after which discharge was stopped completely. Work commenced immediately to plug the breach. It was initially decided to plug the breach within 10 days and release water for irrigation and carry out permanent restoration works after December. However, people in three villages, who were affected by flooding, and farmers wanted permanent restoration works undertaken. This delayed the work further. Members of Keel Bhavani Murai Neer Pasana Vivasaigal Federation, Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association and a few other associations inspected the works on Thursday and held discussions with officials. Later, in a letter to the Executive Engineer, Water Resources Organisation, Lower Bhavani Basin Division, Erode, they said though works were expected to be completed by September 10, full discharge of 2,300 cusecs was not possible immediately which would lead to water not reaching the tail-end farmers on time. Quoting officials, they said discharge could be increased only in a phased manner to ensure safety of the canal and hence wanted the water release extended by another 25 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/extend-water-release-in-lbp-main-canal-by-25-days-farmers/article36284230.ece

04 September 2021||IDUKKI,TAMIL NADU||Invasive slider turtle sighted in Idukki||The accidental finding of a red-eared slider turtle recently from the Malankara dam in Idukki has raised concerns that the invasive species has reached the waterbodies in the district, posing a threat to other endemic local species. The turtle is also known to be a carrier of human-infected bacteria such as salmonella, and countries such as the U.S. and Australia have imposed strict regulation on its trading and import. Though a favourite among pet lovers, it was first observed in private aquariums in the State. Trapped in net The red-eared slider turtle in the Malankara dam was spotted after it was trapped in the net while fishing by a local resident. It was later moved to the forest range office at Muttom to be handed over to the Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) at Peechi. The species was first found in the State at two locations in Thrissur in 2018. In February last, its presence was noticed in Thrissur in small private waterbodies as well. T.V. Sajeev, senior principal scientist, KFRI, told The Hindu that the presence of the turtle in a reservoir posed a larger threat. Though they can be easily trapped in small waterbodies, it is not the case in larger waterbodies such as reservoirs. Their population can also multiply in a short period. Due to its invasive nature, the local habitat of other species may soon disappear, said Mr. Sajeev, adding that there may be more of the species in the dam. Farmers alerted Forest Department officials have alerted farmers in the area about the presence of the turtle and directed them to provide timely information on likely sightings. A native of the southern U.S. and northern Mexico, the red-eared slider turtle is banned in several countries. It is enlisted in the 100 most invasive species in the world. The turtle can grow up to about 33 cm long, with a life span of close to 30 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/invasive-slider-turtle-sighted-in-idukki/article36283945.ece
04 September 2021||KALPETTA,TAMIL NADU||Karnataka officials stamp seal on hands of Kerala farmers||In an unusual development, authorities in Karnataka stamped seal on the bodies of four farmers from Wayanad who crossed the interstate Bavali checkpost on Thursday to visit their ginger farms there. “The officials stamped on my right hand even after I showed proof of two doses of vaccination and a recent RT-PCR test report at the checkpost,” P. Hussain of Padinharethara said on Friday. He has been cultivating ginger on leased land at Hegde Devan Kotta in Karnataka for many years. “The incident literally shook me up,” Mr. Hussain said adding the stance of the officials was against the directive of the Central government. The ink used for the purpose was similar to that used during elections, he said. The exercise with the dated seal was made citing the seven-day quarantine being imposed by Karnataka for travellers from Kerala to contain COVID-19. Meanwhile, O.R. Kelu, MLA, wrote a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking his intervention in the issue. Hundreds of people, including farmers, from Kerala crossed the border everyday for various purposes adhering to the restrictions imposed by the Karnataka government. But these kinds of incidents were not suited for a civilised society and it was violation of human rights, he added. However, Wayanad Collector Adeela Abdulla said she discussed the issue with Bagadi Gautham, her counterpart in Mysuru district, and the latter instructed the officials at the Baveli checkpost to stop the practice. But the travellers should undergo mandatory quarantine, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/karnataka-officials-stamp-seal-on-hands-of-kerala-farmers/article36283950.ece

The overnight rainfall in the upper hills also led to many trees being uprooted. Tangedco and Highways officials swung into action early Friday morning and traffic had to be suspended as a safety measure in two locations. The police said that even essential goods were stopped. Due to the weekend rush, private cars and vans too had lined up on both sides in the ghat section. The officials, in a simultaneous operation, removed all the branches on the upper hills and restored the power supply by noon. An official in the Municipality here said that the flow of water was very heavy at Silver Cascade falls. Tourist spots in Green Valley View and other locations were open to the visitors. Bryant Park, Rose Park and Chettiar Park too witnessed steady crowd despite the weather being chill. Apart from this weekend, the hoteliers said that they had confirmed reservations for the next week with holiday on Sept 10 (Vinayakar Chaturthi), followed by Saturday and Sunday. The health officials at the Kodaikanal Municipality said that vaccination drive was going on at full swing in the hill station. Apart from the screening at Silver Cascade, the residents were told to get themselves inoculated at the nearest PHC and at the Government Hospital. Electrocuted In a separate incident, Kalidas, 23, of J. K. Patti Kambar Street in Bodinayakkanur, Theni district, suffered 70 % burns after he came in contact with a live electric wire.

04 September 2021||Krishnagiri,TAMIL NADU||Irregularities alleged in appointments in sericulture dept.||The Tamil Nadu Sericulture Staff Association has alleged irregularities in appointments in the sericulture department during the last decade of the AIADMK government. Inquiry sought The Association, with its regional centre in Salem, has petitioned Chief Minister through District Collector demanding an inquiry in this connection. The Association has alleged that out of turn promotions and recruitments to the posts of sericulture inspectors and to other posts were made in 2014, 2016 and 2018 under the AIADMK rule. Similarly, those with over 35 years of experience were sidelined in promotions, the Association has alleged. According to the petition, those employed with the sericulture department with 20 years in service are shown as outsourced workers. The Association wanted that such workers be regularised. The Association urged the Chief Minister to honour its promise made in the election manifesto to regularise the staff with over 10 years of service.

04 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Inspection of school buses begins||The annual inspection of school buses for safety and other regulatory norms began at the Armed Reserve Police Grounds on Friday. Out of the 85 school buses that came seeking approval, three were rejected on the basis that they did not have GPS systems or CCTV cameras as mandated by the State government. A total of 986 school buses run under the Madurai Central, North and South RTOs in the district. The officials said, 85 of them had come for inspection on Friday that took place in the presence of Collector S. Aneesh Sekhar, Superintendent of Police V. Baskaran, Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan and Joint Transport Commissioner Madurai Pon Senthilnathan. Speaking to reporters, Dr. Aneesh Sekhar said, “As schools have been opened only for classes 9-12, some of the buses alone have come for the inspection. These buses that already have FC (fitness certificate), are being checked for safety regulations. Once they qualify, they will be given a sticker denoting “approval”. When they don’t qualify, notices will be given.” He also said that the school buses must be run only with a 50 % occupancy and no one should travel by standing. The buses were inspected for safety, based on regulations that were categorised into 22 points. S Selvam, RTO, Madurai North, said, “The buses need to have an emergency exit at the rear right side or at the rear wind screen, measuring a minimum of 150 cm x 120 cm, with a quick release latches mechanism that can be operated from the inside and outside of the vehicle. The CCTV camera and GPS system in working conditions are mandatory. There should be a partition between the driver’s seat and the other occupants. We will check the buses for all the 22 points,” he added. R. Chitra, RTO, Madurai Central, said that the inspections for the remaining buses will continue in the respective RTO offices. “Since most of the school buses have not been in use during the pandemic, the institutions need to make sure they are in a good condition, before bringing them for approval,” she shared. Crew sensitised Mr. Pon Senthilnathan asked school bus drivers in the district to take good care of their physical and mental health as they were responsible for the safety of many students, while addressing a group of school bus drivers about guidelines and protocols to be followed inside the buses, before undertaking inspections of the vehicle at the AR Grounds. Mr. Pon. Senthilnathan said, “When it comes to students’ safety in the bus, the major responsibility lies with you and the way you drive. Always prioritize safety. Never be overconfident. Give importance to physical and mental health. If something is stressing you out, please free yourself from it before getting into the bus.” Mr. Swaminathan, who was also present, said that vaccination was mandatory for all drivers and conductors. If someone is not vaccinated yet, they need to get it done immediately. The drivers were also instructed to wear masks regularly and ensure physical distancing inside the buses. The RTOs that were present asked them to regularly take health check-ups, if they had conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure and inform their school management immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/inspection-of-school-buses-begins/article36284421.ece
04 September 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Bull receives artificial leg||A three-legged bull received an artificial leg at the Government Veterinary Polyclinic enabling the animal to walk on all four legs now. A team of four veterinary doctors, led by K. Vairavasamy, is elated as this is the first time the procedure has been performed on a big animal. “It is able to walk slowly but will take at least four weeks to get adjusted to the artificial leg. We will be monitoring the movements and progress,” he said. He had fixed artificial limbs for injured dogs. The case of the bull came to light last month when a resident sent photos of the animal roaming around in Surya Nagar to Collector S Aneesh Sekhar. On his instructions, the Joint Director (Animal Husbandry) A. Ravichandran, swung into action. Staff from the polyclinic went to the site and with the help of animal rescuer Mayur Hassija spotted the bull. “But it started attacking them and the team had to return,” he said. After missing for three days, the bull was found again, weak and lying on the ground. Surveyor Colony Residents’ Association members fed the animal and took care of it till the ambulance from the vet hospital arrived. The bull was put on five days of antibiotics, intravenous fluids and proper nutrition to gain strength, as Mr. Vairavasamy began researching on prosthetics on bulls knowing that designing for heavy animals is difficult. His search led him to Jaipur-based veterinarian Tapesh Mathur who has designed prosthetics for 90 animals. Once a sponsor was identified, the measurements for the leg were sent. But the team had to wait for over a fortnight for the prosthetic to arrive. During that period, Deepak Nethan R volunteered to keep the animal in a farm at Chhatrapathi, where the bull is recuperating now after the limb placement was successfully done on Thursday. Mr. Vairavasamy was assisted by Arivalagan, Muthu Raman, Vijay Kumar and Muthuram in the pre-operative planning and the 45-minute procedure. The three-year-old Sindhi graded bull has been named Pirate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bull-receives-artificial-leg/article36284424.ece
04 September 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Ganesha idol sale yet to pick up||With the ban on public celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi, the doll makers of Vilacheri have reduced the size of the idols this year and appealed to the district authorities to allow them to sell idols five days before the festival, that falls on September 10. M. Ramalingam, who has been in the business for more than four decades, said government has prohibited people from installing life size idols of Ganesha in public places, he has moulded idols only to a height of three inches to three feet. In the pre-pandemic years, he and another 100-odd families would be engaged in making life-size idols of Ganesha during the festive season. “They would be lifted from our workshop by the devotees; families would come to pick up idols for their homes. But the footfalls have not yet begun so far, only few consignments of bulk orders have moved,” he said, ruing about more than 60 % loss he suffered during last Vinayagar Chaturthi. Another potter’s family next door on Velar Street is equally worried. “We still have last year’s stock but are making new ones too in the hope people will buy for puja at home,” said Saravana Raja. The doll makers want the district administration to facilitate sale at few strategic locations such as uzhavar sandhais, West Masi and East Masi Streets, Munichalai and P and T Nagar. “For the fear of the pandemic, people are perhaps scared to come here for purchase. We should be allowed to set up our stalls in a few areas to make it easy for the public,” said Ramalingam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ganesha-idol-sale-yet-to-pick-up/article36284426.ece

The case pertains to the enhanced compensation to be paid to 13 persons from Madakulam. Their land was acquired for the construction of houses by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board in 1981. They had moved the court for an enhanced compensation. The court ordered an enhanced compensation to be paid to the 13 persons. But the Madurai district administration authorities had failed to pay the amount. Under these circumstances, I Additional Sub Judge directed the authorities to pay the amount last month. As the order of the I Additional Sub-Judge was not complied with, the court staff reached the Collectorate to attach the Collector’s car. After an undertaking was given by the authorities that the order of the court would be compiled with in a week, the car was released. It was said that a total of Rs. 25 lakh enhanced compensation had to be paid to the 13 persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-staff-attach-madurai-collectors-official-car/article36284429.ece
04 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Murugandi set his sights high||In the early 1960s, Ramanathapuram was known for its scraggy landscape dotted with towering palm trees. And this countryside gave birth to S. Murugandi, now famous as the visually impaired palm tree climber. He was born in 1962 in a hamlet called Vellari Odai. Acres of palm trees was his playground. Along with his friends, he climbed these trees as his fingers memorised every jagged cut of the coarse trunks. He had no fear, and his lithe frame skidded up, though he could not see. Little did he know that this favourite game would turn into his bread and butter. In the 1970s, as this backward region had nothing much to offer, many men went to Sri Lanka, a land of opportunity then. One among them was his father, who would never return. Murugandi, then 10 years old, had to take care of his mother and sister. The only skill he knew was climbing palm trees. He would not just cut the palm fronds and fruits but was also adept at weaving the fronds into mats and using the stem of the fronds to make fences. In the early days, he got one paisa for each palm tree he climbed; in a day, he would easily climb 50 trees. In his early twenties, he was a very-much-in-demand climber. His day would start around 3.30 a.m. His first job was to tune into Radio Ceylon. These airwaves kept him company when he went about his chores at home. By eight, he would be ready and, accompanied by his wife Kala Devi or a friend, he would go to farms. By afternoon, he would return home, and many times he would bleed from the cuts that those unforgiving rugged trees inflicted on him. The only ointment he used was milk from the cashew-nut fruit. The only time he was shaken, he says, was when he climbed a curved tree. While descending, his chest slammed on the trunk. Raw eggs and a concoction of dry ginger and turmeric alleviated the agonising pain. With the money he earned climbing palm trees and with the help of well-wishers, he gave good education to his two daughters. The first daughter is an engineer, and works in Chennai. “I am hoping that she gets a government job,” says the proud father. The second daughter is doing a nursing course at Meenakshi Mission Hospital in Madurai. But times are changing. As he ages, the topography has also changed. Only a few palm trees remain. Fences made with palm fronds, once ubiquitous in this region, have been replaced by concrete compounds. With the government placing curbs on toddy-tapping, palm trees are also fading away. Murugandi now spends his time joining other workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. Yet, he awaits a call to climb the remaining trees. His determination to stand on his own remains an inspiration to youngsters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/murugandi-set-his-sights-high/article36284092.ece
04 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC refuses to grant bail to Inspector of Customs||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday refused to grant bail to Inspector of Customs Dharmendra Singh, an accused in the Tiruchi airport gold smuggling case. He was alleged to have acted as the facilitator. Justice B. Pugalendhi took serious note of the nature of offence that involved a government servant and refused to grant bail. The counsel for the petitioner Dharmendra Singh chose to withdraw the bail petition. The petition was dismissed as withdrawn. Earlier, the court granted bail to seven accused in the gold smuggling case taking note of the fact that the men had only acted as carriers.

04 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||48-hour, non-stop vaccination camp begins||Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Friday sought the cooperation of members of the public in achieving 100% vaccination against COVID-19 in the Union Territory of Puducherry. Inaugurating a 48-hour, non-stop vaccination camp at the Villianur Primary Health Centre, she said though the second wave of the pandemic was fairly under control in the Union Territory, there had been a slight increase in the number of cases in proportion to the higher number of tests. Stressing on the importance of sustaining vigil and adopting inoculation as a measure of protection from the novel coronavirus infection, the Lt. Governor pointed to the programmes of the Health Department to make it simpler for people to take the shot. As a result of the measures, such as night-time vaccination and street corner session sites, at least 48 villages in the Union Territory had become fully vaccinated. She appealed to the people to avail themselves of the facilities being provided by the government to get themselves vaccinated, amid reports of a third wave of the pandemic. The marathon camp began at 8 a.m. and will conclude at 8 p.m. on Sunday. Such a camp, the first in the country, was organised to offer round-the-clock convenience to the residents, she said. At Villianur, of an estimated 59,000 beneficiaries, about 53,000 had already taken the jab. She appealed for public support for achieving 100% vaccination in the jurisdiction of the Primary Health Centre and across the Union Territory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/48-hour-non-stop-vaccination-camp-begins/article36284532.ece
04 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||U.T. should reconsider continuing with loss-making PSUs, says CAG||The Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG), in its report on the financial affairs of the Union Territory of Puducherry for 2019-20, has asked the government to reconsider continuing with Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) that have been incurring losses for long if they do not serve the purpose of social welfare. In its annual audit report tabled in the Assembly on Thursday, the CAG said that half of the total of 12 PSUs incurred losses to the tune of Rs. 52.37 crore. The other six earned a profit of Rs. 28.05 crore during the period. Thus the aggregate loss of the government-owned companies was to the tune of Rs. 24. 32 crore. As on March 2020, there were eight companies with accumulated revenue losses to the tune of Rs. 801.88 crore. The net worth of seven of eight units had been eroded, because of the accumulated losses, and their net worth turned negative. However, Swadhashee Bharathi Textile Mills Limited and Puducherry Tourism Development Corporation Limited, which incurred losses in 2018-19, made profits during 2019-20. While the profit earned by the mill was mainly due to a government grant of Rs. 21.53 crore towards the settlement of electricity dues, the Corporation reported a profit owing to an increase in business revenue, the report said. On the revenue side, the report said there were wide fluctuations in the revenue buoyancy of the Union Territory owing to the implementation of the Good and Services Tax (GST) in 2017-18. It had also impacted the government’s actual receipts. During the period, the territorial administration received Rs. 862 crore in compensation from the Centre for the loss on account of the implementation of the GST. The government’s tax revenue decreased from Rs. 3,188 crore during 2018-19 to Rs. 2,475 in the next financial year. As for fiscal management, the report said the Union Territory ended up with a revenue deficit of Rs. 55 crore during 2019-20. This was a cause for concern as receipts did not even match revenue expenditure. The loans and advances from the Union government also decreased from Rs. 1,839 crore during 2015-16 to Rs. 1,418 crore during 2019-20. Puducherry was not able to contain the ratio of fiscal management as envisaged in the Fiscal Road Map prepared by the government in 2012. The ratio of fiscal deficit to the Gross State Domestic Product during 2019-20 was 1% as against the target of 0.84%, the report pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ut-should-reconsider-continuing-with-loss-making-psus-says-cag/article36284534.ece
04 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Exclusive control room for women||An exclusive control room (112) will be set up for women to reach out to if they feel unsafe at night hours, Home Minister A. Namassivayam informed the Puducherry Assembly on Friday. Replying to the discussion on the demand for grants, he said women who wanted any help between 10 p.m, and 6 a.m. might contact the control room. A separate vehicle with a woman constable would be set aside to drop women at their residence at night hours. CCTV cameras would be installed at all police stations at a cost of Rs. 2 crore, the cyber crime cell would be augmented and vacancies in the constabulary would be filled expeditiously, Mr. Namassivayam said. The cyber crime cell would be further modernised and strengthened and Rs. 1.5 crore would be spent for the purchase of cyber tools for an effective check on crimes against women and children and other members of the public. “It will also help in checking the misuse of social media. Stringent action will be taken for posting false/fake news on social media platforms,” he said. A sum of Rs. 15 crore was earmarked for boosting the infrastructure of the police force, including the renovation of the DGP and SSP Quadrangles and the Police Quarters, the construction of police stations for Reddiarpalayam and Lawspet, SSP Office and SP Office in Karaikal and a coastal police station in Mahe. He announced that Rs. 7.5 crore was allotted towards the uniform allowance for all police personnel and Home Guards this year. The process to fill the vacancies for 390 constables, 12 radio technicians and 29 deck handlers would be completed in the next few months. Arms and ammunition would be purchased at a cost of Rs. 1 crore. Four-wheelers and two-wheelers would be purchased at a cost of Rs. 4 crore for effective mobility of the force. It was also decided to purchase a jammer vehicle and a bullet-proof vehicle for the VIP security at a cost of Rs. 2.56 crore because the Union Territory had to depend on the neighbouring States for such vehicles, Mr. Namassivayam said. Exemplar schools The Minister said that under Samagra Shiksha, 24 government schools in the Union Territory would be developed as “exemplar schools” with the Union government’s assistance. These schools would be provided with good infrastructure and academic facilities. The Government of India would provide non-recurring support to these schools for 3 years and recurring support for 5 years. The schools would be selected on the basis of enrolment and other criteria laid down by the Union government. It was also proposed to convert the Government Higher Secondary School at Maducarai into a government women’s college to provide higher education to girls from rural areas. On account of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fee fixed by the fee committee for 2019-20 would be extended for the academic year 2021- 22, the Minister said. He said a new export policy would be announced to reach the target of Rs. 4,000 crore before 2025. In order to bring in investors, the single window system would be modified to issue licences, clearances and no-objection certificates by the line departments without delay. A new electric vehicle policy would be announced to reduce pollution and minimise fossil fuel consumption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/exclusive-control-room-for-women/article36284539.ece

04 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||Expelled Cong. leader joins CPI(M)||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Friday welcomed expelled Congress leader P.S. Prasanth into its fold. CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan feted him at the AKG Centre. Mr. Prasanth had contested the 2021 Assembly election on the United Democratic Front ticket from Nedumangadu. He was a Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee secretary till last week. In a statement, Mr. Prasanth damned the Congress for “losing its secular character, ignoring regional leaders, and promoting persons with mafia links”. Recently, Mr. Prasanth had invited the wrath of the Congress leadership by describing All India Congress Committee general secretary K.C. Venugopal as a “trojan horse” for the Bharatiya Janata Party. He had also accused Thiruvananthapuram District Congress Committee president Palode Ravi of being covertly Sangh Parivar and a mafia underling. In a letter to the party high command, Mr. Prasanth said defections from the Congress to the BJP had mounted under Mr. Venugopal’s watch. Mr. Vijayaraghavan said the trickle of deserters from the Congress and the UDF would increase to a flow. The Revolutionary Socialist Party was aligned with the Left at the Centre. In Kerala, the RSP had made no secret that its foray into the UDF fold had proved to be a let down. “Let the RSP make its position clear as the Kerala Congress (M) did earlier. The Indian Union Muslim League also faced mutiny within its ranks. The UDF was on its last legs. The Congress was falling apart,” he said. The Congress was falling apart. It was riven with infighting in Kerala, he said. The Congress high command operated in privileged isolation, far removed from ground realities. Its politics were personality centred. Scores of secular Congress workers were disillusioned with the party's leadership. Many think only the CPI(M) offered a safe harbour for them, Mr. Vijayaraghavan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expelled-cong-leader-joins-cpim/article36283947.ece

04 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruchi crematoria in a shambles||The Oyamari and Konakkarai crematoria lie in a sorry state due to poor maintenance. While the infrastructure at Oyamari is yet to improve, the grounds around the crematorium in Konakarai is full of garbage. People who visit the grounds to lay their kin to rest are put off by the maintenance. The Oyamari crematorium complex, where a large percentage of COVID-19 deaths were cremated over the last year, lacks proper toilet, bath facility or seating area. So, many go to the nearby bathing ghat to take bath and perform rituals, a worker said. The Tiruchi Corporation drew up a plan to hand over the operations of the facility to a trust. However, it was opposed by a section of city residents. “We have floated tenders for construction of a toilet complex. Work will begin soon,” a corporation official said. The burial ground at Konakkarai is an eyesore - garbage is strewn the approach path and all over the place. Cattle and pigs rummage through the garbage in search of food. Sanitary workers employed at the micro composting yard located within the same compound dump a large amount of that waste. “We have not been given a separate place to dump the non-biodegradable waste. We use biodegradable waste to make compost but throw out plastic bags, cloth and other waste,” a worker said. Speaking to The Hindu , K. Suresh, city secretary of Communist Party of India, said that the civic body must improve the facilities. Burial grounds and crematoria in other cities such as Chennai have been revamped to provide a calm and peaceful environment. “It is the least that we can do for the grieving. They need a clean environment, while also providing basic infrastructure like a waiting room, restrooms etc.,” he said. Mr. Suresh added that the Minister of Municipal Administration must take note of this and allot funds for cleaning and maintenance. “Especially over the last year, there have been several untimely deaths. With COVID-19 still prevalent, we need to keep these facilities ready,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-crematoria-in-a-shambles/article36284205.ece

04 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Plea for more DPCs in delta region||The State government must instruct the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) to open more number of direct purchase centres (DPCs) as paddy harvest is peaking in the Cauvery delta, said Federation of Farmers Associations of Cauvery Delta Districts. In a representation to the government, its general secretary Arupathy Kalyanam has also called for stationing mobile DPCs so that the harvested paddy can be procured from the field itself. “This will help prevent overcrowding at the DPCs. The mobile DPCs can procure paddy even if two farmers with five acres each were harvesting paddy in a village,” he said. Mr. Kalyanam pleaded for procuring paddy with up to 20% moisture content without any price deduction as many parts of the delta have received rains. The Agricultural Engineering Department must arrange sufficient number of tractor-operated portable paddy dryers for the benefit of farmers. “Using the equipment, farmers can dry two tonnes of paddy within a couple of hours. Last year, such dryers were deployed in Thanjavur district,” he said. Mr. Kalyanam urged the government to implement the minimum support price for the new kharif season from August instead of October. In delta region, around 80% of harvest would be completed by September-end. If the new MSP comes into effect from August, all farmers would be able to avail themselves of the benefit of the increased price, he contended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delta-farmers-seek-more-paddy-purchase-centres/article36284202.ece

The entire process is being conducted in a haphazard manner,” a student said. G. R. Dinesh of All India Students Federation led the protest and said that the method in which the answer papers were being evaluated was unsystematic. The examination notification was also made in haste. “Most of the students who are in the third year now have failed papers in the first and second year and will have to write arrears. They are unable to cope. A similar problem was also faced by them last year,” he said. At least 12,000 students are pursuing D. T. Ed in Tamil Nadu, with all of them facing a similar issue. “We have written at least 1,000 letters to the CM Cell. We have received no response,” they said.

As a private company has planned to construct a cement factory at S. Kailasapuram, residents of Kailasapuram, Savarimangalam, Jambulingapuram, S. Pudhur, Varadharajapuram and a few more villages are opposing it saying that the proposed factory would seriously pollute their villages and cause a range of ailments to the residents and cattle besides destroying farming operations. They submitted a petition at the TNPCB’s District Environmental Engineer Office on Friday in this connection. The petitioner villagers said that they had already recorded their opinion against the proposal to establish a cement factory at S. Kailasapuram at the public hearing held on August 12. They were firm in their decision that the cement factory would cause ailments by polluting the environment seriously. Moreover, the pollution would wipe-out cattle rearing and agricultural operations in this region.

K. Senthamarai Kannan, Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli City. Speaking to reporters here on Thursday evening, he said the Tirunelveli City Police, after forming special team to check smuggling of ganja into the city from Theni and banned tobacco products from various parts of the country including Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad, conducted surprise check in suspected places based on the intelligence inputs and seized 71.870 grams of ganja in the past three months and arrested 59 persons in this connection.

04 September 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Special vaccination camp for Narikuravas held in Villupuram||The Villupuram district administration, in association with the Society for Community Organisation and People’s Empowerment (SCOPE), a non-governmental organisation, organised a special COVID-19 vaccination camp for residents of the Narikurava colony under the Villupuram municipal limits on Friday. Municipal Commissioner Surender Shah said that as many as 384 residents of the Narikurava colony in Ward number 26 in the municipality were vaccinated during the special drive. Safety kit distributed According to Collector D. Mohan, a majority of the residents in the colony were initially hesitant to take the vaccine shots. The residents were identified during the enumeration of eligible persons for the vaccine drive organised by the municipality. The camp started in the morning and after a lot of persuasion, they agreed to get vaccinated. The administration also distributed a safety kit worth Rs. 1,000 each consisting of face masks, sanitisers and other essentials to each family. Mr. Shah said that around 60 per cent of the population in the age group of 18 to 45 and 109 percent in the 45-55 age group in all the 42 wards had been vaccinated during the door-to-door vaccination camp so far. The drive, which began two weeks ago, was organised as part of the Health Department’s push for 100% coverage for the population of Villupuram municipality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/special-vaccination-camp-for-narikuravas-held-in-villupuram/article36284536.ece

It pointed out that the 2008 writ petition was dismissed since the litigant had insisted that mantras be chanted only in Tamil. Therefore, the court had held that it could not compel the use of a particular language to the exclusion of others at religious institutions. On the other hand, the 1998 writ petitions were dismissed after the Division Bench held that the choice of mantras either in Tamil or in Sanskrit would rest with the devotees, the Chief Justice said. In his affidavit, Mr. Narasimhan had said the HR&CE Department’s attempt to introduce a new language by translating verses and hymns from Sanskrit into Tamil was nothing but blasphemy and an act to introduce confusion and unrest in the otherwise peaceful religious practices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-against-mantras-in-tamil-rejected/article36284097.ece

04 September 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Belagavi corpn. election sees 50.41% voting||Polling remained poor with around 50.41 % of voters coming to choose their representatives in the Belagavi City Corporation elections on Friday. Officials said that consolidation of voting figures is still on and that the tally could increase further. Voting in urban local bodies in Saundatti was 79%, while polling in the municipal council in Raibag was around 72%, the officials said. Polling began on a slow note with only 6.5% registered till 9 a.m., 15.7% till 11 a.m., 25.7% till 1 p.m., 33.8% till 3 p.m. and 44.15% till 5 p.m. Women voters stood in queues in front of polling centres in some areas across the city which includes parts of the three Assembly constituencies. However, the booths were full in the Old City areas. The police had to rush to a booth in Mali Galli in Ward No 3, after BJP leaders complained of fake voting. Some men have voted in the names of women and some persons from other booths were allowed to vote here, Member of Legislative Assembly Anil Benake said. He also complained to Assistant Commissioner of Police Narayan Baramani that the officers and the police did not allow the BJP candidate to enter the booth. Mr. Benake said that he would lodge a complaint against the officers concerned. Member of Legislative Assembly and Congress leader Lakshmi Hebbalkar complained that the BJP leaders violated the code of conduct by distributing voter slips containing a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “BJP leader Basappa Chikkaladinni tried to influence voters by distributing slips with Mr. Modi’s pictures in Ward No 45,” she said. She said that she had seen some such slips and had complained to the polling officers. She said that she would complain to the State Election Commission. Voting was delayed for a few minutes due to technical glitches in booth number 297 in Tilakwadi. The presiding officer allowed a voter to cast her vote again, as the EVM did not ping the first time. In Ward No 10, MES leader Madan Bamane complained that the polling officers were allowing only candidates of national parties inside the booth, but MES nominee Vaishali Bhatkhande was kept out. Polling officers denied the allegation. Writer D.S. Chougale complained that the police had deflated the tyres of two-wheelers of voters parked near polling centres. Some of us who went to booth number 46 in Ram Teerth Nagar were shocked to find that tyres of two-wheelers had been deflated. There is no traffic congestion on the road and there are no sign boards announcing no parking. Member of Legislative Assembly Abhay Patil, Mr. Anil Benake and Ms. Lakshmi Hebbalkar voted in booths near their residences. As many as 385 candidates, including 238 Independents, are in the fray. There are about 4.4 lakh voters in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-corpn-election-sees-5041-voting/article36284246.ece
04 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pothole filling: Task force to be constituted at zonal level||For motorists, commuting within the city is akin to completing an obstacle course. For pedestrians, the state of roads and lack of pavements is a health hazard. Inundated with complaints from citizens, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has decided to constitute a zonal-level task force to oversee filling up of potholes and repairing bad reaches on high-density corridors, arterial and sub-arterial and ward roads. Civic officials said that each ward has an allocation of Rs. 20 lakh only for filling up the potholes. The task forces will be overseen by the chief engineer, executive engineers, assistant executive engineers and ward engineers. A note in this regard was issued to all engineers by chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Thursday. Motorists and pedestrians are sceptical, but hope that the task forces will be effective in tackling the problem. Apart from several roads dug up for development works that are in different stages of completion, there now are numerous unmotorable stretches across the city, as a result of the heavy rains over the past few days. According to the internal note, a copy of which is with The Hindu, the zonal task forces once constituted should first make a list of all roads and potholes, and place an indent for hot mix to fill the potholes from the hot mix plant. Taking note of the lack of coordination between the different departments even within the BBMP, such as road infrastructure and projects, the task force is expected to bridge the gap between them. Engineers from road infrastructure and projects departments have already identified roads that are still under defect liability period and submitted the reports. Repair of bad reaches and filling potholes on these roads will be the responsibility of the contractor concerned. The zonal chief engineer should oversee the filling up of all potholes in the zones and submit a report on the same to the zonal commissioner on a daily basis. The daily reports from the eight different zones should be collated and submitted to the office of the Administrator and Chief Commissioner every day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pothole-filling-task-force-to-be-constituted-at-zonal-level/article36284037.ece
04 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Former Home Minister flags ‘casinos’ in city||K.J. George, former Home Minister, has written to the incumbent Minister Araga Jnanendra flagging two ‘casinos’ that have opened recently in his Sarvagnanagar constituency seeking immediate action against them. Though there have been allegations of casinos in the city - residents of Indiranagar had raised the issue in the past - this is the first time a former Home Minister has officially complained about the same. However, the city police continue to deny their existence in the city. “There is no such activity in the city, as of today. If anything is found, most stringent action will be taken against such establishments,” said Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant. All forms of gambling, except those categorised as skill games, are banned by law. A copy of the letter available with The Hindu provides specific locations of the two casinos — in HRBR Layout and on Kammanahalli Main Road. Mr. George said several families have become paupers because of the illegal gambling at these casinos, and sought their immediate closure. Sources in the city police said hours after the receipt of the former Minister’s letter on Thursday, the East Division Police raided the two premises and shut them down. Casinos in Goa, Sri Lanka and South East Asia are famous and many from the city also frequent them, sources said. “There may be gambling dens in the city, where several kinds of card games are played for high stakes, along with Teen Patti and Andar-Bahar common in recreation centres in the city. But these are not casinos, which are more hi-tech with slot machines, roulettes and are on a large scale. There may be four or five such gambling places still operating. Many that came up last year were shut down,” conceded a senior official. Security risk Sneha Nandihal, a resident of Indiranagar, who recently actively campaigned against a gambling den in the locality and got it shut down, said their presence was both a nuisance and a security risk. Mr. George’s letter to Mr. Jnanendra also says the illegal ‘casinos’ have not only led to several families becoming pauper but also to an increase in crimes in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/former-home-minister-flags-casinos-in-city/article36284045.ece

Sudhakar has directed colleges to keep a strict vigil on students returning from other States. Speaking to the media after inspecting the Christian Nursing College in Horamavu, the Minister said 34 students out of 300 have tested positive for COVID-19 there. The area has been declared as a micro containment zone and 700-800 residents around the college will be tested as a precautionary measure, he added. “The college has been sealed down and all safety precautions have been taken,” he said. Pointing out that all the infected students have been shifted to COVID-19 Care Centres for isolation, the Minister said the college will be sealed for 7-8 days and then testing will be conducted again. “There are about 800 nursing colleges in the State. All the students who are infected are from Kerala and West Bengal. The samples will be sent for genomic sequencing as well,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residents-around-college-to-be-tested/article36284040.ece
04 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||New device to conduct microbial experiments in outer space||What happens to microbes in outer space? Will their behaviour patterns in such an extreme environment give us insight to help future space missions? With these questions in mind, a team of researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have developed a modular, self-contained device to cultivate microorganisms. This could enable scientists to carry out biological experiments in outer space, said IISc. via a press release. In a paper published in the peer reviewed journal Acta Astronautica, the team showed how the device can activate and track the growth of bacterium ‘Sporosarcina pasteurii’ over several days, with minimal human involvement. “Understanding how such microbes behave in extreme environments could provide insight for human space missions such as ‘Gaganyaan’, India’s first crewed spacecraft set to be launched in 2022,” stated the release. The study of microbes in extreme conditions is a growing field. “In recent years, scientists have been increasingly exploring the use of lab-on-chip platforms which combine many analyses into a single integrated chip for such experiments,” they said in the release. However, designing such platforms to function effectively in outer space poses additional challenges as conditions are different from lab settings. “It has to be completely self-contained,” said Koushik Viswanathan, assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and a senior author of the study. “You can’t expect the same operating conditions as in a normal lab setting … and you can’t have something that guzzles 500W, for example.” The device uses an LED and photodiode sensor combination to track bacterial growth. It has separate compartments for different experiments. Each compartment or ‘cassette’ consists of a chamber where bacteria suspended as spores in a sucrose solution and a nutrient medium can be mixed to kickstart growth, by flicking on a switch remotely. “Data from each cassette is collected and stored independently. Three cassettes are clubbed into a single cartridge, which consumes just under 1W of power. The researchers envision that a full payload that could go in a spacecraft will contain four such cartridges capable of carrying out 12 independent experiments,” stated the release. Another challenge was to build a device that is leak-proof and unaffected by any change in orientation. “This is a non-traditional environment for the bacteria to grow. It is totally sealed and has a very small volume. We had to see whether we would get consistent [growth] results in this smaller volume,” says Aloke Kumar, associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and another senior author. “We also had to make sure that the LED going on and off doesn’t generate much heat, which can change the bacterial growth characteristics.” The next step is getting a flight model of the device ready and ensure accuracy under stresses such as vibration and acceleration due to gravity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-device-to-conduct-microbial-experiments-in-outer-space/article36284036.ece

Both these zones, along with the South zone, also have the highest number of micro-containment zones. According to civic officials, there are over 100 active micro-containment zones in Bengaluru. Speaking to reporters here on Friday, BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that the civic body was keeping a close watch on the containment zones, and ensuring that all those who have tested positive are isolated and under quarantine. On the two zones reporting more cases than others, he said that an analysis of the source of infection pointed to travel history. “Employees of the IT sector, construction workers and students, who have travel history have tested positive. Already, the State government has made it mandatory for travellers from Kerala to be placed under mandatory seven-day quarantine,” he said. There are over 7,600 active cases in the city. With the festival season round the corner, Mr. Gupta urged citizens to wear masks and get vaccinated. “A spike in cases has been reported in developed countries such as the UK, the US and Israel. This is all the more reason for citizens to not let their guard down,” he said. Sero survey Preliminary results of the serosurvey taken up by theBBMP on August 4 show the presence of antibodies in a large percentage of samples collected, said Mr. Gupta. He added that the final report is yet to be submitted. “Once the final report is submitted, the expert committee will have to give their take on the findings of the different kinds of antibodies present,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/east-mahadevapura-zones-see-bulk-of-cases/article36284044.ece
04 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘NEP indoctrinates students with idea of communalism’||Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah has urged the Karnataka government to withdraw its decision to implement the new National Education Policy (NEP) saying that “the intention of the NEP is to indoctrinate students with the idea of communalism through education”. The former Chief Minister claimed, “The NEP is unscientific and will push lakhs of students to darkness”, in a letter to Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan. ‘Sans discussion’ Mr. Siddaramaiah said the government decided to implement the NEP from the current academic year without any discussion with students, teachers, education experts or the Opposition. Noting that policy changes in matters such as education and health were not minor issues, the former Chief Minister said, “Governments of many developed countries take complete responsibility of health and education, but here in India, the government is trying to wash its hands off the responsibility.” India has a high student-to-teacher ratio, which should come down for the benefit of students. The government’s allocation for education as a percentage of the GDP is very low.The NEP also recommends allocation to education at 6% of the GDP, in which case, Karnataka should allocate about Rs. 1.08 lakh crore, he said in the letter.The NEP violates federal arrangements and infringes upon the autonomy of States in the matter of education and universities. It promotes privatisation, leading to inequality and social injustice, Mr. Siddaramaiah argued. ‘Do’nt create panic’ Reacting to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s arguments, Dr. Narayan said people who were talking against the NEP should not “induce fear” among students. At a seminar organised by Bengaluru City University in association with Mount Carmel College about implementation of the NEP on Friday he said, “The policy is student centric and not system centric. Only students will get the benefit out of it. I request people not to create panic among students.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nep-indoctrinates-students-with-idea-of-communalism/article36284054.ece

But at the same time, I do not agree with the view that Ganesha Utsava should be stopped,” Mr. Eshwarappa told reporters in Shivamogga. “The BJP has come to power based on Hindutva ideology. We will never go back on conducting Ganapati Utsava. But how we should conduct it during COVID-19 and how many people should be allowed to participate is an issue that will be decided by the meeting to be chaired by the Chief Minister,” he said. Meanwhile, Health Minister K. Sudhakar said elsewhere, “Ganesh festival is a very sensitive and emotional issue. But we must not forget that COVID-19 went out of control in Kerala after Onam and Muharram. We are trying to avoid such a situation in Karnataka.

04 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Man killed in bar brawl||A civil contractor was killed by unidentified assailants in a brawl at a bar in Basaveshwara Nagar on Thursday night. The victim has been identified as Balaji, 49, a resident of Kengeri. According to the police, Balaji visited the bar with two of his friends on Thursday. At 9 p.m., the cashier asked everyone to leave due to the night curfew. Patrons rushed to the cashier to settle the bill. As Balaji was walking towards the counter, a group of youth at the table next to him started quarrelling with him. Eyewitnesses told the police that Balaji slapped one of them. The cashier and others intervened and pacified both groups and sent them out. By then it had started to rain. While his friends left immediately, Balaji chose to stand under a tree to wait for the rain to subside. But the group of youth surrounded him. One of them hit him on his head multiple times with a helmet, injuring him severely. The gang fled as Balaji collapsed. Though he was taken to a nearby private hospital immediately, he succumbed to his injuries later. The Basaveshwara Nagar police, who have registered a case, have launched a manhunt for the assailants. They have identified them through CCTV footage from the bar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/man-killed-in-bar-brawl/article36284043.ece
04 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Govt. wants to make youth job-ready’||More than unemployment it is the unemployability that needs to be addressed immediately, said C.N. Ashwath Narayan, Minister for Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood, on Friday. At a job fair organised by the Ministry here, he said although many new jobs were being created across industries and service sectors, the unemployability of candidates even after completion of studies remained a cause of concern. “The government wants to make the youth job-ready and employable according to the industry requirements,” he said. Some 30 companies attended the job fair physically and 12 participated virtually, together seeking to employ over 2,000 candidates. However, the organisers received only 1,300 registrations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-wants-to-make-youth-job-ready/article36284052.ece
04 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Follow SOPs while towing vehicles’||Home Minister Araga Jnanendra directed the city police to adhere to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) while towing vehicles from ‘No Parking’ zones in the city, giving no room for any complaints. He met with the police on Friday to discuss the issue in light of recent incidents where towing personnel and traffic police were assaulted by motorists alleging harassment and violation of norms. B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner (Traffic) said they gave the Home Minister a presentation on the SOPs. “The Minister had no objections with any of the SOPs, but directed us to ensure it is implemented in letter and spirit,” he said. It can be recalled that one of the first directions by Mr. Jnanendra after he took over as Home Minister was also to traffic police, asking them not to conduct random checks. “The traffic police should alert the vehicle owners by blowing sirens before a towing driver on the road as per the laid down SOP. No Parking penalty has to be collected, and the vehicle not towed, if the vehicle owner is at the spot,” Mr. Jnanendra instructed the police, a press communique from his office said. Incidentally, in Indiranagar where motorists assaulted towing personnel on August 20, the bone of contention was that motorists were not alerted before the drive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/follow-sops-while-towing-vehicles/article36284033.ece

Activities such as film festival, adventure sports, food mela, exhibitions, Yuva Dasara, and torchlight parade usually held during the celebrations will not be held this time too. These programmes were not held last year as well owing to the pandemic. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who presided over a meeting of the Dasara High-Powered Committee on Friday, said the committee had unanimously resolved to celebrate the festival in a simple manner. He said Rs. 6crore would be released for holding the festivities in Mysuru, Srirangapatna, and Chamarajanagar. All traditional events, including inauguration at Chamundi Hills, will be held by ensuring social distancing, while the world famous Jamboo Savari (procession of caparisoned elephants) would be restricted to the palace premises. The committee has empowered Mr. Bommai to decide the dignitary for the inauguration of the event. In 2020, corona warrior representatives inaugurated Dasara festivities. Number of participants Based on the COVID-19 situation, the number of people to be present at the inauguration, cultural events, and Jamboo Savari would be decided after September 20, Mysuru district in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekhar said. Last year, 150, 50, and 300 people, respectively, were allowed to attend inaugural, cultural events, and Jamboo Savari functions. Minister for Energy, Kannada and Culture Sunil Kumar said light decorations would be made in Mysuru during the festival. As local small businesses, including hotels, in Mysuru have been impacted by the pandemic, the meeting discussed ways and means to revive the local business. The Chief Minister said Rs. 8 crore was released towards the dues of last year’s Dasara events.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/scaled-down-dasara-in-mysuru-this-time-too/article36284061.ece
04 September 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Double whammy for daily wage worker||Hassan Traffic Police allegedly took a daily wage worker and his mother into custody for passing an angry remark while paying a penalty on Thursday. Shivakumar of Teranya village in Holenarsipur taluk was on his motorcycle with his mother to attend a funeral at Vatehole in Alur taluk, when the traffic police stopped him at Basavanna Circle on B.M. Road. After checking the records, the police found that Shivakumar had not renewed his vehicle’s insurance certificate. Traffic Police Sub-Inspector Manjula slapped a fine of Rs. 1,000. Shivakumar had only Rs. 150 in his pockets. For Shivakumar, Rs. 1,000 is a big amount and he had to work a week to earn that much money. Shivakumar and his mother requested the police to take the amount they had and let them go as it was getting late for the funeral. However, the police did not relent. The police asked him to get the amount transferred from someone. He got the money transferred from his employer to a cashier in a nearby hotel and paid the amount. While paying the fine, Shivakumar passed a comment criticising the police for collecting heavy penalties from poor people. This angered the Traffic Police Sub-Inspector and the driver of her vehicle Krishna. Shivakumar was allegedly beaten up at the spot. The police seized his vehicle and took both him and his mother to the police station. They were let off only in the evening. This incident has gone viral on social media, prompting the public to criticise the police for their conduct. Hassan Superintendent of Police R. Srinivasa Gowda, on Friday, said that he had directed Hassan Deputy Superintendent of Police to conduct a probe into the allegations against the police and submit a report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/double-whammy-for-daily-wage-worker/article36284457.ece

04 September 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Barring some confusion, polling ends peacefully in Hubballi-Dharwad||Barring instances of confusion among voters regarding polling stations, cases of missing and shifted voters, overall polling in the elections to the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation concluded peacefully with 53.81% voters turning up to exercise their franchise on Friday. In an official communication, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad and District Returning Officer Nitesh Patil said that polling concluded peacefully and 53.81% voters had cast their votes. In all, there are 420 candidates fighting it out in 82 wards of the municipal corporation. The total number of wards increased to 82 from 67 after delimitation and there are 8.17 lakh voters in the twin cities. In the last municipal council elections, 66% polling was recorded. Polling began at a very slow pace with only 7.73% voters casting their votes in the first two hours. Chairman of the Legislative Council Basavaraj Horatti, Hubballi-Dharwad West MLA Arvind Bellad and the former MLA Chandrakant Bellad were among those who cast their votes early. Polling picked up pace after 9 a.m. and in the next two hours the polling percentage improved a bit with 18.18% voters casting their votes by 11 a.m. By 1 p.m. 29.01% voters had cast their votes and it went up to 39.22% by 3 p.m. and in the next two hours it reached 50.39%. In the last hour of the polling just over 3% voters cast their votes taking the final polling percentage to 53.81%. The former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar exercised his vote along with his wife Shilpa and son Sankalp, while Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi cast his vote along with his wife Jyoti and two daughters. Congress MLA Prasad Abbayya cast his vote along with his wife and mother. The former MLAs Ashok Katwe and Virabhadrappa Halaharavi were among other prominent leaders who exercised their franchise. Confusion There was confusion and heated arguments at polling station No 3 at St. Peter’s High School in Hubballi for some time with locals saying that there was deletion of over 500 names from a single polling station. This angered the residents and Municipal Commissioner Suresh Itnal had to rush to the spot to clarify to them. He said that if at all a mistake had happened, it would be rectified. Meanwhile, Congress leaders, including Mr. Prasad Abbayya, said that BJP leaders had misused the government machinery to deprive voters of their franchise, especially in wards where Congress supporters were high. Although the former Mayor and BJP leader Viranna Savadi admitted that there had been several discrepancies in the voter list, he said that it was wrong to blame the BJP for it. Mr. Savadi said that because of the failure of senior officials to properly oversee the revision of voter list following delimitation in several wards, members of single families staying under one roof had been assigned different wards. He said that the booth level staff had revised the voter list sitting in office because of which voters were being made to run from one polling station to another to cast their votes. Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi said that the issue had come to his notice and he would take it up with the State Election Commission to get the mistakes rectified. Earlier in the day, absence of VVPAT machines led to confusion in a few polling stations with a few local booth agents objecting to holding polling without them. It took some time for the polling officials and staff to clarify and convince them that this time VVPATs were not being used for the HDMC council elections. Subsequently, voting resumed. Following the incident, Deputy Commissioner Nitesh Patil issued a clarification and made an appeal to the electronic media not to highlight such incidents caused due to misinformation.  The total number of wards increased to 82 from 67 after delimitation and there are 8.17 lakh voters in the twin cities||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/barring-some-confusion-polling-ends-peacefully-in-hubballi-dharwad/article36284257.ece

The injured have been admitted to hospital and a complaint has been lodged against them, he added. A clash broke out between police personnel and BJP supporters when the latter complained of bogus voting by the Congress candidate at a polling station in Hanuman Tanda. After the BJP workers said that the police attacked them, BJP MLA Dattatreya Patil Revoor reached the spot and settled the matter. But the story was not the same in all wards. Many polling stations identified as hyper-sensitive and sensitive saw peaceful polling. A total of 533 polling stations were set up and around 300 candidates have tried their luck for the 55 seats in the Kalaburagi City Corporation.

Angara said here on Friday. Talking to reporters after watching the working of portable desalination units of an Australian firm in a few vessels at the fishing port here, Mr. Angara said that these units help in addressing drinking water needs of trawlers and purse seine boats that are taken out for deep sea fishing for more than 15 days. “This unit helps generate a good amount of drinking water from sea water thereby avoiding the need to store drinking water on boats,” he said. Mr. Angara said that the Central funds available under the Matsya Sampada Scheme could be used for installation of these units. The State government would also contribute towards the installation, he said. Mr. Angara went on a boat that has the mobile desalination unit installed at a cost of about Rs. 4 lakh.

The Dakshina Kannada district unit of CPI(M) that met under the leadership of senior leader K.R. Shriyan passed a resolution to this effect. The party said that instead of containing the spread of the pandemic, the measure will enhance the miseries of the common man. Daily earners, including manual workers, owners and staff of commercial establishments, tailors, hairdressers and similar others working in the unorganised sector are being hit hard by the measure, the party said. The party said that the district administration’s move goes against the State government directive which said that curfew/lockdown should not be imposed if the test positivity rate is less than 5%. Though the positivity rate in the district is less than 2%, the administration is imposing weekend curfew and also, is hesitant in reopening schools and colleges, it said. It is unfortunate that people’s representatives, including the district in-charge Minister, the MP and the MLAs, who should have voiced people’s concerns, are silent against the unilateral decision of the Deputy Commissioner, the party said. If the administration does not withdraw the weekend curfew immediately, all like-minded secular parties will launch an agitation, said a release from the CPI(M) district unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cpim-seeks-withdrawal-of-weekend-curfew/article36284449.ece

04 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||KSPCB promotes turmeric Ganesha||The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) is promoting its ‘health-friendly’ and ‘eco-friendly’ campaign for the ensuing Gowri-Ganesha festival across the State in view of the pandemic situation. For the second successive year, the Board is promoting idols made from turmeric. “Make idols at home, offer puja and go for green immersion at home” – is the Board’s message ahead of the festive season. According to the Board, the people can make the idol from turmeric, which is believed to have many medical values, instead of going in search for the clay idols in the market. The Board has released videos on YouTube as a part of its campaign to demonstrate idol making from turmeric. The videos are also being shared on different social media platforms as part of the promotions. Some companies have joined the campaign and are supporting the Board in circulating the message for an eco-friendly festival. The campaign has set a target of one million home-made turmeric idols for this festival. In this connection, the Board has invited the people to join the initiative of Turmeric Ganesha Campaign-2021. “You can be part of the world record event by sharing the pictures with the homemade turmeric Ganesha idol. People can visit the social media handles or www.turmericganesha.com This is an exciting opportunity to win prizes and a certificate. Please spread the campaign and join the cause,” the message from the Board said. Urging the people to go green this festive season, the Board said turmeric Ganesh idols can be made through the “Do It Yourself” videos. The ingredients needed include flour (wheat), turmeric powder, water and oil. The idols can be immersed at home and the water can be used to sanitise homes. The idols made from Plaster of Paris and the painted ones are not eco-friendly and tiny turmeric idols can help save water bodies, it said. Agarbathi brands are also promoting the cause with stickers carrying the messages pasted on incense sticks packets on the Turmeric Ganesha campaign-2021. Around five lakh agarbathi packets will be carrying the message. The following links can be accessed to watch the making of idols from turmeric (Arisina) - https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=h6ZZttZHXp4 &t=3s and https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=EDlM5ddqhLk B.M.

04 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Decision to scale down Dasara fete ‘sensible’||The State government’s decision to keep this year’s Dasara a simple affair due to the pandemic has been described as a “sensible move’’ by a section of the citizens while the stakeholders said it was on expected lines. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday has also stated that the Jamboo Savari will be restricted to the palace premises like last year, reinforcing the view that the tradition was not being compromised though the festivities will lack the grandeur. But the decision has been welcomed on the grounds that it will help prevent a surge or a possible wave. It is better to have a low key Dasara so as to prevent mass congregation this year, said N.S. Rangaraju of INTACH. He said there was loss of life and people are in distress and allowing gathering of large number of people for 10 days will amount to inviting a disaster. He said the government has perhaps learnt from the traumatic experience of the second wave. Nagapati, a tourism expert and author of books on the subject, said the government did not have any option either. But what is intriguing is that political gatherings are being allowed while Dasara is being scaled down. However, one cannot fault the government as it would have been held responsible in case there was a surge and hence one has to endorse the decision though it is not gratifying, said Prof. Nagapati. Notwithstanding the economic fallout of keeping Dasara a simple affair, he said livelihood is important but so is life and hence the decision has to be welcomed, he added. Meanwhile, the hospitality sector in the region which is dependent on tourism and has been badly mauled by the pandemic, will reiterate its demand for concessions in payment of property and commercial tax besides waiver in trade licence and electricity charges. Narayana Gowda of Hotel Owners Association said that though the government announced that hotels and restaurants would get a rebate in property tax and power charges, it was never notified. “As the sector is completely dependent on tourists who have stopped coming due to COVID-19, we are unable to sustain ourselves let alone pay taxes.’’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decision-to-scale-down-dasara-fete-sensible/article36284472.ece
04 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||AYUSH campaign takes off in 100 govt. schools||As many as 100 government schools in Mysuru district are now part of “Namma AYUSH Namma Swasthya” campaign launched as part of “Azadi Ka Amrutha Mahotsava” to sensitise the children on the importance of ‘AYUSH’.

04 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Relocation of Changadi village gains traction||The masterplan for relocation of the local community at Changadi village in M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary is ready and will be submitted to the government for its approval on Monday. The authorities including those of the Forest and Revenue departments have also completed the joint survey for the relocation at Vaishampalya near Hanur and this includes establishing the extent of land owned by different families at Changadi. The land to be granted to the rehabilitated families at Vaishampalya has also been surveyed and now awaits government clearance. The district-level committee for rehabilitation of Changadi which reviewed the progress on Thursday was apprised of the developments by Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi who said that the new settlement will have a primary health centre, anganwadi, and primary school besides adequate space for animal husbandry activities. These should be made available within the area where the rehabilitation programme will be taken up, he added. In a bid to encourage agriculture, check dams, and rainwater harvesting systems, tanks should also find a place for the community while horticulture activities should also be given a thrust to make the local people economically self-sufficient, said Mr. Ravi. Anomalies  The joint survey was ordered recently to ensure that there was no anomaly on claims related to land held by individuals in the village besides sorting out discrepancies in the land allotment so that the relocation was smooth. Though the government had initially suggested Chikkallur as the alternative site for rehabilitation, it was changed to Vaishampalya on the grounds that it would be more feasible for the community. According to officials, nearly 200 families including those from tribal communities have lived in Changadi since generations. But they were unable to benefit from many of the schemes and development programmes due to the difficult and inhospitable terrain. Even agriculture was a dicey affair due to the soil condition and its proximity to forests had led to increase in human-animal conflict. The village, which is remote and deep within the forests, was cut off from the mainstream and was languishing due to lack of access to even basic amenities. There was a demand from the local community seeking relocation and it got traction in 2018 and a government notification approving the exercise was issued in 2020. However, the pandemic has delayed the relocation. Project cost The project requires about 178.9 hectares of land and will cost the government nearly Rs. 35 crore. If successful, this will be the template for relocation of other villages including Padusalanatha and Tokkere, according to the officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/relocation-of-changadi-village-gains-traction/article36284475.ece
04 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||6.5 lakh children to be tested for COVID-19 in Mysuru||The Health Department’s “Arogya Nandana”, a new initiative to test all children for COVID-19, has proposed to cover 6.5 lakh children in Mysuru district. As of now, nearly 63,801 children had been covered under the initiative after the experts cautioned that the children are likely to be affected during the third wave of the pandemic. The programme was launched to lay emphasis on the health of children aged between 0 and 18 years, including those studying in private schools, who would undergo screening. The missed dose of routine immunisation will be carried out for those aged between 0-5 and 10-16, a release from the department said. The programme also aims to vaccinate school teachers and the staff of the schools. Parents of children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and co-morbidities would get vaccination on priority basis. With the Department of Women and Child Development supporting the initiative, steps would be taken to supply ration to children. Teams constituted in each of the primary health centres will implement “Arogya Nandana”. Children with low immunity and other co-morbidities will be identified for providing nutritious food and supplements for boosting their immunity. The children’s health will be monitored under the programme, the department said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/65-lakh-children-to-be-tested-for-covid-19-in-mysuru/article36284473.ece
04 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MLA alleges corruption in cloth bag scheme; IAS officer refutes charge||Former Minister and JD(S) leader S.R. Mahesh has accused IAS officer Rohini Sindhuri of corruption in the cloth bag distribution scheme as part of plastic-free campaign in Mysuru district during her tenure as Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru, but the official called the charges “blatant lies and contrary to the truth”. Mr. Mahesh, who represents K.R. Nagar Assembly constituency in Mysuru, shared details of the alleged corruption with mediapersons on September 3. The scheme had been initiated by Ms. Sindhuri earlier this year for distribution of environment-friendly cloth bags as part of a plastic-free campaign in the district. The JD(S) MLA claimed that the official had placed an order for more than 14.71 lakh cloth bags at a cost of Rs. 52 a piece, totalling Rs. 7.65 crore, for distribution to houses in all urban local bodies in the district, including Mysuru City Corporation. Each beneficiary household was to receive two bags – one with a capacity to carry 5 kg and another 10 kg. However, he claimed that cloth bags of the same quality were actually available for Rs. 13 a piece in the retail market in Mysuru, which he displayed at the media conference along with a bill for the same. He alleged a kickback in the scheme, which had led to a loss of more than Rs. 6 crore to the State exchequer. Pointing out that the scheme had been taken up without bringing the matter before any urban local body in the district, Mr. Mahesh accused the official of ‘usurping’ the powers vested in local bodies and forcing the scheme upon them without having the proposal discussed in the elected councils of the local bodies. He claimed that the local bodies were now refusing to clear the proposal and give financial approval for payment for the cloth bags. A huge consignment of cloth bags is now stocked in a building in Mysuru, Mr. Mahesh said. He wants the government to order an inquiry and suspension of the IAS officer. He has threatened to stage a dharna outside the office of Ms. Sindhuri if his demands are not met. Denial by official Ms. Sindhuri described the allegations as a “Standard Operating Procedure to browbeat and scare officers against daring to inquire into illegalities and irregularities by these individuals”. She said the work order for implementing the scheme was given to Karnataka Handloom Development Corporation (KHDC), a government of Karnataka undertaking, and was in compliance with the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (KTPP) Act. She insisted that “not even a single paisa” was paid as kickback during her tenure as Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru. It was only as recently as August 30, 2021, that the first payment of Rs. 9,59,991 was made to the KHDC by the Nanjangud City Municipal Council. “(This is) The only payment they (KHDC) have received until today,” she added. Ms. Sindhuri, who is now the Commissioner, Department of Endowments, has hoped that the current officials would continue to “show courage and bring out the truth” in the illegalities and irregularities committed by individuals who were making allegations against her.  Bags purchased at Rs. 52 a piece available for Rs. 13 in the retail market in Mysuru, claims S.R.

04 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mysuru Rly. Division exploring ways to shore up freight revenue||The Mysuru Division of South Western Railway, which notched up impressive performance till July 2021 in the freight segment, is seeking to attract new streams of goods traffic to shore up its revenue in the current fiscal. The Operations and Commercial Departments of the division recently conducted a meeting with the copra merchants at Tiptur to explore the possibility of generating business for mutual benefit in which the Minister for Primary and Secondary Education B.C. Nagesh and other officials were present. The thrust of the meeting was on advantages of transportation of cargo by rail and the authorities said that the meeting was conducted in Tiptur as it has the biggest copra market in Asia. Every week anywhere between 300 to 400 tonnes of copra is transported from Tiptur to several States including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi, and the railways want to capture this segment to increase freight revenue. Manjunath Kanamadi, Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, apprised the participants of the benefits of transporting the cargo by freight trains and said that the faster transit time by the railways will be beneficial and the traders can expand their customer base by extending their supplies to new markets . Subsidy sought The merchants urged the railway authorities to bring copra too under the ambit of the Kisan Rail project to enable them to not only transport copra by rail by utilising the vast network of the Indian Railways, but also to gain the subsidy announced under the Kisan Rail project. The merchants’ body also argued that the subsidy would offset the overheads for multiple operations at loading and unloading points. The Kisan Rail was announced by the government recently and it was explained that the scheme is meant for transportation of perishables, fruits, and vegetables, dairy products, meat, and poultry. However, the trade body was suggested to discuss the issue with the Government of Karnataka and the Union Ministry of Food Processing Industries would examine the demand for the inclusion of any other commodity for the subsidy based on the recommendation of the State Government. Right environment Rahul Agarwal, Divisional Railway Manager, South Western Railway, Mysuru, instructed all the heads of all departments to take necessary steps for creating a congenial environment for traders to opt for rail movement. Thrust must be on doing away with even a minor irritant in all the processes, and this should be assigned the highest priority, he added. 253 per cent hike Despite the impact of COVID-19 on the general economy, the Division had notched up a revenue of Rs. 250.57 crore till the end of July 2021 and this was 253 per cent higher compared to the corresponding period last year. This is a fallout of the establishment of Business Development Units in all zonal railways and divisions for attracting new streams of traffic and also to increase the modal share of freight traffic, said the authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-rly-division-exploring-ways-to-shore-up-freight-revenue/article36284474.ece

The forest department officials had a tough time when two elephants crossed over the Aralam farm through the Cheenkanipuzha river to enter areas in Muzhakkunnu panchayat. Roads were closed and the forest officials drove the elephants back into the farm. Kannur Divisional Forest Officer P. Karthick said that forest officials were on duty for patrolling and to ensure that the elephants did not venture out of the forest. Mr. Karthik said the department had submitted certain recommendations to the District Collector and the government in order to mitigate the problem. He said that deputing forest officials to drive away elephants into the jungle could not be a solution in the long run, adding that growing crops such as cashew, pineapple, coconut, and jackfruit inside the Aralam farm and adjoining areas lured the elephants out of the forest. However, the tribespeople here said that several measures in the past taken up by spending huge funds to resolve the problem were in vain. Krishnan, a tribesperson in block 9, said that a young boy was killed during a similar drive conducted by the forest staff recently. In many places, the elephant walls had not been built properly and the animals easily broke them to cross over from the jungle. The residents inside the farm were under constant threat, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/forest-officials-on-vigil-against-rampaging-jumbos/article36284325.ece

The review was in continuation of the performance audit of the local bodies in implementing the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The previous review held in July had found that 27 local bodies in the district had made ‘zero progress’ in acting against those responsible for dumping of waste in public spaces. Twenty-four panchayats had failed to act against dumping of waste in waterbodies. The department had given a month’s time to the secretaries of the local bodies to initiate legal and penal action against those responsible for illegal waste dumping. The latest review found that the compliance was still poor as the local bodies were hesitant in slapping penalty on those dumping waste in public places and waterbodies. Except for a few municipalities like Kalamassery and Eloor, the overall rate of imposing penalty on violators had achieved little progress since July, according to the assessment. The secretaries and elected members of the local bodies pointed out that they were unable to impose penalty in view of the increasing resistance among the public against such measures, citing financial crisis amid the pandemic situation. However, the LSGD officials stated that such excuses could not be accepted as the rules clearly stated penal and legal steps against the violators. The pandemic situation should not be a shield for carrying out illegal dumping of waste in public places and waterbodies, they said. The meeting recommended stringent action and asked the secretaries to report compliance on the action taken within a month. The Deputy Director of Panchayats, Ernakulam, has to convene regular meetings to ensure that the secretaries of local bodies implement the waste management rules without fail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-bodies-fail-to-penalise-those-dumping-waste/article36284350.ece

04 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Youths fall prey to online job scams||A young BTech graduate in Kochi recently received a lucrative part-time job offer through SMS promising quick bucks with little effort in the name of a global e-commerce giant. The fraudster claimed to represent a company engaged in enhancing the sales and popularity of certain products listed on the e-commerce portal. The youngster was asked to transfer half the price of the chosen products to a mobile wallet, while the company claimed to donate the other half with a promise to reimburse him the full amount plus commission later. On payment, he was given the link of the products to place the order. Though he was told that it helped increase the sale of the products, in reality, no products were bought, and even the links themselves were fake. “Initially, I was given small returns, and that convinced me further. But then I was asked to order costlier products, and my payments became bigger,” said the youngster on condition of anonymity. After six such tasks, he had spent close to Rs. 1 lakh, while the mobile wallet showed a balance of Rs. 3 lakh, including his commission. It dawned on him that he was cheated only when his attempt to withdraw the amount failed. It was after much persuasion that he agreed to register a police complaint. “In a majority of cases, victims prefer not to complain for fear of being ridiculed. That emboldens fraudsters, and scams keep recurring claiming even more victims,” said a cyber cell official. Similar scams seem to be thriving considering the number of people receiving such text messages, which also point to the illegal sale of data considering how fraudsters get easy access to so many mobile numbers. “It is easy to mimic the web pages of popular websites, hoodwinking unsuspecting victims, while instant money transfer via UPI using third party applications seems to have opened the floodgate for such scams. Unlike the transfer of funds between accounts through the banking infrastructure, UPI transactions are not easy to trace back. Besides, a software script is all that it takes to dupe people with eye-popping mobile wallet balance,” said Avinash K.V., a software engineer. Rahul Sasi, a cyber security expert, said many variants of the scam were in circulation taking advantage of the trying pandemic times. Scams by creating fake bitcoin platforms and bank websites showing balances running into lakhs are also in vogue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youths-fall-prey-to-online-job-scams/article36284580.ece

The arrested man was identified as Joseph George, 25, of Vengoor. The incident happened when the bus reached Perumbavoor around 10 a.m. The accused reportedly picked a fight with the conductor for not stopping the superfast bus at Vallam near Perumbavoor. He wasn’t convinced by the reasoning that the bus had no stop there and that the service was already running late. Instead, he abused and thrashed the conductor, the police said. Consequently, the trip was cancelled and the passengers had to continue in other buses. He was booked under Sections 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty), 294-B (uttering obscene words) of the IPC.

The local bodies that had not yet set up the facility had cited lack of space or land under its jurisdiction as a problem. The department has asked such panchayats to take buildings or storage facilities on rent. The supervisors holding charge of the performance audit in each local body will have to submit an updated status report on the setting up of MCFs to the Deputy Director of Panchayats, Ernakulam. The erring local bodies should install weighing machines to record the quantity of non-biodegradable waste. The latest assessment on the management of non-biodegradable waste found that nearly 14 local bodies were yet to start door-to-door collection of such waste. Even though majority of the local bodies had constituted the Haritha Karma Sena, the collection process has not been streamlined in a few local bodies as the workers were hesitant to visit homes or commercial establishments to collect waste amidst the pandemic crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/set-up-mcfs-without-delay-local-bodies-told/article36284351.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran, while dealing with a petition seeking police protection against nokkukooli, observed that complaints relating to the demand for nokkukooli were coming before the High Court on a regular basis. This was surprising because the government had already issued an order banning such demand from any trade union. The judge pointed out that this prima facie meant that the government order had not been effectively implemented by the competent authorities. The court issued notice to the State Police Chief. The petition was filed by Sundareshan from Kollam. According to him, he wanted to construct a hotel building on his property. However, some of the office-bearers of the CITU and the INTUC were obstructing his workers from carrying out constructions because of his refusal to accede to the demand of the unions for nokkukooli . Acting on another petition, the court came down heavily on the police for using disrespectful words such as eda/poda while addressing the public. The court asked the SPC to issue a circular instructing his subordinates not to use such impolite words. The court made the observation when a petition alleging that the police had behaved badly towards a 15-year-old girl at Cherppu in Thrissur district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/inform-steps-on-nokkukooli-ban-hc/article36284352.ece

Three persons, including a woman, were taken into custody with methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a synthetic drug commonly known as ecstasy or Molly, during a raid on Thursday. The department had been monitoring the bank accounts of a couple of habitual offenders who were arrested for similar cases. They had found a transaction of nearly Rs. 3 crore through multiple accounts. The Excise team had gatecrashed an alleged rave party following a tip-off received by Assistant Excise Commissioner V. Robert. According to officials, all accused were in an intoxicated state when the police arrived. Loud music was blasting out of the flat, disturbing the neighbours and they had filed a complaint. The accused attacked the Excise team and tried to flee through the back exit after flushing the drug down the toilet. Youth injured Deepu, an Asramam resident, sustained serious injuries when he jumped off the third floor balcony to avoid arrest. The 26-year-old had been booked for possession of MDMA earlier too and he attended the party while out on bail. While Leena, a 33-year-old Thazhuthala resident, and Sreejith, a 27-year-old Kilikolloor resident, were taken into custody, another person managed to flee. The Excise team later seized the MDMA and ganja from the flat and a scooter used by the men. “Leena is one of the main drug dealers in the city and the investigation will be extended to other residents of the flat. Some persons, suspected to have attended the party, are under close surveillance. The mobile phone of the arrested will also be used to collect more information,” said the officials. Synthetic drugs are not very common in Kollam and narcotics such as MDMA with hallucinogenic properties can be lethal at times. Possession of MDMA is punishable with rigorous imprisonment up to 20 years and a fine of Rs. 2 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drug-seizure-excise-beefs-up-watch/article36284406.ece

Inaugurating the swearing-in ceremony of Nattakom Suresh as president of the Kottayam DCC, Mr. Chennithala aired his grievances against the K. Sudhakaran-led dispensation. The leader criticised the alleged attempts by the party leadership to ignore voices of dissent, while backinf Oommen Chandy. “I am not saying that all decisions of the Congress should have been taken after consulting me. I am just a kaalana [inconsequential] member, but Oommen Chandy is the general secretary of the All India Congress Committee. Everybody has a responsibility to discuss matters relating to the organisation with him,” Mr. Chennithala said. Party discipline He sought to dismiss the threat of party discipline wielded by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC). “If we are to consider the party discipline of those who are espousing the concept, one should think how many of these would have been with the Congress now.” Former Minister K.C. Joseph, an ally of the Chandy camp, too voiced his dissent over the leadership. He said the perceived apathy shown by the party in initiating action against those running a defamation campaign against Mr. Chandy on social media.

The project is implemented with the support of the Civil Supplies Department. According to Labour Department officials, the fund to meet the initial expenses has already been granted by the district administration. They also hope to expand the scheme in such a way to cover more villages where containment zone regulations are implemented very strictly as part of the measures to prevent the COVID-19 spread. Assistant Labour Officer L.N. Anooj said the free kits worth Rs. 800 were distributed to 200 migrant labourers during the launch event in Koorachundu panchayat on Friday. The beneficiaries were mostly those undergoing home quarantine and were badly in need of social support for survival, he said. The Labour Department took up the issue after it was informed about the plight of jobless migrant workers and those in home quarantine. District Collector N. Tej Lohit Reddy immediately responded to the issue. The expenses for the project would be met using the PM Cares fund. According to local body representatives from critical containment zones, many migrant workers were found in need of similar support. They also point out that needs of some of the workers have already been addressed with the support of charitable organisations and using the funds of panchayats. Apart from this, many migrant workers who remain jobless in various locations were found suffering from mental stress. The issue has been brought to the attention of the district administration. According to Labour Department officials, trained counsellors who are proficient in Hindi would be appointed to address the issue at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-helping-hand-for-migrant-workers-in-containment-zones/article36284329.ece

The Avinissery grama panchayat in Thrissur, Ambalappuzha North grama panchayat in Alappuzha, and the Uzhavoor grama panchayat in Kottayam were the local bodies that proscribed the use of ‘sir’ and ‘madam’, saying that they were the relics of the colonial period. With the national media highlighting the historic move made by the Mathur grama panchayat, a serious discussion on the larger issue of purging the official language of the outmoded expressions from the British period has begun. Democratic “It is not a question of just saying bye-bye to ‘sir’ or ‘madam’. It is a question of shifting to a modern, democratic form of language from a language that was basically feudalistic or monarchic,” said Boban Mattumantha, the social activist who laid the foundation for a campaign demanding official language reform. Mr. Boban and his team have approached 60-odd local bodies in and around Palakkad district demanding corrections in the official Malayalam language. A WhatsApp collective titled Sauhruda Bhasha Group is pushing for iconoclastic reforms in the language being used in official records and applications. Begun as a funny thought for Mr. Boban, the language modernisation drive is gaining momentum with several youngsters joining the journey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/three-more-local-bodies-follow-in-mathur-footsteps/article36284353.ece

The three-member group was caught while attempting to dump waste into the Marappalam canal near the Kuravankonam-Marappalam Road around 3 a.m. The Museum Police have registered a case against Suresh, Joy, and Christeena in this regard. The Health wing also seized the autorickshaw that was used to carry the waste. False claim According to Nanthencode health inspector S.S. Minu, who led the crackdown, the group used to collect waste for a fee from houses and commercial establishments in various localities, claiming to be Kudumbashree volunteers deployed by the Corporation. The collected waste was the dumped at various places, including canals in the city. Noticing the constant dumping of waste in the canal, the Health staff along with Kesavadasapuram ward councillor Amsu Vamadevan and Muttada councillor Rinoy T.P., kept vigil on Thursday night in the area, and nabbed the group when they arrived to dump the waste. ‘Illegal collectors’ “Stringent action will be taken against those who pollute waterbodies by dumping waste. Action will also be taken against commercial establishments that hand over waste to illegal collectors,” said Mr. Minu. The Health wing of the city Corporation has stepped up its drive against those who dump waste in public places, following increasing such instances in recent weeks. The checks against waste dumping had slowed down after the COVID-19 outbreak, as the Health officials were deployed for other work, including implementation of quarantine rules and running of isolation centres. On flyovers The Health wing has found that the flyovers in the city are a preferred location for some to regularly dump waste, as there are no CCTV cameras or squads there. According to Health officials, quite a few of those who were caught claimed to be unaware of the facilities opened by the city Corporation for collecting biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gang-tries-to-dump-waste-in-canal-nabbed/article36284560.ece
04 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Food safety inspection at three fish markets||The enforcement wing of the Food Safety Department conducted inspections at Pothencode, Venjaramoodu, and Aryanad fish markets on Friday morning. The inspections were held following complaints by consumers of possible sale of chemical-laced fish. Thirty samples were tested using rapid kits that detect the presence of formalin and ammonia. At the Pothencode and the Venjaramoodu markets, the inspections held at 7 a.m. failed to detect the presence of any chemicals. Inadequate ice However, food safety officials found that traders were selling fish without storing it in adequate ice, and issued warnings to them. One kg of ice is required to store one kg of fish. Only ice should be used to prevent fish from decaying, the officials said. Samples of ice were also tested but no presence of chemicals was detected. Some sellers tend to sprinkle sand on fish before sale to give the impression that it is fresh. Sprinkling of sand will cause germs in it to contaminate the fish, they said. Flesh that sinks upon touch, fish with sunken eyes, colourless fins, and the inners of the fish coming out from split-open stomach are signs of decayed fish, the officials said. Most of the fish in the markets was from other States and preserved in ice. However, local fresh fish too could be seen, more than during the lockdown period when fish from States as far as away as Gujarat made its way here. Licence must Fish traders should get a food safety licence or registration to sell fish, while fish commission agents should take a licence, they said. Ten samples of fish had been taken for detailed investigation at the Government Analytical Food Testing Laboratory here, senior food safety officer A. Sakeer Hussain, who led the inspection, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/food-safety-inspection-at-three-fish-markets/article36284567.ece

The research and development work has now begun for the development of a prototype with the involvement of the KSRTC and the Sree Chitra Thirunal (SCT) College of Engineering in Pappanamcode. Speaking to The Hindu on Friday, KAL Managing Director A. Shajahan said the project was part of the industry-institution linkage plans now being promoted by the State government. “The KSRTC has in its possession old diesel buses that are not so fuel-efficient and are not put into service much. But the chassis and other parts of these buses might still be in a very good condition. Our plan is to retrofit such buses and turn them into electric buses. The R&D work has begun for this project,” he said. Other colleges He said the KAL would sign memorandums of understanding with colleges, including a few other engineering colleges, for technical collaboration as part of the industry-institution linkage programme. These collaborations would be mutually beneficial for the KAL and the students, as the company would be able to generate fresh ideas, while the students can make use of its facilities and technologies. The industry-institution linkage was one of the key elements of the master plan that the KAL had prepared, he said. The company had also been getting enquiries from a few neighbouring Asian countries and African countries for the ‘Kerala Neem G’ autorickshaws that it developed, said Mr. Shajahan. Demand for e-autos “At least till recently, there has been an issue of acceptance for e-autos in the State, as we still have only around 600 of these across all the districts. But with the drastic rise in fuel prices and the push towards e-mobility, there has been a rise in demand for e-autos. Our e-autos have proved their efficiency, while a private player was recently blacklisted by the Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Limited owing to issues with their e-auto model. We have opened dealerships now in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka too. The production capacity of our facility is also set to be increased,” said Mr. Shajahan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kal-may-convert-old-ksrtc-buses-into-e-buses/article36284571.ece
04 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Pay revision panel for retirement age at 57, five-day week||The 11th Pay Revision Commission has recommended that the retirement age of State government employees be enhanced by one year, to 57. The commission has also proposed a five-day week for government offices and the abrogation of the compassionate employment scheme by offering better financial benefits to the kin of employees who die in harness. The report of the commission, headed by former bureaucrat K. Mohandas, titled Administrative Efficiency, Social Accountability, People Friendliness, and Gender Sensitivity, has been handed over to the State government. Stiff opposition Given the stiff opposition to enhancing the retirement age, the commission has looked at the pros and cons. It observes that 56 is too early an age for retirement considering the life expectancy levels in the State. By increasing the retirement age, the government can enjoy continued access to the considerable experience gained by senior hands. It will also enable the government to put off bulk payment of terminal benefits such as gratuity, pension commutation and leave surrender in the initial period. “The deferment of the disbursement of pensionary benefits amounting to around Rs. 4,000 crore in a year may help the government temporarily tide over its resource constraints due to COVID-19 and also against the backdrop of the need for more social security interventions,” the report says. The commission has recommended a five-day week for government offices and realignment of the working hours from 9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. “A five-day week promotes work/life balance by allowing employees to spend more time with their families and pursue their hobbies.” The commission notes that the compassionate employment scheme (CES) should be abrogated. The scheme should be modified considering the “denial of justice to large numbers of young job aspirants, the adverse effect on the efficiency of the Civil Services and the impropriety in the inheritance of public employment.” Looking at numbers, the commission notes that the CES constitutes over 5% in government departments. Sportspersons in government service should be encouraged with lump sum cash awards rather than promotions for achievements in the sports field. “Out-of-turn promotions could dampen the spirit of other officers in the department and are not desirable, unless the achievement is an extraordinary feat, like that of P.R. Sreejesh in the Tokyo Olympics.” Leave and holidays The number of days of casual leave should be reduced to 12 per year as in the Government of India service. Further, the practice of declaring local holidays for local festivals should be scrapped if the event does not affect life in the locality. “For example, Beemapally Urus, Vettucaud feast, and the Arat of Sree Padmanabhawwamy, all in Thiruvananthapuram city, do not require the closure of all government offices in the city. These are only examples, and there are similar events in other places for which local holidays are now allowed. These must be reviewed.”  A five-day week lets employees to spend more time with their families and pursue their hobbies||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pay-revision-panel-for-retirement-age-at-57-five-day-week/article36284366.ece

04 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Recruitment board mooted||Seeking to end malpractices in appointments made in aided schools and colleges in the State, the 11th Pay Revision Commission has recommended the creation of a statutory Kerala Recruitment Board. Merit, and not favouritism or payment of money, should be the criterion for appointments in aided educational institutions where the salaries are paid by the government, the commission noted. The Kerala Recruitment Board should carry out selections to fill vacancies that arise in such institutions, based on reports from the managements, the commission said in its report. The board should have a full-time chairperson and two full-time members, one Vice Chancellor from Kerala, Mahatma Gandhi, Calicut, or Kannur University, and the Director of General Education as part-time members and four part-time members representing the managements. The commission also recommended a slew of measures for the interim revamp of the present recruitment system until the board can be formed. It criticised the collection of huge sums by managements for postings as a practice “akin to dowry.” “Such unaccounted transactions of black money should not be tolerated in public interest, and there has to be insistence on merit, as the salaries are fully paid by the government from the public exchequer.” Ombudsman The commission also recommended that the government appoint an ombudsman for educational appointments. The post should be held by a retired judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court. He/she will have the power to review all appointments by aided schools and colleges. The ombudsman will also review postings made by universities other than those made through the Public Service Commission, it said. Further, the commission recommended mergers and splitting of schools and transfers of teachers and students to maintain viable student-teacher ratios.

04 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) feels progressive Nairs backed LDF in poll||An election review by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has purportedly concluded that a large section of progressive members of the Nair community had thrown in their lot with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the 2021 Assembly elections. The reviewers reportedly feel that they had rejected the patently anti-LDF stance of the Nair Service Society (NSS) leadership. The CPI(M) review report also ostensibly blames the NSS for providing ammunition to the United Democratic Front (UDF) to disadvantage the LDF by playing up the Sabarimala issue electorally and calling for a regime change on the day of the voting. Nevertheless, the CPI(M) had steered clear of a confrontation with the NSS leadership. Its non-confrontational stance appeared to have paid off politically in the elections. In contrast, the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam did not strike an anti-LDF stance. Moreover, Bharath Dharma Jana Sena votes gravitated from the Bharatiya Janata Party to the LDF kitty. The National Democratic Alliance’s vote shared dipped commensurately. The Indian Union Muslim League had worked in conjunction with the Jamaat-e-Islami to alienate the Muslim community from the LDF. But the Kerala Muslim Jamaat led by Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobaker Musaliar had countered the bid. The Kerala Congress (M) inclusion in the LDF helped erode the UDF’s base among Christians in Travancore. Primarily, the LDF’s governance track record authored the win. Countering BJP The CPI(M) reviewers urged the party to devise a strategy to retard the BJP’s growing influence among Hindu voters in Thiruvananthapuram district, particularly in Chirayinkeezhu and Varkala taluks. They reportedly spotlighted the party being pushed to third place in Palakkad in the Assembly polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-feels-progressive-nairs-backed-ldf-in-poll/article36284354.ece
04 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Local bodies told to revive ward panels||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has directed local self-governments to revive the ward-level committees that had played a key role in COVID-19 containment during the first wave and work with renewed vigil and vigour so that the current pace of transmission can be brought down in two weeks. Chairing a crucial videoconference of local body functionaries to discuss COVID management at the grassroots, he said ward- level committees had failed to rise to the occasion during the second wave. He directed the committees to enforce quarantine regulations strictly. The ward-level committees, which had efficiently taken care of contact tracing, quarantining, and other containment activities during the first wave, had fallen back to abysmal levels in recent times. If these committees took over contact tracing and monitoring of those families in home quarantine, disease transmission could be checked and the State could go back to normality faster, Mr. Vijayan said. No total lockdown Mr. Vijayan said total lockdown was no longer a viable solution for disease containment and that all public health experts were against it. The focus had to be on ward-level containment. Ward-level committees should ensure that those quarantined in homes were not violating the quarantine, he added. Mr. Vijayan also asked the local bodies to task the ward-level committees with the responsibility of ensuring that all families in home quarantine were rendered all assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-bodies-told-to-revive-ward-panels/article36284360.ece

Two-thirds of the KAS posts should be filled through open direct recruitment from the next selection onwards. The balance one-third should be from among government employees, gazetted or non-gazetted through an examination that is different from that for the direct recruits, according to the commission. Further, the panel has also suggested that the quota for government employees be abolished after five years. The commission noted that the present system provides for direct recruitment to only one-third of the KAS posts. Two-thirds of the posts are filled through recruitment of individuals already in the service. “Selection to the majority of posts in the KAS as per the present scheme gets reduced to an in-house exercise with limited space for highly qualified outsiders who could bring in fresh thoughts and varied experiences,” the commission said. Good governance board The commission has called for the formation of a Kerala State Good Governance Board for strengthening good governance.

The recommendation is part of the commission’s report, which has called for a timely revision of the Kerala Government Servants Conduct Rules, 1960. The commission has proposed that every male employee should furnish separate affidavits, signed by him and his wife, regarding the gifts in the form of immovable property, vehicles, gold, cash and durable goods received by them for the marriage. This has to be done within one month of the marriage, or, if the employee is already married, within one month of his joining the service.

Picking up flaws Former Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran, who represented the Ambalappuzha constituency earlier, had come under a cloud after the CPI(M) tasked a commission central committee member Elamaram Kareem and State secretariat member K.J. Thomas with ferreting out flaws in electioneering for Assembly polls in the district. Mr. Sudhakaran is the most senior CPI(M) leader from Alappuzha. Several CPI(M) leaders, including incumbent legislator H. Salam, had allegedly complained that Mr. Sudhakaran had stayed off the campaign trail after the party denied him the seat. Fundamentalist outfits Some party members also purportedly pointed to an attempt by some quarters to portray Mr. Salam as a choice of certain fundamentalist outfits, suggesting a covert electoral understanding between the party and such elements.

04 September 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Will hold probe against police on Bidar school incident: govt.||The State government on Friday told the High Court of Karnataka that a departmental inquiry would be conducted on the violation of rights of children by the police in conducting a probe into a sedition case registered against a school in Bidar and appropriate action taken based in the inquiry. A submission in this regard was made before a Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by city-based advocate Nayana Jyothi Jhawar and the South India Cell For Human Rights Education and Monitoring, an NGO, who had complained that the police had violated provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2016.  The government said the Director-General and Inspector-General of Police passed an order for holding departmental inquiry as some of the police personnel were found to be in their uniform contrary to the law that prescribes that the police, as far as possible, should be in plain clothes while counselling/questioning the juveniles. The court, during an earlier hearing, had observed that prima facie the police had violated provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 while questioning the children of a school run by Shaheen Education Society and others. While directing thegovernment to submit the stage of the proposed departmental inquiry during the next date of hearing on the petition, the Bench gave time to the government to comply with the court’s direction for issuing directions to the Police Department to ensure that the police do not violate the provisions of the JJ (Care and Protection of Children) Rules. The criminal case was registered against the school, its management and others for enacting a play, using schoolchildren, to allegedly incite people to oppose the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and to give negative opinion on laws enacted by Parliament. Photographs Though the government had said that the investigation office was in plain clothes while questioning the students, the court had pointed from the photographs produced by the petitioner that some other police personnel were not only in uniform but were also carrying their firearms during the process of questioning children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/will-hold-probe-against-police-on-bidar-school-incident-govt/article36283939.ece
04 September 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC rejects plea against chanting of mantras in Tamil in temples||The Madras High Court on Friday rejected a public interest litigation petition which sought a direction to the Tamil Nadu government to withdraw the ‘Annai Tamil Archanai’ scheme, which lets devotees opt for the chanting of hymns by priests in Tamil, instead of Sanskrit, while performing puja in the sanctum sanctorum of temples. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu refused to entertain the petition since the issue was not res integra (an unsettled question of law) any more. They said another Division Bench of Justices Elipe Dharma Rao and K. Chandru (both retired) had, in March 2008, dismissed a batch of cases filed in 1998 and held that the Agama Sastras do not prohibit chanting of mantras in Tamil. Holding that the choice of wanting the mantras to be recited either in Sanskrit or in Tamil vests with the devotees, that Bench had criticised the litigants for making it seem as if God could understand only Sanskrit and not Tamil. Authoring the verdict, Justice Chandru had said that if the litigants were allowed to have their way, the fears expressed by former President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan might become true. In his book, The Hindu view of Life , Dr. Radhakrishnan had said, “To many Hinduism seems to be a name without any content. Is it a museum of beliefs, a medley of rites, or a mere gap, a geographical expression?” Though the present litigant, Rangarajan Narasimhan of Srirangam, had relied upon yet another judgement by a different Division Bench which had rejected a writ petition filed in 2008 for reciting mantras in Tamil, the Bench led by Chief Justice Banerjee differentiated between the two verdicts. It pointed out that the 2008 writ petition was dismissed since the litigant then over there had insisted that mantras should be chanted only in Tamil and not in any other language. Therefore, the court had held that it could not compel the use of a particular language to the exclusion of others in religious institutions. On the other hand, the 1998 writ petitions were dismissed after holding that the choice of chanting mantras either in Tamil or Sanskrit would rest with the devotees, the Chief Justice said. Improper translation Further, the verses had not been translated properly. There was a huge difference between the Vedic language and the language to which they are being translated. For example, one of the hymns chanted in Vaishnavaite temples goes: “Om Kesava Namaha, Om Madhava Namaha, Om Govinda Namaha…” the petitioner said and pointed out that in the Tamil translation, the term Namaha alone had been replaced with Potri while the term Om had been retained as such. Just like the people have faith that a vaccine could prevent a disease, people believe that reciting mantras in a particular language and a particular tone alone would result in well being. “No one can tinker with such a faith,” he contended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/plea-against-chanting-of-mantras-in-tamil-rejected/article36284048.ece
04 September 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Madras HC directs police to respond to plea to examine EPS, Sasikala||The Madras High Court on Friday directed the Sholurmattam police in Nilgiris district to file its reply to a plea by three accused in the 2017 Kodanad Estate heist-cum-murder case, to summon and examine former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, former CM Jayalalithaa’s close aide V.K. Sasikala and others, before the trial court. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar directed State Public Prosecutor Hasan Mohammed Jinnah to ensure that the reply was filed by September 27. Accused D. Deepu, M.S. Satheesan and A. Santhosh Samy had filed the revision petition against the refusal of the trial court to summon the former CM and others. Justice Kumar told counsel for the accused that they had not listed out the reasons to summon certain people for examination as defence witnesses. He asked counsel to be prepared with reasons during the next hearing. He said, a reading of the trial court order alone gives an idea about reasons for rejection of their plea. In his order passed on April 30, Sessions Judge C. Sanjai Baba had stated that the three accused before the High Court now, had filed a petition before him to summon as many as nine individuals including Mr. Palaniswami and Ms. Sasikala for being examined in connection with the 2017 crime reported at the tea estate jointly owned by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The other seven individuals, whom the three accused wanted to examine, were Ms. Sasikala'; relatives J. Elavarasi & V.N. Sudhakaran, former Nilgiris Collector P. Shankar, former Superintendent of Police Murali Rambha, AIADMK State organiser Sajeevan, estate manager Natarajan and one Sunil under the care of Mr. Sajeevan. Similarly, the prime accused in the case, K.V. Sayan too had filed a petition before the trial court to summon an equal number of nine individuals for examination, and the only common witness between both the petitions was estate manager Natarajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/respond-to-plea-to-examine-ex-cm-sasikala/article36284113.ece

The MLAs belonging to the ruling party turned the heat on the issue saying that scarcity of sand, high prices and non-availability have compounded the woes of the people. Tempers ran high when MLAs Annabathuni Siva Kumar and Bolla Brahma Naidu lashed out at the sand contractor blaming him for the high prices of sand. At one point of time, an MLA flung the mike down on the floor prompting Minister for Housing and district in charge Minister Ch. Ranganatha Raju to intervene. Collector Vivek Yadav said that rates displaying the availability and rates of sand at various sand reaches had been put up at all sand reaches . He said that sand was available in plenty at the sand reaches across the district and added that people could now have access to sand at lower prices. The DDRC meeting also witnessed MLAs tuning their ire against officials over supply of fertilizers and pesticides, seeds and availability of water for irrigation purposes. Mr. Brahma Naidu said that it was irrational that irrigation officials had resorted to “vara nandi” inn spite of availability of water.

04 September 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||With monetisation move, assets will go to a few: Kharge||Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge sees the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) of the Modi government robbing off the hard-earned reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes with the Congress-created assets landing in the hands of a few individuals. Mr. Kharge said that the intellectuals’ silence on this ‘selling spree’ would harm the nation not just financially but also socially. “This is a danger that is camouflaged in the name of monetisation policy,” he said in Hyderabad. He was addressing the media on Friday as part of the Congress’ nationwide campaign against monetisation. He said that the mixed economy concept of the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru created 89 PSUs that changed the very course of development in modern India with assets created and the economy growing and strengthening people financially. “But, the Modi government just wants to blindly sell these precious assets instead of creating more,” he said. Ridiculing the BJP’s defence on monetisation, he said that the proposed national assets to be monetised were earning Rs. 3.5 lakh crore for the government. Some units were incurring the loss of Rs. 45,000 crore but even if that is excluded, the government still earns Rs. 3 lakh crore. He said that selling off 26,700 km of roads for Rs. 1.6 lakh crore, 400 rail stations, and tracks for Rs. 1.5 lakh crore, power transmission lines worth Rs. 45,200 crore, and power generation plants worth Rs. 39,832 crore, will play havoc with the lower and middle classes, as toll taxes, travel fares and power charges are bound to multiply. Stating that the BJP’s concept was ‘Looto aur Baato’, he said that BJP had to acknowledge that the Congress governments had created these assets over 70 years for them to sell. “They have exposed their charges that the Congress did nothing in the last 70 years,” he added. Mr. Kharge agreed that Congress governments too, sold some assets but they were few and the loss-making ones only unlike the BJP that is selling ‘strategic’ assets. Moreover, the track record of the Modi government’s selling encouraged monopoly with only a few individuals benefiting than the nation. He reminded how cities like Hyderabad and Bengaluru burst with economic growth due to the PSUs established here in the last seven decades. “That ecosystem led to lakhs of people gaining financially, socially and educationally because of the strategic assets created,” he said. He also said that India has a total of 366 PSUs with 9.2 lakh regular and 4.98 lakh contractual employees. Railways employ a total of 12.53 lakh employees, and department of posts employs 4.18 lakh employees. If all these companies are sold off, what will be the future of these employees and their families? he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/with-monetisation-move-assets-will-go-to-a-few-kharge/article36283943.ece

Charges Mr. Parathasarathy will be in police custody for two days (Friday and Saturday). He has been accused of defaulting bank loans, besides raising loans against the securities of his clients without their consent. “He was taken into custody for questioning pertaining to a case registered against him by HDFC Bank for availing a loan of Rs. 350 crore by pledging the shares of the company clients illegally and defaulting the payments,” an officer said.

04 September 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||KCR meets PM, seeks review of IPS cadre posts to Telangana||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday with a list of 10 demands, one of which sought review of IPS officers allotted to the State with the objective to increase their strength from existing 76 to 105 to take their authorised total strength to 194. At 76, the authorised strength of IPS officers allotted to the State was only 139, Mr. Rao pointed out. The other nine demands raised by Mr. Rao included 21 Centrally sponsored Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas to cover each of the new districts, a one-time grant-in-aid of Rs. 1,000 crore for Warangal textile park, a tribal university as envisaged in the State bifurcation Act, an Indian Institute for Management at Hyderabad, and an International Institute of Information Technology at Karimnagar, upgradation of roads under Prime Minister’s Grameen Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), additional funds under PMGSY, complete funding of road works in naxalite affected districts by the Centre and sanction of Hyderabad - Nagpur and Warangal - Hyderabad industrial corridor projects. While seeking more IPS cadre posts to the State, Mr. Rao highlighted that the demand accrued from reorganisation of districts which took their number from 10 to 33. It resulted in 20 police districts and nine police commissionerates instead of nine police districts and two police commissionerates. So, there was need to create new territorial posts to fulfil statutory responsibilities as per Police Act. Not only new districts, new zones and multi-zones were created which required creation of additional critical posts. The earlier IPS cadre review for Telangana was done by Home Ministry in 2016 when a total of 76 senior duty posts and resultant 139 total authorised posts were approved. The State government had sent a proposal to the Ministry to review the cadre posts in June. Hence, a marginal increase of these posts from 76 to 105 was sought as a special case to increase their their total authorised strength from 139 to 195. This allocation will help posting IPS officers as Commissioners/Superintendents of Police, Deputy Inspectors General in at zonal level and Inspectors General of police in multi-zones. Mr. Rao pointed out that the present authorised strength of 139 posts comprised 76 senior duty posts, 30 Central Deputation Reserve (CDR) posts at 40 %, 19 State Deputation Reserve (inter-State) posts at 25%, two training reserve posts at 3.5% and 12 leave reserve posts at 16.5%. The senior duty posts will go up to 105, CDR 42, SDR 26, training reserve 4 and leave reserve 17 if the authorised strength was increased from 139 to 194.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kcr-meets-pm-seeks-review-of-ips-cadre-posts-to-telangana/article36283986.ece

04 September 2021||MYSURU,ANDHRA PRADESH||Geotagging pelicans to track their flight path||Scientists of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, will geotag the spot-billed pelicans at Kokkrebellur in Mandya district to track their flight path and study their migratory patterns. The exercise, being conducted for the first time for the pelicans at the community reserve located off the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway near Maddur, will help understand the habitat preferred by the birds. This will help initiate conservation measures through suitable interventions, apart from throwing light on theirnesting patterns and breeding biology. The Deputy Conservator of Forests, V. Karikalan, told The Hindu that around 250 pelicans come to roost at Kokkrebellur during peak season, and this is in addition to painted storks. The pelicans which arrive at Kokkrebellur around October or November tend to roost for an extended period of time lasting up to six months. But their whereabouts are not known for the remaining period and geotagging will to help not only track their movement but also ascertain the preferential habitats of these birds in different seasons and at different locations, said Mr. Karikalan. Though many pelicans are also sighted at Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, Lingambudhi Kere, and Karanji Nature Park in Mysuru, among others, it is not possible to establish if these are the same birds that have flown from Kokkrebellur, he added. The Forest Department will fund the geotagging of the birds, and as each tag costs between Rs. 1.5 lakh and Rs. 2 lakh, only a handful of birds will be tagged and their movement tracked on a real-time basis. In the past, the birds used to be ringed and provided with an identity tag, and ornithologists and birders would identify them and confirm their presence in different location when sighted in those places. But their flight path remained unknown as ringing the birds with ID tags did not provide for real-time monitoring to track their movement, said K. Manu of Mysore Amateur Naturalists (MAN) who has worked extensively at Kokkrebellur. There are a little more than a dozen breeding sites of spot-billed pelicans in the country and Kokkrebellur is one of them, he said. Mr. Karikalan said that once the migratory path of the birdsis established, the Forest Department can take measures to shore up the habitat where the pelicans tend to roost before their onward flight. He said in case the water source is being polluted or trees where the birds roost are being felled, suitable intervention can be made to check this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/geotagging-pelicans-to-track-their-flight-path/article36283938.ece

The exams were scheduled to start on September 6. A Bench led by Justice A.M.

The State counsel refused to give an assurance when the court asked whether the State could guarantee that no student would be infected. “These are children of tender age,” Justice Khanwilkar observed. “As we could not get a satisfactory response from counsel for State in this regard, we grant interim relief staying offline exam till the next date of hearing,” the court noted, listing the case on September 13. 3 lakh students Mr. Padmanabhan submitted that around three lakh students were scheduled to take the exam from September 6 to 27.

Interacting with bank officials coming under the Ongole police sub-division, she said that CCTV cameras should be installed inside and outside of the bank premises and also at ATM centres. The data should be stored for longer duration of time as it would be useful in cracking incidents of crime. The SP wanted banks to set up fire safety equipment and to place accountable persons related to banking matters at ATM centres to prevent incidents of crime. The SP advised bank officials to carry out awareness programmes on the theft of money from the bank accounts of innocent people as cybercriminals collected bank customer details on social media by using Android phones and misusing them. The SP suggested to the public not to reveal the bank account number, ATM card number and PIN number to strangers under any circumstances. The SP asked them to convey the information to the police station concerned if they found any person roaming suspiciously at the parking premises of the bank. “Fake website, OTP type cyber crimes are on the rise in recent times hence the bank officials should be vigilant against such crimes and take effective measures against the happening of such crimes.” the SP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/step-up-security-at-banks-sp/article36284502.ece

The Minister said details asked by the apex court would be handed over before September 13. Any further decision would be taken after the court’s final verdict.

The leaders demanded an explanation from the DGP for the ‘insult’. ‘Disha Act non-existent’ The youth and student leaders ridiculed the spending of Rs. 30 crore towards publicity of the ‘non-existent’ Disha Act and also wondered why the accused in cases of violence against women would go scot-free if the Disha Act had been in force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-leaders-decry-police-high-handedness-on-protesters/article36284507.ece

04 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Unaided schools want govt. to revoke G.O. on fee structure||Members of the Federation of Unaided Schools Associations of Andhra Pradesh on Friday appealed to the State government to revoke GO 53 pertaining to fixation of fee rates in private unaided schools and junior colleges in the State by the AP School Education Regulatory and Monitory Commission and amend GO 1 on implementation of reforms in schools. At a press conference, president of AP Private Unaided Schools Managements’ Association (APPUSMA) M.V. Ramachandra Reddy called GO 53 “very unfair” towards private budget schools that catered to the education needs of the low-income households and were the only source of livelihood for many educated unemployed persons. “These budget schools, to some extent, help alleviate teacher unemployment issue,” he said. He said a handful of corporate schools with commercial interests were the real culprits as far as collection of hefty fees was concerned. The federation appealed to the regulatory panel to put private budget schools in separate category and frame separate set of rules for them. Referring to the draft GO on reforms in school education, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said its implementation in entirety would result in closure of 85 % of private budget schools, creating a wide gap in the education sector. He said GO 1 should be amended in a manner that 50 % of the fee amount should be spent on payment of salaries and other benefits like ESI and EPF to the staff, 40 % towards building rents, electricity charges and other maintenance expenses and 10 % should be allocated for development of school assets. He said the rates fixed for annual fees, transport charges and fee for boarding schools were anything but practical. “No two schools have common features, but ironically, all schools are being forced to follow common rule which cannot be justified,” he argued. Maintaining that fee structure should finalised based on the facilities and infrastructure available in a private budget school, he pointed to the fact that the government decisions would directly impact the lives of nearly 10 lakh teachers working in the private sector. Giving a break-up of the schools in the State, the members pointed out that there were a total of 44,639 government schools with a student strength of 43,56,643 against 14,526 private schools with a student strength of 27,84,274. Similarly, there total 1,972 aided schools with 1,97,291 students studying in them. Mr. Reddy said the teaching fraternity was already in dire straits due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of the proposed measures would deal a further blow to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/unaided-schools-want-govt-to-revoke-go-on-fee-structure/article36284527.ece

04 September 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Of contempt of court and jail term for IAS officers||The jail sentence awarded by the Andhra Pradesh High Court to IAS officers R. Muthyala Raju, S.S. Rawat, M.V. Seshagiri Babu, and A.Md. Imtiyaz, and retired bureaucrat Manmohan Singh, in a contempt case on Thursday brings to focus the price a public servant has to pay for dereliction of duty. However, the court had given them permission to appeal against the punishment within a month, while reprimanding them for being negligent in spite of clear directions by it to do justice to the petitioner. The case in point Though quite a few IAS officers have personally appeared before the court in the last two years in a flurry of contempt cases, this one stands out as five senior bureaucrats are awarded jail term for not following the directions in a single, land-related matter. As per the case, they were supposed to arrange payment of compensation to the petitioner, T. Savitramma, for resuming her D-Form patta land measuring three acres at Yerragunta village of Venkatachalam mandal in Nellore district for construction of the regional centre of the erstwhile National Institute for the Mentally Handicapped (NIMH). But the payment was inordinately delayed. As a consequence, the court had directed that the compensation be paid to the aggrieved woman from out of the salaries of the IAS officers, two of whom (Mr. Mutyala Raju and Mr. Seshagiri Babu) were District Collectors and another was Joint Collector (Mr. Imtiyaz) at that time. Similarly, Mr. Manmohan Singh was Principal Secretary (revenue) and Mr. Rawat was Principal Secretary (finance) at that time. Ms. Savitramma’s husband, Venkataiah, had been granted the D-Form patta land at Yerragunta Kanupuru-II village. He was later issued the pattadar passbook and title deed, and his name too was entered in the revenue records. The land had been in the possession of Ms. Savitramma since her husband’s death in 1998. In 2015, the Village Revenue Officer (VRO) had instructed Ms. Savitramma not to cultivate the land, saying that the government was acquiring it (for NIMH) and would pay her compensation before taking possession of the land. Thereafter, Ms. Savitramma requested the MRO concerned to take possession of the land and pay her the compensation, but the officer had orally informed her that the land had already been resumed because she was not cultivating it. In the absence of due notices to her, Ms. Savitramma had applied under the Right to Information Act for copies of the resumption order and proceedings of allotment of the land to NIMH. But, as per the copies of the said records furnished by the MRO, the petitioner’s land had not been resumed. While handing over possession to the NIMH in July 2015, the land was not shown in the records. It turned out that the land had been wrongly included in the relevant map and handed over to the NIMH. Thereafter, Ms. Savitramma approached the Lokayukta praying for action against the revenue officials. The Lokayukta had called for a report from the District Collector, who submitted the same in December 2016, which said that land up to an extent of 10 acres in Survey Numbers 943/1 & 943/14 was handed over to NIMH, and that the petitioner would be paid compensation along with the other owners whose lands had been taken over for the project. While the matter stood thus, the MRO had issued a notice to Ms. Savitramma on November 5, 2016, seeking an explanation within 15 days why her patta should not be cancelled as she was not cultivating the land. A counter affidavit filed in the high court by the government showed that the land had been resumed even before a notice to that effect was served on the petitioner, and it admitted that compensation was to be paid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/of-contempt-of-court-and-jail-term-for-ias-officers/article36284521.ece

The TDP has sought action against those responsible for registering the cases. In the letter dated September 3, TDP Polit Bureau member Varla Ramaiah said the party had organised State-wide protests on August 28 against the steep increase in petrol and diesel prices in Andhra Pradesh. The protests were held in a peaceful manner following COVID-19 protocol, to exert pressure on the State government to reduce fuel prices, the letter said. “TDP leaders, cadre and the general public were arrested, and others were placed under house arrest,” he alleged in the letter. The police, in violation of democratic norms, had illegally detained demonstrators, placed them under house arrest, and filed cases, he alleged. “The police are turning a blind eye to the mass gatherings, processions and meetings organised by the ruling YSRCP leaders,” he alleged, adding, “The YSRCP-led government has been using the pandemic as an excuse to target and victimise TDP leaders, cadre and sympathisers.” A quick action by the NHRC would help in restoring democracy and upholding fundamental rights in general and freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19 in particular in the State of Andhra Pradesh, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-petitions-nhrc-against-illegal-arrest-of-party-cadre/article36284637.ece

04 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Chronic flooding a routine monsoon affair||Several colonies towards the Eastern side of the city experienced flooding due to the heavy rain that lashed the city during evening hours on Thursday. Akhilandeswari Nagar near Saheb Nagar, Mythili Nagar and Shivasai Nagar in Meerpet, and Kodandaram Nagar and Seesalabasthi downstream of Saroor Nagar lake, were a few locations hit by flood water yet again. Three hours of heavy rain beat down the city relentlessly on Thursday, starting from 8 p.m., recording the highest rainfall of over 10 cm in Shaikpet. Kukatpally followed with 9.8 cm and Serilingampally with 9 cm. Saroornagar recorded 8.7 cm, Balanagar 8 cm, and Khairatabad 7.8 cm. Hayatnagar, and Bandlaguda were other locations which received about 7 cm of rain, which resulted in heavy flooding on roads and inundation of colonies. Water streaming down the hilly areas of Krishna Nagar and Yusufguda made a spectacle, carrying away two wheelers and push carts along with the flow. While at many locations water cleared eventually, there were colonies which remained besieged by flood water even on Friday. Par for the course “This has become a routine for us whenever it rains. Floodwater rushes into our residential area, due to insufficiency of the stormwater drain capacity,” said Ch.Saibaba, a resident of Kodandaram Nagar, where knee-deep water entered homes in low-lying areas. Houses were locked, as residents shifted to safer locations in the dead of the night. Rain water mixed with drainage has become a routine scourge for the residents of Akhilandeshwari Nagar in the vicinity of Kapra Lake. Due to newly proliferating colonies around the lake and absence of drainage lines, all the sewage is connected to the stormwater drains, which results in overflow during rains. “Drainage from areas such as Almasguda and B.N.Reddy Nagar enters the inlet channels of the lake. During heavy rain, the drains overflow and flood the colony. Owing to CC roads, the flood water settles in open plots, which results in chronic mosquito menace,” says Koteshwar Goud, a student. Vanished weirs In colonies around the chain-linked lake system of Pedda Cheruvu, Mantrala Cheruvu and Chandan Cheruvu in the limits of Meerpet Municipal corporation, vanished surplus weirs are the root cause of flooding. With Chandan Cheruvu of Jillelaguda brimming to the brink, residents had to create a breach to let the water out, which resulted in heavy flooding of Shivasai Colony. The situation is worse in Mythili Nagar, which falls between Mantrala Cheruvu and Chandan Cheruvu.

04 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KCR pitches for IIM, IIIT and Navodaya Vidyalayas||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao made a strong pitch for prime educational institutions like Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) and Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas at his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Friday. While seeking IIM, he regretted that the institution was not sanctioned to Telangana though some other States got it as a stated policy of Centre to establish them in each State. It was not sanctioned because there was already an Indian School of Business (ISB) in Hyderabad. But, it was a private self-financing institution. Ordinary students could not afford to study in it because of exorbitant tuition fee. Mr. Rao assured Mr. Modi that the State government will provide land for IIM on the campus of the University of Hyderabad (UoH) as there was more than 2,000 acres available there. The land was allotted by the State government. The government would also provide land and contribute its share of funding for the establishment of IIIT in public-private partnership mode at Karimnagar. The government will galvanise leading private and public sector companies, particularly in IT sector, to partner with the project in PPP mode as envisaged by the Ministry of Education. After the reorganisation of districts in 2016, the strength of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas did not go up though 30 new districts were carved out and it was the policy of the Centre to have them in each district throughout the country. Therefore, 21 new schools were required for which the government will provide land. Mr. Rao said that the DPR for an integrated state-of-the art textile park over 2,000 acres was being readied but would require an investment of nearly Rs. 1,600 crore. He, therefore, requested a one-time grant-in-aid of Rs. 1,000 crore. The balance cost will be met by the State government. He reminded Mr. Modi that the promise of sanctioning a tribal university as a Central university in the bifurcation law was not met. The 4,000 km road length, which the State qualified to get under the Prime Minister’s Grameen Sadak Yojana, should be upgraded from 3.75 mt lane to 5.5 mt bituminous pavement. Additional funds may be given under the yojana to improve road connectivity in backward areas as mandated in the bifurcation law. The road works in Naxalite-hit areas should be completely funded by the Centre instead of asking States to contribute in 60:40 ratio. Mr. Rao sought Hyderabad - Nagpur industrial corridor for connection through high speed passenger and freight rail connectivity between the two cities and also six or eight laning of the existing NH between them. He also wanted Hyderabad - Warangal industrial corridor to cover the sector with existing rail line from Nagpur to Hyderabad and road link from Hyderabad to Bhoopalapatnam through an ongoing NH project. Just as all State governments have their official accommodation in New Delhi, he requested Mr. Modi to sanction land at a suitable place for the construction of Telangana Bhavan in the capital. Mr. Modi assured to sanction the land, a release of CMO here said. Mr. Rao also requested Mr. Modi to inaugurate the Yadadri temple, whose reconstruction was nearing completion. The inauguration was likely in October or November. Mr. Modi promised to attend the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-pitches-for-iim-iiit-in-state/article36284311.ece
04 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Swirling rain waters give sleepless night to residents in Yousufguda||A day after the video of roaring rain water sweeping away push carts of fruit vendors and vehicles on Venkatagiri Road and Sabir Road in Yousufuguda went viral, life returned to normalcy. “The water reached up to knee level. We could not sleep at night as the water came in two directions and flooded our house,” says Venkatratnam, who lives in the lane abutting Sabir Road. The house is built next to a covered nullah. Right behind the house, a three-storey house has been built on the nullah. “The water bubbled and overflowed from the nullah here,” says Mr. Venkatratnam pointing to a hole as well gaps in the covering slabs of the water channel. A tea stall has also been built on the nullah. “People have dumped rocks in the sewage line. There are many blockages which cannot be removed with this machine,” said a civic worker trying to drain the rainwater mixed with sludge using a sewer-cleaning machine. “Even if the sewage line was functioning, it cannot take the load of water that comes downhill. This has become a regular feature for us,” said Bobby, a resident of the area. A pool of water with heaps of sand at many locations turned the road dangerous. The particular stretch of road in Yousufguda is below the slope of Jubilee Hills. While Jubilee Hills Road no. 10 and Road no. 22 are at an elevation of 600 metres above sea level, the Yousufguda area is at an elevation of 552 metres above sea level. It is this 50-metre drop in elevation that gave the velocity to water to sweep away everything in its path on Thursday night. “The water reached here,” says the owner of Dhanalakshmi Rice Store pointing to the water mark on the low wall in front of the shop. “We built this small wall last year so that the water doesn’t enter and damage rice bags. A lot of other shops had their goods damaged,” he said. The other areas that got flooded on Thursday night included Nadeem Colony, areas around Gaddinnaram Cheruvu, Bahadurpura, Falaknuma Bridge, Allamthota Bavi, Vanasthalipuram, Kodandaram Colony in Saroornagar and Gulshan Colony.  The water reached up to knee level. We could not sleep at night as the water came in two directions and flooded our house.

04 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Handloom revivalist Suraiya Hasan passes away||Suraiya Hasan Bose known as Suraiya Apa, who was instrumental in reviving the handloom heritage fabrics like himroo brocade, mashru, and telia rumal passed away on Friday morning. She was 93. Born and brought up in Hyderabad, she travelled the world learning about crafts and fabrics. Educated in Cambridge, she returned to India to work at the Cottage Industries Emporium established by her father Badrul Hasan, who was a freedom fighter. In the mid-50s she moved to Delhi and worked with Pupul Jayakar and Kamaldevi Chattopadhyay at the Handloom and Handicrafts Export Council. Her husband Aurobindo Bose, a nephew of Subhash Chandra Bose, predeceased her. Suraiya Hasan Bose returned to Hyderabad in 1972 when her uncle Abid Hussain Safrani bought land near Husain Shah Wali Dargah and established the Safrani Memorial High School. Just beside the school, Suraiya set up her workshop-cum-showroom that also functioned as a training ground for generations of artisans. It was at her workshop that she roped in the services of a master naqshband weaver from Varanasi Abdul Qadir to revive himroo. And by 1986, the brocade that charmed nobility and royalty was back in the fashion circles. In 1982 she established Deccan Exports which tapped the big demand in foreign markets for Indian handlooms. She was responsible for bringing in ikat and kalamkari dyeing techniques to durries and Gadwal and uppada saris making them attractive to foreign buyers as well as the more fashion conscious circles in India. Another weaving tradition she saved from extinction was Telia Rumal which now has a Geographical Indication tag. It was at her workshop that the unassuming woman draped in handloom sari met legions of connoisseurs, journalists, artisans and buyers. “You must visit the Coromandel Coast where these textiles are being made for centuries. You have to meet the artisans, spend time with them, and understand their lives to write about their ancestors. Without understanding the places [the sites and workshop spaces] of production, one cannot gain knowledge about objects,” she told one of her interviewers in 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/handloom-revivalist-suraiya-hasan-passes-away/article36284299.ece
04 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bandi Sanjay: KCR in Delhi to give false impression to people||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Bandi Sanjay Kumar waded into Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s visit to New Delhi and said that the latter’s effort to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi was just to give a “false impression” to people about his ties with the party. “KCR is moving heaven and earth to meet the PM. Like a true democrat, Mr. Modi will surely meet him but there is no question of our party having close ties with TRS. We will never align with it contrary to what the CM wishes to project,” he told a public meeting at Manneguda in Vikarabad district on Friday. ‘Diverting attention’ The BJP leader, on the seventh day of his Praja Sangrama Yatra, ridiculed the hoisting of party flags on the occasion of foundation stone laying for the TRS office in Delhi and said it was only meant to divert the people’s attention to the ‘overwhelming’ response to his ongoing ‘mahapadayatra’. “Mr. Rao, after meeting the PM, will claim that his government was praised with select leaks to the media. Please do not believe such canards. He and his party are facing the heat from the public. His pre-bypoll gimmicks of new schemes and spending hundreds of crores will not work anymore and we are sure to win in Huzurabad,” he claimed. Mr. Sanjay Kumar said that this region was deprived of irrigation water either from the initial design of Pranahita Chevella or the redesigned project by TRS government due to ‘corruption’. “Telangana’s interests have been mortgaged in getting Krishna water share as it was getting only 299 tmc as against 575 tmc. The CM skipped the KRMB meeting to ‘cover up’ his failures. BJP is committed to the welfare of people and is the only party that can free Telangana from the clutches of a corrupt family rule of TRS,” he maintained. Senior leaders D.K. Aruna and Vivek Venkat Swamy, among others, were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bandi-sanjay-kcr-in-delhi-to-give-false-impression-to-people/article36284308.ece
04 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TSRTC MD Sajjanar bats for self reliance||Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) Vice-Chairman and Managing Director (MD) V.C. Sajjanar lauded the staff for their hard work and said that the corporation’s revenues were affected due to the pandemic, and pushed for its self reliance. The IPS officer took charge on Friday and interacted with the media. He expressed pride in taking over the reins of the transport juggernaut and pointed out that several of his predecessors, who were at the helm of affairs, were IPS officers. Taking questions from the media, he said that COVID had hit hard several sectors and that TSRTC was no exception. RTC, he said, was losing around Rs. 8 crore per day on account of the pandemic and other factors like continuous rise in diesel and spare parts prices. Mr. Sajjanar said that despite these adverse conditions, TSRTC officers and staff have risen to the occasion to perform their duties well. Bearing testimony to this is the fact that the Corporation not only transported ‘guest’ workers when the pandemic was raging, but also carried oxygen cylinders to those in need. He listed the priorities, first being self reliance, meaning generating revenue through ticket sales. The second, he said, was customer satisfaction, meaning the comfort of passengers. Finally, the welfare of around 48,000 TSRTC staff. He pointed out that TSRTC Welfare Board would diligently look into grievances of staff. He encouraged people to avail the service of RTC. “Your safety is our responsibility. Please use RTC to reach (your destination) safely,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sajjanar-bats-for-self-reliance-in-tsrtc/article36284320.ece

Sabitha Indra Reddy and Chairman of Dairy Development Cooperative Federation L. Bhuma Reddy laid foundation stone for the construction of a mega dairy project with Rs. 246 crore on 32 acres land at Raviryala village of Maheshwaram mandal in Rangareddy district on Friday. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Srinivas Yadav said the State government is helping dairy farmers for bringing another white revolution in Telangana and helping the farming community improve their income from dairy farming. He stated that Vijaya Dairy was facing closure due to huge losses before formation of Telangana as the procurement of milk was just one-lakh litres a day. However, the proactive steps taken by the government had helped it improve turnover from Rs. 300 crore in 2014-15 to Rs. 750 crore in 2020-21 with the procurement of milk going up to 4.5 lakh litres a day with 2.13 lakh farmers in the cooperative unions. On the mega project at Raviryala, the minister said it would be completed in two years and it would have the capacity to process about 8 lakh litres. Stating that there were 28 Vijaya Dairy products, he said they have good demand in Andhra Pradesh, Mumbai and Delhi, besides in Telangana. The minister stated that they are encouraging small and marginal farmers to take up dairy farming as additional income generation activity on one hand and making young entrepreneurs to take up dairy farming on commercial basis. Unlike the private dairy, Vijaya Dairy is procuring milk 365 days a year by giving incentive on supply of milk to it and also giving milch animals on subsidy. Stating that there are 200 Vijaya Dairy outlets in the State, Mr. Srinivas Yadav said they have plans to increase the number to 600. Minister Ms. Sabitha Indra Reddy explained various other animal husbandry and dairy development schemes being implemented by the State government, including supply of sheep units on subsidy, fisheries and others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mega-dairy-project-with-rs-246-cr-to-come-up-at-raviryala/article36284297.ece

04 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre, FCI urged to lift more boiled rice||The State government has stepped up its efforts to convince the Centre and Food Corporation of India (FCI) to lift more boiled rice from Telangana to protect the interests of paddy farmers. The State has also sought more time for handing over custom milled rice (CMR) for 2020-21 Rabi season. After meeting Union Food and Civil Supplies Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday and secretary Sudhanshu Pandey on Thursday on the same issue, Minister for Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar met Chairman and Managing Director of FCI Atish Chandra on Friday to reiterate the State’s plea for lifting more boiled rice from Telangana, keeping in mind harsh weather conditions during the Rabi season. Mr. Kamalakar explained to the FCI CMD that huge quantity of paddy would go waste in processing it as raw rice as it would end up in broken rice in a higher quantity due to the extreme temperatures during the Rabi season and result in huge loss. “By accepting boiled rice instead of raw rice for Rabi season, huge wastage can be prevented and will help meet the hunger needs,” he said. Further, lifting higher quantity of boiled rice would help double farmers’ income. At a time when the State government was helping farmers in every possible way, it was the responsibility of the Centre to help the community by accepting rice milled from 80 lakh quintals of paddy for the last Rabi season and extend the time for a month to give one lakh quintals of CMR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-fci-urged-to-lift-more-boiled-rice/article36284303.ece

She is among film celebrities after filmmaker Puri Jagannadh and his business partner, actor-turned-producer Charmme Kaur, to appear before the ED. Prior request The 30-year-old Tollywood actor, who recently made her debut in Bollywood, had reportedly made a special request to the central agency and appeared three days before her scheduled summons due to her busy shoot schedule. While she was asked to come in at 10.30 a.m., the actor reached an hour in advance to avoid ‘media chaos’, but was later surprised to see media personnel waiting for her at the ED office. The Sardar Ka Grandson actor, who wore a red-checkered cotton shirt and blue jeans paired with white sneakers, was questioned on her alleged links with the drug racket and following case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. She was asked to produce her bank statements with regard to the alleged suspicious transaction. ‘Doob’ reference In September last, Ms. Singh was questioned by the Narcotics Control Bureau, Mumbai, in an alleged drugs nexus in Bollywood, during which she was asked about a reference to the word ‘doob’ that had appeared in her WhatsApp conversations with actor Rhea Chakraborty. Meanwhile, the ED has summoned more than 10 celebrities of Tollywood, including director Puri Jagannadh and actor Rana Daggubati, in a case related to the smuggling of ‘Class A’ narcotic substances, including LSD and MDMA. After the racket was busted in July 2017, which further followed the arrest of several people, including an American, a South African and a Netherlands national, several Tollywood celebrities were questioned by the Telangana’s Prohibition and Excise Department top officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rakul-preet-appears-before-ed/article36284301.ece

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Dear Megha’ movie review: Love and life, in fits and starts||The film begins with Megha Swaroop (Megha Akash) trying to kill herself at a railway track but changing her decision in the last few seconds. A crestfallen Megha then shares that she is in search of peace and hopes to find it. The next scene takes us to her college life; obviously, we shall know the circumstances that lead her to the railway track.  Dear Megha is a remake of the Kannada blockbuster Dia , whose Telugu dubbed version was recently streamed on YouTube. Those who have seen Dia might not be too happy with Dear Megha . The first half of the film retains the soul of the original but there is a striking contrast thereafter. Though the dialogues are similar, there is a difference in conveying the meaning. Unlike Dia’s Khushi who is an introvert and barely smiles, Megha is cheerful and has a sunny disposition. Cinematographer Andrews splashes Dear Megha in pinks and bright colours; the wall colours of the two homes of the lead pair makes it clear that the director wanted to bring in some change in the narration. Megha Swaroop is attracted to Arjun (Arjun Somayajula) in college. She wants to initiate a conversation with him but holds herself back every time. She wants a valid reason to strike a conversation and by the time she is ready for it, she learns that he left the college. That is just the first surprise; as the film says, life is full of surprises. Back home a bit later, she finds Arjun getting into the elevator she is in. He has moved into the flat opposite hers. Needless to say, they fall in love. However, there comes a shock. Arun Adith fits the gregarious role and Pavitra Lokesh reprises her role as his mother. Director Sushant Reddy hurries initially and slows down later. Though engaging, the narration seems inconsistent. The songs are good. What stands out is Arun Adith’s performance; Megha Akash disappoints initially but is fine post interval. She comes up with the right expressions.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘101 Jillala Andagadu’ movie review: The social comedy on male pattern baldness entertains in parts||When something feels sorely amiss, we lose so much sleep over it that we fail to see the brighter things in life. Society might be largely to blame for how it expects everyone to conform to certain norms, but do we have it within ourselves to rise above it? Nootokka Jillala Andagadu , written by Srinivas Avasarala, is the story of a man coming to terms with male pattern baldness. There’s a lot of humour, some of it works and some fall flat, at the end of which the protagonist has to find it in himself to be confident and take on the world. GSN a.k.a Suri (Srinivas Avasarala) works at a real estate firm, has a doting mom (Rohini) and hails from a middle class family. The one thing that drives him up the wall is his baldness, which he blames on his genes and helpfully says that in Telugu, it translates to karma! The 2019 Hindi films Bala and Udja Chaman on male baldness also spoke of fat shaming and prejudice about dark skin. In pre-release interviews, Avasarala stated that Nootakka … was conceptualised before these films made headlines, but this project took time to shape up. For Nootokka …, Avasarala channels his sense of humour, love for vintage music and cinema in an attempt to make GSN a good-natured guy next door whose smile hides his internal struggles. The wig becomes GSN’s second skin. He never wears a helmet because he can’t risk taking it off without disturbing his perfectly set artificial armour. He wears a cap at home, even when he goes to sleep. The only place where GSN is at peace is when he’s singing S P Balasubrahmanyam hits in the shower. A few segments are hilarious — the genius with which one bald man hiding under a wig can spot another of his ilk in a crowd, and a spin off of the iconic exchange of words between Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor from Deewar . Some of the humour falls flat, like the pun on ‘ pai’ (top) floor to describe the girl as ‘ paina’st (finest) ammayi . The story is straightforward. GSN falls in love with his new colleague (Ruhani Sharma), a level-headed woman who makes him see things for what they are. So we get a film where GSN’s charade in front of her doesn’t get dragged till the climax. Self esteem is the bigger battle to be won. Avasarala and Ruhani play their parts effectively.  Nootokka … is well intentioned and handles issues with sensitivity. But it doesn’t have the spark with which Avasarala wrote Oohalu Gusagusalade and Jo Atchutananda .

04 September 2021||Mumbai,||No signs of unnatural death in actor’s case: police||The autopsy report of actor Sidharth Shukla, who died at the age of 40, does not mention the exact cause of death, police sources said on Friday. The cause of the death will be known after reports of chemical analysis of the viscera and histopathology tests, a police official said. “On the face of it, there were no signs of unnatural death (as per the autopsy report),” the official said, referring to reports that a heart attack led to Shukla’s death. There were no external injuries on the actor’s body, another police official said. The actor’s viscera has been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) at Kalina in Mumbai and some organs were sent to the pathology laboratory of a medical college for examination, a source at the civic-run RN Cooper Hospital said.  Report within 2 days A forensic expert from the hospital said they sent the viscera to the FSL to rule out the possibility of foul play. “The FSL will investigate the presence of toxicity in the organs and other details,” he said, adding that the pathology lab will examine the organs and submit a report within two days. Shukla was rushed to the hospital on Thursday morning after he took ill at home. The doctors declared him brought dead. He was cremated at the Oshiwara crematorium on Friday afternoon in the presence of family members, friends and colleagues from the entertainment industry. Shukla became a household name with his role in the long-running TV show Balika Vadhu and as the winner of Bigg Boss 13 .

According to the police, Prakash Durgashankar (30) stole two gold biscuits, weighing 100 gram each, worth Rs. 8 lakh, and Rs. 2.3 lakh in cash from the temple’s locker. When the temple trustee opened the locker on August 29, he found the valuables missing. The trustee told the police that he had given the main priest the keys during renovation work at the temple from August 17 to 19. “When the main priest kept the keys in the drawer and went for lunch, the accused stole the valuables and kept the keys back,” a police officer said. The main priest was the prime suspect, but the accused was arrested on Wednesday. The police recovered the gold biscuits, but the cash was spent by the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/temple-theft-priest-arrested/article36284395.ece
04 September 2021||New Delhi,||Expert panel to be set up to resolve waterlogging issues in city: Sisodia||After waterlogging was witnessed at several parts of the city for three consecutive days, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said that sites where waterlogging happens should be identified. He also said that in order to resolve the problem, “an expert committee will be formed” with all officers, and a short-term and long-term plan will be made. “He [Mr. Sisodia] directed the officers to get rid of the problem and said that the waterlogging sites in Delhi should be identified and work should be done on it at the micro level, only then will the city get rid of this problem,” an official statement from the Minister’s office said. Waterlogging had led to closure of traffic under the Minto Bridge and there were traffic jams in different parts of the city. Residents found it difficult to reach their destinations. In 2012, the government had commissioned a group of experts from IIT to make a Drainage Master Plan for the city and it was submitted to the Delhi government in 2018. Comprehensive solutions The plan gave comprehensive solutions and talks about 330 waterlogging points in the city, identified by Delhi Police, and solutions in many areas. But it is yet to be approved or implemented. Earlier this year, the PWD had identified several such major waterlogging points. Experts have been saying that implementing the master plan is the solution to the problem. A Delhi government spokesperson said that the current problems will be looked at by an existing committee headed by the Public Works Department, that is already looking into the waterlogging issues. “This committee is looking into different aspects of the Drainage Master Plan submitted to the government and making suggestions or changes. This plan will be long-term plan and the short-term plan will be made to solve the current major issues,” the spokesperson said. Earlier this week, Minto Bridge was closed for traffic due to waterlogging, and the government had said in a statement on Wednesday: “It has been raining heavily for two days. But the work done by the Delhi government to prevent waterlogging in the past has shown results and there is no problem like bus getting stuck due to waterlogging in Minto Bridge.” The statement also said that “apart from this, also there are many areas where there was no waterlogging”. Following heavy rains and waterlogging, on August 24, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that Delhi will “soon get freedom from waterlogging” and “problems will be identified on the ground level”. Overall, the city has gauged 987.7 mm rainfall since June 1, which is 81% more than normal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/expert-panel-to-be-set-up-to-resolve-waterlogging-issues-in-city-sisodia/article36284179.ece
04 September 2021||New Delhi,||Reduce number of refugees protesting outside UNHCR: HC||The Delhi High Court on Friday directed the Delhi government and the police to reduce the number of Afghan nationals protesting outside the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) office here, and that they strictly follow COVID-19 protocol. “Nobody is stopping them from protesting. Firstly they are at a wrong place. It is not a designated protest site. Plus, as per the COVID-19 guidelines, more than 100 people cannot gather,” Justice Rekha Palli remarked. Law same for all The judge added, “How can there be 500 protesters. What is this exception of 500 for refugees?” while referring to the restriction of 100 people even for marriage purpose. The court made it clear that the law is the same for everybody. The High Court’s observation came while hearing a petition by Vasant Vihar Welfare Association, which stated that the foreign nationals have gathered outside the office of the UNHCR at B Block in south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar since August 15, including lanes and parks adjoining it and residents are facing difficulties due to this. The Delhi police’s counsel said that as per the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) guidelines, all social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious, or festival related gatherings and congregations are prohibited during the pandemic.  Central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul said the issue must be seen from a humanitarian angle and urged the court to grant some more time to take a holistic view to resolve it. The court has listed the matter for further hearing on September 7, with the caution that if the matter was not resolved by then, it will be constrained to pass certain orders. The police’s counsel said children are also there in the protest for some duration and the officers have tried to persuade the protesters to shift but they are not agreeable and the only option left is to push them away, which was not done since it was a sensitive issue having international ramifications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/reduce-number-of-refugees-protesting-outside-unhcr-hc/article36284167.ece

04 September 2021||Pune,||Violation of norms will invite fresh curbs: Pawar||If COVID-19 norms are violated during Ganesh Chaturthi, then the Maharashtra government will immediately impose fresh restrictions, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said on Friday. He added that the government had no plans on imposing curbs ahead of the festival. Mr. Pawar, who is also the Guardian Minister of Pune, expressed concern over people letting their guard down in the district’s rural areas, which has been reporting 550 to 600 cases daily. The 10-day festival will begin on September 10 and is likely to remain a muted affair. “While we have discussed imposing restrictions, no such measure will be taken as the big pandals have assured us that celebrations will be muted. Pune has a tradition of people watching spectacles late into night. In case we find a lot of overcrowding, then based on the first day’s estimate, we will take stern measures on the second day itself. I urge citizens not to bring this situation on themselves,” he said. Mr. Pawar hit out at the campaigns launched by the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena to reopen temples in the State. He said BJP leaders ought to be informed about what their own government at the Centre has directed the State about celebrating festivals. ‘Obeying Centre’s orders’ “We are only following the Centre’s directives which have urged caution during dahi handi and Ganesh Chaturthi to avoid a surge in infections. There’s no need for anyone to protest for the reopening of religious places because the State government will do it on a priority basis at the right time,” he said. Admitting that the case positivity rate was on the higher side in the district’s rural areas, Mr. Pawar said the Pune administration attributed it to greater testing. “Unfortunately, people, too, are becoming lax. They don’t wear masks or follow physical distancing, and they have assumed that everything is over. This has led to a rise in infections,” he said. Mr. Pawar said any sport which causes crowding like swimming pools will not be opened. “One cannot swim with masks on. Once masks are removed, the picture changes drastically and cases rise. While we have been liberal thus far with relaxations, these will be lifted in the event of a major spike,” he said. Mr. Pawar urged citizens not to put the State government in a position where it would be compelled to shut down everything in the event of a third wave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/violation-of-norms-will-invite-fresh-curbs-pawar/article36284398.ece

04 September 2021||Kabul,||Taliban battle for final holdout province||Anti-Taliban fighters in Afghanistan’s Panjshir Valley said on Friday they were battling to repulse “heavy” assaults, as the Islamists seek to capture the last holdout province defying their rule. Efforts to strike a peace deal between the two sides have failed, and the Taliban are keen to cap their lightning military offensive which saw them seize control of the rest of Afghanistan last month. “The Taliban have a significant advantage,” said Nishank Motwani, an Afghan analyst based in Australia, saying the Islamists were emboldened by their recent victories. “They are very well armed, and they have the psychological factor in their favour in that they precipitated the fall of the government so quickly.” The Taliban seized an enormous arsenal of weapons and military kit that the now departed U.S. provided to the defeated Afghan Army, as well as the support of prisoners they freed from jails. “The Taliban also have shock troops, including the use of suicide tactics,” Mr. Motwani added. Fighters from the National Resistance Front (NRF), made up of anti-Taliban militia fighters and former Afghan security forces, are understood to have significant weapon stockpiles too in the Valley, which lies around 80 km north of Kabul. On Wednesday, senior Taliban official Amir Khan Muttaqi issued an audio message to say their forces had surrounded the Valley, calling on the people of the Panjshir to tell fighters to lay down their arms. “Those who want to fight, tell them it is enough,” Muttaqi said. Renewed attacks The Taliban have pledged this time they will be more accommodating, but many in Panjshir are deeply sceptical. Hours after their warning, Taliban forces launched renewed attacks, including from the south of Panjshir from Kapisa, as well as from the Khawak pass to the west of the Valley. Both sides have claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on their rivals. Communications are difficult in the Valley, however, and AFP was unable to verify the reports on the ground. On Friday, Ali Maisam Nazary, a spokesman for the NRF, who is understood to be outside the Valley but in close contact with key leader Ahmad Massoud, said there had been more attacks by Taliban forces overnight. “There is heavy fighting in Panjshir,” Mr. Nazary said. “He (Massoud) is busy defending the Valley.” Mr. Massoud is the son of the late guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, dubbed the “Lion of Panjshir” for holding out first against Soviet and then Taliban forces when they were power before. He is understood to want autonomy for the region. Mr. Massoud said in a statement on Wednesday that the Taliban had offered them “one or two seats” in their new administration, but he had rejected the deal. “The Taliban have chosen the path of war,” Mr. Massoud said. Panjshir fighters — and their media-savvy leaders — are full of fighting bravado. “We are ready to defeat them, if they dare to invade,” one Panjshir fighter said. But despite their confidence, the odds seem increasingly stacked against them. Geography at least is on the side of the Panjshir’s fighters, said Mr. Motwani, and while the Taliban claim to have blocked roads into the Valley, that is “very different” from controlling all sides.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-battle-for-final-holdout-province/article36283671.ece
04 September 2021||New York,||Amid rescue efforts, Ida toll rises to at least 48||A stunned U.S. East Coast faced a rising death toll, surging rivers and tornado damage on Thursday after the remnants of Hurricane Ida walloped the region with record-breaking rain, drowning at least 46 people in their homes and cars. At least 48 people in five States died as storm water cascaded into people’s homes and engulfed automobiles, overwhelming urban drainage systems never meant to handle so much rain in such a short time. The toll was highest in New Jersey, where at least 25 people perished in heavy rains that began late Wednesday. A majority were people who drowned after their vehicles were caught in flash floods, some dying in their submerged cars, some getting swept away after exiting into fast-moving water. Floodwaters and a falling tree also took lives in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and New York. In New York City, 11 people died when they were unable to escape rising water in basement apartments. Search for the missing Authorities said the work of searching for possible victims and identifying the dead wasn’t over. Work also continued to haul away ruined cars, clean mud and debris from streets and restore service on bedraggled transportation systems. Parts of New York City’s subway system remained offline as workers repaired flood damage. In Philadelphia, parts of the Vine Street Expressway, a major east-west artery through the heart of the city, were still under water on Friday morning as crews worked seven large pumps to drain it. An inch-thick layer of muck was left behind in the portions that were drying out. Pennsylvania’s transportation department had no estimate on when the heavily trafficked interstate would completely reopen. Leaders in some States also pledged to examine whether anything could be done to prevent a catastrophe like this from happening again. New Jersey and New York have both spent billions of dollars improving flood defences after Superstorm Sandy hit the region in 2012, but much of that work was focused on the coasts and tidal floodplains. President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for both states.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/amid-rescue-efforts-ida-toll-rises-to-at-least-48/article36283662.ece
04 September 2021||Wellington,||IS-inspired terrorist shot dead after New Zealand rampage||An Islamic State-inspired attacker injured six people in a New Zealand supermarket knife rampage on Friday, before being shot dead by undercover police officers who had him under round-the-clock surveillance. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she was “gutted” the man, a Sri Lankan national, had managed to carry out his “hateful” assault even though he was on a terror watchlist. She said the man, who arrived in New Zealand in 2011, entered a shopping mall in suburban Auckland and seized a knife from a display before going on a stabbing spree. Six people were wounded, three critically, in the 60 seconds before officers opened fire. Terrified shoppers fled for the exits and video footage shot by bystanders showed men running toward the incident before a barrage of shots rang out. The attack has stirred painful memories of the Christchurch mosques shootings in March 2019, New Zealand’s worst terror atrocity, when a white supremacist gunman murdered 51 Muslim worshippers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/is-inspired-terrorist-shot-dead-after-new-zealand-rampage/article36283663.ece

During a Politburo meeting Thursday, Mr. Kim said officials must “bear in mind that tightening epidemic prevention is the task of paramount importance which must not be loosened even a moment,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported Friday. While stressing the need for material and technical means of virus prevention and increasing health workers’ qualifications, Mr. Kim also called for “further rounding off our style epidemic prevention system,” KCNA said.

04 September 2021||Yangon,||Over 23 Myanmar troops killed near China border, say rebels||Myanmar ethnic rebels have killed at least 23 government soldiers in days of fighting near the Chinese border, a spokesman for the group said on Friday, in the latest clashes likely to worry powerful neighbour Beijing. The country has been in turmoil since a military coup in February, which sparked pro-democracy protests and renewed fighting in ethnic border areas. Clashes broke out in Mongko, Shan State, on August 28 when troops tried to seize a base from the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the group’s spokesman and local media reports said. “They came to take our base. They were hurt a lot as we were waiting at the top of the mountain. We shot them as they were coming,” an MNDAA spokesman said. Fifteen soldiers were killed on August 28 and eight more in renewed clashes on September 1, he said, adding one MNDAA fighter had been killed. The military said on Monday an officer and an undisclosed number of personnel were killed in fighting with the MNDAA. Myanmar has more than 20 ethnic rebel groups, many of which hold territory in border regions. A messy struggle over autonomy, as well as control of lucrative drug production and natural resources, has long pitted them against each other and the military.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/over-23-myanmar-troops-killed-near-china-border-say-rebels/article36283669.ece

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Duper, fleecer, jailbird||Sukesh Chandrasekhar, 32, sits cooling his heels in the custody of the Delhi Police. He faces the charge of running a well-oiled extortion racket, not from a swanky bungalow but from the premises of Rohini Jail where he has been lodged for the last one year. Four years ago, Chandrasekhar was arrested by the Delhi Police for allegedly striking a deal with a faction of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), led by V.K. Sasikala and T.T.V. Dhinakaran, by assuring them that they would get the ‘two leaves’ AIADMK symbol ahead of the keenly contested RK Nagar by-polls in Chennai. Chandrasekhar, investigators say, had promised them that he would bribe officials in the Election Commission of India to get the job done. Three months ago, the Enforcement Directorate stumbled upon some WhatsApp chats which indicated that someone was involved in money laundering operations. In due course, it turned out it was no small sum — nearly Rs. 200 crore had changed hands and had reached the prime suspect. Realising that something was amiss, the investigators meticulously worked on the case. Finally, the agency’s cyber experts achieved a breakthrough and managed to find out the phone’s location by tracking down its Internet Protocol address prints. Meanwhile, based on complaints from various people, who said that they had received calls from government functionaries promising them help in exchange for a hefty sum, the investigators also scrutinised the outgoing call records from the landlines of these functionaries. The outgoing call records showed that no calls had been made to the complainants, which meant that the numbers had been spoofed. Spoofing is a process which involves the masking of the number of the caller’s phone with a number of his choice, to cheat people. The investigators say there were left stunned with their findings. The calls were made from Rohini Jail and the man making the calls was none other than Chandrasekhar. Bits of a puzzle Going by the charges against him, Chandrasekhar played many roles to run his extortion business — sometimes a government officer, at other times a businessman and, pushing the envelope more, even a politician’s grandson. His victims were carefully chosen. They were businessmen, senior politicians and film personalities, many of whom were entangled in cases of large-scale cheating, fraud and corruption. Chandrasekhar, smooth-talking and persuasive, who knew the art of deception well, would promise to provide a solution to their problems for a price. During the investigation, the police later identified two jail staff — an Assistant Jail Superintendent and a Deputy Superintendent — who admitted to the police that they had assisted Chandrasekhar. With admissions tumbling out, two dozen jail officials have now been transferred. Simultaneously, the Enforcement Directorate is conducting a money-laundering probe to identify all the assets generated through the proceeds of alleged crimes currently under investigation. The scale of extortion is yet to be established. The probe agencies are looking into all the instances where those facing legal cases had received calls offering a way out in exchange for huge sums of cash. The source of these calls remained elusive for long as those conned did not dare open their mouths. Some cases of impersonation were earlier lodged with various police departments across the country, but they were pursued separately. The probe officers concluded that the calls were being made through a number-spoofing App to camouflage the real phone ID. First developed in 2004 in the United States, this technology is often employed to deceive the receiver into believing that the call has originated from some other phone line. The officials shared this information with the police, which launched its own investigation. The Special Cell of the Delhi Police got its first breakthrough when it received a complaint from Aditi Singh, the wife of former Fortis promoter Shivinder Singh, who was arrested along with his brother Malvinder Singh by Delhi’s Economic Offences Wing in a case in 2019. Aditi Singh alleged that she had been duped by a person who had first called her in June 2020. Posing as a senior Law Ministry official, this person, she said, offered to help her husband get some relief. It is alleged that Malvinder Singh’s wife too was made a similar offer. Based on the complaint, last month a trap was laid for the conduits who were to receive more cash from the complainant. What ensued was a dramatic chase by multiple teams. Pradeep Ramdanee and Deepak Ramnani, small-time operators, were detained. They claimed that they had been collecting money at the behest of Chandrasekhar, lodged in Rohini Jail. Investigators allege that Rs. 200 crore changed hands through several middlemen. Next there were searches inside the jail premises. The police found two mobile phones and sent them for forensic examination. Investigators say Chandrasekhar had been leading a comfortable life in prison. The detection, coupled with other irregularities, prompted jail authorities to examine the rotten apples in their midst and fix responsibility of those involved in arranging the devices for the accused. The Economic Offences Wing subsequently registered another case and arrested three more persons — the bank manager of RBL, Komal Poddar, and his two associates — Avinash Kumar and Jitender Narula — apart from Chandrasekhar. The role of ‘hawala’ operators in the transfer of funds also came to the fore. A lavish lifestyle The Enforcement Directorate also initiated a probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, on the basis of the police case and searched multiple locations linked to Chandrasekhar, his associates, and wife Leena Maria Paul, an actress in the Malayalam film industry, who had starred in the critically acclaimed film Madras Café . The agency also identified a ‘benami’ sea-facing bungalow in Chennai. When the Enforcement Directorate sleuths reached the spot, they found a fleet of luxury vehicles of top brands like Rolls-Royce Ghost, Bentley Bentayga, Ferrari 458 Italia, Lamborghini Urus, Escalade and Mercedes-AMG 63 parked there. The search team entered the building, which was being maintained by caretakers. In the words of an official, the bungalow revealed the extravagant lifestyle of its residents. He described sleek Italian marble floors, Versace rugs, expensive furniture, chandeliers, gym equipment, a home theatre and gold-plated items. On the second floor was a spacious bar. They also found a large number of shoes, bags and branded clothes bearing labels such as Ferragamo, Chanel, Dior and Louis Vuitton. The initial search resulted in the seizure of 16 high-end vehicles, including a luxury bus, apart from the bungalow. Going through past reports, investigators found that Chandrasekhar had a penchant for high-end vehicles since his school days. In Bengaluru, he would roam around in cars fitted with a red beacon and often dropped names to get his job done. The agency has tracked down seven more vehicles that were parked at other places. The seized vehicles bore registration plates of different States. Their details will be gathered by the agency from the transport authorities. While the current value of the seized assets is being assessed, the Enforcement Directorate is also looking into the revenue records of the bungalow to determine its ownership history. Daredevilry with no limits Chandrasekhar, a school dropout, hails from Bengaluru, Karnataka. His father, who passed away last year, worked as a part-time mechanic and rubber contractor. Chandrasekhar flirted with the law when he turned 17. He posed as the son of a former Chief Minister of Karnataka and allegedly duped an old man of Rs. 1 crore. Elated with that success and many subsequent ones, he slowly transitioned into a high-profile ‘conman’. If he donned the role of a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer in one case, he would impersonate the grandson of a Chief Minister in another. Not only was Chandrasekhar audacious, he also possessed skills that helped him. He spoke multiple languages and soon acquired expertise in spoofing. This was crucial to his operations. His daredevilry knew no limits: he would spoof offices of Central law enforcement agencies headquartered in Delhi and senior officers in ministries, the police say. While the accused remained the mastermind, his associates arranged logistics for him. They would create the network for him to make calls and fix deals, say investigators. His associates would often pose as officials from investigating agencies and offer to help those facing legal action. Sometimes, they would demand that the victims pay up for not getting arrested. When the deals were struck, the call to finalise the arrangement would come from Chandrasekhar, the ‘officer’ heading the probe or helming the agency. The number displayed would ostensibly be of the real office or officer as reflected in Truecaller or other modes of verification. The cycle of arrests and bail After he was arrested for the first time in 2007 and subsequently granted bail, it is suspected that Chandrasekhar shifted base from Bengaluru to Chennai. It was sometime in 2009-10 that he contacted Leena via Facebook, identifying himself as Balaji, a man with deep pockets, from the Tamil film industry. He said he could get her acting assignments. Born and brought up in Dubai, Leena had come to Bengaluru to pursue a dental science course. She also aspired to become a film actress. Leena was to discover his real identity much later. Chandrasekhar was again arrested in 2009. He came out on bail, but was arrested yet again in 2011. He came out on bail that time too. In May 2013, a joint team of the Delhi and Chennai Police arrested Leena from a farmhouse in South Delhi for allegedly cheating the Canara Bank of Rs. 19 crore. Chandrasekhar managed to escape, but was nabbed weeks later in Kolkata. Based on that case, the Enforcement Directorate had attached 20 bank accounts with a cumulative balance of over Rs. 13 crore, cars worth Rs. 7 crore, 80 watches and jewellery. After Chandrasekhar’s arrest in the Dhinakaran case in 2017, the police seized Rs. 1.30 crore in cash. They also seized a fake card showing him as a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament, an Indian Youth Congress identity card, and a Mercedes car bearing a sticker of Member of Parliament. He had used all these to trap his victims. “It is the immense belief that one can wriggle out of even the worst possible situations that drives a conman to go to any length. Given the nature of allegations, it also holds true for Chandrasekhar. He is said to be a master at mimicking anyone’s voice. He also understands mobile technology well,” says an investigating officer. The officer says there are dozens of cases against him in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Delhi. Facing multiple charges The frequency with which Chandrasekhar allegedly indulged in cheating and fraud was reflected in the submissions made by a public prosecutor before a Delhi lower court in May 2019, while opposing his bail application. It was submitted that three new First Information Reports had been instituted against him while he was in his custody in the Dhinakaran case. In one case, he allegedly used the phone of a constable to influence a judge in order to get out on bail by impersonating a Supreme Court judge. In another, he allegedly posed as the private secretary to the Union Law Minister and contacted an Additional District Judge in Mumbai to seek favour in a case. In the third, he was accused of bribing and managing the police escorting staff while he was taken to Bengaluru, Coimbatore and Mumbai, before being produced in front of the courts. The Enforcement Directorate is also verifying whether a former Rajya Sabha MP and another high-profile accused arrested by the agency in separate cases were also cheated of Rs. 25 crore and Rs. 11 crore by Chandrasekhar while he was in Rohini Jail. Chandrasekhar also faces the allegation of cheating about 500 people in Mumbai through a Ponzi scam. He was arrested in the case, along with Leena, in 2015. On the pretext of ill-health, he later got himself admitted to a hospital from where he allegedly attempted to stop a property auction by making a phone call posing as a government official. The Mumbai Police again arrested him in May 2016. Chandrasekhar’s role again came up in a case registered by the Hyderabad wing of the CBI on January 16, 2020. Former Telugu Desam Party MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao, director and promoter of Transtroy (India) Limited, who was earlier booked by the CBI in a bank fraud case involving Rs. 7,926 crore, alleged that he had received calls from a person claiming to be a senior CBI official. He was threatened with dire consequences if he did not pay up. The man demanded Rs. 100 crore to bail him out of the case. However, the former MP sensed foul play and lodged a complaint with the CBI. According to the FIR, on January 3, 2020, a landline installed at the CBI head office in Delhi was spoofed by the imposters and multiple calls were made to Rao on his mobile phones. Two accused — Manivardhan Reddy Yala and Ramaraj — were initially named in the case for collecting money from different people in the name of senior Central government functionaries by promising favourable actions, the FIR said. All the cases instituted against Chandrasekhar are either under investigation or pending trial. While the police are trying to identify his other associates, the Enforcement Directorate is examining various persons linked to the case. The witness statement of Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez, who was also reportedly contacted by him from inside prison, was recently recorded by the agency. As people spoke up, the investigators were able to piece together an extraordinary story of extortion. In the Dhinakaran case, Chandrasekhar has pleaded not guilty of any of the allegations made by the police, which filed a charge sheet before the trial court on July 14, 2017. In November 2018, the court ordered the framing of charges against him and others under the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Further proceedings are under way. Following his arrest in 2017, the accused has spent most of his time in Tihar Jail and later Rohini Jail. Chandrasekhar has a battery of high-profile lawyers arguing his case. With court permission, he has come out on bail or parole a couple of times. In June this year, the Delhi High Court granted two weeks of interim custody bail on the ground that his mother was seriously ill and required hospitalisation and surgery in Chennai. The bail was then extended till July 2. In November last year, the Supreme Court granted him interim bail for two weeks so that he could attend the last rites of his father. The court also directed that Chandrasekhar be escorted by a cop, the expenses for which were to be borne by him. He was earlier allowed to meet his father, who had then been suffering from leukaemia. During that period, he contracted COVID-19 and the bail duration was extended. On being discharged from a Chennai hospital, he was back in Rohini Jail. He is also apparently back in business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/duper-fleecer-jailbird/article36283660.ece
04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Certainly not the end of the road for the U.S.||The future of Afghanistan is yet to be determined, but the debate has abruptly shifted to the future of the United States after its withdrawal from Afghanistan. This may be the first time in history that a ruler is sought to be punished for ending a war of 20 years. “Pax Americana died in Kabul,” a strategic thinker declares. This is a watershed moment that will bring down the curtain on the West’s long ascendency, he predicts. Others say that the damage can be limited if U.S. President Joe Biden resigns. Some U.S. Congressmen have submitted a questionnaire to Mr. Biden raising such issues as the Taliban acquiring nuclear weapons. Mercifully, there is no significant opinion that the U.S. should not have withdrawn its troops or that the U.S. should reoccupy Afghanistan. “The U.S. has done the right thing in the wrong way,” says another learned commentator. Defining event To understand the present plight of the U.S., we need to go back to the terrorist bombing of 9/11, which was a game-changing global experience. It transformed the geopolitics of the world, which was determined by the size of the nuclear arsenals of the nuclear weapon states. The most powerful country in the world, which had the capacity to destroy the world many times over, became powerless before a few terrorists, who had only knives and forks as weapons. In one clean swoop, the theories of the balance of power, mutually assured destruction and nuclear weapons superiority went up in smoke with the Twin Towers of New York. Once the responsibility of the attack was traced to Osama bin Laden and the terrorists in Afghanistan, it was imperative for the U.S. to retaliate by overthrowing the Taliban regime and hunting out and killing bin Laden. Benefits of the U.S. presence The U.S. accomplished its mission within a short period but it was not able to withdraw because the Afghanistan government was unable to withstand the onslaught of the Taliban and other terrorist groups. Even neighbouring countries, including India, were strongly in favour of continuing the American presence. Pakistan played a double game — of being a partner on the one hand and an adversary on the other. It was not a matter of the Americans imposing themselves, but being invited to provide a certain stability for Afghanistan. The result of their presence was the prevalence of relative peace in the region except that Pakistan fattened the Taliban with American largesse. In the process, the troops in Afghanistan protected the homeland and the Americans, because the Taliban and other groups were kept engaged in Afghanistan territory. At this moment, when American failures at the time of withdrawal dominate the news, it is worth recalling that the U.S. presence in Afghanistan had succeeded in containing the dangers of terrorism for two decades. Considering that terrorism has endured in the broader West Asia/Middle East and the attacks and victims worldwide are three to five times higher annually than in 2001 (9/11), the benefits of the American presence should not be underestimated, even though the cost was high in terms of American money and lives. We should also remember that the clear mandate given to Mr. Biden was to clean up the Augean stables left behind by his predecessor, President Donald Trump, and how the world as a whole and a majority of the U.S. citizens heaved a sigh of relief that the U.S. finally had a predictable, steady and experienced leader to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic and racism in the country and to recover its position in the centre of the world that the Chinese were hoping to grab. Mr. Biden moved in earnest to return to the Paris Agreement (climate), resume the dialogue on the Iran nuclear deal and to reassure America’s traditional allies that the U.S. would stand by them. He gave a clear signal to China and Russia that no confrontation would be tolerated, but cooperation, wherever possible, will be pursued. The Afghan exit Withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan was yet another unfinished agenda he had inherited and what he did was merely to follow up the agreement reached with the Taliban and announce a deadline, in the expectation that the Afghan forces trained and equipped by the Americans and the Kabul government would step into the vacuum. As Mr. Biden pointed out, the decision about Afghanistan was not just about Afghanistan. It was about “ending an era of major military operations to remake other countries”. But the series of events that happened till the end of August 2021 completely wiped out what should have been the good ending of a partly successful war on terror. Even if the exit became a disaster because of the wrong calculations on the part of the military advisers — who stand condemned by the retired flag officers for the tragic and avoidable debacle — to declare it as the end of the road for Mr. Biden and the United States is unfair and graceless. History is replete with events of extreme folly by rulers who survived because of the many other mitigating factors in their favour. By those standards, the Biden presidency has every reason to survive. The decisiveness with which he has handled the debris of the exit should receive approbation. As a true Commander-in-Chief, he stood by his Generals and took the blame. He has not even been provoked to attack the Taliban or to criticise the Afghan forces for their betrayal of their patrons. In fact, he went out of his way to announce that the Taliban was helpful in facilitating the evacuation, which was completed before the deadline, Interestingly, it was Mr. Biden who set the August 31 deadline, which was turned into an ultimatum by the Taliban. Many commentators have argued that the Kabul fiasco was worse than Vietnam, Tehran, 9/11, Iraq and COVID-19 because the details of the other disastrous developments had lost their sharpness with the passage of time. Whatever may have been the horrors of those events, no President was held accountable for them and removed. In the case of U.S. President Gerald Ford, 59% of the people said that he deserved none of the blame at all. Only 2% held him responsible, though he lost the elections in 1976. President Ronald Reagan’s misadventure in Lebanon was criticised by 60% Americans in 1984, but he won the election later that year. There were reasons for these Presidents to continue to serve the nation, taking the reverses in certain areas in their stride. As of now, there is no alternative to President Biden to lead the country, after his having learnt a bitter lesson from the Afghan experience. A CNN commentator remarked that the withdrawal may hurt him in the midterm in 2022 and presidential election in 2024. “They could just as easily have no impact at all.” No setting sun Even more unfortunate is the conclusion that the U.S. itself lost its place in the world on account of its failure to have a sagacious leader or a competent Commander-in -Chief. A superpower does not sink or rise on account of a single leader. It is still the most powerful economic and military power around which the whole constellation of the world rotates. In fact, the world has a stake in ensuring that a democratic nation leads the world rather than an expansionist dictatorship which has no public opinion to restrain it. The free world has a responsibility to maintain the American leadership of the world till a wiser and more benign alternative is found. Much has been written about a post-American world for some years now. But it looks that the demise of America, as Mark Twain said about the reports of his own death, is greatly exaggerated. T.P.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Estimating the deaths due to COVID-19 in Chennai||India is slowly recovering from the second wave of SARS-CoV-2. It is still uncertain whether a third wave will happen, and if so, with what intensity. Assessing how many people actually died from COVID-19 can help governments and the health-care sector prepare their treatment strategies effectively.  When it comes to evaluating fatalities, the Indian Council of Medical Research has issued clear guidelines as to what constitutes a COVID-19 related death. Despite this, it is evident that there is an undercounting of deaths in India due to a variety of reasons. Even in rich countries, undercounting has been observed based on international analyses of “excess deaths”. This reflects the “real world” problems of acquiring perfect data during a public health crisis. Given that this is the case, there is no shame for either the Government of India or the State governments to admit that the reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 is much less than the actual numbers. To estimate the actual numbers is far more honourable given the magnitude of the crisis and the precision of planning required to overcome it. In this article, we concentrate on estimating COVID-19 fatalities in Chennai and to what extent the southern metropolis falls prey to “undercounting” COVID-19 deaths that plagues India, and the world, currently. This adds to the previously published articles in this newspaper. Estimation for Chennai To estimate the “excess deaths” during the period of the pandemic requires accurate baseline data of deaths in the previous years. For Chennai, we consider the available data on the daily total all cause deaths (ACD) during 2015-19 (the basic source is the Chennai Corporation –https://bit.ly/3yFzEb2). During this period the ACD steadily increased by about 1,850 per year (3% per year). The projected population of Chennai also increased at roughly the same rate. Hence, our estimate of the expected total ACD, if the pandemic had not occurred, assumes that this steady increase in the ACD would have continued in 2020-21. We have only been able to extract the age-dependent ACD for 2018-19. Since the age dependence of the increasing trend cannot reliably be extracted from data that just spans two years, the simple average of ACD from 2018 to 2019 is used as the baseline for the age-stratified ACD. Examination of the ACD during the pandemic from January 2020 until June 2021, as compared to the baseline of ACD from 2015 to 2019, reveals two clear observations. First, there is reduction in mortality prior to the lockdown in the first wave and also during the intermediate period between the two waves ( Table 1 ). There could be many reasons for this. As of now, we have no reliable data to ascribe causes and the dip in mortality during these periods remains unexplained. Second, there is an increase in ACD during the first and second wave of reported deaths due to COVID-19 in Chennai. The pandemic and ACD Broadly, when the reported mortality due to COVID-19 was low, there was a reduction in ACD, and the converse when it was high. It is reasonable to conclude based on this data, that the pandemic had two opposing effects on the ACD. On the one hand, the ACD increased due to those who died due COVID-19. On the other, it also decreased due to the deaths due to other causes (OCD) reducing due to lockdown effects. At the moment the reasons for this duality are not clear. The only way this issue can be resolved is by conducting a verbal autopsy with the families of the deceased. This has not been performed systematically in Chennai. In the absence of this confirmed data, the under-counting factors are defined to be (excess deaths)/(reported COVID-19 deaths). The results on the approximate undercounting factor for Chennai, defined above during the different periods of the pandemic, are shown ( Figure and Table 1 ). These undercounting factors are probably underestimates. This is because our estimated number of deaths during the pandemic period inferred from the pre-pandemic data on ACD does not account for the probable reduction in OCD due to the lockdown effects. It is clear that the undercounting of the deaths was much more in the second wave as compared to the first one. The age dependence of excess deaths and undercounting ratio are shown ( Figure ). The ACD in the “juveniles” (0-17 years) and “young adults” (18-44 years) are reduced throughout the pandemic period (deficit deaths) except for the young adults during the second wave. The undercounting ratio in the first wave increases with age but the trend is not discernible during the second wave. Among the elderly It has also been reported that the mortality rate due to COVID-19 among the elderly was significantly less than that of the international data. However, this analysis of data from Chennai indicates that, this may simply be a consequence of the fact that the undercounting factor of the deceased among the elderly is much more than that of the younger age group during the first wave. The reasons for this undercounting are not clear just now. This will only be known after a thorough examination of the causes of death in the future. However, it is important to acknowledge that there has been an undercounting that requires detailed quantitative analysis. Understanding the severity of this viral infection is important to devise effective policy for the immediate future. T.S.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||An uneven uptick||With gross revenues of Rs. 1.12-lakh crore in August, the GST has now yielded over Rs. 1-lakh crore a month for almost a full year. The only blip in the past 11 months came in June, when takings fell below Rs. 93,000 crore in the aftermath of the second COVID-19 wave that compelled mobility restrictions across States. Those curbs have been progressively easing up — just as they were a year ago when the country saw a phased unlocking from the national lockdown. Compared to those lows, the August collections are 30% higher and also 14% above the pre-pandemic levels of 2019-20, though one must remember India’s growth had stuttered sharply that year. While revenues from domestic transactions were up 27%, key industrial States saw faster growth, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Going forward, the Government expects such ‘robust’ GST revenues to persist. Most economists agree that may be the case, unless the fears of a third wave come true, triggering lockdowns. But it is unclear if the economy is recovering ‘fast’ in tandem with the easing out of COVID-related restrictions. The GST collected in August pertains largely to economic activity in July and the mobility restrictions in most States had been eased further that month compared to June, including in the southern States. GST e-way bills generated in July surged to an average of 2.1 million from 1.8 million in June. Yet, on a sequential basis, GST revenues in August are almost 4% lower than the Rs. 1.16-lakh crore collected in July. This recovery appears choppy rather than ‘fast’. Similarly, the Government’s claims of higher compliance levels reiterated over the past several months need to be matched with accompanying numbers. At the start of the GST regime four years ago, it had 6.6 million taxpayers. On GST Day this July, the Finance Minister said this had risen to 12.8 million. But how many of them are filing returns each month is no longer known since the Government stopped disclosing that number from February 2021. This makes it virtually impossible to distil the effects of compliance and growth on GST revenues. Deviating from standard data points spikes suspicions about what they strive to hide. The Government would do well to restore and enhance its quality of data disclosures — even State-wise revenues have been selectively shared recently. As the Reserve Bank of India Governor has highlighted, the economy is still delicately poised — manufacturing recovery has stumbled in August, services remain stressed, exports stay strong but have slipped on a month-on-month basis just like GST collections.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Ending the forever||President Joe Biden has mounted a stiff defence of his position on pulling American troops and civilians out of Kabul, an operation widely regarded as botched and disastrous, vowing that the era of meddling in the politics of other nations had ended. His comments came in the context of sharp criticism of an evidently poorly planned exit, coterminous with deadly terror attacks near Kabul airport. Since the withdrawal, U.S. polls suggest that nearly twice as many people disapproved of his management of the end of the long war as those who approved, that 56% of surveyed individuals disapproved of his performance on foreign policy, and his overall job approval rating had hit a new low of 44%. When the poll statistic of 71% of Americans believing that the U.S. mission in Afghanistan was a failure is taken together with Mr. Biden’s promise to eschew the regime change paradigm in foreign policy, it begs the question of whether such a new era of U.S. non-interventionism is possible or likely. The answer depends on the extent to which the U.S. believes it can manage the forces of international terrorism from afar, sans boots on the ground. That also partly depends on the strategic role of Pakistan, China, and Russia in the South Asia region. Neither sets of factors inspires hope that the messy troop pull-out was anything other than one step in another round of the classic historical cycles in Afghanistan, of foreign occupation, ‘regime change,’ abandonment and lapse into lawlessness, orthodoxy, and flirtations with terror outfits in the neighbourhood. The U.S. has a rich history of shaping or toppling foreign governments and seeking to influence forces made abroad that had an impact on American shores. In the early 20th century, the centre of gravity of such clandestine operations was in the North American hemisphere, and it included the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama. In the post-Second World War and post-Cold War periods, it included the likes of Iran, Indonesia, and Venezuela, including alleged interference in the elections of Italy, the Philippines and Japan. With a foreign policy elite and intelligence community deeply inured to habitually meddling in the politics of other nations for at least a century, the odds that Mr. Biden will be the leader to turn their heads from this preoccupation are low. It is true that ever since the advent of his predecessor, Donald Trump, the U.S. has been on an inexorable path towards a more inward-focused paradigm of policymaking, putting “America First” and reconsidering if not rejecting certain elements of the rules-based international order. But in America, historically, the clarion call for nativist populism has always coexisted to an extent with the temptation to meddle abroad. The impulses of the Biden administration may, therefore, only lead to a temporary lull in this disturbing trend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ending-the-forever/article36283648.ece
04 September 2021||New Delhi,||PMI signals fastest rebound in services activity in 18 months||India’s services sector expanded in August at the fastest pace in one-and-a-half years amid strong inflows of new work and improved demand conditions, a monthly survey showed on Friday. The seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index rose from 45.4 in July to 56.7 in August, as the reopening of several establishments and increased consumer footfall boosted sales. The services sector witnessed the first expansion in output in four months and a rebound in business confidence. In Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below 50 denotes contraction. “The Indian service sector bounced back in August, led by the reopening of several establishments and improved client confidence due to growing vaccine coverage,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. New orders placed with service providers rose in August, ending a three-month sequence of reduction. Moreover, the pace of expansion of orders was the quickest in more than eight-and-a-half years. However, firms saw a further decline in new export orders. The downturn was often associated with the pandemic and travel restrictions. “Service providers foresee a brighter outlook, with firms indicating that the economic recovery could be sustained if restrictions continue to be lifted and further waves of contamination can be avoided,” Ms. De Lima added. Still, service providers again cut headcounts in August, though the rate of job shedding was marginal and the weakest since January.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pmi-signals-fastest-rebound-in-services-activity-in-18-months/article36283637.ece

Terming the allegations “an attempt to malign the company” that would be met with the strongest legal action, a spokesman for the airline said, “SpiceJet... continues to maintain the highest standards of safety in operations with no compromise on quality.” Separately, Press Trust of India reported that a section of SpieceJet employees had gone on strike at the Delhi airport on Friday morning over issues related to reduced salaries and their irregular disbursement. They had resumed work later, an airline spokesperson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/spicejet-rejects-ex-pilots-claims-defends-safety-record/article36283626.ece

04 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||BSNL sea cable tender favours one player: TEPC||The Telecom Equipment and Services Export Promotion Council (TEPC) has alleged that BSNL floated a tender to lay submarine fibre cable between Kochi and Lakshadweep Islands with guidelines that restricted the participation to just one firm. In a letter to the Prime Minister’s Office, the TEPC said “restrictive eligibility conditions” of the tender allowed only NEC India to bid. “By adding Repeatered section, which is only 15% of the project length, the purchaser has ensured that only three multinational companies could bid,” the letter dated August 31 said, adding these three work in their own regions with NEC working in Asia. The Empowered Technology Group had raised objections to the ‘Repeatered segment’ while consultant TCIL had pitched for repeaterless systems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/bsnl-sea-cable-tender-favours-one-player-tepc/article36283631.ece

04 September 2021||New Delhi,||RIL targets 100 GW from renewables by 2030||Reliance Industries will create or enable capacity to generate at least 100 gigawatts of electricity by 2030 from renewable sources, which can be converted into carbon-free green hydrogen, its chairman Mukesh Ambani said Friday as he outlined a ‘1-1-1 vision’ to bring down the cost of hydrogen to under $1 for one kg in one decade. The focus on generating electricity from renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind will help cut carbon emissions in the world’s third-largest greenhouse gas emitter. The same electricity, when converted into green hydrogen, can replace petrol and diesel in automobiles and other fuels in the industry, helping cut down on the use of fossil fuels, carbon emissions and reduce import dependence. ‘Initial target is $2’ Speaking at the International Climate Summit 2021, Mr. Ambani said Reliance would pursue the target of bringing down the cost of making green hydrogen to under $2 per kg initially and ultimately to bring it down to under $1 per kg in a decade. Currently, green hydrogen produced with renewable resources costs between $3 per kg and $6.55 a kg.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ril-targets-100-gw-from-renewables-by-2030/article36283638.ece

04 September 2021||Hyderabad,||Manu sizzles, goes five shots clear||Gurugram’s Manu Gandas came with a brilliant 10-under 58 to build a substantial five-shot lead at 17-under 122 in the second round of the Vooty & Haldi-sponsored Golconda Masters Telangana Open golf championship here on Friday. Noida’s Amardeep Malik was in second place at a total of 12-under 127 following his second round of seven-under 61. Playing his first event at the HGA since turning pro, Kartik Sharma, the 21-year-old rookie from Gurugram, came up with a splendid, error-free nine-under 59 to be placed tied third with a total of 10-under 129 along with Chandigarh’s Yuvraj Singh Sandhu, who shot a six-under 62 on Friday.  Heavy overnight rain resulted in a delayed start by one hour and also waterlogging on a couple of fairways at the HGA. As a result, hole no. 6 was reduced from par-5 to par-3 and hole no. 18 was reduced from par-4 to par-3. Therefore, the par for the course in round two was 68 instead of the regular 71. The cut was applied at even-par 139. Fifty professionals and two amateurs made the cut. Gandas (64, 58), the joint leader in round one, had five birdies and two bogeys on the front-nine. Gandas, still looking for his maiden title, was on fire on the back-nine with seven birdies which included some exceptional chip-putts, a great recovery from the bunker on the 17th and a 25-feet conversion on the 18th. The 25-year-old ended the day in style with birdies on his last five holes. Malik (66, 61) made his way up from overnight tied fourth to second place after a round punctuated by an eagle, six birdies and two bogeys. Malik made a sensational chip-in from the rough for an eagle-two on the 14th. Bengaluru-based Chikkarangappa, the 2019 champion, was tied fifth at nine-under 130 along with Mysuru’s Yashas Chandra. PGTI Order of Merit leader Karandeep Kochhar of Chandigarh was seventh at eight-under 131. Olympian and defending champion Udayan Mane missed the cut as he tallied three-over 142 for two rounds to be placed tied 68th.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/manu-sizzles-goes-five-shots-clear/article36283640.ece
04 September 2021||FLORENCE,||Not the ideal homecoming for Italy||Italy came back down to earth in its first game as European champion. Less than two months after winning the Euro at Wembley, it was held to a 1-1 draw in Group C by Bulgaria in a World Cup Qualifier on Thursday. That ended Italy’s perfect start to the qualifying campaign but nevertheless matched Spain’s record run of 35 matches unbeaten, set between 2007 and 2009. Spain lost 1-2 away to Sweden to drop to second place in Group B, while England and Belgium earned big wins to consolidate their lead at the top of their groups. Federico Chiesa gave Italy the lead after a dominant start but the Azzurri conceded their first goal in the qualifiers when Atanas Iliev levelled at the end of the first-half. Some great stops by Bulgaria goalkeeper Georgi Georgiev prevented Italy from restoring its lead. Only the group winners directly qualify. Second-place finishers face a playoff. Carlos Soler scored five minutes into his debut for Spain, but Aleksander Isak levelled seconds later. Viktor Claesson put Sweden ahead for good in the 57th. Only some desperate defending by Spain denied Isak a chance to add another goal on the counter-attack. Sweden has a perfect nine points from three games, while Spain fell to second with seven from four games. Kosovo moved to third after beating Georgia 1-0 while Lithuania is at the bottom. Lukaku’s double In Group E, Romelu Lukaku scored twice as top-ranked Belgium came from a goal deficit to beat Estonia 5-2 and stay on top. Estonia midfielder Mattias Kait put the host ahead in the second minute but the heavily favoured Red Devils were quick to turn things around. With 10 points from four games, Belgium retained a three-point lead in the group ahead of the Czech Republic, which defeated Belarus 1-0. England weathered a hostile atmosphere to beat Hungary 4-0 in Group I . Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane and Harry Maguire scored in a 14-minute flurry and Declan Rice added a second-half goal as England secured a fourth straight win in the group to extend its lead to five points. Poland is second after beating Albania 4-1 while Andorra earned its first win by beating fellow minnow San Marino 2-0 at home. Germany in second In Group J, Germany downed Liechtenstein 2-0 to move into second, a point behind surprise leader Armenia. Goals in each half from Timo Werner and Leroy Sané helped Germany to a labored win in its first match under new coach Hansi Flick. Armenia dropped its first points of the campaign with a 0-0 draw against North Macedonia, which remained third. It is three points behind Armenia and a point above Romania after it won 2-0 in Iceland.  The results: EUROPE: Group A: Niger 0 lost to Burkina Faso 2 (L. Traore 76-pen, Konate 79); Algeria 8 (Slimani 5, 25-pen, 46, 53, Bensebaini 26, Bounedjah 40-pen, Mahrez 67, Zerrouki 69) bt Djibouti 0.

04 September 2021||TOKYO,||Praveen Kumar jumps to silver||High jumper Praveen Kumar knocked off an Asian record for his silver, shooter Avani Lekhara scripted history again, and Harvinder Singh became India’s first archer to finish on podium as the country’s Paralympians raised the bar higher with unparalleled performances at the Games here on Friday. India’s overall medals tally rose to 13 (including two gold, six silver and five bronze) as the country’s best ever Paralympics continued to get better. Memorable debut It all started with Praveen’s silver in the morning. The 18-year-old, competing in his debut Games, clinched the medal in the T64 high jump, setting a new Asian record with a personal best effort of 2.07m effort to finish behind Great Britain’s Jonathan Broom-Edwards, who cleared 2.10m. T64 classification is for athletes with a leg amputation, who compete with prosthetics in a standing position. T44, the disability classification that Praveen belongs to, is for athletes with a leg deficiency, leg length difference, impaired muscle power or impaired passive range of movement in the legs. His impairment, which is congenital, affects the bones that connect his hip to his left leg. Then came Avani to script history for the second time. The 19-year-old claimed the 50m Rifle 3 Position SH1 bronze to add to the gold she had secured earlier. In a fiercely contested final, Avani totalled 445.9 to finish behind China’s Zhang Cuiping (457.9) and Gemany’s Natascha Hiltrop (457.1).  Prior to her, Joginder Singh Sodhi was the lone Indian to win multiple medals in the same edition of the Games when he won one silver (shot put) and two bronze (discus and javelin) medals in the 1984 Paralympics. Late in the day, Harvinder etched his name in the history books with a gritty performance. Harvinder collected three shoot-off wins with the last coming against Korean Kim Min Su in the bronze play-off. Harvinder pipped Kim 6-5 (26-24, 27-29, 28-25, 25-25, 26-27) with a 10-8 win in the shoot-off. In the semifinals, Harvinder had lost to USA’s Kevin Mather 6-4 (25-28, 24-24, 25-25, 25-24, 24-26). The Indian had started by edging out Italian Stefano Travisani 6-5 (10-7 shoot-off) before pipping former World No. 1 Bato Tsydendorzhiev 6-5 (8-7). In the quarters, he swept aside Maik Szarszewski of Germany 6-2. In badminton, Pramod Bhagat and Palak Kohli qualified for mixed doubles semifinals, while three singles players —Suhas Yathiraj, Tarun Dhillon and Manoj Sarkar — also made the last-four stage. Swimmers Suyash Narayan Jadhav and Niranjan Mukundan failed to qualify for the men’s 50m butterfly event and the country also finished outside the medal bracket in women’s canoe, men’s shot put and women’s club throw.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/teenager-praveen-jumps-to-a-silver/article36283962.ece
04 September 2021||Zandvoort,||Leclerc, Sainz give Ferrari 1-2||Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz led one-two at the top of the practice timesheets after a stoppage-hit opening day at the first Dutch Formula One Grand Prix in 36 years on Friday. Red Bull’s home favourite and title contender Max Verstappen, with tens of thousands of orange-shirted fans packing the grandstands, was second in the morning session and then fifth in the afternoon. Mercedes’ seven-time World champion Lewis Hamilton, who is three points clear of his Dutch rival, was fastest in a red-flagged and disrupted opening session before his car broke down in the second.  Leclerc’s fastest lap of one minute 10.902 seconds was 0.154 quicker than Sainz, with Alpine’s Esteban Ocon third. Problem for Vettel More than 35 minutes of the opening hour at the seaside circuit were lost after Sebastian Vettel’s Mercedes-powered Aston Martin suffered a power unit failure and stopped, leaving a trail of oil. Vettel grabbed a fire extinguisher as smoke came from the back but the car appeared to remain electrically live and could not be removed until it was declared safe by a marshal in protective clothing. By the time the process was complete, only six minutes remained and a roar went up from the crowd as the cars returned to the track in a final rush. All three days have been sold out, with 70,000 spectators allowed to attend on each and nearly all supporting Verstappen or his team at an old-school track with some standout banked corners. The 23-year-old Dutch driver is by far the most successful in his country’s Formula One history, the youngest ever race winner and the first to challenge for the title. He is three points behind Hamilton after 12 races.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/leclerc-sainz-give-ferrari-1-2/article36284014.ece
04 September 2021||NEW YORK,||Muguruza overcomes Azarenka’s challenge||World No.1 Novak Djokovic moved five matches from completing the first men’s singles calendar-year Grand Slam in 52 years by advancing to the third round of the U.S. Open on Friday. The 34-year-old Serbian cruised past 121st-ranked Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 at Arthur Ashe Stadium to book a third-round date with 2014 runner-up Kei Nishikori of Japan. Motivated as ever “I’m as motivated as ever to do well,” Djokovic said. “I’m not the only player that wants to go deep in the tournament and put his hands on the trophy. “I’m trying to be my best every day and let’s see what happens.” More in the mind “Probably it’s more mental and emotional, really,” Djokovic said. “I don’t mind being on the court a long time. I feel I have more chances in a best-of-five. It’s more about handling everything that’s happening off the court, all the expectations.” A fourth US Open crown would bring Djokovic his 21st career Grand Slam crown, giving him the men’s all-time record, one more than the mark he now shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, both absent with injuries. Djokovic has a 17-2 career record against Nishikori, who last beat the Serbian star in the 2014 U.S. Open semifinals. Since then, Djokovic has won 16 in a row, most recently in the Tokyo Olympic quarterfinals. Low attendance Attendance was off as New York struggled to recover from a deadly storm and flash flooding. High water that flooded US Open plazas had drained away and wind-scattered furniture was replaced for Thursday. Swamped Louis Armstrong Stadium hosted Thursday morning practice. Fewer spectators than normal saw Tokyo Olympic champion Alexander Zverev and top-ranked Ashleigh Barty roll into the third round. Australian Barty dispatched Danish teen Clara Tauson 6-1, 7-5 while German fourth seed Zverev ripped 33rd-ranked Spanish left-hander Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-1, 6-0, 6-3. “It's great that I'm through in three sets and just over an hour,” Zverev said. “I will need that energy. I'll need that power I have for further matches. I'm happy I only lost four games.” German Oscar Otte, ranked 144th, became the fifth men’s qualifier to reach the third round by defeating 92nd-ranked American Denis Kudla 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. There haven’t been so many qualifiers so deep at any Slam since six at the 2011 French Open and not at the U.S. Open since five made it in 1984.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-stays-on-course-for-calendar-slam-barty-cruises-into-the-third-round/article36283966.ece
04 September 2021||LONDON,||Pope and Woakes return in style, give England 99-run lead||Ollie Pope and Chris Woakes both scored valuable half-centuries on their return to Test cricket as England recovered from a top-order collapse to build a 99-run lead over India at The Oval on Friday. Pope made 81 on his Surrey home ground and all-rounder Woakes 50 as the hosts were dismissed for 290 in reply to India’s first-innings 191 on the second day of the fourth Test. The visitors held firm to reach 43 for no loss in their second innings at stumps, still trailing by 56. Rohit Sharma was unbeaten on 20 and K.L. Rahul on 22. England was struggling at 62 for five earlier in the day after paceman Umesh Yadav, playing his first Test in nearly a year, removed Craig Overton and Dawid Malan quickly. Umesh needed just 10 balls to remove nightwatchman Overton for his overnight score of one, a flashing square-cut caught by India captain Virat Kohli at first slip. Malan, fresh from his 70 on England recall in an innings win at Headingley last week, had added just five when the left-hander, squared up by Umesh, was well caught by a diving Rohit Sharma at second slip. But Pope revived the innings as he shared partnerships of 89 and 71 with Jonny Bairstow (37) and Moeen Ali (35). After a cautious start, Pope hit three fours in four balls off Thakur — a classic on-drive followed by a clip through mid-on before a short delivery was pulled through midwicket. Counterattack Runs started to flow as Bairstow, too, counterattacked from the other end. Kohli brought on left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja in a bid to break the partnership. It was Mohammed Siraj, however, who reduced England to 151 to six when Bairstow was lbw playing down the wrong line to a ball that nipped back off the pitch. But Pope leg-glanced the paceman for four to complete a 92-ball fifty — the 23-year-old’s sixth in a 20-Test career that has yielded a lone century. It was Pope's first half-century in 16 Test innings after his 62 against Pakistan in Manchester last year. The knock also extended his excellent record at The Oval where, prior to Friday, he had scored 1,410 runs at an average of 100.71 in 18 First Class innings. Moeen, on 14, was struck on the toe by a Jasprit Bumrah yorker. But India, believing he had dug the ball out with his bat, did not appeal, with replays suggesting the all-rounder might have been lbw. The left-hander was in good touch before he gave his wicket away when he skied a catch to Rohit at cover off Jadeja. Woakes was unbeaten on 17 when No. 11 James Anderson walked to the crease, but the pair added 35 before he was run out. Anderson was unbeaten on one, the England great’s 100th not out in Test cricket.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pope-and-woakes-give-england-a-99-run-lead/article36283958.ece
04 September 2021||San Salvador,||El Salvador holds USA||The United States kicked off its road to World Cup redemption with a 0-0 draw against El Salvador on Thursday as the final round of CONCACAF 2022 World Cup Qualifiers got under way. The US, aiming to bounce back from the shock of failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, was frustrated for long periods by a battling El Salvador side and failed to make the most of a handful of chances that came its way. Bright start US coach Gregg Berhalter’s young side started brightly to carve out early chances for Borussia Dortmund’s Gio Reyna before Brenden Aaronson also saw a deflected effort go over the bar. Miles Robinson saw a golden chance go waste in the ninth minute when he met Reyna’s floated free kick in space but was unable to get a diving free header on target. El Salvador worked its way into the contest with some energetic pressing that knocked US out of its stride. Ronald Gomez came closest to scoring for the Salvadorans in the opening phase of the game, his header from Marvin Monterroza’s corner flying over the bar in the 16th minute. Three minutes later, the US surged forward again when Barcelona full-back Sergino Dest cut in from the left and unleashed a low shot which forced El Salvador goalkeeper Mario Gonzalez into a low save. That however was as good as it got in a mostly disappointing first-half, which despite some bright touches from Marseille’s Konrad De La Fuente and Norwich’s Josh Sargent, saw the US struggle to eke out more clearcut chances. Dramatic win for Mexico In other matches, host Mexico grabbed a dramatic 2-1 victory over Jamaica after Henry Martin’s 89th minute winner. Jamaica had looked to be heading for a battling point after Shamar Nicholson’s 65th-minute goal made it 1-1 following Alexis Vega’s 50th minute opener for El Tri. In Toronto, Canada came from behind to earn a point in a 1-1 draw with Honduras while Panama was held to a 0-0 draw by Costa Rica in Panama City.  The results:   Canada 1 (Larin 66-pen) drew with Honduras 1 (Rodriguez 40-pen); Panama 0 drew with Costa Rica 0; El Salvador 0 drew with USA 0; Mexico 2 (Vega 50, Martin 89) bt Jamaica 1 (Nicholson 65).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/el-salvador-holds-usa/article36284189.ece
04 September 2021||MUMBAI,||MCA apex council appoints review committee for award of contracts||The Emergent Meeting of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) apex council has taken cognisance of the objections raised by a group of council members for misuse of power by some office-bearers. The council also appointed a three-member sub-committee to review the process for awarding several contracts by the MCA. A group of eight apex council members had approached MCA president Vijay Patil, requesting an emergent meeting.  The meeting, which was held on August 20, was reconvened on Friday. The aggrieved members were asked to submit an explanatory note. Of the eight objections raised by the complainants, seven were admitted unanimously. The apex council then decided to appoint a three-member sub-committee, including MCA vice-president Amol Kale, along with councillors Ajinkya Naik and Kaushik Godbole for reviewing various contracts alleged to have been awarded without following due process. Meanwhile, secretary Sanjay Naik is understood to have contested charges of having violated the MCA constitution. The matter was put to vote and accepted on the basis of simple majority. As a result, executive secretary C.S. Naik is understood to have been instructed to carry out the secretary’s responsibilities. The fact that infighting among the apex council members has come into the open when the domestic season is about to commence doesn’t augur well for Mumbai cricket. The MCA club representatives have been hoping that it will not affect the return of tournaments which have been affected ever since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. The MCA has already been forced to postpone the Kanga League indefinitely.  Seven out of the eight objections were admitted unanimously Three-member sub-committee will look into the contracts issue||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mca-apex-council-appoints-review-committee-for-award-of-contracts/article36284460.ece

04 September 2021||Sao Paulo,||Argentina, Brazil post wins; Colombia draws||Leader Brazil and second-placed Argentina won their away matches in the South American football World Cup Qualifiers on Thursday ahead of their superclasico. Neither Lionel Messi nor Neymar had great performances for their teams. Brazil topped Chile 1-0 in Santiago in a tense match despite the absence of nine of its England-based players, including five starters, who were not released by their clubs due to COVID-19-related quarantine restrictions. Ribeiro on target The only goal of the match was scored by substitute Everton Ribeiro. Brazil now has 21 points with seven wins after seven matches. Chile is seventh with six points. Shortly before, Argentina downed Venezuela 3-1 in Caracas. Lautaro Martinez, Joaquin Correa and Angel Correa scored for the visitor. Jeferson Soteldo netted from the spot for the host seconds before the final whistle. Argentina is second with 15 points. Venezuela is at the bottom of the 10-team round robin with four points. This round of South American qualifiers has seen several England-based players not travel due to COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the British government to countries of the region. Argentina, though, did not lose any of the four it called in. The first four teams will automatically qualify to play in Qatar next year. The fifth-placed team will take part in an international playoff.   The results:   Bolivia 1 (Saucedo 83) drew with Colombia 1 (R. Martinez 69); Ecuador 2 (Torres 88, Estrada 90+5) bt Paraguay 0.   Venezuela 1 (Soteldo 90+4) lost to Argentina 3 (L. Martinez 45+2, J. Correa 71, A. Correa 74).

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Rajajinagar cricketers dreaming big||Last week, when Rajajinagar Cricketers won the KSCA (Group I) first division competition and took home the Sir Mirza Ismail Shield, it was the unlikeliest of champions. It had gained promotion into the top division just three years ago and had a relatively young and inexperienced team. But the side’s performances through the season belied its status as it won 10 out of 11 matches, including stunning wins over heavyweight outfits such as Swastic Union CC (1 & 2) and Social Cricketers. “No one had any expectations from us,” said skipper Nihal Ullal, 28. “Myself, Kranthi Kumar and H.S. Sharath were the only senior cricketers and many hadn’t played for even the State u-23 team. But we won 10 out of 11 games, a difficult record to beat. We fought through all situations and surprised a lot of big teams. Now everyone knows we are champions and we have to live up to it.” Team effort It was a fine team effort. Nihal, with 427 runs, was among four batsmen in the team who scored nearly 350 runs or more (S. Nithin 433, Kranthi Kumar 388 and Farhan Magi 347 the others). Paceman Nischith N. Rao was the tournament’s second-highest wicket-taker with 21 scalps and was closely followed by senior fast bowler Sharath with 20. Teenaged debutant off-spinner S. Bhargav chipped in with 17, including three four-wicket hauls, the most for any bowler. “Youngsters learnt very quickly and grabbed their chances well,” said Sharath, 28. “This is my maiden win at this level and the feeling is special. I came from a different team but mingling with the new bunch proved pretty easy. It was enjoyable and we had great fun.” Club secretary R. Kumar said that the side’s achievement was all the more noteworthy because of the prevailing circumstances, with COVID-19 disrupting schedules and practise routines. “Usually, we get a couple of months’ time to plan and prepare,” Kumar said. “But this time the team was split up and we asked them to practise wherever they could. We trained together for just ten days. Credit goes to the seniors and the youngsters showed the hunger to win.” The likes of Sharath, who played the last of his 28 First Class matches for Karnataka way back in 2015, Nihal, who was part of the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy squad two seasons ago but is yet to make his senior debut, and Kranthi Kumar, who played three T20 matches in 2015, are hoping that the triumph will get them closer to the senior State team.  “Every season I have hope,” said Sharath. “I do the hard work. But luck is something I have lacked. I have concentrated on my fitness, and improved. “This is my peak and I feel I have another four to five years of cricket left. I am confident this time.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rajajinagar-cricketers-dreaming-big/article36284023.ece
04 September 2021||MUMBAI,||Soumyadeep asked me to fix a match: Manika||Denying the charges levelled against her by the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) after refusing to let National coach Soumyadeep Roy advise her during her singles matches at the Tokyo Olympics, ace paddler Manika Batra has alleged that the coach was involved in match-fixing. Manika’s five-page response, accessed by The Hindu , was sent to the TTFI on August 26, a day before the seven-day deadline the TTFI had set while issuing the notice on August 20. She has accused Soumyadeep of pressurising her into conceding the Olympic qualification match to his personal ward (Sutirtha Mukherjee) in Doha in March. “I have been falsely charged with ‘bringing disrepute to the country by the sight of an empty chair of the coach’. But the truth is that the ‘empty chair’ was the result of the National coach’s pressure tactics for match-fixing and TTFI’s inaction to act on my prompt reporting of that incident and not the result of my so-called ‘indiscipline,’’’ Manika wrote in her reply to the show-cause notice served by the TTFI. “It is such pressure tactics, inaction and the consequent sub-optimal performance of a player that would have actually brought disrepute to the country,” she further wrote. “Contrary to false propaganda, it was not at all a show of disrespect or displeasure by me. I had to take that decision as I did not wish to lose in the lower rounds by buckling under unethical pressure. I decided to fight bravely for my beloved country and reach the higher rounds,” Manika stated in the reply.  TTFI secretary general Arun Kumar Banerjee told The Hindu that it has asked Soumyadeep for his response. “We have asked Soumyadeep to submit his reply to the allegations. The issue will be discussed at the next TTFI executive committee meeting that will be convened at the earliest,” Banerjee said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/soumyadeep-asked-me-to-fix-a-match-manika/article36283960.ece

04 September 2021||ZURICH,||Hungary-England game under FIFA scanner||After England players faced racial abuse in Hungary, FIFA said on Friday it will take “adequate actions” once it has investigated the incidents. The statement from FIFA stopped short of directly condemning Hungary fans for the abuse, which included monkey chanting, in Thursday’s World Cup qualifier at the Puskas Arena in Budapest. England won 4-0. “FIFA strongly rejects any form of racism and violence and has a very clear zero tolerance stance for such behaviour in football,” football’s governing body said. ”FIFA will take adequate actions as soon as it receives match reports concerning yesterday’s Hungary-England game.” Hungary had recently been ordered to play two matches without fans but the sanction from UEFA didn’t take effect for the visit of England because the game was under FIFA’s jurisdiction. The racist abuse was also condemned by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson England’s players were jeered for taking a knee, pelted with plastic cups after goals and then targeted with alleged racist chants. Pitch-side reporters for domestic broadcasters ITV and Sky Sports said they heard Hungary supporters behind one of the goals aim monkey chants at Raheem Sterling and Jude Bellingham, who are Black.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/budapest-game-under-fifa-scanner/article36284021.ece
04 September 2021||Johannesburg,||Slimani scores four as Algeria steamrollers Djibouti||Islam Slimani scored four goals as Algeria equalled the widest winning margin for an African World Cup Qualifier by crushing 10-man Djibouti 8-0 in a Group A rout in Blida on Thursday. The Lyon forward netted twice in each half and the other scorers were Ramy Bensebaini, Baghdad Bounedjah, captain Riyad Mahrez and Ramiz Zerrouki. Former Leicester City player Slimani took his national team goals tally to 36, matching the record of retired Abdelhafid Tasfaout. Slimani and Zerrouki were promoted by coach Djamel Belmadi in the only changes from the team that beat Senegal 1-0 in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations final. Victory stretched the African record for an unbeaten run by a national team to 28 matches with Algeria last losing away to Benin in 2018. Burkina Faso scored twice within three minutes through Lassina Traore and Mohamed Konate to defeat Niger 2-0 in Marrakesh. Niger had to play the home fixture at a neutral venue because it is among eight countries, including Burkina Faso, whose stadiums were declared unfit to host World Cup fixtures. Meanwhile, goals from Nayef Aguerd and Abuaagla Ahmed, who put the ball into his own net, earned Group I favourite Morroco a 2-0 win over Sudan in Rabat.  The results:   AFRICA: Group A: Niger 0 lost to Burkina Faso 2 (L.

Asked about India letting England off the hook after having the home team down at 62 for five, Umesh conceded that the bowlers could have done better. He said it was a result of the bowlers “trying too much.” “Thanks to the way we started bowling, we took two wickets within 40 minutes. “After that, we let things drift as we conceded 40-45 runs in seven or eight overs. The batsmen got their rhythm back and knew what had to be done. “We tried everything, but there was no support from the wicket. Once they hit boundaries, the batsmen get the upper hand and want to be dominant.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-could-have-done-better-admits-umesh/article36283989.ece

04 September 2021||KOLKATA,||‘Harvinder’s dedication is extraordinary’||Coach Gaurav Sharma does not mind that he could not accompany his ward Harvinder Singh to Tokyo due to a stipulation on the number of accreditations. Rather, he is elated that his ward has made history by becoming the first Indian archer to claim a medal in the Paralympic Games. Gaurav stayed in touch with Harvinder even after the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) ignored the Archery Association of India's (AAI) recommendation for coaches and support staff for the Tokyo Games. Regular touch “It does not matter that I could not go with him. The most heartening thing is he performed well and scripted history. Even though I was not present there, we stayed in touch through phone calls and discussed strategies. We also did video conferencing to exchange ideas. I am so delighted for him,” Gaurav told The Hindu on Friday. Gaurav credited the Government support that helped Harvinder claim a bronze medal in recurve men’s open individual event. “Even though all training centres were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Sports Authority of India kept its centre in Sonipat open because of which we could do unhindered training.” According to Gaurav, Harvinder’s mental toughness helped him overcome difficult situations. “His dedication level is extraordinary and he is mentally so strong. He is very disciplined and sticks to his schedule for studies and archery,” said Gaurav, planning a grand welcome for Harvinder. The Archery Association of India president Arjun Munda hailed Harvinder’s feat. “I have no words to express my delight. It is a moment to rejoice as it has filled every Indian with immense pride,” said Munda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/harvinders-dedication-level-is-extraordinary/article36283956.ece

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Tea and patties||A cup of tea needs add-ons. I am usually happy with my two Marie biscuits, but sometimes the stomach grumbles. On one such occasion last week, I decided that we need some savouries to go with the tea. I was hoping for a warm chicken patty but knew that I couldn’t order it from Wenger’s, which demands advance notice for delivery services. That’s when I thought of Theos. This is a chain in Delhi-NCR known for its pastries and muffins. I’d eaten its desserts but hadn’t encountered the savouries. We decided on the chicken tikka puffs (Rs. 110), a smoked chicken croissant (Rs. 195), a spinach and corn quiche (Rs. 95), mutton seekh roll (Rs. 160) and chicken pot pie (Rs. 180): the puffs for tea, and the rest for dinner. My food came via Swiggy from their outlet in Sector 50, Noida (Ph: 8750242224). Both meals were exceptional. Let me start with the chicken tikka puffs. I grew up at a time when patties largely came from Nehru Bazar in Paharganj in boxes carted by men on bicycles. Then, of course, little patisseries opened up across the city. I have always held that Wenger’s has the best patties in town; now I am willing to give it another thought. I found Theos’ puffs deliciously buttery and flaky. The filling was spicy, but not overly so, with just the right amount of chilli. Dinner that evening was different, but equally memorable. I didn’t have the mutton roll, but I was told it was crispy and filling, and the meaty stuffing tasty. According to Theos, the casing is a Danish pastry, topped with onion seeds and fresh coriander. I had the stuffed croissant, which was a flaky pastry with a filling of grilled smoked chicken in a cream and onion sauce. It was crispy outside, and warm and soft within. The chicken had been flavoured with some jalapeno cheese sauce, too, which added to its piquancy. The spinach and corn quiche, again, was just right. The filling was thick, and the pastry was buttery and crisp. What I enjoyed the most was the chicken pot pie. It came in a red bowl covered with a flaky pastry. I dipped the pastry in the chicken (small chunks in a cream sauce) and finished a satisfying meal. Theos has a comprehensive menu for savouries: it offers mushroom vol au vents, chicken and paneer patties, chicken quiches, garlic cheese croissants, and aloo puffs. The sandwich list includes a chicken salami brown bread sandwich and a brown bread coleslaw sandwich. I think the fare is exceptionally good. I wish, though, I hadn’t been so brave and turned away from its dessert list. If my meal needed anything else, it was some kind of a pudding. I am looking at its fruit and nut custard and crème brulee on the website and my fingers are itching to place an order again. I shall return.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Maya in the Himalayas||Filmmaker Sanal Kumar Sasidharan is on cloud nine after his movie, Kayattam, won the first ‘Disruptor in Cinema’ award at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. “It comes as a shot in the arm,” he says. “We had to take many risks to shoot Kayattam the way I had conceptualised it. However, because of the pandemic, we were unable to screen it in theatres or promote it the way we would have liked to. This award is definitely a morale booster and an honour.” Both the jury and viewers were impressed by the way the film — nominated for the Kim Ji-seok Award at 2020’s Busan Film Festival and screened in the Malayalam Cinema Today section of the International Film Festival of Kerala — moves away from a conventional narrative to explore philosophical aspects of the quest for happiness and identity in a surrealistic manner. A seamless fusion of fantasy and fact, Kayattam, s tarring Manju Warrier (as Maya), was shot completely on an iPhone XS Max. And with the pristine wilderness of the Himalayas as its backdrop, it explores the male gaze, voyeurism, identity, and ego through a group of strangers trekking in the snow-covered mountains. As the trip progresses, the trekkers’ personalities unravel, their insecurities surface, and their egos take a beating. Sasidharan says the theme demanded a location like the Himalayas, but the terrain also made it difficult to shoot with a large team. “The weather kept changing every hour. Rain and snow would be followed by weak sunshine. Our location was so remote that we had to trek for an hour with our equipment to reach the place,” he recalls. “Since we have the technology to shoot with minimal equipment, we decided to tap its potential and work with an iPhone. Our cinematographer, Chandru Selvaraj, did a great job,” he says. This is Sasidharan’s third film shot in the Himalayas. “ Kayattam explores the philosophical theme of m aya [illusion] and b rahmam [divine power]. It is a sort of extension of my first film [ Oraalppokkam , whose heroine was also named Maya] to understand the mysticism of ‘ m aya ’ and what we think is reality,” he says. “It assumes significance because of the violent times we live in, when every event is viewed through a narrow perspective of selfish interests. We experience happiness, and unhappiness, when we fail to understand that what is happening is m aya .” Not one to believe in bound scripts, he prefers to let a film flow with the situation and the location. It was the same with Kayattam . When the cast and crew were marooned in a remote village after a landslip, cinematographer Selvaraj was able to capture the destructive face of nature and its aftermath. The team also developed a new language, A’hr Samsa — to ‘vocalise’ subtext in the film that could be unfathomable. “I made it to convey the idea of a group of people who had moved beyond the emotions of joy and sorrow. They travelled without any kind of baggage, emotional or physical,” he says. Currently, Sasidharan is working on new scripts and the post production of his Tovino Thomas-starrer, Vazhakku .  Even in inclement weather, we were able to capture panoramic shots and close-ups with the phone Sanal Kumar Sasidharan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/maya-in-the-himalayas/article36284490.ece

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||My teacher’s back||To all our teachers who had eyes and antennae on their backs, comes this tribute with admiration, respect — and all our love. ‘Saji,’ Teacher would say, back turned, scrawling on the blackboard. ‘Stop digging your nose!’ Saji, who had been in the middle of an excavation to find oil in the Tundra, would stop midway, wide-eyed. All the ear diggers, head-scratchers cavity-pickers, nose-wipers who had waited exclusively for this break, froze instantly. Without turning around, she’d say, ‘And Jane, please share the contents of that note with the whole class.’ Note-passing was an activity so surreptitious that the Gestapo could have copyrighted it. Notes zigzagged across class, smuggled under desks, stuck into socks, flown via paper planes. The notes usually contained completely false accusations of who was seen with whom or scandalous arrangements of body parts. ‘It’s — um — two circles, Miss. We were practising geometry.’ I firmly believe my creative storytelling skills began there. Teacher’s back contained a bloodhound’s nose as well to pinpoint the originator of a stink bomb. And elephant ears. ‘I heard that!’ got 40 voices stoutly protesting, ‘It was not me, Miss.’ The multiple double chins on Teacher’s back would wobble in silent laughter. Maths problems were the most anticipated (what?!), especially the complex ones that required giant leaps (of faith) for mankind. Those kept Teacher at the blackboard even longer, scribbling out the solution for her ungrateful class. That was the Breaking News Hour. ‘Did you hear a 4th grader fainted in the loo?’ To which quicker solutions than maths were offered: ‘Must have been after you ate lunch!’ ‘Lina,’ Teacher barked. ‘Would you like to solve this next step?’ Lina, who was salivating over aTrue Romancecomic, would have rather been sucked into the Tundra tunnel. ‘I have a pain, Miss,’ she’d appeal. ‘Where?’ ‘In my stomach, Miss.’ ‘Good, then nothing wrong with your legs. Walk here and solve it.’ Still turned, Teacher said, ‘And throw that dirty comic in the wastepaper basket while you’re at it.’ Saina, who had stolen the comic book from her elder sister, hissed, ‘I will kill you. I will maim you. I will break your teeth!’ We bore war wounds from the Back-Time. It was the agreed time to break into strenuous physical activity that not even PT Sir could otherwise urge us to. Pelting pencils, erasers, (books are gods, don’t you dare!) and half-eaten jam- parathas at each other. Sometimes, a fry drenched in ketchup landed on Teacher’s desk. Dishu once leaned so far out to cheat from the next desk that she fell over and cut her chin. Sara flung an ink pen at the first bench, that both opened up to drench someone’s shirt and nearly took out someone else’s eye (two-in-one school record till today). When the bell signalled freedom, Teacher walked out proudly, job well done. I swear I saw her pop that fry into her mouth and pick up the dirty comic on her way out. Her back smiled back at me.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The sin of sameness||If there’s one thing that the video presentations at the recently-concluded India Couture Week said as one, it is that the designers have been thinking grand. From Falguni & Shane taking their collection to the Taj Mahal (a true feat, considering how famously inimical the babus at the ASI can be) to Gaurav Gupta’s Universal Love show shot at the Taj Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad, this season was all about location, location, location. Shantanu & Nikhil shot their lineup, Oasis, at Suryagarh in Jaisalmer. Varun Bahl’s Memory / Mosaic came alive at the Andaz Aerocity and Anju Modi’s The Eternal Story unfolded at The Banyan Farm, both on the outskirts of the capital. Rahul Mishra’s Kam-Khab had its outing at a 300-year-old haveli in Mandawa, Rajasthan. The fact that so many of India’s most creative minds thought of such locations at the same time is significant. Especially when travelling is, to put it mildly, a little more difficult than before. It mirrors what people have been feeling for a while. Stifled, caged. Designers chose to focus on the idea of travel as their backdrop specifically because such places now offer safe and luxurious locations and experiences, not to mention great wedding packages.  A hackneyed narrative   If you feel I’ve digressed from talking about fashion — this is, after all, an op-ed on a fashion week — you are absolutely right. Because while capturing the zeitgeist, while ensuring that they place their haute couture in the most luxurious settings, and showing how their clothes may be worn by brides, grooms, families, and friends, our designers have succumbed, collectively, to the sin of sameness. Setting aside a few, almost all designers chose to portray some version of the How-To-Luxury-Wedding theme, where the clothes fell into categories and the stories took centerstage. Nobody spoke about the craft of couture, except Tarun Tahiliani and Rahul Mishra. Which brings me to this: we are quick to take pride in our traditional crafts, textiles, and embellishments. We are just as quick to bring up our deep-rooted work with India’s craft clusters at every opportunity, most significantly on social media. But the way we choose to market the beautiful outcomes of all those painstaking efforts is through pandering to hackneyed visions of marital glamour. We tell stories that have nothing to do with what we have designed and made. The sin of sameness manifests in the narratives. Its devices are the following: long, lingering shots of beautiful models, their translucent dupatas flying, the richness of Indian flora represented by gulaab , mogra , and genda strewn around. There are handsome men striding in slow motion. And there are courtyards filled with beautiful friends, dancing. Stately mothers and indulgent fathers in haute couture; jewels to ransom entire countries. Everything is royal, or a version of. Here, it is India’s artisanship that recedes into obscurity. We saw a form of collective outrage when Sabyasachi’s mass-market H&M collaboration was launched because it didn’t fulfil made-up expectations of how India’s crafts should be represented worldwide. We see none of that when an entire fashion week dedicated to haute couture — a space where designers can and should explode with creativity — sells us a tired and uniform vision of The Royal Romance. Which disservice is the greater? Is the future of our most creative minds and skilled hands to be tied to the monopoly that is the shaadi economy? Smart businesspeople are innovative. They diversify and constantly create new markets. Look at Schiapparelli. Or Marc Jacobs. Closer home, look at designers who make haute couture that’s not remotely bridal or traditional. Whether they show at Couture Week or not is immaterial, but they refuse to cater solely to old (and new) money and recognise the potential of the informed, style-conscious, and willing-to-invest younger consumers of high fashion. And they’re not the only ones we need to look at by far.  Time to shun vanilla   Ioften speak about respecting tradition but not being bound by it. Which is not some mind-boggling new concept, really. But when I look at haute couture in India today, I see an irony emerging. Our social media is filled with images of truly modern ideas. There are heartwarming tales of LGBTQIA+ weddings, marriages where brides wear two-piece suits, middle-age romances, and older people marrying for love and companionship. The conversation about size has progressed to the point where designers are (slowly) getting better at featuring models of different shapes and body structures. Jewellery labels are making ads that challenge long-held notions. But our haute couture videos stubbornly depict only the most vanilla narratives. We’ve willingly imposed a brahminical heteronormativity on our collective creativity in the name of business. Since when did fashion become so weak, so afraid? If this were a regular, physical fashion presentation where only those who can afford wedding couture were invited, all that I have said would be irrelevant. But the migration to an all-access video format outed on social media has made it relevant to even those who can’t. And this means that designers now have an added responsibility — towards the continued growth of the artisanal sectors and craftspeople they work with. They have the power now to set the tone. With this in mind, we need to ask if the shaadi market, while it may sustain us economically, is enough. Are we here simply to survive? To bow to this monopoly even unto the erasure of our creative voices? Only our designers, whose very job it is to offer solutions, can answer these questions.  Varun Rana is a fashion commentator and consultant, and is currently consulting with label Shantanu & Nikhil which is mentioned in this feature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-sin-of-sameness/article36283852.ece
04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||History’s many hues||I love to see the circularity with which some issues are rehashed on social media. Like last night’s leftovers warmed up for lunch. And dinner too. When elections get nigh anywhere in the country, the same sudden flurry of challenges pop up to readings of history. The same suspicions about how a historical character or event is portrayed. The same questions about why roads or towns are named after this or that leader. Or why history textbooks focus on the Mughal period alone. None of this would ordinarily be problematic — questions and challenges are the lifeblood of a democracy. But these queries are not so much based on facts as on wishful thinking and colourful, rather traumatised, reworkings. History is just another subject, like maths or chemistry, and based on some verifiable facts. Of course, it’s hard to pick sides in an algebraic equation as one often does in history, but one still needs to be objective, to set aside personal feelings of humiliation or pride or vengeance and focus only on how events in the past played out. India’s ancient civilisational past has many astonishing achievements to its credit. From philosophy to literature, grammar, arts, mathematics, and even sexuality, the subcontinent produced highly knowledgeable and researched treatises at a time when the West was still grappling with daily baths. And it’s well and good to take pride in this remarkable past, but I wish we would do it without constantly dragging it into the present. The value of Sushruta Samhita’s ground-breaking work in medicine is not in the least bit diminished because it doesn’t have cures for Covid-19 but try saying that to a WhatsApp warrior. You will end up with two PPTs and a pie-chart. This has meant that at any given time, someone somewhere is either obsessing with “traditional” remedies to the extent of arresting anyone who questions the efficacy of cow-dung as a Covid cure. Or we have goons burning copies of the Kamasutra because they claim that sacrilege such as sex is not “our tradition” . This mix of false pride and false shame is a deadly concoction, guaranteed to bog us down in a debilitating, wearying and entirely needless cycle of low self-esteem that in turn leads to aggressive self-assertion. What next? Are we going to raze down the walls of the Khajuraho temples to prove how sanskaari we are? The 1921 Moplah Rebellion leaders have now become Chief Villains and Wipeout Candidates. The uprising involved peasants who were largely Muslim, landlords who were largely Hindu, and a British administration that was Christian — a tinderbox at the best of times. Add to this exploitative labour conditions and oppressive colonial laws and you get resentment, anger, bloodshed. When the revolt happened, it was many things simultaneously — a peasant uprising coloured by religious bigotries, an anti-colonial struggle coloured by labour issues, a class struggle complicated by caste and religious categories. We need to step back and look at this moment, and at all of history, with the widest angle lens possible and that lens is certainly not WhatsApp. An Akbar with a syncretic religion called Din-i-elahi that merged all faiths is as much India’s past as a joyless Aurangazeb with his emphasis on Sharia law. The British and the railways they keep boasting about is as real as their destruction of indigenous industries, which they boast a lot less about. A messy mix of all of this constitutes India today, and we don’t get to pick and choose which bits we will accept or not — it’s all ours. There are no convenient heroes and villains and much less are there unsullied legacies of good or evil. While it’s unfashionable to say anything good about Nehru and his colleagues, one thing they did do in 1947 was to acknowledge and respect the mess they inherited and to realise that this mixed-up, contradictory and conflicted history was the foundation they had to build upon. And for a country as socially, culturally and religiously diverse as this, messy compromises are the only thing that can work going forward as well. It’s time we made peace with this rather than concoct a monochromatic past to achieve what we imagine will be a monochromatic future as well.

Most smartphones have an inbuilt stabiliser and it is possible to attach mics to it. Many films are shot with phones and I am happy with the way Kayattam shaped up,” he adds. Behind the illusion This is Sasidharan’s third film to be shot in the Himalayas. “ Kayattam explores the philosophical theme of m aya [illusion] and b rahmam [divine power]. It is a sort of extension of my first film [ Oraalppokkam , whose heroine was also named Maya] to understand the mysticism of ‘ m aya ’ and what we think is reality,” he says, adding that the film could be seen as the journey of life — when people meet as strangers and then find themselves in different kinds of relationships on their search for identity and happiness. “It assumes significance because of the violent times we live in, when every event is viewed through a narrow perspective of selfish interests.” Not one to believe in bound scripts — he has often talked about having just an outline ready, with perhaps 15 pages in all — he prefers to let a film flow with the situation and the location.

As was Watches and Wonders earlier this year, a star-studded affair including virtual fireside chats with watch CEOs and a social media blitz. The Geneva Watch Days Instagram account, meanwhile, has just one post since the show began. That’s it. But the independents are truly celebrated here, with the announcement about the pre-owned platform WatchBox investing in the Swiss watchmaker, De Bethune, creating a stir on forums and Clubhouse rooms. Meanwhile, here are some brands that made an impact:     The brand has gone from Bentley to muscle cars, screamed headlines, about Breitling’s Top Time capsule collection. Inspired by classic American sports cars from the 1960s — the Chevrolet Corvette, Shelby Cobra and Ford Mustang — the three new chronographs have a distinctive colour and car logo. In a 44 mm case (the Shelby is 40 mm with calibre 41) they are in limited volume, a good way to keep the interest high. Approx Rs. 4.1 lakh.  Bulgari Octo Roma Worldtimer  A nod to international travel picking up soon, the sporty Octo Roma WorldTimer was planned before the pandemic, says Antoine Pin, MD of the brand’s watch division. With a softer and more rounded shape, it has a blue dial, steel case, and a rotating world time disc operated with the crown. With BVL257 calibre and a smaller dial that is neat on the wrist. Approx $8,350.  Ulysse Nardin Marine Torpilleur collection  Marking the brand’s 175th anniversary, the Marine Torpilleur collection has seven new models with two new movements, complications, chronographs, and enamelled dials. This is a wrist watch with all the codes and mechanics you can find on a marine chronometer. Each piece is numbered, with the moon-face complication (here) having calibre 119, a variation of 118. Approx $8,200-$42,400.  Czapek & Cie Antarctique Rattrapante     This Swiss watchmaker made an impact last year with its luxury sports contender. In the new Rattrapante, the split-seconds chronograph movement is visible from the dial side. With the automatic calibre SXH6, icy steel case and bracelet, it has created a buzz this week. And the limited edition, 77 pieces, has been swiped up for approx CHF 46,000.  GWD was from August 30 till September 3 .

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Auroville and the price of perfection’||History is believed to never happen by chance, but it was an accident that created and shaped this mesmerising account of the past. Ten years ago, author and journalist Akash Kapur was looking through the contents of a drawer in a New York apartment when he came across a bunch of folders crammed with letters, pages from diaries, and old photographs. They were papers of John Walker, the adoptive father of Akash’s wife, Auralice. The discovery of the folders, which were preserved by John’s sister, was at once painful and liberating. In 1986, when Auralice was just 14, John and Auralice’s mother Diane had died within hours of each other in Auroville under circumstances that were obscure and perplexing. John had grown up in privilege, born in a family of great wealth, an impressive lineage, “a pedigree he has to live up to”. Diane was a beautiful, sunny and flirtatious Belgian hippie who lived near Antwerp with a mother who relied on welfare checks. What these two unlikely partners shared was an itch to escape their lives and follow their dreams, a hankering that would lead them separately to Auroville, not so long after it was founded in 1968. Soon after John and Diane mysteriously died, Auralice would move to the US to live with the former’s family. In America, she would marry Akash, who also grew up in Auroville; the two knew each other as children. In 2004, the couple returned to live in the experimental city that manifested in the dreams of Sri Aurobindo’s foremost disciple, the Mother (Frenchwoman Mirra Alfassa). Their reasons for moving back, Akash says, were varied, and included such things as being homesick and wanting to try something. But the searingly tragic saga of Auralice’s parents — which included a fall that paralysed Diane’s hips for years and the death of an infant son (Aurolouis) by drowning — continued to hang like a fog over their heads. The diaries offered a forensic as well as a cathartic opportunity: to clear the mist and come to terms with the past.  Bringing up the divide  It is a journey that took Akash, now 46, almost 10 years to complete, a project that involved “tracking down old friends of John and Diane’s, their former lovers, fellow-travellers from Auroville… on six continents”. As he set out to write about the two, the scope of the book, perhaps inevitably, widened. The story of John and Diane would also become a social history of Auroville; their lives, after all, were inextricably twinned with the place they chose to live in. Delving into Auroville’s past meant dealing with a shadowy time when the utopia that was designed to be a place for “unending education, constant progress, and a youth that never ages” turned dark and almost dystopian. The passing of the Mother in 1973 was followed by deep divisions within the multi-cultural community. A part of the reason for this was the struggle for power and self-determination, one that pitted the Pondicherry-based Sri Aurobindo Society (SAS, which owned most of the land and assets in the expansive township) against residents of Auroville. There was an attendant ideological dimension, which cleaved Auroville down the middle. There were revolutionaries (loosely, those who wanted to break free from the SAS) and the Neutrals (a grouping that was attacked for its alleged lack of revolutionary ardour and their supposed softness towards the SAS). The collective that dominated Auroville was revolutionary and there was a period in which there prevailed a climate of slander, threats, evictions, deportations, and arrests. Children were ‘liberated’ by the closure of schools and, quite astonishingly, a bonfire was lit of books pulled from shelves from its library. Akash says terrible though it was, the book burning was an “isolated incident”, a moment of madness. “The greater long-term damage was done by shutting down the schools. The ideology behind this and book burning was the same though. That the old forms of knowledge were unnecessary at a time when Aurovilians were going to reinvent the world.” Even children were infected by the polarisation. Akash recalls, with a stirring honesty and immense regret, that when he was about 10, some friends and he chased a couple of Neutrals down the road, sneering and throwing twigs and pebbles at them. “I am embarrassed about this and very ashamed. All kinds of things happened to the Neutrals at that time. They are now reintegrated into the community, but one of the revelations in talking to them for the book is that the pain still runs below the surface for many of them.”  Balancing the dark and the light  “Auroville walked to the edge of the precipice and back,” he says when talking of that period. Has it walked back too far? Hasn’t some of that early fervour, which saw the first few Aurovilians living simply in thatched huts with no money and few resources, vanished? “It’s fair to say that Auroville is middle-aged now, and with this comes a certain complacency,” he replies. “But there are still people here who are very idealistic, sometimes to a fault. As the book suggests, there is a darker side to idealism and extremism. If that has dimmed, maybe it is not such a bad thing at all.” Auroville is also much bigger today, with about 3,500 people from almost 60 countries. And, of course, much more prosperous. “Yes, that is true. And then, there is the tourism economy. And the restaurants. But within the Auroville master plan, none of us owns a house,” he says. “My kids are in a school where it doesn’t matter whether your dad has a flashy car or the biggest house. None of the games that play out in big cities play out here.” What sets Better to Have Gone (Scribner, Rs. 699) apart is Akash’s voice and approach. It would have been far easier to have pulled off, for example, what Peter Washington did of another new age movement (the Theosophists). In Madame Blavatsky’s Baboon , he panned the main players as eccentric founders of a cult, which claimed to receive divine wisdom in their visions and which encouraged all kinds of irrational ideas (which of course they did). Notions such as immortality and talk of transforming cellular consciousness were very much present in the thoughts of the Mother and those close to her. But despite being someone who lives “closer to the side of reason”, Akash is empathetic to even those he disagrees with. There is a recognition, the kind that good novelists have, that everyone has a story and that the truth is often not in black and white, but shades of grey. “Auroville has so many different points of view. I decided that I was going to state things as they were, but also that I was going to step out of the frame.” There are meditations on doubt and certitude, on the dangers that result when an imperfect species flirts with notions of utopia, and the virtues of fallibilism, moderation and incrementalism — values that lie at the heart of any true liberal project. The result is an empathetic non-judgmental work, written with a spare, almost frugal beauty, illuminating in its silences, and revealing in what is left unsaid. Is Auralice in a better place now that she knows about the tragedies of Diane and John? “I think so,” Akash replies. Yes, it was difficult when the research threw up painful facts. But overall, if you have family members die in these circumstances and if you don’t understand why or how, it is liberating to see the bigger picture and what happened to them.” In short, and to tweak the title of the book a little, it is better to have known.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/auroville-and-the-price-of-perfection/article36283915.ece

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Is Indian realty’s recovery sustainable?||The outbreak of the pandemic last year has shown how quickly our world can change. It has yet again proven that the mobility of humans, goods and services is crucial for a thriving economy. The devastating impact of Covid-19 has been felt across the globe, and the subsequent lockdowns brought everything to a grinding halt. The crisis has resulted in one of the most significant social and economic crises since the Great Depression of the 1930s, and like most sectors, the real estate industry was severely impacted too. Having said that, there have been changes within the buyer community during the period. For instance, the lockdown in 2020 made potential home buyers revisit the importance of owning a home. The renewed demand, supported by timely government measures, served as a catalyst for the sector’s revival and development. There has been a growing consensus that the sector is now witnessing a steady recovery. A few key trends noticed over the last year include:  Relocation intentions: Sincelast year, families around the world in search of increased space or second homes have landed new jobs, and many more are looking to do so. According to Knight Frank’s Global Buyer Survey 2021 report, nearly 26% of mid-segment home buyers with an annual household income between Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 25 lakh shifted to another residence within the pandemic period. These relocations were motivated by factors like the want of more open space, modern amenities, proximity to friends and family, easy access to the workplace, among others. The survey also highlighted that cities such as Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune had the maximum number of homeowners who are looking to relocate in the next 12 months or so.  Attitudinal shift among buyers: The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the way home buyers think of their dwellings. Consumer behaviour has changed significantly leading to a structural shift in the manner they look at how to live and where to live, including their sentiment towards home ownership. The projects equipped with work-from-home and study-from-home spaces, are preferred by buyers today. Consumers are also looking for projects with well-designed architecture, equipped with uncluttered spaces and a wide range of recreational spaces. The Global Buyer Survey also indicated that in Chennai, buyers predominately considered a new residence for upgrading their primary residence. Whereas in Bengaluru, upgrading a family’s primary residence and seeking a holiday home were the most important reasons for considering a new home. Buyers in Hyderabad, on the other hand, evaluated a new residence on the basis of an increase in their family’s size. Although, pan India, upgrading the family’s primary residence was seen as the main reason for purchasing a new home, energy efficiency is also another priority for individuals evaluating home purchase in the future.  Holiday homes gaining traction: With an increasing number of people now looking for a getaway or workcation, the need for owning a holiday home is gaining prominence among potential buyers. The trend is here to stay, and amenities such as staff rooms, a home office, play areas for children, are now prerequisites being demanded by most buyers today. Outdoor space and the need for greater privacy have pushed homebuyers in the higher income category to evaluate second home purchases in India. The pandemic has also impacted the propensity of the budget that an individual sets aside for a home. As uncertainty prevails, many have started considering a home as an essential financial security, with buyers from Chennai and Hyderabad increasing their budget for homes (as per Knight Frank Home Buyers Survey). The Survey highlights that almost half of the respondents from southern cities; Chennai (57%), Hyderabad (55%), Bengaluru (47%) have cited a desire for a second home influenced by the pandemic.  Location is key: The importance of location can never be underestimated when it comes to a home-buying decision. It has long been the buzzword and is often considered as one of the most important criteria to dictate the way property prices sway. With the pandemic, features which were typically considered the hallmark of a good location have also undergone a change in the order of priority. While factors such as good air quality, proximity to green areas and access to good healthcare have become more important, parameters such as being within walking distance to a public transport hub have slid down in the order of ranking. This used to be a very important add-on to a location before the pandemic. Respondents to the Survey from the south have majorly cited that after the pandemic, access to large green spaces is an important feature to consider, followed by proximity to adequate healthcare infrastructure. Buying sentiments and price expectations As the restrictions placed during the first lockdown gradually ebbed, buying activity started resuming from Q3 2020. States such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and West Bengal have provided stimulus to the real estate sector in the form of stamp duty cuts. With the announcement of stamp duty cuts in Maharashtra, Mumbai saw a record number of home sales, with Q4 2020 registering a clear 80% gain in sales on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. The lockdown during Q2 2020 and Q3 2020 drove home prices further down, attracting the fence sitters to make the purchase decision. The Survey also stated that a majority of buyers expect the value of their primary residence to increase in the next 12 months across the country. With a better handle on pandemic preparedness and softening of prices in 2020, there is a buoyancy in sentiment for the Indian home buyers. Watch out for... On the question of sustainable recovery, it must be observed that the bounce back in residential real estate is seen across major cities in India. With the pandemic induced change in lifestyles, people are finding the need to upgrade their houses. This home buying trend has been further supported by low home loan interest rates and an increase in household savings during the pandemic. There are specifically positive sentiments among home buyers and developers for southern cities such as Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, indicative of upward trend in demand in the coming months. Chennai’s ongoing infrastructure development and improved connectivity through the metro rail network in the South and West of the city has maintained its value proposition for many home buyers. In Bengaluru, homes located in the Southern and Eastern parts of the city will continue to remain a favourite amongst home buyers. As for Hyderabad, micro-markets located to the West and North of the city will continue to be the preferred destination for a majority of buyers. The direction of the Covid-19 pandemic going forward and its impact on the economy will have a strong influence on real estate recovery. The future trend of interest rates in the economy along with fiscal measures adopted by State governments will truly dictate the sustainability of this growth trajectory.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Property registrations in Maharashtra go digital||In the unprecedented times of the pandemic, going digital has become indispensable for most industries, including Indian real estate. In line with this, the recent announcement by the Maharashtra government that it will finally implement a full e-registration facility for new properties at developer offices is highly timely. To hopefully be rolled out from October this year, e-registration of all first sale MahaRERA-registered properties will not only boost overall transparency, but is a major step towards future-proofing the housing industry. Given the current and future uncertainties, it will help developers become even more customer-centred. E-registration will ultimately benefit all real estate stakeholders — developers, consumers and also the government. Here’s how: Developers will see renewed sales momentum, even when registration offices are shut or visiting crowded government offices is unsafe.  Buyers will enjoy a vastly improved level of ease and convenience by being able to secure their dream homes faster at a time when home ownership sentiment has hit its highest peak in decades.  For the government, seamless continuity of the property registration process will help maintain state revenue collections. Early beginnings In April 2020 — when the first lockdown hit — there were just 796 property registrations in Maharashtra. According to the Department of Registration and Stamps, Maharashtra, the total revenue collection was just Rs. 3 crore. This dire state of affairs becomes more apparent if we consider that in April of 2019, there were nearly 1.05 lakh properties registered with total revenue collections of over Rs. 1,563 crore. While this 99% drop in the number of registrations and 100% fall in revenues was a huge setback for the government coffers. The decision to roll out property e-registration is not merely a convenience extended to developers and their customers, but an insurance policy that the state government is taking out to prevent any such revenue shortfalls in the future - even during such pandemics. Tides of change The property registration process in all states has always been very cumbersome and time-consuming. Over the last few years, on average, more than one lakh property documents are registered in Maharashtra every month. The massive crowding at sub-registrar offices leads to long queues that strain everyone’s nerves and patience - and already over-stressed government office infrastructure. Ultimately, the traditional way of registering property sales deeds is a huge inconvenience, with people sometimes waiting an entire day to get their property documents registered. Also, middlemen charge exorbitant fees. But despite all these drawbacks, the old system continued until the Covid-19 pandemic proved to be the catalyst for change. Crowded government offices are not compatible with full or partial lockdowns and social distancing rules. In 2019, the Maharashtra government first introduced the online registration of property documents to reduce paperwork, save time, and improve transparency. Homebuyers could upload their property documents on the Public Data Entry (PDE) section of the designated website in advance, and then choose a day and time to visit the registration office. This step aimed to be a time-saver for buyers and officials as buyers only had to come to the registration office for fingerprints and signatures. However, there were technical glitches and it still required at least one visit to the sub-registrar office. Gearing up for the future After Covid-19 bared its teeth and became the most powerful call for technology adoption yet, the government has finally decided to meet this challenge head-on. After all, a commitment towards ease of doing business must also percolate down to the masses. The stated intention is to make e-registration of sales of new homes by developers of MahaRERA-approved projects not only possible but mandatory from October 2021. The process has already been field-tested in the offices of select leading developers; online registrations were done from their offices in coordination with the property registration department. This critical Digitech intervention will be a gamechanger. Whether it will plug all the previous leakages and systemic flaws remains to be seen, but all journeys towards progress start with the critical first step.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The significance of setback spaces||Over the last year, we have noticed an increase in the demand for smaller, independent homes in lieu of apartments in and around the city. This clearly reflects a move away from dense developments. While this could actually be beneficial for the city and the residents in the long run, we do need to ensure that such homes are developed sensibly, with access to adequate natural light, ventilation and green space. If not, such developments can become cramped and congested, affecting the occupants’ quality of life, and also increasing the burden on the environment. Considering the cost of land in the city, most plots end up being smaller than one ground (2,400 sq.ft.) within which most people aspire to build as much as possible. Such situations almost always result in the sacrifice of the space required as ‘setback’ all around the home. While code regulations often require a very minimal setback based on the plot size and road widths, that width is not adequate to barely walk around the home, leave alone creating a green buffer. This buffer is essential as it would also bring in some natural light and breeze and keep a minimum distance from neighbouring homes. We should also be conscious of not only how much built space we need in relation to the plot size we own, but also of how much green space we need to preserve within the plot. Although current regulations mandate minimum setback widths, they do not unfortunately mandate a maximum plot coverage ratio, i.e.. how much of the plot area can actually be built upon and how much is left as open space. A ratio of 50% is required only for ‘high-rise’ buildings (ie. buildings taller than 18.3m) and not for structures lower in height including all independent homes. Also, within this 50%, there is no mandate for how much should be left as a permeable surface, leading most developments to pave the available open space and not leave ground for planting. With current setback regulations in small plots, the building footprint itself can occupy up to 75% of the plot area excluding other areas such as the driveway, parking lot, and so on. This leaves barely any ground space for planting that could act as a buffer and allow rainwater to percolate. In this situation it is up to the occupants to realise the importance of open setback spaces as much as closed built spaces. If planned early on, setbacks can be designed creatively to act as interesting outdoor extensions of the building, spaces that can provide a breath of fresh air within small plots of land. These spaces would also act as the much-needed buffer from neighbouring structures, avoiding congestion from closely packed buildings, the very reason why these occupants would have wanted to move away from apartments.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Altering a street’s width||As per the revenue department’s TSR Record of 1979, a street’s width opening has been marked for 2.9m and the rear end has been marked for 3.6m (when all the plots were empty). Now, as the dwellings have increased by more than 16 on the street and all buildings are more than ground plus one structures, all 16 dwellings have to use this as an approach street. Since the entry of this approach street is 2.9m, it restricts the entry of auto rickshaws and other small vehicles. As the GO.Ms.No.18 advocates the provision of a barrier-free environment for the elderly and children, we requested the municipal corporation to realign the street uniformly with an average width of atleast 3.25m. However, the municipal corporation is rejecting our pleas and officials state that the revenue department’s TSR plan of 1979 for street width can only be adopted, and they cannot realign the street width uniformly as they are not competent to do so. Even when we highlighted the increase in the dwelling count, and that the street’s width has been less that the qualifying width, our requests were rejected stating that town surveyor certified the width (2.90m in the front and 3.60m at the end) and they cannot take further action to realign the street. How do we proceed? Selva Jayapal Chennai The status of possession and ownership of the properties on either side of the road will have a bearing on whether realignment is possible or otherwise. In some cases, land acquisition proceedings have to be initiated to widen the road and the same has to be done by the government in accordance with all applicable guidelines/rules, including payment of compensation to the affected owners. If the survey records indicate that realignment is possible as it is, you may have to file a Writ Petition seeking appropriate directions from the Court. I have 3 houses in Chennai. These are the details: 1. One flat is in the name of my wife and I, and we wish to transfer ownership to my daughter and son-in-law 2. The second flat is in the name of my son and I, and I want to transfer ownership to my son and daughter-in-law 3. The third, an independent house is in my name, and I would like to include my wife as a joint owner. How do I get this done? Ramaswamy Ganapathy Chennai It is possible to do the transfers as indicated by you by executing and registering Deeds of Settlement/Gift. However, if the beneficiary/recipient is your son-in-law or daughter-in-law, there could be a levy of higher stamp duty and gift tax implications.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Report on vehicular fuel efficiency||A new Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) analysis — ‘India’s fuel economy benchmarks: How to make them work for an energy-efficient and climate-secure world’ — states that while India has taken giant strides in introducing emission standards for reducing toxic emissions from vehicles with the adoption of Bharat Stage VI standards in 2020, it has not taken equally strident and strong measures to improve fuel efficiency and carbon footprints of vehicles. So far, only Stage 1 fuel efficiency standards have been implemented – that too, only for passenger cars; Stage 2 standards are facing a delay. “These standards are so lenient that most car models have either met or have exceeded them; many are also close to meeting the Stage 2 norms. A lenient benchmark cannot push technological innovations to maximise fuel and carbon savings, nor does it require large-scale electrification to meet fleet-wide fuel efficiency targets,” says CSE executive director Anumita Roychowdhury. Key highlights of the report include: Standards are so lenient that car manufacturers have either met or exceeded current standards, and are close to meeting the next target  Compliance with corporate average fuel consumption standards allows manufacturers to score extra points for adopting predefined technology approaches. As some of these are part of routine application, this stymies technology innovation in IC engines  Weak fuel efficiency targets do not require or enable rapid electrification of vehicle fleet. This is a lost opportunity, says the CSE analysis  Fuel inefficiency hurts consumers and increases out-of-the-pocket expenses.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Is Indian realty’s recovery sustainable?||The outbreak of the pandemic last year has shown how quickly our world can change. It has yet again proven that the mobility of humans, goods and services is crucial for a thriving economy. The devastating impact of Covid-19 has been felt across the globe, and the subsequent lockdowns brought everything to a grinding halt. The crisis has resulted in one of the most significant social and economic crises since the Great Depression of the 1930s, and like most sectors, the real estate industry was severely impacted too. Having said that, there have been changes within the buyer community during the period. For instance, the lockdown in 2020 made potential home buyers revisit the importance of owning a home. The renewed demand, supported by timely government measures, served as a catalyst for the sector’s revival and development. There has been a growing consensus that the sector is now witnessing a steady recovery. A few key trends noticed over the last year include:  Relocation intentions: Sincelast year, families around the world in search of increased space or second homes have landed new jobs, and many more are looking to do so. According to Knight Frank’s Global Buyer Survey 2021 report, nearly 26% of mid-segment home buyers with an annual household income between Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 25 lakh shifted to another residence within the pandemic period. These relocations were motivated by factors like the want of more open space, modern amenities, proximity to friends and family, easy access to the workplace, among others. The survey also highlighted that cities such as Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune had the maximum number of homeowners who are looking to relocate in the next 12 months or so.  Attitudinal shift among buyers: The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the way home buyers think of their dwellings. Consumer behaviour has changed significantly leading to a structural shift in the manner they look at how to live and where to live, including their sentiment towards home ownership. The projects equipped with work-from-home and study-from-home spaces, are preferred by buyers today. Consumers are also looking for projects with well-designed architecture, equipped with uncluttered spaces and a wide range of recreational spaces. The Global Buyer Survey also indicated that in Chennai, buyers predominately considered a new residence for upgrading their primary residence. Whereas in Bengaluru, upgrading a family’s primary residence and seeking a holiday home were the most important reasons for considering a new home. Buyers in Hyderabad, on the other hand, evaluated a new residence on the basis of an increase in their family’s size. Although, pan India, upgrading the family’s primary residence was seen as the main reason for purchasing a new home, energy efficiency is also another priority for individuals evaluating home purchase in the future.  Holiday homes gaining traction: With an increasing number of people now looking for a getaway or workcation, the need for owning a holiday home is gaining prominence among potential buyers. The trend is here to stay, and amenities such as staff rooms, a home office, play areas for children, are now prerequisites being demanded by most buyers today. Outdoor space and the need for greater privacy have pushed homebuyers in the higher income category to evaluate second home purchases in India. The pandemic has also impacted the propensity of the budget that an individual sets aside for a home. As uncertainty prevails, many have started considering a home as an essential financial security, with buyers from Chennai and Hyderabad increasing their budget for homes (as per Knight Frank Home Buyers Survey). The Survey highlights that almost half of the respondents from southern cities; Chennai (57%), Hyderabad (55%), Bengaluru (47%) have cited a desire for a second home influenced by the pandemic.  Location is key: The importance of location can never be underestimated when it comes to a home-buying decision. It has long been the buzzword and is often considered as one of the most important criteria to dictate the way property prices sway. With the pandemic, features which were typically considered the hallmark of a good location have also undergone a change in the order of priority. While factors such as good air quality, proximity to green areas and access to good healthcare have become more important, parameters such as being within walking distance to a public transport hub have slid down in the order of ranking. This used to be a very important add-on to a location before the pandemic. Respondents to the Survey from the south have majorly cited that after the pandemic, access to large green spaces is an important feature to consider, followed by proximity to adequate healthcare infrastructure. Buying sentiments and price expectations As the restrictions placed during the first lockdown gradually ebbed, buying activity started resuming from Q3 2020. States such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and West Bengal have provided stimulus to the real estate sector in the form of stamp duty cuts. With the announcement of stamp duty cuts in Maharashtra, Mumbai saw a record number of home sales, with Q4 2020 registering a clear 80% gain in sales on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. The lockdown during Q2 2020 and Q3 2020 drove home prices further down, attracting the fence sitters to make the purchase decision. The Survey also stated that a majority of buyers expect the value of their primary residence to increase in the next 12 months across the country. With a better handle on pandemic preparedness and softening of prices in 2020, there is a buoyancy in sentiment for the Indian home buyers. Watch out for... On the question of sustainable recovery, it must be observed that the bounce back in residential real estate is seen across major cities in India. With the pandemic induced change in lifestyles, people are finding the need to upgrade their houses. This home buying trend has been further supported by low home loan interest rates and an increase in household savings during the pandemic. There are specifically positive sentiments among home buyers and developers for southern cities such as Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, indicative of upward trend in demand in the coming months. Chennai’s ongoing infrastructure development and improved connectivity through the metro rail network in the South and West of the city has maintained its value proposition for many home buyers. In Bengaluru, homes located in the Southern and Eastern parts of the city will continue to remain a favourite amongst home buyers. As for Hyderabad, micro-markets located to the West and North of the city will continue to be the preferred destination for a majority of buyers. The direction of the Covid-19 pandemic going forward and its impact on the economy will have a strong influence on real estate recovery. The future trend of interest rates in the economy along with fiscal measures adopted by State governments will truly dictate the sustainability of this growth trajectory.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||My teacher’s back||To all our teachers who had eyes and antennae on their backs, comes this tribute with admiration, respect — and all our love. ‘Saji,’ Teacher would say, back turned, scrawling on the blackboard. ‘Stop digging your nose!’ Saji, who had been in the middle of an excavation to find oil in the Tundra, would stop midway, wide-eyed. All the ear diggers, head-scratchers cavity-pickers, nose-wipers who had waited exclusively for this break, froze instantly. Without turning around, she’d say, ‘And Jane, please share the contents of that note with the whole class.’ Note-passing was an activity so surreptitious that the Gestapo could have copyrighted it. Notes zigzagged across class, smuggled under desks, stuck into socks, flown via paper planes. The notes usually contained completely false accusations of who was seen with whom or scandalous arrangements of body parts. ‘It’s — um — two circles, Miss. We were practising geometry.’ I firmly believe my creative storytelling skills began there. Teacher’s back contained a bloodhound’s nose as well to pinpoint the originator of a stink bomb. And elephant ears. ‘I heard that!’ got 40 voices stoutly protesting, ‘It was not me, Miss.’ The multiple double chins on Teacher’s back would wobble in silent laughter. Maths problems were the most anticipated (what?!), especially the complex ones that required giant leaps (of faith) for mankind. Those kept Teacher at the blackboard even longer, scribbling out the solution for her ungrateful class. That was the Breaking News Hour. ‘Did you hear a 4th grader fainted in the loo?’ To which quicker solutions than maths were offered: ‘Must have been after you ate lunch!’ ‘Lina,’ Teacher barked. ‘Would you like to solve this next step?’ Lina, who was salivating over aTrue Romancecomic, would have rather been sucked into the Tundra tunnel. ‘I have a pain, Miss,’ she’d appeal. ‘Where?’ ‘In my stomach, Miss.’ ‘Good, then nothing wrong with your legs. Walk here and solve it.’ Still turned, Teacher said, ‘And throw that dirty comic in the wastepaper basket while you’re at it.’ Saina, who had stolen the comic book from her elder sister, hissed, ‘I will kill you. I will maim you. I will break your teeth!’ We bore war wounds from the Back-Time. It was the agreed time to break into strenuous physical activity that not even PT Sir could otherwise urge us to. Pelting pencils, erasers, (books are gods, don’t you dare!) and half-eaten jam- parathas at each other. Sometimes, a fry drenched in ketchup landed on Teacher’s desk. Dishu once leaned so far out to cheat from the next desk that she fell over and cut her chin. Sara flung an ink pen at the first bench, that both opened up to drench someone’s shirt and nearly took out someone else’s eye (two-in-one school record till today). When the bell signalled freedom, Teacher walked out proudly, job well done. I swear I saw her pop that fry into her mouth and pick up the dirty comic on her way out. Her back smiled back at me.

04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The sin of sameness||If there’s one thing that the video presentations at the recently-concluded India Couture Week said as one, it is that the designers have been thinking grand. From Falguni & Shane taking their collection to the Taj Mahal (a true feat, considering how famously inimical the babus at the ASI can be) to Gaurav Gupta’s Universal Love show shot at the Taj Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad, this season was all about location, location, location. Shantanu & Nikhil shot their lineup, Oasis, at Suryagarh in Jaisalmer. Varun Bahl’s Memory / Mosaic came alive at the Andaz Aerocity and Anju Modi’s The Eternal Story unfolded at The Banyan Farm, both on the outskirts of the capital. Rahul Mishra’s Kam-Khab had its outing at a 300-year-old haveli in Mandawa, Rajasthan. The fact that so many of India’s most creative minds thought of such locations at the same time is significant. Especially when travelling is, to put it mildly, a little more difficult than before. It mirrors what people have been feeling for a while. Stifled, caged. Designers chose to focus on the idea of travel as their backdrop specifically because such places now offer safe and luxurious locations and experiences, not to mention great wedding packages.  A hackneyed narrative   If you feel I’ve digressed from talking about fashion — this is, after all, an op-ed on a fashion week — you are absolutely right. Because while capturing the zeitgeist, while ensuring that they place their haute couture in the most luxurious settings, and showing how their clothes may be worn by brides, grooms, families, and friends, our designers have succumbed, collectively, to the sin of sameness. Setting aside a few, almost all designers chose to portray some version of the How-To-Luxury-Wedding theme, where the clothes fell into categories and the stories took centerstage. Nobody spoke about the craft of couture, except Tarun Tahiliani and Rahul Mishra. Which brings me to this: we are quick to take pride in our traditional crafts, textiles, and embellishments. We are just as quick to bring up our deep-rooted work with India’s craft clusters at every opportunity, most significantly on social media. But the way we choose to market the beautiful outcomes of all those painstaking efforts is through pandering to hackneyed visions of marital glamour. We tell stories that have nothing to do with what we have designed and made. The sin of sameness manifests in the narratives. Its devices are the following: long, lingering shots of beautiful models, their translucent dupatas flying, the richness of Indian flora represented by gulaab , mogra , and genda strewn around. There are handsome men striding in slow motion. And there are courtyards filled with beautiful friends, dancing. Stately mothers and indulgent fathers in haute couture; jewels to ransom entire countries. Everything is royal, or a version of. Here, it is India’s artisanship that recedes into obscurity. We saw a form of collective outrage when Sabyasachi’s mass-market H&M collaboration was launched because it didn’t fulfil made-up expectations of how India’s crafts should be represented worldwide. We see none of that when an entire fashion week dedicated to haute couture — a space where designers can and should explode with creativity — sells us a tired and uniform vision of The Royal Romance. Which disservice is the greater? Is the future of our most creative minds and skilled hands to be tied to the monopoly that is the shaadi economy? Smart businesspeople are innovative. They diversify and constantly create new markets. Look at Schiapparelli. Or Marc Jacobs. Closer home, look at designers who make haute couture that’s not remotely bridal or traditional. Whether they show at Couture Week or not is immaterial, but they refuse to cater solely to old (and new) money and recognise the potential of the informed, style-conscious, and willing-to-invest younger consumers of high fashion. And they’re not the only ones we need to look at by far.  Time to shun vanilla   Ioften speak about respecting tradition but not being bound by it. Which is not some mind-boggling new concept, really. But when I look at haute couture in India today, I see an irony emerging. Our social media is filled with images of truly modern ideas. There are heartwarming tales of LGBTQIA+ weddings, marriages where brides wear two-piece suits, middle-age romances, and older people marrying for love and companionship. The conversation about size has progressed to the point where designers are (slowly) getting better at featuring models of different shapes and body structures. Jewellery labels are making ads that challenge long-held notions. But our haute couture videos stubbornly depict only the most vanilla narratives. We’ve willingly imposed a brahminical heteronormativity on our collective creativity in the name of business. Since when did fashion become so weak, so afraid? If this were a regular, physical fashion presentation where only those who can afford wedding couture were invited, all that I have said would be irrelevant. But the migration to an all-access video format outed on social media has made it relevant to even those who can’t. And this means that designers now have an added responsibility — towards the continued growth of the artisanal sectors and craftspeople they work with. They have the power now to set the tone. With this in mind, we need to ask if the shaadi market, while it may sustain us economically, is enough. Are we here simply to survive? To bow to this monopoly even unto the erasure of our creative voices? Only our designers, whose very job it is to offer solutions, can answer these questions.  Varun Rana is a fashion commentator and consultant, and is currently consulting with label Shantanu & Nikhil which is mentioned in this feature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-sin-of-sameness/article36284489.ece
04 September 2021||September 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Geneva Watch Days, an update||The contrast between Geneva Watch Days, not controlled by a consortium, and the big watch fairs couldn’t be more striking. While the first, which came to a close on Friday, is informal, open to the public, and spread across hotel suites and retail showrooms across the city, the fairs are by invitation. As was Watches and Wonders earlier this year, a star-studded affair including virtual fireside chats with watch CEOs and a social media blitz. The Geneva Watch Days Instagram account, meanwhile, has just one post since the show began. That’s it. But the independents are truly celebrated here, with the announcement about the pre-owned platform WatchBox investing in the Swiss watchmaker, De Bethune, creating a stir on forums and Clubhouse rooms. Meanwhile, here are some brands that made an impact:     The brand has gone from Bentley to muscle cars, screamed headlines, about Breitling’s Top Time capsule collection. Inspired by classic American sports cars from the 1960s — the Chevrolet Corvette, Shelby Cobra and Ford Mustang — the three new chronographs have a distinctive colour and car logo. In a 44 mm case (the Shelby is 40 mm with calibre 41) they are in limited volume, a good way to keep the interest high. Approx. Rs. 4.1 lakh.  Bulgari Octo Roma Worldtimer  A nod to international travel picking up soon, the sporty Octo Roma WorldTimer was planned before the pandemic, says Antoine Pin, MD of the brand’s watch division. With a softer and more rounded shape, it has a blue dial, steel case, and a rotating world time disc operated with the crown. With BVL257 calibre and a smaller dial that is neat on the wrist. Approx. $8,350.  Ulysse Nardin Marine Torpilleur collection  Marking the brand’s 175th anniversary, the Marine Torpilleur collection has seven new models with two new movements, complications, chronographs, and enamelled dials. This is a wrist watch with all the codes and mechanics you can find on a marine chronometer. Each piece is numbered, with the moon-face complication (here) having calibre 119, a variation of 118. Approx. $8,200-$42,400.  Czapek & Cie Antarctique Rattrapante     This Swiss watchmaker made an impact last year with its luxury sports contender. In the new Rattrapante, the split-seconds chronograph movement is visible from the dial side. With the automatic calibre SXH6, icy steel case and bracelet, it has created a buzz this week. And the limited edition, 77 pieces, has been swiped up for approx. CHF 46,000.  GWD was from August 30 till September 3 .

The assurance by Mr. Rana, Minister for Sugarcane Development and Sugar Mills, comes two days before the scheduled mahapanchayat called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha in Muzaffarnagar on September 5. Mr. Rana reiterated the promise made by Mr. Adityanath recently that his government would hike the procurement price for cane after discussions with all stakeholders. Mr. Rana, addressing a press briefing, said talks at the Cane Commissioner and Chief Secretary level had concluded and said the CM had also met cane farmers recently in Lucknow and took inputs from them. The Chief Minister wanted to hold talks with more farmer outfits and delegations, said Mr. Rana. He said the government would provide farmers with a “good price” after analysing all aspects. “Farmers are on our main agenda,” he said. The BJP government’s assurances of hiking the procurement price for cane, along with withdrawing cases lodged against farmers for burning stubble, come at a time when farmer outfits in western U.P. are protesting against the three farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/yogi-to-hold-talks-with-cane-farmers/article36284155.ece
04 September 2021||New DELHI,||HC grants bail to five persons in north-east Delhi riots case||The right to protest and express dissent is a right, which occupies a fundamental stature in a democratic polity and the sole act of protesting should not be employed as a weapon to justify the incarceration of those who are exercising this right, the Delhi High Court said on Friday while granting bail to five persons in a north-east Delhi riots case. Bailed perons Justice Subramonium Prasad granted bail to Tabassum, a married woman with two children, who was arrested in October 2020. The High Court also granted bail to Suvaleen, Furkan, Mohd Arif and Shabad Ahmed, who were arrested between March and May in 2020. All five persons were arraigned as accused in connection with the death of a Head Constable during the north-east Delhi riots. “When there is a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object,” Justice Prasad observed. “There cannot be an umbrella assumption of guilt on behalf of every accused by the court, and every decision must be taken based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances in the matter,” the judge said. Opposing the bail plea, Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju stated that on the morning of February 24, 2020, a crowd carrying various weapons such as danda s, lathi s, baseball bats, iron rods and stones, convened at the main Wazirabad Road and refused to pay heed to the orders of senior officers and the police force. Mr. Raju stated that the crowd soon got out of control and started pelting stones at the police officers, and resultantly, more than 50 police personnel suffered injuries and Head Constable Ratan Lal was shot dead. Mr. Raju added the protestors turned violent, burnt private and public vehicles as well as other properties in the vicinity, including a petrol pump and a car showroom. Justice Prasad, however, remarked, “The applicability of Section 149 IPC (unlawful assembly), specifically read with Section 302 (murder), cannot be done on the basis of vague evidence and general allegations.” The judge noted that the five persons had been added as accused by way of charge-sheet and that none of them had been explicitly caught on any CCTV camera in connection with the crime. “It is egregious and against the principles enshrined in our Constitution to allow an accused to remain languishing behind bars during the pendency of the trial,” Justice Prasad said, adding, “Bail is the rule and jail is the exception.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-grants-bail-to-five-persons-in-north-east-delhi-riots-case/article36284157.ece

This programme has helped in creating an environment of education leadership.” “Our school heads have to play a role as education leaders. This will not only benefit the schools of a cluster but also the rest of the citizens living within the geographical radius of that cluster and an environment for education will be created in the entire region,” Mr. Sisodia said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/schools-need-to-expand-role-to-make-education-a-mass-movement-sisodia/article36284162.ece

Pictures of Gopal Mandal, Janata Dal (United) MLA, wearing only minimal clothing on a train journey were shared on social media. He allegedly verbally abused a co-passenger who had raised an objection. A fellow passenger has lodged a complaint against the MLA with the Government Railway Police at New Delhi railway station for “misbehaving and snatching of gold items”. “Yes, I had an upset stomach and there was an urgent need to go to the washroom, so I couldn’t wear anything else... I do not lie,” said Mr. Mandal. During the train journey, Railway Protection Force personnel and the ticket examiner had to intervene to calm the situation. Mr. Mandal said there were no female passengers in the coach. “I accept that it should not have happened. I had an urgent need to go to the washroom, so I couldn’t put on other clothes,” he said.
