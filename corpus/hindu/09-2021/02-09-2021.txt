02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||GST collections dip in Aug., but Finance Ministry sees growth||Gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues in August fell to Rs. 1.12 lakh crore from Rs. 1.16 lakh crore collected the previous month. The Finance Ministry said the collections, which pertain largely to economic activity in July, indicated a “fast” economic recovery underway. But independent economists perceived it as a signal of an uneven and weak rebound. “The revenues for August 2021 are 30% higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year. Even as compared to the August revenues in 2019-20 of Rs. 98,202 crore, this [Rs. 1,12,020 crore collection] is a growth of 14%,” the Ministry stated, suggesting that the GST revenues have gone past their pre-pandemic levels. The GST collections had fallen below the Rs. 1 lakh crore mark in June due to the second COVID-19 wave after a nine-month streak above that threshold. “With the easing out of COVID-19 restrictions, the GST collections for July and August 2021 have again crossed Rs. 1 lakh crore, which clearly indicates that the economy is recovering at a fast pace,” the Ministry said. Chief economist of rating agency ICRA Aditi Nayar said the sequential dip in the GST revenues “belied the healthy improvement in the e-way bills to a daily average of 2.1 million in July 2021 from 1.8 million in June 2021, which was reflective of the lifting of restrictions, especially across the southern States”. “The dip in GST collections, lower than expected core sector growth, and moderation in the August manufacturing PMI [Purchasing Managers’ Index] suggest that some caution is warranted regarding the strength of the recovery that is underway in the ongoing quarter,” she observed. But the government exuded confidence that the “robust GST revenues are likely to continue” in the coming months as well, as “economic growth” and anti-evasion activities, especially against “fake billers”, have been contributing to the GST kitty. Rajat Bose, partner at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co., said the upshot from the latest numbers was the healthy 30%-plus increase in GST in manufacturing States such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Among the larger States, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka both recorded a 35% jump in GST revenues, followed by Andhra Pradesh (33%), Maharashtra (31%) and Gujarat (25%). Overall, the GST revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) were 27% higher in August year-on-year. Of the Rs. 1,12,020 crore revenues in August, the Central GST (CGST) was Rs. 20,522 crore, the State GST (SGST) Rs. 26,605 crore, and the Integrated GST Rs. 56,247 crore (including Rs. 26,884 crore collected on import of goods). Compensation Cess of Rs. 8,646 crore was collected, of which import of goods contributed Rs. 646 crore. “The total revenue of the Centre and the States after regular and ad hoc settlements in August 2021 is Rs. 55,565 crore for the CGST and Rs. 57,744 crore for the SGST,” the Ministry said. ‘Uptrend may continue’ EY India tax partner Abhishek Jain said the collections were for the supplies made in July, when lockdown restrictions were relaxed in most parts of the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gst-collections-dip-in-aug-but-finance-ministry-sees-growth/article36240353.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Students return to new set of rules in schools||The pitter-patter of raindrops and footsteps brought schools back to life in the Capital on Wednesday morning. Students of Classes IX-XII returned to their schools after one and a half years of online learning in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The usual cheer associated with returning to school after a long break was, however, missing as students had to maintain strict discipline while lining up for temperature checks, sanitising their hands and maintaining social distancing while sitting in the classrooms. Many schools decided to take some time before starting classes. Students were allowed to attend school only after taking permission from their parents as the Delhi government’s guidelines said their attendance was not mandatory and classes would continue in blended mode. Earlier in January, schools had opened for a short period to allow students appearing for Board exams to complete the practical component of their assessment. The government has instructed teachers not to rush into teaching-learning activities and ease students back into school life by assessing their social-emotional well-being through dialogue so that the children can be brought out of the mentally unsettling phase and the extent of the learning gap created by the pandemic can be assessed. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said, “Schools were closed for the last one and a half years due to the pandemic. During this period, there was a lot of damage to the education of children... If schools and colleges are not opened now, an entire generation will move forward with a knowledge gap.” Full alert mode He said all schools have been instructed to be on full alert mode and ensure that COVID-related protocols and social distancing are followed. “Based on the experiences of the first round, the decision on opening the school for other classes will be taken. At present, schools are being opened with 50 per cent capacity, but once these protocols become a habit among the students, schools will open with full capacity,” Mr. Sisodia said. The students said they were happy to be back at school. Many of them were unable to keep up with the learning as they did not have exclusive access to a smartphone or computer. “We sent our teachers assignments and even moved forward to the next class but the feeling of learning in school could not happen at home,” said Sapna Kumari, a student of a school in Lajpat Nagar. Sachin Srivastava, a Class XII student of Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School in Pushp Vihar, said that he was excited to be back at school. “My parents let me attend offline classes as I have been at home all this while. I am really happy that I will get to see my friends more frequently now,” said Sachin.

02 September 2021||HYDERABAD,||Telangana walks out of KRMB meeting||Telangana on Wednesday staged a walkout at the meeting of the Krishna River Management Board after the board refused to concede the State government’s plea to be allowed to generate power at Srisailam hydel station. During the heated arguments at the board meeting presided by M.P. Singh, Special Chief Secretary of irrigation of Telangana Rajat Kumar made a forceful point that the State generated power at Srisailam only to evacuate water from the reservoir to meet its irrigation and drinking water requirements from Nagarjunasagar downstream. The water was anyway getting stored at Nagarjunasagar and also meeting the needs of Krishna delta system. He said there was no other way for Telangana but step up its power generation to meet its large requirement of power for its lift irrigation schemes. Telangana was largely dependent on its lift irrigation because geographically it was on a higher plateau and the rivers flowed at a lower level. Mr. Kumar questioned the rationale of the board in stopping Telangana from generation at Srisailam. The board decided to retain water sharing in the river between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the ratio of 66:34 for the current year. The board also did not concede the request of Telangana that the unutilised share of the State in its water allocation for a year be carried foward to next year. The State did not use 45 tmc ft water in 2020-21 and 50 tmc ft in 2019-20. Another request of Telangana that did not find favour with the board was its request that the surplus water over and above 811 tmc ft which was the water allocation for the combined State in the Krishna be accounted. Telangana insisted on accounting the surplus water as Andhra Pradesh was diverting a huge quantum during flooding from Pothireddypadu head regulator. AP and Telangana shared 811 tmc ft in the ratio of 512:299 tmc ft. Telangana argued that the agreement to share water in this ratio was temporarily fixed for 2015-16. But, the board was not convinced. Mr. Kumar argued that Telangana wanted the ratio revised to 50:50 till an award was delivered by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal - II. This was because the State’s requirement in the Krishna increased considerably after the completion of Kalwakurthi, Nettempadu and Bheema lift-irrigation projects. They served the entire ayacut of these projects. The demand for water sharing in the ratio of 70:30 mooted by Andhra Pradesh was turned down by Telangana. Besides Mr. Kumar, Telangana was represented by its Engineer-in-Chief of irrigation C. Muralidhar and Chief Engineer of Inter-State River Water (ISRW) division Mohan Kumar. Andhra Pradesh’s Principal Irrigation Secretary Shamal Rao, ENC Narayan Reddy and ISRW Chief Engineer Srinivas Reddy were present. Later, the two sides attended the joint meeting of Krishna and Godavari river management boards on the recent gazette notification of Centre on the scope of the boards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/telangana-walks-out-of-krmb-meeting/article36240297.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Breakthrough infections on expected lines: report||Amidst reports of rising numbers of “breakthrough infections”, or infections following two doses of vaccine, in India, a government body said these numbers are on expected lines but did not officially quantify the extent of such infections. “The number of reported vaccination breakthroughs in India are well within the numbers expected from the total number of infections, the fraction of population that is vaccinated and the known reduction in effectiveness of Covishield/Covaxin against infections by Delta. Vaccines continue to protect against severe disease and remain a cornerstone of public health strategy,” the India SARS-CoV-2 Genome Consortium (INSACOG) said in a weekly report. The INSACOG is a consortium of laboratories coordinated by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). The published efficacy of Covaxin and Covishield from Phase 3 clinical trials has shown that they range from 70%-90% but their efficacy at preventing transmission is significantly reduced against newer variants such as Delta. Like other vaccines, they have been designed on the older version of the virus isolated from Wuhan, China. Cases among health staff Last week, a study by scientists at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology and the Max Hospitals Group in Delhi, revealed that nearly a quarter of 600 fully vaccinated healthcare workers were reinfected. Earlier, studies from the Christian Medical College, Vellore and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education Research, Chandigarh, too, had reported between 1%-10% of fully vaccinated healthcare workers as having been reinfected. However, less than 5% of them have required hospitalisation and no deaths have been confirmed, indicating that vaccines continued to be effective — even against Delta variants — in preventing severe sickness and death. The latest INSACOG report also noted that Delta continued to be the dominant lineage in India, though some of the Delta variants were in the process of being reclassified into sub-lineages comprising the ‘Delta plus’ category because of slight variations in the mutations that they manifested. One of these Delta plus categories is called AY.12, which raised concern after being associated with several cases of breakthrough infections in Israel. However, this wasn’t yet of concern in India. “It is specifically noted that the expanding phylogenetic cluster of AY.12 that was first noted in Israel, is not yet seen in India,” the INSACOG noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/breakthrough-infections-on-expected-lines-report/article36240349.ece
02 September 2021||CHENNAI,||Govt. hospitals ramp up vaccination of staff, students||Government hospitals in Chennai are ramping up the vaccination of their staff and medical students on campus. With most healthcare providers and medical students having been vaccinated either partially or fully, hospitals have fast-tracked the inoculation of the remaining persons, including hospital workers, through special drives on campus. T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, said the COVID-19 vaccination coverage of the staff of government hospitals and medical students was good. Most of them had taken the first dose of the vaccine. With the focus currently on ramping up the administration of the second dose, he said, “We are having a line list and are focusing on them individually. Healthcare workers should set an example for others, and they should take the lead in getting vaccinated. Healthcare workers and frontline staff should understand that they are more at risk when compared to the general public, in view of their profession. Taking two doses will ensure better protection against COVID-19, including its variants.” E. Theranirajan, dean of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, said that overall, the acceptance of vaccines had improved, and 100% coverage with a single dose had been achieved on campus. “All medical students have received the first dose,” he said. The hospital is conducting a special drive to vaccinate the outsourced workers involved in housekeeping and security on campus, as less than half of them have been vaccinated so far. At the Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital, 100% coverage was achieved in the vaccination of doctors, medical students and multi-purpose workers, according to dean R. Jayanthi. Around 81% of nurses and 87% of hospital workers have been vaccinated so far. “We are conducting a special drive to cover the remaining nurses and workers. We hope to complete it within a week,” she said. Dr. Jayanthi added that vaccination prevented morbidity and mortality. Hence, it was imperative that all were fully vaccinated. The Government Stanley Medical College achieved 100% coverage of its eligible staff and medical students, dean P. Balaji said. “Except for four doctors who cannot take the vaccine due to certain health conditions, all our staff have been vaccinated with two doses. Those who had contracted the infection also got inoculated after three months,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-hospitals-ramp-up-vaccination-of-staff-students/article36240481.ece
02 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Single digital platform for delivery of govt. services||The State Cabinet on Wednesday decided to create a single digital platform for the delivery of various government services. The Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RBDKI) project also seeks to create an online portal to identify and select beneficiaries of social welfare schemes transparently to ensure accurate targetting of pensions, relief, compensations, free housing, and subsidies. The Cabinet also cleared the creation of an Aadhaar Data Vault to protect information volunteered by citizens. It sanctioned Rs. 34.32 crore for the project. In an explanatory note, the Cabinet said the government funded more than 400 social welfare schemes. At present, different departments administered the schemes, resulting in overlaps. The proposed platform will bring the selection of beneficiaries and disbursal of welfare under one administrative umbrella to preempt such anomalies. The scheme will render the selection of welfare pension payees transparent. It will consider the family as the base unit, create a unified registry of beneficiaries, and weed out those not eligible for welfare. The Cabinet also decided to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to allow courts to issue summons to persons via electronic means and digital media. The government gave administrative sanctions for constructing railway overbridges at Kariyannur and Sudheelapadi in Palakkad using the funds of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. The Cabinet appointed T.N. Seema as the Nava Keralam Karma Padhathi coordinator for three years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/single-digital-platform-for-delivery-of-govt-services/article36240749.ece
02 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Moves afoot to bring down e-vehicle prices, says CESL CEO||Having launched an electric two-wheeler sales scheme for government employees in Kerala, Convergence Energy Services Ltd. (CESL) is hoping to play a bigger role in helping the State chant the e-mobility mantra. The newly established subsidiary of the Union government-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd. (EESL) is planning an electric three-wheeler scheme for garbage removal trucks. The CESL is also in talks with the Kochi Metro Rail Limited for operating feeder buses for last-mile connectivity, its MD & CEO Mahua Acharya told The Hindu on Wednesday. “We feel that Kerala consumers are ready (for e-vehicles). In the two-wheeler market there are plenty of options. We would like to promote electric three-wheelers for garbage disposal. Isn’t it a little bit ironic, using a diesel-powered vehicle to pick up the garbage? e-vehicles are silent and cleaner,” Ms. Acharya said. The CESL has launched the digital marketplace, MyEV (www.myev.org.in), to make things easier for the consumer. Efforts are on to make vehicle prices more attractive through subsidies and long-term loans, she said. “Affordability is the big issue for the consumer. We are doing the financial structuring at the back-end so that e-vehicle competes closely with their fossil fuel equivalents. We are trying to bring down the sticker price,” she said. Cost of batteries The high cost of batteries, a major concern for buyers, is expected to come down. “ In the long run, the CESL also hopes to introduce exchange schemes which help remove old fossil fuel two-wheelers from the roads. At the national level, the CESL is involved in initiatives ranging from decentralised solar power projects to e-mobility to solarising feeders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/moves-afoot-to-bring-down-e-vehicle-prices-says-cesl-ceo/article36240752.ece
02 September 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra government to form council for climate change||Recognising the gravity of the climate change crisis, the Maharashtra government will constitute a council for climate change, State Environment and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray said on Wednesday. The council would be headed by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and co-chaired by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. An action plan to deal with climate-related challenges affecting Maharashtra would be presented before the State Cabinet within a month, Mr. Aaditya Thackeray said. “Climate change is a pressing and grave issue and I believe we face a climate emergency. Today, we presented the summary of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report regarding carbon impact before the State Cabinet. After this, it was decided by the Cabinet to form a State council on climate change. Henceforth, we will be making a presenting every month before the Cabinet,” Mr. Aaditya Thackeray told journalists after the Cabinet meeting. Monthly reports He said that the State Environment Ministry would formulate the climate action plan for concerned departments like Energy, Transport, Urban Development, and Industry, and seek the Cabinet’s approval for the same. “The State Council for Climate Change will be monitoring and presenting the progress report to the Cabinet each month,” Mr. Aaditya Thackeray said. The State will also work on the 5Rs — Reduce, Refuse, Reuse, Recycle, Recover — declared by the United Nations, said a statement issued after the Cabinet meeting. Noting that weather patterns had changed dramatically in the State over the past decade, the Environment Minister said that climatic transformation had triggered landslides with greater frequency besides raising temperatures during the summer months and reducing the number of winter days. “We recognise the importance of climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the need to act now. We do not have the luxury of time. The State government has already taken multiple actions on the climate front, like adopting the EV (electric vehicles) policy, conserving the Aarey Colony green space… within a month, we will be having interdepartmental conferences where we will be finalising our goals,” he said. Plan for Mumbai Last week, Mr. Thackeray had launched Mumbai’s first climate action plan developed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) with technical support from the World Resources Institute India. At the time, Mr. Thackeray had said that further delays would make Mumbai “unliveable” in a decade’s time. The BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal had given sober warning at the launch of the Mumbai Climate Action Plan, by saying that 70% of the area under four administrative wards in the city, including the upmarket Cuffe Parade, Nariman Point and the Secretariat itself, could be underwater by 2050. Last month’s IPCC report had said extreme sea level events that previously occurred once in 100 years could happen every year by the end of this century with scientists warning that rise in sea level, floods, heavy rainfall and glacier melting could be some irreversible effects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maharashtra-government-to-form-council-for-climate-change/article36240903.ece
02 September 2021||PALAKKAD,||Kerala panchayat office bans ‘sir’, ‘madam’||The Mathur gram panchayat in Kerala’s Palakkad district has become the first local body in the country to ban the use of salutations like ‘Sir’ and ‘Madam’. A special meeting of the panchayat council on Tuesday took the historic decision that could likely kickstart a wave of reforms in the use of official language. The panchayat viewed salutations like ‘Sir’ and ‘Madam’ as remnants of the colonial rule. “It’s been 75 years since we secured freedom from the British. It’s time we showed the supremacy of the people in a democratic government,” said P.R. Prasad, vice-president of the Mathur panchayat, moving a resolution. People reaching the panchayat office for various purposes will no longer have to call officials “Sir” or “Madam”. Instead, they can address them by their designations or names. Every panchayat official will now display their names on their table. If people feel addressing an elderly or senior person by name will be disrespectful, they can use the more friendly and endearing terms likeCheta(elder brother) orChechi(elder sister). The panchayat has asked the Official Language Department to suggest proper alternatives to “Sir” and “Madam”. The panchayat also decided to drop words like‘apekshikkunnu’or‘abhyarthikkunnu’(meaning I request) in letters. Instead, people can use‘avakasapedunnu’(I demand) or‘thalparyapedunnu’(I desire). The panchayat has displayed a notice outside the office telling people that if anyone is denied any service for not using the banned words, they can complain to the panchayat president or secretary. “In a democracy, government officials and elected representatives are the servants, the people are the supreme authority. People should not be at our mercy for their rights,” said Mr. Prasad. Mathur panchayat president Pravitha Muraleedharan said it was a bold step towards reducing the gap between officials and the people. The panchayat council took the decision unanimously, assuming that scrapping words that indicate colonial hangover will bring in an air of friendliness.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/panchayat-in-kerala-bans-sir-and-madam-in-its-office/article36240345.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||No SC, ST, OBC quota for NRIs for NEET||When Rohit Vinod applied for NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) this year, the online form asked him to select his nationality and the Indian citizen, who is a Kuwaiti resident, selected the “NRI” option. However, on the next page that asked him to select the category, he was only given the option of “general”, although he had expected to be able to opt for Other Backward Classes and avail of reservation. His case, now pending with the Kerala High Court, raises the question of whether NRIs are eligible for community quota. Senior Health Ministry officials say they are operating on the principle of one candidate being able to opt for only one quota category, even if eligible for multiple categories. “Why should NRIs be denied community-based reservation? Are we not Indian citizens who are guaranteed constitutional rights? Why are we being treated similar to the foreigners’ category?” asks his father Vinod Karthikeyan. Shiv, another 18-year-old NRI based in a Gulf country who did not want to be identified with a surname, discovered the opposite problem. When he selected “Indian” under nationality while applying for NEET last year, he was not eligible for the NRI quota seats offered by deemed universities as well as some Central medical institutions, including JIPMER. When he applied again this year, he was about to choose “NRI” before being told that this would not allow him to opt for the OBC quota.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-sc-st-obc-quota-for-nris-appearing-for-neet/article36240350.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Split accounts to tax EPF income: Ministry||The government has decided to split existing Provident Fund (PF) accounts into two separate accounts in order to operationalise the new tax on PF income arising out of employee contributions exceeding Rs. 2.5 lakh a year. The Finance Ministry notified new Income Tax rules to this effect on Tuesday, but experts said this could prove to be an administrative nightmare for the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and a few thousand employers who manage their workers’ EPF savings in-house. “For the purpose of calculation of taxable interest…, separate accounts within the provident fund account shall be maintained during the previous year 2021-2022 and all subsequent previous years for taxable contribution and non-taxable contribution made by a person,” according to the Income-Tax (25th Amendment) Rules, 2021. Accordingly, all EPF accounts will have to be bifurcated into a taxable and non-taxable contribution account, with the latter including their closing account balance as on March 31, 2021, any contributions made thereafter that are “not included in the taxable contribution account” and annual interest accrued on these two components. 24.77 crore accounts To put that in context, the EPFO had 24.77 crore members with EPF accounts, of which 14.36 crore members had been allotted Unique Account Numbers (UAN) as of March 31, 2020. About 5 crore of these members were active contributors into their EPF accounts during 2019-20. The calculation of taxable interest for the year shall be computed as the interest accrued during the previous year in the taxable contribution account where all contributions over Rs. 2.5 lakh a year would be parked. The same threshold is Rs. 5 lakh for PF accounts where employers do not contribute, but most EPF accounts, by definition, usually include matching contributions from employers and employees of 12% of monthly salary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/split-accounts-to-tax-epf-income/article36240351.ece
02 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||‘High attendance shows parents’ willingness to send children to school’||The attendance of students in schools is encouraging and it reflects the interest of the students in attending offline classes and willingness of their parents to send their wards for classroom teaching, Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh told The Hindu on Tuesday. The Minister was responding to a query on the serious observations made by the Andhra Pradesh High Court on reopening of schools while the COVID-19 pandemic was still prevalent. While directing the State government to vacate the village/ward secretariats and Rythu Bharosa Kendras from the premises of government schools, the High Court on Tuesday said their presence could result in spread of the Coronavirus. The court asked the government as to how it could allow reopening of schools at a time when the pandemic was still prevalent and wondered who would take the responsibility if the students were infected with the virus. The Minister, however, cited 85% attendance of students in all government schools, and maintained that the elaborate arrangements made by the government in line with COVID protocol on school campuses had given confidence to children and their parents to attend offline classes. “Only in a few primary sections of certain private schools, the attendance is slightly low,” he said, adding: “The classes have already commenced amidst a series of precautions needed to keep the virus at bay.” The Minister said schools where more than 10 children tested positive for COVID-19 virus were being closed down. Mr. Suresh said if and when the third wave hits, there would be no other option but to move the classes to online mode. “We may not be able to reach out to 100% students, but we will explore all modes to continue the learning process,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/high-attendance-shows-parents-willingness-to-send-children-to-school/article36240346.ece

02 September 2021||Srinagar,||Separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani dies||Hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, 91, passed away at his Srinagar residence on Wednesday night, according to family sources. Under strict house arrest for around a decade, Geelani, a resident of Sopore, developed “breathing complications” on Wednesday night around 10:30 p.m. and breathed his last, the family sources said. Of late, Geelani, a resident of Sopore, was had been battling severe lung ailments and dementia. He was looked after by his sons, who were allowed by the administration to visit him. There is no official word on the cause of death. Police sources said security arrangements were being made for his final rites of Geelani, who had desired to be buried at Srinagar’s ‘Martyrs’ Graveyard’ where most militants and separatist leaders are buried. However, the police would ensure the funeral is attended by a limited number of his relatives. “Security has been tightened across the Valley,” a police official said. Geelani, a three-time legislator from north Kashmir’s Sopore, was active in the political landscape of J&K for around five decades. He served as a senior member of now banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and also headed the hawkish faction of Hurriyat, which opposed any unconditional dialogue with the Centre and advocated J&K’s accession with Pakistan. He resigned as head of the Hurriyat in June 2020, eight months after the Centre ended J&K’s special constitutional position. “Saddened by the news of Geelani sahab’s passing away. We may not have agreed on most things but I respect him for his steadfastness and standing by his beliefs. May Allah Ta’aala grant him jannat and condolences to his family & well-wishers,” former Chief Minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said in a tweet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/separatist-leader-syed-ali-geelani-dies/article36240397.ece

The court directed the regional passport officer in Chennai to return her passport on submission of an affidavit containing her itinerary. Justice R. Mahadevan also ordered that she should undertake to appear, whenever necessary, either before the RPO or the courts where a couple of criminal cases are pending against her. Senior counsel P. Wilson said it was unfair on the part of the RPO to have impounded her passport citing the criminal cases. Claiming that she was yet to receive any summons from the courts concerned in those cases, the senior counsel said the impounding of the passport had made it impossible for her to accompany her husband when he required her the most. He argued that the RPO’s insistence on obtaining a no-objection certificate from the trial courts concerned was arbitrary and illegal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-permits-premalatha-to-travel-to-dubai/article36240492.ece

In August, the IMD forecast rainfall to be 101% of the seasonal average, but it now expects it to be around 98%, with a 4% error window. The spurt in September will help sowing in central India, which is seeing a large rain deficit, but would be insufficient to completely bridge the nearly 9% shortfall in all-India monsoon rainfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/above-normal-rain-in-sept-forecasts-imd/article36240929.ece

02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Above normal’ rain in September: IMD||After a 24% deficit monsoon rain in August, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday that while rain in September — the last monsoon month — would be “above normal”, the overall June-September rainfall would be at the “lower end” of normal. In August, the IMD forecast rainfall to be 101% of the seasonal average, but it now expects it to be around 98%, with a 4% error window. Surplus in south The spurt in September will help sowing in central India, which is seeing a large rain deficit, but would be insufficient to completely bridge the nearly 9% shortfall in all-India monsoon rainfall. All regions — northwest, central and eastern and northeast — are seeing deficits in rainfall, except for the southern peninsula, which has reported an 8% surplus. “The rainfall averaged over the country as a whole during September 2021 is most likely to be above normal (above 110% of the long period average) which is about 170 mm,” the IMD said in a statement. “ Considering the expected above normal rainfall activity during September 2021, the current deficiency is very likely to reduce, and accumulated seasonal rainfall during 1 June to 30 September 2021 is very likely to be around lower end of the normal.” Had rainfall been above 100% as the IMD had forecast in April and June, this would have been a rare event with three consecutive years of normal or above normal rainfall. Director-General, IMD, M. Mohapatra said at a news conference that the reasons for the IMD’s inability to predict the August shortfall were being looked into. “The models that we were using, while able to predict the regions where there would be a shortfall, were unable to predict the quantum of deficit. These are relatively newer models and are still being improved.” Negative dipole The factors that caused the August deficit were a “negative” Indian Ocean Dipole, characterised by warmer eastern Indian Ocean and colder closer to the Indian coast, which is considered unhelpful for the monsoon. Also, there were no significant depressions, that push the rain rising from the Bay of Bengal in August, unlike the two or three that were usual for the month, Mr. Mohapatra said. The central equatorial Pacific was expected to show a “cooling trend” towards September and this could be favourable for the monsoon, Mr. Mohapatra said. But the Indian Ocean temperatures were not expected to be significantly helpful. The IMD has formally adopted a dynamic-modelling approach, whereby the weather conditions are simulated and projected into the future by supercomputer. Though the approach is more accurate at forecasting impending changes in weather a week or two in advance, it has not proved reliable at long-range forecasting in the past three years. For instance, in 2019, the IMD forecast reduced monsoon rainfall at 96% of the LPA but India got record-breaking rainfall at 110% of the average. In 2020, it first forecast 100% of the LPA and updated it to 102%, but India again got a torrential 109% which was outside the 5% error window.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/above-normal-rain-in-september-imd/article36240019.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||No call on bypolls yet, ECI to assess situation||Officials of the Election Commission of India (ECI) are likely to hold a meeting soon to assess the situation in the States where bypolls are due, sources in the Commission said on Wednesday. Byelections to Assembly seats had been deferred by the ECI in May, after the completion of the West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry elections, due to the COVID-19 situation. Since then, more vacancies have come up. Mamata’s clock ticking The All-India Trinamool Congress had written to the ECI on August 26 seeking “immediate announcement” of bypolls in seven West Bengal Assembly seats.

Its supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who lost the election from Nandigram, has till November to become a member of the Assembly in order to retain her post. An official said there had been no decision on holding bypolls yet. However, officials would assess the ongoing situation in the States soon. The Commission would be given a feedback after receiving the inputs from the States.

02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Caste census needed for Muslims too’||Demands for a caste census are not just emanating from political parties in various States but also from organisations connected with the Pasmanda Muslim community, with the All India Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz raising the demand that people from all faiths be counted according to their caste category. The Mahaz, headed by Ali Anwar Ansari, former Rajya Sabha member, has announced an awareness campaign on this demand. Khalid Anis Ansari, scholar with the South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), and active in the Pasmanda community advocacy space, says the counting of castes among Muslims should be included in any kind of format for a caste census that is adopted by the government. Backward Class Muslims can avail themselves of reservations only in the OBC category. “We saw drafts of letters by political parties demanding a caste census where only Hindu Most Backward Castes (MBC) were being mentioned. When we raised the issue of Pasmanda Muslims, the letter to Prime Minister Modi from political parties in Bihar dropped any mention of religion. As Pasmanda Muslims, we ourselves are not sure about the contours of the population in the community. The British census authorities in colonial India counted caste categories among Muslims too, but we have no further figures,” said Mr. Ansari. Welfare schemes He said the issue is not just related to job reservations or electoral mobilisation, but of accessing existing welfare programmes and funds through the Minority Affairs Ministry as well. “Much of the funds meant for minority Muslims is cornered by the elite Muslims as they have the educational and social capital required to access them,” he said. “We need a caste census of the Muslim community in India too, to better access developmental funding aimed at minorities for a real targeting of benefits, and a real democratisation among Muslims,” he said. The Pasmanda Muslims, he said, have been marginalised through history with the Muslim voice only being represented by the elite in the community. “Even the discourse on partition ignores the fact that the separate electorates for Muslims under the British, which voted for Muslim League candidates in the run-up to the partition, had very limited franchise restricted to those with property or education. Pasmanda Muslims who had neither were out of this process, and were in fact Congress supporters. In my own personal history, my grandfather in Bindki town in Fatehpur district of Uttar Pradesh opposed the partition of India and there were reported incidents of violence between Ashraf vs Pasmanda groups in various towns like Kanpur, Amroha, etc. We were ignored in the post-partition era also, with the secular parties buying into the elite Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb rhetoric. Muslim appeasement happened but only of the elite Ashraf Muslims,” he said. He points to the root of the issue as being embedded in the “first past the post electoral system”. “The time has come to reconsider the first past the post system in elections, as it only encourages tokenism, while the proportional representation system can ensure more honest representation of demographic reality.” Social justice “There are limits to the politics of demand without true social justice being ensured. Without a true reckoning of numbers and categorisation and hierarchy in an electoral system, and in the welfare system as well, its like you have invited me to a wedding at a five-star hotel, but I cannot attend as I don’t have the clothes to let me in the door of the hotel in the first place,” he said. In the mid-2000s, Pasmanda outreach was at the forefront of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s political playbook under the old NDA. After a hiatus of being in the background of any political party’s interest, the Mahaz and the community are hoping the caste census issue will foreground them once again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/caste-census-needed-for-muslims-too/article36240286.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||High honour for Naval Aviation||President Ram Nath Kovind will award the President’s Colour to Indian Naval Aviation at a ceremonial parade to be held at INS Hansa, Goa, on September 6. The President’s Colour is the highest honour bestowed on a military unit in recognition of its exceptional service to the nation. Naval Aviation came into being with acquisition of the first Sealand aircraft on January 13, 1951 and the commissioning of INS Garuda, the first Naval Air Station, on May 11, 1953, the Navy said in a statement. “Today, Naval Aviation boasts of nine air stations and three naval air enclaves along the Indian coastline and in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,” it stated. Over the past seven decades, it had transformed into a modern, technologically advanced and highly potent force, with more than 250 aircraft comprising carrier-borne fighters, maritime reconnaissance aircraft, helicopters and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), the Navy said. The Navy was the first among the armed forces to be awarded the President’s Colour on May 27, 1951 by then President Rajendra Prasad, as per the statement. The arrival of the armed Firefly aircraft in 1958 added an offensive punch and 1959 saw the commissioning of the Indian Naval Air Squadron (INAS) 550, with 10 Sealand, 10 Firefly and three HT-2 aircraft. Over the years, a variety of rotary wing platforms have been added as well. Maritime reconnaissance also grew steadily, beginning with the induction of the Super-Constellation from the Indian Air Force in 1976 to the state-of-the-art Boeing P 8I aircraft in 2013. Carrier aviation The Navy heralded the beginning of carrier aviation with the induction of INS Vikrant in 1957 and integral Sea Hawk and Alize Squadrons subsequently. “ INS Vikrant with its aircraft played a crucial role in the liberation of Goa in 1961 and again in the 1971 Indo-Pak war, where its presence on the Eastern seaboard proved decisive,” the Navy said. The Navy inducted its second carrier INS Viraat along with Sea Harrier aircraft in the mid-1980s and Naval Aviation was further strengthened with the arrival of MiG 29K fighters on INS Vikramaditya in the last decade. “The Indian Navy’s Carrier capability received significant fillip with sea trials of the indigenously built aircraft carrier, the new avtar of INS Vikrant , commencing this month,” the statement noted. Naval Aviation has played a major role in operations such as Cactus, Jupiter, Shield, Vijay and Parakram as well as spearheaded Humanitarian And Disaster Relief (HADR) operations on numerous occasions both in India and the extended neighbourhood. Naval Aviators have been decorated with one Mahavir Chakra, six Vir Chakras, one Kirti Chakra, seven Shaurya Chakras, one Yudh Seva Medal and a large number of Nao Sena Medals (Gallantry) over the years, the Navy added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/high-honour-for-naval-aviation/article36240017.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Poll body wants ‘stuck’ EVMs to be released||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to intervene in releasing its Electronic Voting Machines “stuck” in Delhi and five States and a Union Territory that went to the polls in 2021. The top poll body said the EVMs had to be moved to States such as Uttar Pradesh, where elections are due in early 2022. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, for the Election Commission of India (ECI), made an urgent oral mention of its plea before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Wednesday. The court indicated that it would consider listing the application for an early hearing. The ECI said the problem lay with a Supreme Court order of April 27, which open-endedly extended the “period of limitation” or the deadline for moving court due to the pandemic. The court’s relaxation of the limitation period stretched to a large chunk of court proceedings, including filing of suits, appeals, petitions. This included election petitions. The ECI said it was time the Supreme Court intervened urgently and fixed a timeline for filing election petitions in Delhi, which had gone to the polls in 2020, and Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry, where Assembly elections were held in 2021. The Conduct of Election Rules of 1961 requires the EVMs used in an election to be kept in the custody of the District Election Officer and not be used in any subsequent elections without the approval of the Election Commission. Back to back elections “It is trite to mention that the Election Commission of India releases for reuse only those EVMs which have been used in constituencies in respect of which no election petition/writ petition has been filed raising any EVM-related issue,” the ECI said in the application. The ECI said there are back-to-back Assembly elections due in Goa, Manipur, Uttarakhand and Punjab in March 2022. The election in Uttar Pradesh is on May 14, 2022. The extension of the limitation period by the apex court on April 27 has frozen the deployment of 4.48 lakh ballot units, 3.73 lakh control units and 3.95 lakh VVPATs in Assam, Kerala, Delhi, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. To conduct elections in 2022, it needs 4,55,149 ballot units, 3,77,037 control units and 4,04,612 VVPATs, the ECI said. The total present availability was 1,37,131 ballot units, 77,375 control units and 1,01,047 VVPATs. If the EVMs continue to remain stuck in Delhi and the five States/Union Territory, then machines have to be transported from other States, leading to “serious logistical challenges which may delay the checking of ECMs and VVPATs”, the poll body noted. “It will be in the interest of justice that this Court may kindly direct a timeline for filing election petitions,” the ECI said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/poll-body-wants-stuck-evms-to-be-released/article36240030.ece
02 September 2021||New Delhi,||New vision needed, says Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday attacked the Narendra Modi government over inflation and the repeated increase in fuel prices by asserting that “GDP growth” meant “increase in gas, diesel and petrol prices”. Addressing a press conference, Mr. Gandhi said the country was facing structural problems, much like the “catastrophic situation” in 1991, and needed a new vision and approach to take the economy out of the crisis. “The Government has a new concept of GDP — an increase in GDP means an increase in gas, diesel and petrol prices. Over the past seven years, they have earned Rs. 23 lakh crore from the increase in diesel, petrol and LPG gas. And every single person is affected by this,” Mr. Gandhi said. “In 2014, when we [UPA government] left office, LPG gas price was Rs. 410 per cylinder; today, it is Rs. 885 per cylinder. That is a 116% increase. Petrol was Rs. 71.51 per litre; it is now Rs. 101.34 per litre, a 42% increase. Diesel was Rs. 57.28 a litre but now it is Rs. 88.77, a 55% increase,” he added. Mr. Gandhi pointed out that the current crude price of $71 a barrel was much lower than the $105 a barrel when the UPA was in power. Comparing the situation with the “economic catastrophe” of 1991, Mr. Gandhi said, “Our plan for the economy, which worked from 1991 to 2012, stopped working after that. We have to change our vision and need a new approach. Modi ji promised that he would bring a new approach — all the talk about ‘New India’. But they were hollow slogans.” He claimed that neither the Prime Minister nor the Finance Minister were “capable of addressing” the structural problems but experts and think tanks should focus on tackling them. The Congress party was clear about what needs to be done and can share its expertise with the government, he said. Taking a fresh dig at the ‘Make in India’ programme as well as the National Monetisation Pipeline, Mr. Gandhi said a large section of the population was being demonetised while friends of the Prime Minister benefited. “There is demonetisation taking place, where farmers, labourers, small traders, MSMEs, contract workers, salaried classes and honest industrialists are being hit, and on the other side, there is dramatic monetisation taking place. They are three or four big industrialist friends of the Prime Minister who are benefited. There is a transfer of wealth taking place from the poor to the Prime Minister’s friends,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-vision-needed-says-rahul/article36240035.ece
02 September 2021||Ghaziabad,||Big turnout of BJP leaders at Kalyan Singh’s rites||In what is seen as an attempt to consolidate the non-Yadav OBC vote bank ahead of the Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh, the top Bharatiya Janata Party leadership of Uttar Pradesh descended on Atruali town of Aligarh on Tuesday to participate in the 13th day rituals of former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh. In the district for the second time in a fortnight, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath described the Lodh leader, who was once the OBC face of the BJP, as one of the foremost warriors of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Referring to the ongoing construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, he said Kalyan Singh worked tirelessly for the “fulfilment of the dream”. He said Babuji, as Kalyan Singh was fondly called, never stepped back from making sacrifices for this centuries-old dream, “whether it was sacrificing the Chief Minister’s post after the disputed structure was removed in 1992 or taking full moral responsibility for its removal.” Praising Kalyan Singh’s simplicity and discipline, he said, Babuji worked for establishing “a fear-free government in the State” that worked for the socially underprivileged who were kept out of government schemes. Mr. Adityanath declared that the newly constructed Cancer Institute in Lucknow would be named after Kalyan Singh. He said the government medical college coming up in Bulandshahr would also be named after the former Chief Minister. ‘Loved by people’ Mr. Adityanath hailed the people of Atrauli, the native town of Kalyan Singh, for turning up in large numbers. “Considering Babuji was out of political life for two decades, the huge turnout shows that he was truly loved by the people of the region.” He said local institutions would also be named after the leader and appealed to the people to strengthen the hands of Kalyan Singh’s son Rajveer Singh and grandson Sandeep Singh. Mr. Rajveer is a BJP MP from neighbouring Etah constituency while Mr. Sandeep is MLA from Atrauli and a junior Minister in the State government. Inclement weather did not spoil the show, as arrangements had been made to feed around a lakh people, with around 1,400 cooks roped in to prepare the special meal. Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, State BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh and Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar were present. Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra, an old colleague of Kalyan Singh, and Uttarkhand Governor Baby Rani Maurya also addressed the gathering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/big-turnout-of-bjp-leaders-at-kalyan-singhs-rites/article36240049.ece
02 September 2021||Kolkata,||Abhishek’s wife skips ED appearance||Rijura Banerjee, wife of Trinamool Congress general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, has expressed her inability to appear before the Enforcement Directorate in Delhi for questioning in a coal pilferage case. She said she could meet its officials at her Kolkata residence. The ED had issued her summons to appear before the agency in Delhi on September 1. “I am a mother of two infants and travelling to New Delhi physically alone in the midst of the pandemic will put my [life] and the lives of my children at grave risk,” she said in a letter to the Central agency dated August 31. “It would be convenient to me if you consider asking me to appear in Kolkata at my residence since your organization has its office in Kolkata and I reside in Kolkata too. Besides, as per my understanding, the alleged cause of action of the subject matter of your inquiry too arises out of West Bengal,” the letter pointed out. Earlier, the CBI had questioned her at her Kolkata residence. ED has issued summons to Abhishek Banerjee and three serving IPS officers also. Narada sting tapes In another development, a special court in Kolkata ordered that summons be issued to West Bengal Ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in connection with Narada sting case. The orders were issued, taking cognisance of a chargesheet by the ED. Summons are to be issued also to Trinamool Congress MLA Madan Mitra, former Kolkata Mayor Sovan Chatterjee and suspended IPS officer S.M.H.

02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Taliban urged to form inclusive govt.||The Taliban should form an inclusive government that will bring national reconciliation in Afghanistan, a group of eminent citizens, led by former External Affairs Minister K. Natwar Singh, has said. Extending solidarity to the Afghanistan people, it stated that the people of India stood “shoulder to shoulder” with them. “Afghanistan needs an inclusive government that facilitates national reconciliaton after four long decades of wars and violence. Therefore, we appeal to the Taliban and other political forces to begin an intra-Afghan peace process leading to a democratic government establishment,” declared a statement issued by the Indian Friends of Afghanistan, which comprises former Union Ministers Yashwant Sinha and Mani Shankar Aiyar and peace activist Sudheendra Kulkarni. The Taliban should ensure that no terrorist organisation is allowed to find sanctuary in Afghanistan. The new power holders of Kabul should respect every Afghan citizen irrespective of ethnicity, ideology or past political background. The Taliban should respect the rights of women and safeguard the developmental projects, it said. The group appealed to the international community to not exclude any regional country from “collaborative efforts to bring peace in Afghanistan”. “This requires India, Pakistan, China, Russia, Iran and other countries to evolve and implement a common strategy, in cooperation with themembers of the international community,” it stressed. “There should be no discrimination on grounds of religion in providing shelter to Afghans forced to leave their country. India should permit temporary stay to Afghan journalists, artists and civil society leaders feeling threatened by the conditions in their country,” the group added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/taliban-urged-to-form-inclusive-govt/article36240033.ece
02 September 2021||Kolkata,||After social security, Mamata turns her focus on industry||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said after the implementation of social security schemes, the government’s focus would be on industry. Ms. Banerjee announced the setting up of an empowered group of industries chaired by her where key ministers and senior secretaries would take monthly stock of investment proposals. The announcement is crucial, as the Trinamool Congress government, since assuming power in 2011, has been trying to brush aside the anti-industry image, as it came to power after violent protests over forcible land acquisition at Singur and Nandigram. Single window system The event at Panagarh in Bardhaman, where Ms. Banerjee made her fresh pitch for industry was to announce the setting up of a Rs. 400-crore plant that would produce polyester films. The Chief Minister said the suggestion for setting up an empowered group came from the business community itself. “It will be a single window system. We have decided that there will be at least one meeting of the empowered group every month that will take stock of the proposals submitted, why they are pending and what can be done by the government,” she stated. Ms. Banerjee also spoke about the world’s second largest coal block, the Deocha Pachami Coal Mines, spread over 11,222 acres with coal reserves of around 2.2 billion tonnes in Birbhum’s Mohammed Bazar area. “After the project is implemented, there will be no shortage of electricity. We have the land for the first phase and for the second phase,” she asserted. Biofuels such as ethanol would be produced in Bengal and an investment of Rs. 1500 crore would be made in the sector that would generate thousands of jobs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-social-security-mamata-turns-her-focus-on-industry/article36240036.ece
02 September 2021||Lucknow,||Declare cow the national animal, says Allahabad HC||The Allahabad High Court on Wednesday said that the cow should be declared the national animal and that gau raksha (cow protection) should be included as a fundamental right of the Hindus. The court made the comments, along with a string of other observations, noting the religious and cultural significance of cows and the need for cow protection, while denying bail to Javed, a person from Sambhal, who has been in jail since March on charges of allegedly stealing a cow and slaughtering it with his associates. While holding the cow as a symbol of Indian culture and talking of threats to this culture, a Bench of Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav also warned people that they should not forget the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. The court said history was full of instances that “whenever we forgot our culture, foreigners attacked us and enslaved us and if we are not warned, we should not forget the unbridled attack on and capture of Afghanistan by Taliban”. Justice Yadav said that scientists believe the cow is the only animal that inhales and exhales oxygen. He invoked mythology at several points in the 12-page order in Hindi. Justice Yadav also opined that Parliament should bring in a law to take tough action against those accused of cow slaughter. He described cows as a symbol of Hindu faith and culture, and claimed that even the majority of Muslims in the country were in favour of a nationwide ban on cow slaughter. He added, “When the faith and culture of the country suffer injury, the country becomes weak.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/declare-cow-the-national-animal-says-allahabad-hc/article36240337.ece

Black-necked crane, only found in the Ladakh region, was the State bird of J&K before August 5, 2019. “Black-necked crane and snow leopard are two endangered species and the pride of Ladakh,” said Konchok Stanzin, councillor from Chushul constituency. Black-necked cranes are only found in Ladakh’s Changthang region. They are described as majestic birds — around 139 cm long with a 235 cm wingspan and weighing 5-6 kg. The bird’s sighting is considered auspicious in Ladakh. Snow leopard, whose numbers are dwindling wordwide, has been categorised as “vulnerable” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ladakh-adopts-state-animal-and-bird/article36240332.ece
02 September 2021||Mumbai,||Bhima Koregaon: HC reserves order on plea||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday reserved the order on a plea filed by eight accused in the Bhima Koregaon caste violence case seeking default bail by challenging the Pune Sessions Court order taking cognisance of the charge sheet filed. A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.J. Jamadar was hearing the petition filed by Surendra Gadling, Varavara Rao, Sudhir Dhawale, Shoma Sen, Rona Wilson, Mahesh Raut, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira. Sessions judge K.D. Wadane, on September 5, 2019, rejected their default bail pleas. They are now seeking bail on the grounds that the charge sheet was not filed before the Magistrate Court who could have committed the matter to the Sessions Court. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, representing the National Investigation Agency (NIA), said no other order by the Sessions judge was challenged, be it extension of the remand or transfer to the NIA. Only the order of taking cognisance of the charge sheet had been challenged. The special court would have jurisdiction of trial and the Sessions court the jurisdiction prior to trial. Advocate Sudeep Pasbola, for the accused, had argued that the order passed by the Sessions Court cannot be sustained as the government had constituted a special NIA court, and the agency ought to have approached the Magistrate Court, as the charges included those under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhima-koregaon-hc-reserves-order-on-plea/article36240288.ece

02 September 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Stop pollution of Sabarmati river: HC||The Gujarat High Court came down heavily on the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for not curbing pollution in the Sabarmati river, noting that untreated effluents continue to be dumped into the river. The court held that there is a nexus of civic body officials, Pollution Control Board officials, and industries, with the government apparently “protecting polluters”. The Division Bench of Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice V.D. Nanavati also said that it would make a surprise visit to check the river’s condition. The court is hearing a suo motu petition initiated by it following media reports of sewage water and industrial effluents not treated in accordance with set norms being dumped into the river. Senior advocate Mihir Joshi, representing the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, in his submission admitted that in industrial clusters like Narol, Odhav, Vinzol and Avayav, there were industries and industrial estates which illegally connected industrial effluent discharge pipelines to the sewage trunk line. Effluents were also dumped by tankers into pipelines of pumping stations. “According to Mr. Joshi, the menace or the nuisance of illegal trade effluent being discharged into the sewage drainage system needs to be looked into and attended to by the GPCB at the earliest,” the court noted. Expressing its displeasure over the GPCB’s approach to river pollution, the court said, “It is only the GPCB that can take appropriate action. But unfortunately, we don’t have a very good experience with the GPCB. There are people at the top who protect these industries also.” The court asked the pollution control body to identify areas from which untreated effluents and sewage were being released into the river in violation of pollution control norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stop-pollution-of-sabarmati-river-hc/article36240905.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh clarified “we are not issuing notice” as it asked Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma to “take instructions” on the matter.

02 September 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC issues notice on appointment of Asthana||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday issued notice on a petition challenging the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner. A Bench of Chief Justice D. N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh also allowed an application filed by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) seeking to be made a party in the case. The court posted the case for further hearing on September 8. On August 25, the Supreme Court asked the High Court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment. The CPIL, in its impleading application, argued that the petition before the High Court, filed by one Sadre Alam, was a “copy-paste” of its plea before the apex court. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said, “It is too much for a coincidence that same typographical error was possible”. “It appears that Mr. Alam seems to have copied and followed the dangerous path of Mr. Bhushan [CPIL counsel]... Both have no business challenging the appointment,” he said, adding that the High Court had to hear the “affected officer” as well before any order was passed in the matter. The NGO said it got to know about the filing of Mr. Alam’s petition from media and “was surprised to see some of the paragraphs of the instant writ petition as quoted by media”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-issues-notice-on-asthana-appointment/article36240021.ece

A three-time legislator from north Kashmir’s Sopore, Geelani was active in the political landscape of J&K for around five decades. He served as a senior member of now banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and also headed the hawkish faction of Hurriyat, which opposed any unconditional dialogue with the Centre and advocated Jammu and Kashmir’s accession with Pakistan. Geelani resigned as head of the Hurriyat in June 2020, eight months after the Centre ended Jammu and Kashmir’s special constitutional position. “Saddened by the news of Geelani sahab’s passing away. We may not have agreed on most things but I respect him for his steadfastness and standing by his beliefs. May Allah Ta’aala grant him jannat and condolences to his family & well-wishers,” former Chief Minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti stated in a post on Twitter on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/separatist-leader-geelani-dies-in-srinagar/article36240330.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||No SC, ST, OBC quota for NRIs appearing for NEET||When he applied again this year, he was about to choose “NRI” before being told that this would not allow him to opt for the OBC quota. “NRI should not be an option under the nationality category at all. Non-Resident Indians still hold Indian citizenship and nationality and are only counted as NRIs for tax purposes,” said his father. When Rohit took his case to the Kerala High Court earlier this month, he won an interim order on August 13 that directed the Health Ministry and the National Testing Agency (NTA) which conducts the NEET to change his application “in such a fashion that he is able to claim admission to MBBS course against the quota marked for OBC-NCL [non-creamy layer] in the event of selection”. However, NTA has so far failed to make the needed changes, said Mr. Karthikeyan, noting that the exam would be held on September 12. NTA affidavit In its affidavit to the court, the NTA held that including OBC category for NRI candidates was “not sustainable”. “NRI is already a separate reserved category for the MBBS course. The petitioner cannot be given the benefit of sub-reservation,” it stated. Mr. Karthikeyan noted that constitutionally, vertical reservation was allowed only for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs and the Economically Weaker Sections, while horizontal reservation was allowed for Persons with Disability in all categories, including general merit. NRI seats were only a provision made for students with NRI sponsors, and was not to be considered as a reservation, he said. A senior official from the National Medical Commission agreed that the application portal could be changed to allow NRI students to opt for community-based reservation, but insisted they could not then be eligible for NRI quota seats as well. “We have operated on the principle that one candidate cannot apply for multiple quotas. Otherwise, tomorrow we should not see SC students also applying under EWS,” said another senior Health Ministry official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-sc-st-obc-quota-for-nris-appearing-for-neet/article36240024.ece

Accordingly, all EPF accounts will have to be bifurcated into a taxable and non-taxable contribution account, with the latter including their closing account balance as on March 31, 2021, any contributions made thereafter that are “not included in the taxable contribution account” and annual interest accrued on these two components. 24.77 crore accounts To put that in context, the EPFO had 24.77 crore members with EPF accounts, of which 14.36 crore members had been allotted Unique Account Numbers (UAN) as of March 31, 2020. About five crore of these were active contributors into their EPF accounts during 2019-20. The calculation of taxable interest for the year shall be computed as the interest accrued during the previous year in the taxable contribution account where all contributions over Rs. 2.5 lakh a year would be parked. The same threshold is Rs. 5 lakh for PF accounts where employers do not contribute, but most EPF accounts, by definition, usually include matching contributions from employers and employees of 12% of monthly salary. The Central Board of Direct Taxes’ top brass had earlier said that taxpayers will have to include the taxable PF interest in their total income while filing tax returns, but the new rules suggest that the EPFO and PF trusts run by companies may have to deduct tax and remit it to the exchequer from such accounts. A retirement benefits expert said it’s not clear from the notification whether the tax has to be deducted from the taxable EPF account or simply added to one’s I-T returns as earlier suggested.  Central PF Commissioner Sunil Barthwal did not respond to a request for his comment on the implementation of the EPF tax as per the new rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/split-accounts-to-tax-epf-income-ministry/article36240025.ece

But the government exuded confidence that the “robust GST revenues are likely to continue” in the coming months as well, as “economic growth” and anti-evasion activities, especially against “fake billers”, have been contributing to the enhanced GST kitty. Rajat Bose, partner at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co., said the upshot from the latest numbers was the healthy 30%-plus increase in GST in manufacturing States such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka. T.N., Karnataka status Among the larger States, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka both recorded a 35% jump in GST revenues, followed by Andhra Pradesh (33%), Maharashtra (31%) and Gujarat (25%). Overall the GST revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) were 27% higher in August year-on-year. Of the Rs. 1,12,020 crore revenues in August, the Central GST (CGST) was Rs. 20,522 crore, the State GST (SGST) Rs. 26,605 crore, and the Integrated GST Rs. 56,247 crore (including Rs. 26,884 crore collected on import of goods).

Last week, a study by scientists at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology and the Max Hospitals Group in Delhi, revealed that nearly a quarter of 600 fully vaccinated healthcare workers were reinfected. Earlier, studies from the Christian Medical College, Vellore and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education Research, Chandigarh, too, had reported between 1%-10% of fully vaccinated healthcare workers as having been reinfected.

The 4.1 sq.km. sanctuary is within the Deepar Beel, a wetland on the south-western edge of Guwahati that expands up to 30 sq. km in summer and reduces to about 10 sq. km in the winter. It is Assam’s only Ramsar site, a wetland designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The Environment Ministry’s notification of August 25 specified an area “to an extent varying from 294 metres to 16.32 km” as the eco-sensitive zone, with the total area being 148.97 sq.km. “The notification is meaningless if the government does not stop the dumping of garbage perilously close to the wetland. Seepage from this dump and sewage from Guwahati have already made the sanctuary toxic,” said Bakul Rongpi, president of Deepar Beel eco-development committee. He is from Mikirpara Chakardeo, where residents have for long resisted development projects around the wetland in vain. “A thorough study of the notification showed the ESZ will serve no purpose. The minimum distance for polluting units should have been 5 km from the boundary of the sanctuary,” Chakardeo-based dairy farmer and green activist Pramod Kalita told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-wetland-at-risk-till-dumping-stops-activists/article36240051.ece

Mr. Adhikari pointed out that more than 50 MLAs of the Opposition parties have crossed floor during the regime of the TMC since 2011. “The Opposition parties then [Left and Congress] did not seriously take up these defections. From the BJP, we can assure that we will take it to its logical conclusion in a democratic manner.” Mr. Adhikari said the two MLAs had not been keeping in touch with the party over the past few months. Three BJP MLAs have defected to the TMC after the polls. Mr. Roy was the first to do so in June, followed by Tanmoy Ghosh (Bishnupur) and Biswajit Das (Bagda). Brave front State BJP president Dilip Ghosh tried to put a brave front and said such defections will not affect the party. “If dozens of MLAs came from the TMC to the BJP before the Assembly polls and a few of them go back to the TMC, it is not going to affect the party,” he said.

Leaders of the BJP and and its coalition partner in the State government, the Jannayak Janta Party, have been facing backlash from farmers in connection with the three contentious agriculture laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/haryana-govt-transfers-karnal-sdm/article36240038.ece

According to an update by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), one person each died in Barpeta and Majuli districts. These two are among 22 of the 34 districts reeling under floodwaters. Officials said the floods have so far affected 6,47,606 people, about 2.18 of them being women and 1.64 lakh children. More than 3,580 among the flood-affected have moved into 85 relief camps set up by the local authorities. During the last 24 hours, Nalbari and Darrang surpassed Lakhimpur as the worst affected districts. While 1.11 lakh people have been temporarily displaced in Nalbari, the number of such people in Darrang and Lakhimpur is 1.08 lakh and 1.04 lakh respectively. Several rivers, including the Brahmaputra, were flowing above the danger level and incessant rainfall has continued to make them swell, officials said. On the brighter side, the crop area affected reduced by about 400 hectares from the 39,831 hectares on Tuesday. The flood level at the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve remained constant for the third straight day though two more animals died on Wednesday.

02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||TNSCB renamed Urban Habitat Development Board||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Wednesday announced that the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board would now be called the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board. Making the announcement in the Assembly, Mr. Stalin said not only should slums be replaced, but the livelihoods of people living there should be uplifted. “The name is being changed with an intention to uplift their lives,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the Slum Clearance Board was launched when M. Karunanidhi first became the Chief Minister of the State, and it was highly appreciated by then Union Minister Jagjivan Ram, and he expressed his desire to extend the scheme to all States. Officials said the United Nations (UN) was using the word “habitat” to refer to dwellings of people, and the Tamil Nadu government has also decided to use the term. “The word slum is normally used in a derogatory way, and some IAS officials have been fighting to change that for 25 years. It has now become a reality,” a senior official said. Viduthalai Chiruthaikal Katchi (VCK) MP D. Ravikumar said the changes should go beyond mere re-naming of the board. “There should be a qualitative change. The government should ensure that every citizen has a house,” he said. A. Devaneyan of Thozhamai, a non-governmental organisation, said it was a welcome move, but the change in name should also reflect in the system. “I have been opposing the word “clearance” for some time. When eviction is done, people should be rehabilitated within a 100-m radius from their old habitats. The government should take into account that 53% of the people are living in urban areas,” he said. Underscoring the need for a white paper on relocations, Mr. Devaneyan said the government should ensure the participation of slum dwellers in the board. “There is also a need for creating Urban Samathuvapurams,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnscb-renamed-urban-habitat-development-board/article36240456.ece
02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Govt. plans to build commercial complex in Pattinapakkam’||The Tamil Nadu government has plans to construct a commercial complex on a par with international standards on the 25.16 acre of land in Pattinapakkam, Housing and Urban Development Minister S. Muthusamy told the Assembly on Wednesday. “Once, the LIC building served as the identity of Chennai. It was a tourist attraction and would be shown in films. We will make the new complex the new identity of the city,” he said. Prime location Mr. Muthusamy said the area was between two main roads, and it was very difficult to get such a space in the city. “We are studying the possibility of constructing the complex in collaboration with Singapore and other governments. We are keen on making it the identity of the city, and the Chief Minister is very particular about the project,” he said. The Minister explained that the project would be implemented without felling the trees on the premises, and if necessary, they would be replanted. “We will also plant 10 saplings in place of every tree that is removed,” he added. He said the trade centre in Nandanam was given up due to technical reasons, and they would soon study the project. Pointing out the poor condition of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) flats, he said 1,078 flats constructed under the instalment scheme remained unsold. “The Chief Minister has asked us to study the situation and find ways [to repair them]. In fact, they were completed over 30 years ago, and now the TNHB had nothing to do with them,” Mr. Muthusamy said. Self-finance scheme He said 6,000 houses constructed under the self-finance scheme also remained unsold, and the government was taking steps to sell them. The Minister said Metropolitan Development Authorities would be established in Madurai, Coimbatore-Tiruppur and Hosur. Mr. Muthsamy said the Chief Minister had also advised him to organise special camps to hand over documents to those who had paid the money for allotment of the TNHB flats. “In a month, we have handed over documents to 2,691 allotees,” he added. He also pointed out that 41 complexes were derelict. “They pose a great danger,” he added. “Whether it is the complex in Pattinapakkam or other buildings, we will ensure quality. It will be higher than the quality of private constructions. Number is not important, quality is,” he said. Mr. Muthusamy said it was the goal of the Chief Minister to provide quality homes to everyone by 2030. He said as the 143 neighbouring villages in the city lacked development, the government would implement a scheme to link them with roads to spur growth.  We are studying the possibility of constructing the complex in collaboration with Singapore and other governm- ents. We are keen on making it the identity of the city S.

02 September 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Lack of LPG pipeline leads to T.N. having high cooking gas prices||The absence of pipelines to move liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from refineries elsewhere is turning out to be expensive for consumers in Tamil Nadu as cooking gas prices in the State are among the highest in the country. After revision of LPG prices on September 1, Wednesday, a non-domestic commercial cylinder containing 19 kg of LPG in New Delhi is Rs. 1,694, it is Rs. 1,649.50 in Mumbai, Rs. 1,770.50 in Kolkata and Rs. 1,831 in Chennai. It is the same case with domestic LPG where New Delhi (Rs. 884.50), and Mumbai (Rs. 884.50) have lower prices than Chennai, which stood at Rs. 900.50. In Chennai, the price of a domestic cylinder went up by Rs. 25 and that of commercial by Rs. 75. “Most of the LPG that the country procures is from Saudi Aramco and this is off-loaded first at Mumbai, then Mangalore, Cochin, Thoothukudi and only then reaches Chennai. Transport costs are higher since the ship has to travel all the way to the Eastern Coast. Delhi gets its supply by a pipeline. Tamil Nadu does not have an LPG line till date. Perhaps it is time for policy makers to lay an LPG carrying line to the State,” explained another industry source, who, however, pointed out that people in the State are opposed to pipelines. A pipeline from Kochi to Salem via Karur remains 70% complete and remains inside the State of Kerala due to opposition in Tamil Nadu. M. Venkadasubbu, president, Tamil Nadu Hotels Association, said considering the fact that the industry had just begun recovering from the impact of lockdowns, the Centre could at least reduce the GST slab of 18% for hotels for a certain period. “The lack of intra-State LPG pipelines has also lead to differential prices in various parts of the State,” he added. Association secretary R. Srinivasan said with several leading brands closing down their branches the hotel industry needed an impetus and a reduction in import duty on LPG or transportation charges of the fuel, would be passed onto the consumers. “The vegetarian segment of restaurants have returned to only 60% of their original business and LPG constitutes under 10% of the total expenses,” he explained. A distributor with an national oil company said they were witnessing a drop of around 3%-4% in domestic cylinders, especially among BPL customers. “We are also afraid that commercial consumers would switch over to private LPG brands if the oil industry does not take steps,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lack-of-lpg-pipeline-leads-to-tn-having-high-cooking-gas-prices/article36240646.ece
02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Nagaswaram maestro’s house razed||The house of late nagaswaram wizard Thiruvavaduthurai N. Rajarathinam Pillai has been demolished. The demolition of the house in Thiruvavaduthurai, which once showcased the nagaswaram played by TNR, as he was fondly called by the music world, has cut off his links with his native town. “When I visited the place, the empty land brought tears to my eyes. I nurtured the hope that one day it would become a memorial,” said nagaswaram player K. Dineshkumar, who posted photos of the demolished house on Facebook. TNR’s greatness is explained by the fact that he was invited by the Indian government to play nagaswaram at midnight, when India gained independence on August 15, 1947. He had already established himself as a non-pareil nagaswaram player, whose rendition of the thodi raga had set the benchmark for both instrumentalists and vocalists. The land belonged to the Thiruvavaduthurai mutt, and TNR constructed the house. “The house was sold after his death to repay loans taken by him to conduct the wedding of his adopted son, Sivaji. After his death, his relative Vanaja redeemed it and now she has sold it,” said V. Subash, grandson of TNR, who lived in the house as a child. TNR, who came to Chennai, died in 1956. Former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi was keen on converting the house into a memorial, when his centenary was celebrated, and the job was left to then Tamil Maanila Congress leader G.K. Moopanar. But the task could not be completed. When the DMK was in power between 2006 and 2011, there was an attempt to construct a memorial in Thirumaurgal, the birth place of TNR. But the proposal never saw the light of the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nagaswaram-maestros-house-razed/article36240459.ece

02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Amend rules to punish police personnel who harass LGBTQIA+ community: HC||The Madras High Court has directed the Tamil Nadu government to amend the conduct rules applicable to police personnel and provide for punishment to those who harass people belonging to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual and such others’ (LGBTQIA+) community or harass non-governmental organisations that support them. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh issued the direction after expressing disappointment over complaints of the police continuing to harass the community despite comprehensive instructions issued by him on June 7 with the aim of providing counselling, monetary support, legal assistance and protection to the LGBTQIA+ community. The judge ordered that even sensitisation programmes to be conducted for the police personnel, in accordance with one of the directions, must be conducted through persons belonging to the community, activists or NGO workers supporting and protecting the community. Justice Venkatesh requested Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram to instruct the authorities concerned to be more proactive on the issue. The court expressed dismay over certain incidents of insensitive reporting of news related to LGBTQIA+ community in the media. “Media’s insensitive commentary and ridiculing with dramatic words and music while “reporting” such news cannot be normalised. The reportage of the most intimate and personal aspects of an individual’s identity by the contemporary vernacular media is deeply problematic. ,” the court observed. Refraining from issuing directions to the media, the judge requested it to exercise self-restraint. He was also shocked to come across a prescription given by a psychiatrist to a gay man without realising there was no cure for gender identity. Pointing out that the psychiatrist had also referred the patient to a psychotherapist for cognitive behavioural therapy, the judge said: “These are the ways and means adopted by professionals under the guise of conversion therapy.” He went on to state: “Prescribing anti-depressants and erectile dysfunction drugs to a person and referring them into cognitive behavioural therapy as “remedy” to their gender identity and sexuality is nothing but conversion “therapy,” camouflaged as medical and mental health support. This lack of knowledge on the part of the concerned psychiatrist is directly attributable to the course that was undergone by him and which is yet to be revamped and brought up to date.” The judge requested Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan to take such issues to the notice of National Medical Commission and Indian Psychiatric Society and find out by October 4 how the two bodies planned to address such issues even if it had to be done by bringing in necessary changes to the medical course curriculum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/amend-rules-to-punish-police-personnel-who-harass-lgbtqia-community-hc/article36240648.ece

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh issued the direction after expressing disappointment over complaints of the police continuing to harass such people in spite of comprehensive instructions issued by him on June 7 to various stakeholders to provide counselling, monetary support, legal assistance and protection to members of the LGBTQIA+ community, who face serious discrimination in society. The judge ordered that even sensitisation programmes to be conducted for the police, in accordance with a direction issued by him on June 7, must be held through people belonging to the community or LGBTQIA+ activists or NGO workers involved in supporting and protecting the community from various onslaughts. Justice Venkatesh requested Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram to instruct the authorities concerned to be more proactive on the issue. The judge told the A-G that Tamil Nadu was known for reforms in the interest of people belonging to marginalised sections and, therefore, must be a role model in creating a favourable atmosphere for the community as well. The court expressed dismay over certain incidents of insensitive reporting of news related to the LGBTQIA+ community in the media. “It not just reflects the pre-existing harmful stigmatisation of the community, but also perpetuates it,” the court said. Refraining from issuing directions to the media since it might trench upon the freedom of the press, the judge requested it to exercise self-restraint. He was shocked to come across a prescription given by a psychiatrist to a gay man without realising there was no cure for gender identity. The judge requested Additional Solicitor General R.

02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tech to bring down human-elephant conflict||Prudent use of technology and diligence on the field is helping avoid conflicts between wild elephants and people in Gudalur in The Nilgiris. After using kumkis and local site-effective driving gears such as pepper aerosol spray and chilly ropes to solve the Gudalur elephant problem, chief wildlife warden Shekhar Kumar Niraj had instructed forest officials to use the digital wireless network and drones. After deploying drones in Gudalur, the elephants have not been seen coming out from the sholas. Since elephants usually come to depredate during the night, monitoring becomes difficult, and so, local forest officials were guided to use the drones during the day to locate the animals, and send kumkis to push them deeper into the forests towards Kerala and the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), said Mr. Niraj. “This combined use of technology and field work has been working, as elephants are not coming out of the sholas,” he said. No untoward incident has happened these past few nights due to wild elephants, and at present, they are loitering along the Kerala border. “The use of technology and diligence on the field has actually worked,” Mr. Niraj said. Officials said two wild elephants had returned to human habitations around Devala, after a few months, with one of them raiding for salt and food. Four kumkis have been deployed to drive them back into the sholas and towards the Kerala side. Gudalur has been at the centre of the human-elephant conflict for the past few decades, with research indicating that the disappearance of forest cover and swamp lands, and the associated micro habitats, had led to the rise in confrontations. The death of people, more men than women, due to attacks by wild elephants, and the number of deaths of elephants caused by people have also been high in the Gudalur range in the past few decades. Likewise, properties damaged by elephants had also increased in the range, show studies. Activists say a long-term solution is to secure the elephant corridors, and in the short term, the government should immediately stop and remove encroachments in the Pandalur forests, as they act as migratory paths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tech-to-bring-down-human-elephant-conflict/article36240446.ece

02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Karunanidhi’s statue to be installed at spot where it stood in Chennai 34 years ago||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Wednesday told the Assembly that a statue of late Chief Minister and DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi would be installed where it once stood on Anna Salai, in Chennai, 34 years ago. The statue and the pedestal were damaged by vandals the day AIADMK leader and then Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran died on December 24, 1987. When the photo of a boy hitting the chest of the statue with a crowbar appeared in newspapers, Karunanidhi had written in the DMK mouthpiece, Murasoli , “Unlike others who stabbed me on my back, he at least hit me on my chest.” Responding to DMK lagislator T.K.G. Neelamegam, who wanted the government to install the statue again, Mr. Stalin said Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) president K. Veeramani, who met him a few days ago, had expressed a similar desire to place the statue at the same place, since it was a wish of Periyar [E.V. Ramasamy].  “I told him that there were [court] orders against the installation of statues, as they would affect the flow of traffic. Mr. Veeramani said permission had already been obtained [when it was originally installed], and there was no need to get it again,” Mr. Stalin said. “There is a statue of Periyar , Anna [C.N. Annadurai] and MGR on Anna Salai. It will be appropriate to consult legal experts. We have to also abide by the order of the court. The statue will certainly be installed on Anna Salai,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/karunanidhis-statue-to-be-installed-at-same-spot-in-chennai-where-it-stood-34-years-ago/article36240461.ece
02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||ASHAs sweating it out with no fixed working hours, low pay||It is a long wait for better pay for hundreds of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) in Tamil Nadu. Starting with registration and follow-up of antenatal women, keeping track of immunisation of children to COVID-19 work in the last one-and-a-half years, the number of jobs they do has been increasing but their long-pending pleas for regularisation and better pay remain ignored. Serving as one of the links with villagers in hilly and hard-to-reach areas, ASHAs have been demanding regularisation of jobs, fixed monthly pay of Rs. 18,000 and recognition for several years. Their monthly incentives range from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000, with some of them not paid on time in many districts. Over the last one-and-a-half years, ASHAs were involved in COVID-19 work as well. The latest addition for ASHAs in a few districts were works under the State government’s flagship scheme — Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam. They were deployed in hilly areas in Tamil Nadu, Vahidha Nizam, general secretary of Tamil Nadu ASHA Paniyalar Sangam (AITUC) said, adding that there were 2,700 to 3,000 ASHAs working in hill and rough terrains. “When the concept of ASHAs was introduced through the National Rural Health Mission, we opposed it as it took away the permanent nature of jobs. This meant that there will be no permanent workforce for rural healthcare and they introduced incentivisation. Ironically, ASHAs work 24 x 7 from monitoring pregnant women to ensuring institutional deliveries, postnatal care and child care. They take schemes of both the Central and State governments to the rural population, and should be a permanent workforce. What is pathetic is that they are not even recognised as a worker,” she said. Monthly incentive An ASHA, who has been working since 2009, said a few years ago, the Central government announced a monthly minimum incentive of Rs. 2,000 for them but majority of them had not received the amount till date. Another ASHA in a southern district said they had not received incentives for June and July. Officials cited lack of funds as the reason. ASHAs were involved in COVID-19 work including Influenza-Like Illness survey and contact tracing of persons who test positive for COVID-19. “Only ASHAs were not listed as beneficiaries of the State government’s incentive for those involved in COVID-19 work,” she said. Recently, ASHAs of Kolli Hills block, covering Solagaadu, Pavarkaadu, Senthangkulam, Mullukurichi, Thenurpatti in Namakkal and attached to the association, submitted a petition to the Collector appealing to the State government to consider their demands. Noting that the incentives were pending for six months to one year in many districts, they demanded that the incentives be paid by the 10th of every month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ashas-sweating-it-out-with-no-fixed-working-hours-low-pay/article36240486.ece

Anand Venkatesh issued the direction after expressing disappointment over complaints of the police continuing to harass such people despite comprehensive instructions issued by him on June 7 to various stakeholders with the aim of providing counselling, monetary support, legal assistance and protection to the LGBTQIA+ community members who face serious discrimination in society. The judge ordered that even the sensitisation programmes to be conducted for the police personnel, in accordance with one of the directions issued by him on June 7, must be conducted through the persons belonging to the community or the LGBTQIA+ activists or the NGO workers involved in the cause of supporting and protecting the community from various onslaughts. Justice Venkatesh requested Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram to instruct the authorities concerned to be more proactive on the issue. The court expressed dismay over certain incidents of insensitive reporting of news related to LGBTQIA+ community in the media. “ Stigmatising, inaccurate and inherently unscientific phrases such as ‘A man has turned into a woman’ and ‘A woman has turned into a man’ are rooted in queerphobia and cannot be tolerated or entertained any further. It is high time journalists stick to sensitive and inclusive terms on the gender spectrum,” the court observed. Refraining from issuing directions to the media since it might unwittingly trench upon the freedom of the press, the judge requested it to exercise self-restraint. He was also shocked to come across a prescription given by a psychiatrist to a gay man without realising there was no cure for gender identity. Pointing out that the psychiatrist had also referred the patient to a psychotherapist for cognitive behavioural therapy, the judge said: “These are the ways and means adopted by professionals under the guise of conversion therapy.” The judge requested Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan to take such issues to the notice of National Medical Commission and Indian Psychiatric Society and find out by October 4 as to how they plan to address such issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/amend-rules-to-punish-police-personnel-who-harass-lgbtqia-community-hc-directs-state-government/article36240514.ece

02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||GCC poorly maintaining HC campus: Registrar||The Madras High Court administration has complained to the court, on its judicial side, that the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is showing little interest in ensuring proper maintenance of the court campus. In a report submitted before the first Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu, Registrar (Administration) V. Devanathan said the GCC had to be goaded constantly to get work done. The report was filed through High Court counsel S. Haja Mohideen Gisthi in response to a PIL petition filed in 2017 about the lack of hygiene inside the campus. On the litigant N. Rajkumar’s complaint that GCC was not cleaning the campus properly, the Registrar said, “It is true that the Corporation of Chennai shows little interest in the maintenance activities on campus.” “There is reluctance at every level and every issue is required to be escalated to the higher authorities,” he added. On the menace of stray dogs on the court campus, the High Court Registry said the issue was perennial. After receiving the Registrar’s report, the litigant’s counsel sought a week to file a rejoinder.

02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State to speed up satellite township project||The State government will take steps to speed up its project to develop a satellite township in Thirumazhisai, Minister for Housing and Urban Development S. Muthusamy said in the Assembly on Wednesday. The Minister’s comments came as a response to DMK legislator V.G. Raajendran (Tiruvallur), who suggested that the State government should develop satellite townships, instead of expanding the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) to new places, without developing civic infrastructure there. However, Mr. Muthusamy replied that it would not be possible not to include more areas under the CMA, waiting for infrastructure in the newly-included areas. Mr. Raajendran also urged the government to ensure the efficient functioning of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to make sure that constructions are of quality. As for constructions in the CMDA jurisdiction, the State must ensure the quality of construction of residential units by builders by seeking reports of soil test, water tests and structural designs at regular intervals, so that mishaps do not occur, he said. “Stage-wise structural reports should be received from them once every three months,” he said. During his speech, MLA S. Ambethkumar (Vandavasi) said efficient functioning of CMDA would help get approvals for construction projects at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-to-speed-up-satellite-township-project/article36240448.ece
02 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||WRD planning to expand storage in Madurantakam lake||Madurantakam lake, one of the largest irrigation waterbodies in Chengalpattu district, will soon be rejuvenated with additional storage capacity. The Water Resources Department (WRD) also plans to improve the waterbody as a drinking water source to cater to the city’s growing water needs. The department will also adopt a different approach in its restoration efforts, given the multiple issues in the transportation of excavated silt, increase in the number of intense rainfall days during monsoons and the widening gap between demand and supply. Officials of the WRD said desilting of the lake alone did not help increase the storage capacity. There are plans to increase the full tank level by raising the height of six weirs, structures that allow surplus water to flow out. At present, the lake’s storage capacity, which is spread over 1,058 hectare, has reduced to 530 million cubic feet (mcft). “We will be able to improve the storage to 790 mcft by a combination of factors. Apart from desilting the lake, the height of the weirs will be raised by two feet to build more storage,” an official said. Instead of dumping the excavated silt elsewhere, the WRD plans to use it to raise the height of lands in the foreshore area, which are usually submerged once the lake fills up. Work to strengthen the bunds will also be implemented. The tender will be floated in a couple of weeks for the Rs. 120-crore project that will be taken up with financial assistance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plan-to-expand-storage-in-madurantakam-lake/article36240473.ece

According to the officials from the Department of School Education, over 600 government, aided and private schools (high and higher secondary) reopened and many schools allowed only Class X and Class XII students on the first day. For Class X, out of the estimated 34,426 students in government, aided and private schools, 23,369 or nearly 68% turned up. Out of the 29,169 Class XII students in the schools in the district, nearly 75% or 21,719 attended the physical classes, officials said. The attendance remained low for Class IX and XI students as many schools did not insist on their turnout for physical classes. Only around 55% of Class IX students (14,846 out of 26,831 students) and around 59% of Class XI students (12,936 out of 21,819 students) were present. While all the 259 government and aided schools and nearly all private schools reopened in Coimbatore district, a few private schools located close to the inter-State border did not reopen on Wednesday. As day scholars from Kerala were not being allowed to enter the State, these schools appealed to Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer N. Geetha that they would be unable to reopen the schools and would continue with online classes, the officials said. P.

02 September 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. not to collect security deposit for buildings it approves||Coimbatore Corporation has decided not to collect the security deposit it used to collect at the time of giving building plan approval. A resolution passed at the July council meeting said that it would collect security deposit for all buildings except those residential buildings that were not more than 12m in height, that did not have more than three dwelling units or measured more than 750 sq.m., and industrial buildings. In the resolution, the corporation also decided to return the security deposit for those applicants who had constructed as per the approved plan and obtained building completion certificate. The corporation said it would collect the security deposit as per the provisions of the Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019. At present, the corporation collected Rs. 75 per sq.m. for residential buildings and Rs. 150 a sq.m. for other buildings. The resolution meant that the corporation would collect security deposit only for those buildings that the Local Planning Authority approved and other buildings, particularly buildings that measured more than 12m in height, had three or more three dwelling units and had an area more than 750 sq.m. Or, the corporation would not collect security deposit for constructing buildings it approved, said sources. The decision appeared to be quite opposite to what the CREDAI had demanded as the resolution had also recorded the realtors’ and developers’ association’s demand. Exemption sought It had sought exemption from paying security deposit on applications approved by the Local Planning Authority saying the developers or promoters had to pay security deposit to both the Authority and the corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-not-to-collect-security-deposit-for-buildings-it-approves/article36240522.ece
02 September 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Colleges witness thin attendance on first day||After almost 15 months students returned to colleges on September 1 as the State Government had eased COVID-19 lockdown restriction. But attendance was thin as students from Kerala continued to take online classes, and many from within the district and neighbouring districts chose to adopt a wait-and-watch approach, said sources in the academia. At the Government Arts College, Coimbatore, the management had permitted only final year undergraduate and postgraduate students to return to colleges on the first day on Wednesday. Given the fact that only final year students had returned, there was no necessity for the college to go in for the Government norm that not more than 50% students should be present and that classes should be held on rotational basis. At the entrance, the college security and faculty checked identity, body temperature and asked students to wash their hands with sanitisers, said S. Suryaprakash, a final year B.Sc. Botany student. The college had a few days ago collected the vaccination status of students. On the first day, science faculty asked students to attend lab sessions, said sources in the college. In private colleges, only those students from within the city and its neighbourhood turned up. And, that too from those years for whom the managements had opened classrooms. The college had asked only final year postgraduate students to return on the first day. The final year undergraduate students would return on September 6 and second year students on September 21, said D. Brindha, Principal, PSG College of Arts and Science. The college had opened classrooms only for those students who had had at least one dose of vaccine and hostel only for those who had had two doses, she added. In another city college, the attendance was poor as a majority of the students were from Kerala. Given the restriction the district administration had placed on students commuting daily from Kerala and the necessity to stay in hostels or rent houses or rooms, the students from Kerala chose to continue attend classes online, said a faculty. Many colleges in the city’s outskirts bordering Kerala also chose to ask students from Kerala to attend only online classes. The managements said they as well as the parents of students from both the States wanted to adopt a wait and watch approach to see if classes would continue for a while or if there would another lockdown as and when the third COVID-19 wave hits the city. Meanwhile, the talk in classrooms was also that. The students were happy to return to classrooms but the talk was about the next lockdown, Mr. Suryaprakash added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/colleges-witness-thin-attendance-on-first-day/article36240533.ece

02 September 2021||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||‘Take action against those involved in sand mining’||Protesting against the rampant sand mining in Oddanchatram and Palani blocks in Dindigul district by a group being supported by an influential political functionary from the ruling party here, farmers and members of TN Environment Protection Group demanded the police to immediatelyregister cases on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters, Mukilan, coordinator of the TN Environment Protection Group, claimed that mining activities were going on round-the-clock in at least eight locations in the above two blocks. “There are ample evidences to prove that sand mining was going on and dipper lorry movement was heavy during nights,” he charged. Demanding the new government headed by M. K. Stalin to take strong action and suspend those partymen involved in the illegal act, he alleged that some local police officers connived with the party functionaries and remained mute spectators. The police had booked cases against a farmer association leader Ragupathi for having raised his voice against sand mining, he said. When culprits, who were looting the natural resources, were allowed to go scot-free, farmers who acted as the whistle-blowers were charged falsely. The Nallathangal Tank and other waterbodies have been mined so deep that in future, the farmers would find it tough to draw water for irrigation, Mr Mukilan said and added that many other tanks in Oddanchatram taluk including Manjanaickanpatti and others may turn like a desert soon. The police permitted five persons to make a representation to District Collector S. Visagan. After the Collector assured to look into the complaint, they dispersed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-stern-action-against-those-involved-in-sand-mining/article36240669.ece

While areas to the north side of Erode – Kunnathur Road comes under Karumandichellipalayam Town Panchayat, areas located to the south side of the road comes under Perundurai Town Panchayat. Both have a population of 25,000 and 35,000 respectively, the letter said. The letter said that Perundurai‘s geographical proximity to major cities and its location near the Salem – Kochi national highway paves way for more growth opportunities.

The petitioner was a minor at that time. After completing Diploma in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2017, he submitted the application seeking compassionate appointment. The request was turned down by Tangedco as the application was not made within the prescribed period of three years. The petitioner said he could not make the application at the time of his father’s death as he was a minor then. In its response, Tangedco submitted that the application was made after a lapse of 11 years and three months. Justice D. Krishnakumar observed that Tangedco had clearly prescribed the time limit to prefer the application made for compassionate appointment as three years from the date of the death of government servants.

02 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Two undergo gender reassignment surgery||Two youths in their twenties underwent female-to-male gender reassignment surgery at Government Rajaji Hospital recently. After a week’s recuperation, both have been discharged. Both surgeries, which lasted for about two hours each, were performed by a team with specialists drawn from the departments of gynaecology, endocrinology, anaesthesia, psychiatry and plastic surgery. According to Dean A. Rathinavel, it is the first time that a gender reassignment procedure has been done at GRH, making it the only centre in south Tamil Nadu to carry out such surgeries. The only other centre in the State with a dedicated clinic for the third gender is Rajiv Gandhi Governmnet General Hospital in Chennai. The two youths, a 24-year-old M.Com graduate from Madurai and a 21-year-old B. Com graduate from Tirunelveli, have been living as transmen for more than a decade. Cases for gender alteration surgeries are taken up after much preparation, S. Sridhar, Head of Endocrinology Department and convener of transgender clinic, GRH, told The Hindu.  “It is important to choose the right candidate because those who undergo the irreversible surgery require lifelong follow-up and hormonal therapy for bone health,” he said. “Both patients were put on three months of psychiatric counselling and six months of hormonal therapy before the operation.” They were given a new lease of life by Head of Obstetrics & Gynaecology N. Sumathi, who was assisted by Jeyanthi Prasad and Krishnaveni in removing the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. S. Pappiah and Sudharson were in charge of anaesthesia, while pre-and-postoperative care was provided by Head of Plastic Surgery Suresh Kumar. Even though the transgender clinic was ready in 2020, it remained under-utilised until two months ago. Close to 200 transgenders have been medically assessed and issued identity cards, while 45 of them are now under various stages of treatment at the clinic. On Thursday, one more transperson will get admitted for gender reassignment surgery, which is performed as per Tamil Nadu Government National Health Mission protocols. According to Dr. Sridhar, plans for breast and penile implantation surgeries, laser hair removal for hirutism and vocal cord tightening are also in the pipeline. The male-to-female conversion is more common and there are many patients waiting for breast implants. The clinic runs from outpatient no. 4 in the old GRH building from 10 a.m. to noon every Thursday.

02 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry govt. to pay fees for Centac-sponsored students||The government has decided to pay the fees for students sponsored by the Centralised Admission Committee (Centac) for professional courses in the Union Territory, Chief Minister N. Rangasamy informed the Assembly on Wednesday. He made the announcement while winding up the debate on the annual Budget in the Assembly. The Chief Minister also said the government had decided to increase freedom fighters’ pension from Rs. 9,000 to Rs. 10,000. The amount given for the funeral expenses of the Adi Dravidar community had been increased from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 25,000. The financial assistance given to lactating mothers was enhanced from Rs. 18,000 to Rs. 25,000. The government has decided to conduct free coaching classes for IAS aspirants at the Kamaraj Manipandam after its inauguration. The stipend given to final year medical students had been increased from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 20,000. The salary of voucher paid employees at the Public Works Department had been increased from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000. The salary would be paid through the treasury. The government would also regularise anganwadi staff now working on contract basis, he added Statehood issue Expressing confidence in obtaining Statehood for the Union Territory, the Chief Minister said, “The Centre is also thinking on those lines. I have already taken up the issue with Prime Minister and during my trip to New Delhi, I will again apprise him on the need for Statehood.” Responding to Opposition leader R. Siva’s statement that the Budget speech did not mention about the demand for Statehood, the Chief Minister said, “There is no change in my stand. Our party was even formed with the idea to obtain Statehood. I am confident of getting it.” Mr. Siva said the effort of the government must be to raise resources so that government need not entirely depend on Central assistance to implement welfare and development works. The government should promote industrial and tourism activities for revenue generation and to create employment opportunity. “The single window system for giving permission to start industries is only in name. People interested in setting up industries have to run from one department to other and then wait endlessly,” he said. He also wanted to revive efforts to set up the port in Puducherry. “The government should not entertain the misgivings of a lobby which is working against the Puducherry port,” he added. Mr. Siva also urged the government to revive the textile mills and the defunct cooperative units. PASIC and PAPSCO used to run 5 petrol pumps and 33 bars. Now, most of them were either running on loss or closed, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-govt-to-pay-fees-for-centac-sponsored-students/article36240967.ece
02 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Helping Narikurava women export products to global markets||The gift stockings hung from evergreen trees across several homes in Australia this Christmas will have a connection to this city. The gift hampers are the handiwork of young women from the Narikurava tribal settlements here. At the JALY Home, a refuge for street and gypsy children run by the not-for-profit Samugam Trust, a group of destitute women, including members of the nomadic tribe, are busy sewing a range of products from upcycled saris — from gift stockings, dolls and eco-friendly bags to purses and pouches. The export demand originates from the U.K., Australia, France and Belgium. The tailoring unit with a dozen sewing machines is part of the self-sustaining activities at JALY (Justice Awareness Loyalty for Youth) Home, which was established 15 years ago to wean away the children of Narikurava settlements in Lawspet, Udayampet and Madagadipet from rag-picking and begging on the streets for sustenance. “The tribal families would try to justify seeking alms or rummaging garbage piles as they had children to feed. So, we realised that our first intervention should be enrolling the children in government schools,” said Bruno Savio J., who founded the Samugam Trust and Home. “We had to break through the initial resistance and distrust to convince them to send the children to school. The nomadic nature of these people also posed a challenge,” he said. “Now, it is almost a standard practice, and we have 100% enrolment rates in these colonies and drop-outs are very few.” 300 children The NGO has under its care about 300 children, including 116 at the Krishna Nagar shelter, 96 at the Boys’ Home in Tiruchi, and another 70 children who are being sent to school from the settlements. The project has had plenty of benefactors in the city and abroad, like Rita, a Belgian philanthropist who helped in various ways in its early days, and Jal Ong, a Spanish citizen whose donation helped it move from a rented place to its own premises at Krishna Nagar. There are Samugam Trust chapters in Belgium and Australia, as well as volunteers in the U.K. and Spain, who coordinate export orders for the products. The tailoring enterprise is supported by the Province of West-Vlaanderen, Belgium, and Gayle Factor, a women’s empowerment initiative in Melbourne. Award Last year, the Samugam Trust/JALY Home was presented with the 2019 Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar. The first generation of girl adoptees are now job-ready, while a few others have, by choice, been married off to fine young men. Kausalya, from a Narikurava settlement in Lawspet, who was enrolled as a 13-year-old under the Right To Education Act, 2009, and Khushboo, have completed a nursing course and are set to become nurses at private hospitals. Vijayalakshmi, who is pursuing a catering course, is interning at a restaurant opened by the Home in Kuyilapalayam near Auroville. The Home raises these children in an ambience that matches, if not exceeds, the regular experience of mainstream peers, with guitar/keyboard lessons, yoga, computer classes, classical dance and silambam training. Changing the lives of street children has sparked an attitudinal and behavioural change back in the tribal settlements, said Mr. Savio, who is supported in the endeavour by his wife, Annie Nirmala. The tribals procure balloons and toys in bulk and sell them for a profit on the Promenade Beach on a one-time Trust grant of Rs. 7,000 for each family. During the pandemic, the Trust has been providing a regular supply of groceries to the settlements. Efforts are on to retrain the Narikuravas in their traditional skill of making beaded jewellery to tie in with a proposal to get corporate clientele to use them in the lanyards of ID cards. There is also a noticeable awareness on health and hygiene. Not too long ago, women would deliver their babies in their ramshackle hutments. These days, institutional delivery is the default choice. The Home does not keep images of any God. “We celebrate Diwali, Ramzan and Christmas with equal enthusiasm,” Mr. Savio said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/helping-narikurava-women-export-products-to-global-markets/article36240965.ece

02 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Restoration of heritage school buildings begins||The Puducherry Smart City Development Limited (PSCDL) has commenced work to restore the decades-old Calve College Government School and the V.O. Chidambaram Government Higher Secondary School. The civil and engineering works have begun. The PSCDL is executing the project and the Centre has already sanctioned Rs. 4.80 crore for Calve College and Rs. 2.81 crore for VOC School. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage is the architectural consultant for the project. The Pondicherry Engineering College will look after the structural aspect. Chief Minister N. Rangasamy launched the restoration work for the two schools located on Mission Street on Wednesday. Ministers A. Namassivayam, K. Lakshminarayanan, Chief Secretary-cum-Chairman of PSCDL Ashwani Kumar and Chief Executive Officer T. Arun were present. French legacy The schools, a legacy of the French, had been crying for attention from the time cyclone Thane struck Puducherry in 2011. According to Arul, senior architect of Intach, “The restoration work, including structural strengthening, has begun from the roof of the Calve College. This mainly includes replacement of the wooden rafters and beams plastering without making any alterations to its architectural beauty. The building will also have new flooring, windows and a toilet block for students and staff.” The Thane cyclone had caused extensive damage to the first floor of the building. The cost for the school’s renovation was then estimated at at Rs. 5.40 crore. A Grade II A heritage structure, Calve College was among the three schools functioning out of heritage buildings in the city. The other two were V.O. Chidambaram Government Higher Secondary School and the Pensionnat De Jeunes Filles (Government Girls French High School). The schools were provisionally shut down by the government in 2014 after an inspection reported that the buildings were “unsafe”. The Calve School gets its name from Calve Souprayachettiar (Kalavai Subburaya Chettiyar) who belonged to a renowned merchant family. The school was opened for the education of local Hindu and Muslim children. The family’s roots are in Kalavai (Calve) village near Vellore. In the beginning, the school functioned as a private school till May 1877 when it was placed under public management. From 1877 to 1880, it was run by members of a congregation. An English section was opened in 1880. After 1885, it was upgraded into an upper primary school and opened to children of all castes, according to an Intach report. Calve College, which was built in 1886, had churned out political leaders such as V. Subbiah and former Chief Minister M.O.H. Farook. The school continues to cater to French education for a small group of 110 students from Classes I to X, apart from following the State syllabus. The restoration work of the V.O.C. School will also be taken up simultaneously with replacement of wooden rafters and beams on the ground floor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restoration-of-heritage-school-buildings-begins/article36240975.ece

02 September 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Subsidised drip irrigation scheme for farmers||Small and marginal farmers have been urged to apply for certificates through online so that they can avail the benefits of a subsidised drip irrigation scheme implemented to assist them in achieving profitable cultivation. In a press release, Collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver asked the farmers cultivating crops in less than 2.50 acres of land to apply for small/ marginal farmer certificate as this certificate would enable them to avail 100 per cent subsidy to install drip and sprinkler systems under the Central government-sponsored scheme – the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) – a scheme implemented to promote the use of drip irrigation in paddy cultivation. The Agriculture Department has tested the technique in paddy cultivation at select fields having filter point irrigation facilities in Tiruvarur and Cuddalore districts on a pilot basis in 2018-19, sources said. The pilot project showed positive results with the total quantum of harvest per acre increasing by 50 % and water efficiency increasing by around 30 %, prevention of leaching loss of nutrients, reduction in labour cost by 40 % with respect to weeding operations and conservation of electricity by around 30 %. So, the Department promoted the concept in 15 paddy cultivating districts (other than delta districts) – Ariyalur, Cuddalore, Erode, Kancheepuram, Karur, Namakkal, Pudukottai, Salem, Tirunelveli, Theni, Tiruvallur, Tiruchi, Tiruvannamalai, Vellore and Villupuram - in the subsequent year 2019-20. As the implementation of this scheme in 15 districts showed the same positive results such as efficient use of water resulting in higher yield, the department is all set to introduce the drip irrigation concept in the fields in the revenue villages having filter point irrigation facilities in delta districts this year. To avail 100 % subsidy, the small/ marginal farmers were urged to apply for the certificate online immediately and receive the certificate at the special camps to be held on September 7 at all the taluk offices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/subsidised-drip-irrigation-scheme-for-farmers/article36240617.ece
02 September 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Do not rename Sangam literature’||The Thamizh Desiya Periyakkam has resented the State government’s move to identify Tamil Sangam Literature as “Dravida Kalanjiyam.” In a press release issued here on Tuesday, its president P.Maniarasan opposed the proposed name for the compilation by saying that the word “Dravidam” has not been found in the Sangam Literature. He was referring to an announcement of the Minister for Tamil Official Language, Tamil Culture and Archaeology, Thangam Thennarasu, that it had been proposed to bring out a compilation of Tamil Sangam Literature under the name of “Dravida Kalanjiyam.” He deplored the change in the stand of Chief Minister M.K.Stalin, who had during the Assembly election campaign used the word “Thamizhar” more frequently, but after assuming the office he had started using “Dravidam” in his speeches and addresses more frequently and went on to declare himself as a Dravidian stock. Even Robert Caldwell, who had written a book on the grammar of Dravidian or South Indian family of languages, had mentioned that he had taken the word “Dravidam” from the “Manusmriti” and the literary work of Kumarila Bhattar “Thanthravarthika” in the Sanskrit language. If the State government was to keen on its stand, then they would not hesitate to take the issue to the people by organising demonstrations, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-rename-sangam-literature/article36240620.ece
02 September 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘When liquor shops are open, why Chathurthi celebration is not allowed’||State BJP president K. Annamalai has questioned the ban on Vinayaka Chathurthi celebrations in public places with installation of Vinayaga idols when liquor shops remain open during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Even as liquor shops transact brisk business with no respect for COVID-19-appropriate behaviour, why don’t you allow Vinayaka Chathurthi celebration as usual in public places?,” Mr. Annamalai questioned while addressing reporters at Thoothukudi airport on Wednesday. Before leaving for BJP party workers’ meetings in Tenkasi district, Mr. Annamalai said the Tamil Nadu government, through a specific order, had banned Vinayaka Chathurthi celebration in public places while allowing celebration in houses. Instead, the government should have allowed the celebration in public places with some restrictions like a particular the number of participants or guidelines, he said. Instead of citing the ban on the celebration imposed in Karnataka, the Tamil Nadu government, like the Maharashtra government, should have allowed the celebration by issuing standard operating procedures to curtail the spread of the viral infection. The BJP would oppose the ‘blanket ban’ on Chathurthi celebration in public places, Mr. Annamalai said. Alliance with AIADMK Asserting that his party’s alliance with the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu was “strong”, he said the two parties were working in a cohesive manner in the Assembly on issues like probe into Kodanadu heist and murder case and merger of Dr. Jayalalithaa University with Annamalai University “which are being done for political reasons”. “After a party in power implements a new project or starts new institution, the opposition party, on coming to power, would change or abolish it in Tamil Nadu. It has been happening here for decades. The DMK, which claims to be doing politics with a difference, should stop indulging in such activities,” Mr. Annamalai stressed. The BJP leader also trashed the opposition’s criticism on the memorial built in Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab. “It is a true tribute to the martyrs by incorporating new modern facilities there. While Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has criticised it, the party leader and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has welcomed it,” Mr. Annamalai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/annamalai-questions-ban-on-chathurthi-celebrations/article36240657.ece
02 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Students happy to return to schools||Students of classes 9 to 12 returned to school after a 15-month hiatus with strict COVID-19 protocol in place. From staggered entry to limiting the seating capacity in classrooms, schools have designed their own methods to ensure the safety of the students and staff. Even though there was some anxiety, most students and parents seemed keen on getting back to physical classes after a long break. At the Periyar Maniammai's Girls Higher Secondary School, teachers manned the entry gates and the pathway leading to the school building on campus. Students’ body temperature was checked and sanitisers were given before entering. Each class was divided into two batches, with each batch allotted a class teacher. Only two students were allowed per bench and were asked not to remove their masks or touch anyone or their belongings. ‘It is possible for teachers to be hesitant and afraid but we are enthusiastic as we bring back life to this campus after a whole year,’ a teacher at the school said, as she welcomed students. Teachers here were instructed to record students' body temperature along with their attendance on a daily basis. A majority of the students of the school were from lower-income families and unable to attend online classes, Principal, S. Bakkialakshmi said. Teachers would take the first three days to talk to the students and ease them into the new routine. There are students who would be here by force, there are students who have had deaths due to COVID-19 in their families, and other such incidents. We will need to comfort and care for their mental health before proceeding with classes, she said. At the Government Higher Secondary School, Poovalur, all students returned to school with enthusiasm. ‘Some said they were forced to go to work in fields, at carpenter’s workshops and garages. Others said that they were sent to live with their grandparents or other relatives as their parents would go to work. They were lonely and happy to come to school to see familiar faces,’ Satheesh Kumar, science teacher said. While some private schools with van facilities had decided to provide them to the students, some others had insisted that parents drop and pick up the children at school. Parents whose children suffered from ailments said that they had requested the schools to continue to conduct online classes or stream video recordings of the classes for the children. ‘My child is immunocompromised and has low haemoglobin. I am worried about her education, but I am unable to send her to school. I hope they consider my request,’ K. Uma Maheshwari, a mother of a student studying at a private school in K.K. Nagar. said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/students-happy-to-return-to-schools/article36240636.ece
02 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Need for measured steps to restore bridge courses||Academics have advocated measured steps for restoration of bridge/ foundation course for first-year students of arts and science colleges with proper planning, now that the off-line classes have started for intermediate and final year students Last year, the academic year started too late for the freshers and the priority of the colleges was to complete as many units of portions they could. Dovetailing bridge course, which has been effective in enabling students from rural parts to adapt to the academic environment in higher educational institutions, with student induction programme, colleges usually offer it as a one-week intensive training before commencement of regular classes. The University Grants Commission had initiated induction programme to enable students acclimatise with the new surroundings, develop bond with fellow students and teachers, develop sensitivity towards various issues of social relevance, and imbibing values so as to become responsible citizens. The week-long activity encompasses a daily routine of games and sports to develop team work, mentoring by faculty members to equip the students to explore themselves, experience the joy of learning, standing up to peer pressure, and taking decisions with courage. ‘The road to recovery is too long. All is not lost. As such, there is no indication on when the normal offline classroom activities will be restored. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the foundation programme is inevitable. Skipping some portions can be manageable, but learning of life-skills must not be brushed aside. The pandemic must not be an alibi for skipping the bridge course,’ G. Balakrishnan, former Vice-Principal of St. Joseph’s College and soft skills trainer, said. The colleges can even consider incorporating the bridge course into the academic activities during the course of the odd semester, if not the start of the session, Prof. Balakrishnan said, adding that the same could be done for the second year students who had to miss out on the foundation program last year. ‘Bridge courses being a requirement of the University Grants Commission, it is indeed necessary for universities and colleges to conduct bridge courses. The initiatives for scheduling and conducting bridge courses need to be taken at the department-level for better execution,’ V. Vinod Kumar, Professor, Department of English, Bharathidasan University, said. Since there is a strong possibility for the 2021-22 academic year to be extended till June-July, the bridge course ought to be conducted at timings that students find convenient, Prof. Vinod Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/need-for-measured-steps-to-restore-bridge-courses/article36240623.ece
02 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Turnout of students poor in arts and science colleges||Truncated student turnout coupled with a sense of disquiet among teachers was evident in arts and science colleges on the first day of the academic calendar for the odd semester of 2021-2022 session for intermediate and final year under graduate students, on Wednesday. The student turnout was in the range of 40 to 50 % in private and government-aided colleges, and less in government colleges, according to teachers. The lack of seriousness on the part of students could, perhaps, be due to the indication given by the government that the physical presence of the students must not be insisted upon, guess teachers. In a six-day week, three days each have been fixed for intermediate and final year students on alternate days. There were problems galore. Leave alone the problems within the campus that had not been cleaned up in many an institution, a large number of students attending online classes kept away purportedly due to the discontinuity in the 2GB free data per day scheme. As per the Standard Operating Procedures, the teachers are expected to maintain social distancing among students in the classrooms. In colleges with large student numbers, the institutions had utilised all the rooms at their disposal including laboratories for seating the students. But, the situation could turn unmanageable once the classes for the first-year students begin. Ideally, it would be better to conduct online classes for first-year students for a specific duration until the pandemic fear diminishes further,’ a professor of a government-aided college in a rural part of Tiruchi district said. Teachers do hope that the student turnout, that of girls, in particular, could turn better from the start of next week. But, the compulsion for teachers to juggle between online and offline classes for the intermediate and final year students all through the six working days in a week has apparently caused consternation among many. ‘It is not about our sense of duty. Enormous workload is bound to dilute focus of attention. Also, we had so far been handling online classes for students from specific spots in the college campus with good signal clarity. We are now constrained to confine ourselves to the assigned classrooms. The problem herein is that we will not be able to engage the remaining 50 % of the students online simultaneously,’ a teacher of a government college said. Woes of guest lecturers It was a double whammy for the over 600 guest lecturers, the mainstay of the 10 erstwhile constituent units of Bharathidasan University. Sans motivation, these guest lecturers had to not only work without salary for four months - since the university had stopped paying them from April - they also had to continue working in unhygienic settings. ‘Enforcement of the other aspects of SOP including physical distancing and other safety protocol is welcome. But, ignoring the hygienic need of students has caused enormous disappointment among teachers,’ a faculty member of the Government Arts and Science College, Srirangam, said. According to the faculty, the onus is on the college principal to fulfil this very essential aspect of the SOP even if it would require utilisation of funds maintained under PTA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/turnout-of-students-poor-in-arts-and-science-colleges/article36240625.ece

It was one among the important projects launched by the civic body when it began sourcing funds under the Smart City Mission after the city was selected among the smart cities across the country.

Fine tuning works were on to short out defects if any. “The test run of the illumination will be conducted shortly and the groundwork for the process is on. The people of Tiruchi and tourists will see the Rockfort in new colours soon,” he said. He said that 280 watts RGBA (red green blue alpha) light emitting diode flood lights had been erected at 72 locations around the Rockfort. In addition, 140 watts RGBA LED flood lights had also been installed at 36 locations. Modifications were made on existing towers around the Rockfort to hold the high power lights.

02 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||New scheme to protect COVID-19 hit children||The police launched a new initiative to reach out to children who have lost one or both parents due to COVID-19 and nominating constables as their ‘guardians’ towards ensuring their safety. A press release says 865 such children have been identified in the nine districts in the central zone and their details have been collected under the initiative, ‘Kaaki Kavasangal,’ a plan of V.Balakrishnan, Inspector General of Police, Central Zone.

So far, 555 constables have been nominated as guardians of as many children. ‘Guardians’ for the remaining children were being nominated from among the constables manning the women’s help desks in the police stations. The ‘guardians’ have been instructed to meet their wards every Saturday to enquire about their safety and well being. The first such meeting was held on August 28 to provide counselling on continuing education without any interruption. “Even if the constables, who have been nominated as guardians of such children, were transferred they have been instructed to stay in touch with their wards either by meeting them in person or calling them over phone every week so as to ensure their safety and well being.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-scheme-to-protect-covid-19-hit-children/article36240631.ece

02 September 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Schools, colleges reopen after pandemic-break||Happy scenes were witnessed on school and college premises on Wednesday as students returned to their educational institutions after a long pandemic-induced lockdown. Since schools and colleges were set to reopen from Wednesday, local bodies had been instructed to disinfect the premises of all educational institutions before Tuesday. The task was completed under the supervision of local administration department officials. While the students’ body temperature was checked at the entrance of schools and colleges with thermal scanners, they were also asked if any of their family members or neighbours had COVID-19 symptoms. Isolation rooms had been kept ready in all schools and the colleges. Only two students were allowed to sit in a bench as only 50% of the students were allowed to attend the class on turn basis. Since the Department of School Education has prepared a ‘Health Profile’ format for students and the teachers, the forms were filled up by them. The students also submitted the consent given by the parents for allowing them to attend classes. In Tirunelveli, 319 schools reopened while 248 schools functioned in Tenkasi. Collector V. Vishnu, who visited Schaffter Higher Secondary School and Kallanai Corporation Higher Secondary School to review the implementation of standard operating procedure, said the heads of all the educational institutions had been instructed to strictly follow the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour on their premises while allowing only 50% of the students every day. The students had been instructed to wear masks, maintain physical distancing and wash their hands with soap or sanitiser frequently. Even as 90% of the teachers and the non-teaching staff of the schools had been vaccinated, the remaining teachers and the parents had been advised to get inoculated through special camps to be organised at the educational institutions. The district administration had deployed 13 special teams with officials drawn from the Departments of Public Health, Education, Revenue and the Local Administration to monitor the functioning of the schools and the colleges.

02 September 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Injured gaur shifted to reserve forest for treatment||An 8-year-old gaur that was found with a fracture to one of its legs in Coonoor town is being treated by the Forest Department for its injuries. The gaur was found near the bus depot in Coonoor during the early hours of Wednesday, unable to move and lift itself from the ground. Based on the instructions of the District Forest Officer (Nilgiris division), Bhosale Sachin Thukkaram, it was decided to transport the animal to a nearby reserve forest where it could be treated for its injuries. Assistant Conservator of Forests (Nilgiris division), K. Saravanakumar, said that the animal was tranquillized and shifted to the Sims Park reserve forest. “The animal seems to be quite healthy, keeping in mind the nature of its injuries. It is feeding and active at the moment, and we have shifted it to the reserve forest to keep it calm,” said Mr. Saravanakumar. Forest veterinarians have been called to offer their suggestions as to what could be the best course of treatment to help heal the animal’s wounds and rehabilitate it back into the wild. Forest department officials said that they did not know the cause of the injury to the animal, but speculated that it could have sustained injury due to a fight with another animal. Survival rate The survival rate of injured gaurs is exceptionally low in the Nilgiris, primarily due to the lack of a dedicated rescue and rehabilitation centre for wildlife in the Nilgiris. Officials confirmed that another gaur that had broken its legs in a fall in Udhagamandalam in a separate incident a few months back had died from its injuries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/injured-gaur-shifted-to-reserve-forest-for-treatment/article36240521.ece

Officials said that the ease in restrictions to the Nilgiris from neighbouring Karnataka, combined with the Krishna Jayanthi holiday on Monday had led to a high number of tourists in the Nilgiris. Inflow into the Government Botanical Garden over the weekend, and on Krishna Jayanthi totalled 10,813 visitors. According to Horticulture Department officials, the visitors to the district over the weekend and on Monday comprised almost 60 percent of all visitors since the district reopened tourism spots on August 23. Hotel owners in the Nilgiris said they were happy to see tourists returning to the district and hoped that the reopening of tourism spots would entice more visitors.

We hope that the ‘second season’ will be a success with more tourists visiting,” said a hotel owner in Udhagamandalam town. While all EDCs administered by the Forest Department opened to visitors from Monday, the Doddabetta Peak remained closed due to damage to a road leading to the peak caused by heavy rains in the Nilgiris over the last week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-nilgiris-sees-rise-in-footfall-after-ecological-hotspots-open-to-tourists/article36240519.ece

02 September 2021||VIRUDHUNAGAR,TAMIL NADU||Man booked for sexually assaulting minor daughter||A 12-year-girl had been sexually assaulted multiple times by her father here. Virudhunagar All Women Police station has booked the father, a loadman, under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The police said the mother of the girl, who was working in a local company, was perplexed as her daughter, a Class VIII student, was continuously crying without revealing the reason. After she brought one of her women relatives to her house, the girl told her how her father had been sexually exploiting her for the last 14 months whenever she had been alone at home.

When the women asked the girl why she had not revealed this to her mother all these days, she said her father had threatened to murder her if she told anyone about it. The mother, in her complaint, said she did not want to lodge a police complaint as it would bring shame to the family. However, since she feared that her husband could continue to exploit her daughter and also pose a threat to their life, she preferred the complaint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-booked-for-sexually-assaulting-minor-daughter/article36240654.ece

"We have some students whose parents shifted out of Chennai during the pandemic since they lost their jobs. They were attending online classes, and will continue to do so till they can shift back here," said Maheshwari Kalpana, headmistress, Chennai High School, Kottur. With COVID-19 protocols in place, schools in Madurai began functioning with nearly 90% student turnout. "There are 1,65,684 students in the district who belong to Classes IX-XII at 534 high and higher secondary schools. Close to 90% attended school today," Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan said. Over 600 schools reopened in Coimbatore district. Education Department officials said some schools started functioning with students of only Classes X and XII. No major absenteeism was reported from the schools in the district, including those in the hilly regions. With day scholars from Kerala not being allowed to enter the State, the representatives of a few private schools near the inter-State border approached Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer N. Geetha, saying they won’t be able to reopen the schools on Wednesday, and that they would continue with online classes, an official said.

More than 30,000 students from Classes IX to XII were back on 210 school campuses there. While most schools in the central region reopened on Wednesday, some private schools decided to reopen on Thursday. The authorities at a private school on Vayalur Road in Tiruchi said they decided to give the students an additional day to prepare for the reopening. For the initial few weeks, the schools would conduct a refresher course, for which the State Council for Educational and Research Training (SCERT) has prepared a syllabus, to bridge learning gaps due to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-across-tamil-nadu-welcome-students-back-on-campuses/article36240462.ece

02 September 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘BJP is the agent of the people, it is the agent for development’||AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi is not BJP’s agent. It is completely wrong to make such statements, Food Minister and BJP leader Umesh Katti said in Hukkeri on Wednesday. “The BJP is the agent of the people. It is the agent for development. We are not worried about other parties,’’ he said. Mr. Katti reacted angrily to questions about allegations that Mr. Owaisi was only helping the BJP by cutting into the secular vote and by marginalising the Muslims further. “What other parties do is not our concern. Our concern is that the Muslims in Karnataka should vote for the BJP. They should realise that they have no real option as the Congress will be completely destroyed in 20 years,’’ he said. “The Muslims of Karnataka have not come from Pakistan. They are born here in India, like the rest of us,’’ he said. To a query, he said that he would appeal to the Muslims of Belagavi to vote for the BJP to keep away parochial parties such as Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti. He dismissed allegations that the BJP will form a post-poll alliance with the MES. “It is the Congress that has been playing adjustment politics with the MES. We are not like that. The people of Belagavi should teach a lesson to both the Congress and the MES,’’ he said. He said that the BJP government had released Rs. 1,000 crore to the development of Belagavi under the Smart City project. “The scheme has already brought in visible changes in Belagavi city,’’ he said. The BJP will stay in power at the Centre and Karnataka for the next 20 years. “I am sure it will stay in power in Belagavi City Corporation for 20 years from now,” he said. “We are sure to win 35 of the 58 seats in the corporation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-is-the-agent-of-the-people-it-is-the-agent-for-development/article36240694.ece

02 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Three years on, LED street lights project yet to gain traction||Nearly three years after it was taken up, the project to replace the city’s 4.85 lakh sodium vapour street lights with LED ones is yet to take off. With several deadlines issued and no tangible result on ground, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has been instructed to issue a final deadline to the consortium that has bagged the tender. As per directions from Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, the consortium will be given time till the end of the year to replace at least one lakh street lights, failing which the tender is likely to be scrapped. Should that happen, the BBMP has been instructed to float fresh tenders in smaller packages to ensure that all the street lights in the city are replaced by LED lights. This direction, according to highly placed sources, was issued following a review meeting chaired by Mr. Bommai on various development projects taken up in the city. Sources claimed that following this directive, the consortium has begun work on replacing street lights in parts of Rajarajeshwarinagar, Bommanahalli and Dasarahalli zones. They claimed that so far, over 2,000 street lights had been replaced with the energy efficient LED lights. The civic body had floated the global tender for the project in January 2018. The consortium of Shapoorji Pallonji, SMS Infrastructure and Samudra Electronics Systems Pvt. Ltd. bagged the tender, promising an energy efficiency of nearly 85%. The tender was approved by the then BBMP council in August 2018 and the Letter of Intent was issued to the consortium in 2019. The consortium was given 30 months to replace sodium vapour lights to LED lights in five phases. As per the tender conditions, they would have to replace one lakh lights in each of the first four phases, and in the last phase, 85 lakhs. The consortium is also required to undertake maintenance for 10 years after installation. The consortium will be spending approximately Rs. 830 crore on the project. Once the LED street lights are installed, the civic body is expected to save almost Rs. 17 crore per month in electricity charges. Of this, the BBMP will give Rs. 13.5 crore to the consortium. Sources said that nearly Rs. 17 crore is spent every month, translating to Rs. 204 crore annually, as electricity charges by the BBMP, while their maintenance comes up to Rs. 50 crore. If the consortium fails to ensure 85% energy saving, a fine will be levied by the BBMP, as per the tender conditions. The street lights will be monitored centrally through a smart control room. Any defect in the 4.85 lakh lights will be known immediately. This will help ensure that no part of the city is in darkness and defunct lights are taken up for repairs immediately, sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-years-on-led-street-lights-project-yet-to-gain-traction/article36240401.ece
02 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police tracing movements of the deceased prior to the accident||The Adugodi police are retracing the movements of the seven people, including DMK MLA Y. Prakash’s son Karunaa Sagar, who died in a car accident in the early hours of Tuesday, well beyond curfew hours. While the police are waiting for Karunaa’s medical reports to ascertain if he was under the influence of alcohol while driving the SUV, they are analysing CCTV footage to probe where the deceased were and sequence of events prior to the accident. Karunaa Sagar, who was behind the wheel, was allegedly speeding and lost control of the SUV on 80ft road at Koramanagala. The vehicle jumped onto the pavement, and rammed into the compound wall of a bank. The six passengers--all in their 20s--were killed. According to sources, CCTV footage from the PG accommodation in Koramangala 5th Block where some of the deceased were living, showed two girls Ishita Biswas, 21, and Bindu C., 28, leaving the residence at Monday night a little after 8.30 p.m. “They walked from the PG towards the main road for 200 metres before entering a store to make some purchases. Karunaa picked them up in his SUV and they drove past Sony junction,” said a source, but did not share details on the other friends who were in the car at the time of the accident. The other deceased were identified as Dhanusha M., 29, a dentist from Kerala, Akshay Goyal, 25, from Malappuram; Utsav, 25, from Rohtak, and Rohith, 23, a business development officer from Hubballi. Police asked them to return home The probe revealed that around 9 p.m., as night curfew was set to begin, the police at a checkpoint stopped Karunaa’s car. “After making enquiries, they asked him to return home, and drive safely,” said a police officer. A team of officials from the Transport Department visited the accident spot and inspected the area and also the car, which is in the custody of the Adugodi police. “A small temple building adjacent to the compound wall where the car rammed into was also partially damaged,” said the police. Technical team to submit report on vehicle A team is probing what went wrong that day. While preliminary investigations revealed that rash and negligent driving led to the accident, transport officials are also conducting a detailed probe to ascertain why the airbags did not inflate on impact. None of the car’s occupants were wearing seat belts. “We are checking whether there was a human error like a plastic bottle struck under the brake pedal that could have caused the accident,” said a source. The SUV manufacturer’s technical team has reportedly been called in to inspect the car and present their report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-tracing-movements-of-the-deceased-prior-to-the-accident/article36240403.ece
02 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Railways asks State to give a push to Talguppa-Honnavar railway line||Railway authorities have renewed its plea to the State government to execute the long-pending demand for a new railway line between Talguppa in Shivamogga district and Honnavar in Uttara Kannada, a distance of 82.15 km. Sources said that officials of the Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. (KRCL) met Home Minister Araga Jnanendra and officials of other departments last week and urged the government to undertake the project either in 50:50 cost sharing arrangement between the State and Indian Railways or on public-private partnership. In 2010, the Southern Railways carried out the preliminary engineering-cum-traffic survey for a new broad gauge line between Talguppa and Honnavar to provide a link to Konkan Railways, and thereby link the Malnad region to neighbouring States of Kerala, Goa, and Maharashtra. Karnataka has a coastline of 300 km studded with ports between Karwar in the north and Mangaluru in the south, in three districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada. The proposed line would not only fuel new projects along the coast but also lead to a boost in tourism, sources in the Railways said. The development of the proposed railway line would be crucial for development of major and minor ports along the west coast, such as Tadri, Bhatkal, Honnavar, Karwar. It will also serve the hinterland of Karnataka, by enabling mega projects based on transportation of coal and other industrial inputs from ports to the hinterland and transportation of iron ore, granite and other products from hinterland to ports, sources said. The proposed railway line has potential to increase both passenger and goods traffic. The preliminary survey proposed six stations and four passenger trains (trips), sources said. Cost escalation As per the 2010 survey, the estimated cost of the project was Rs. 1,511.86 crore. Now, the cost is expected to increase three times. The survey of land for the project is yet to be taken up. Though the Centre mentioned undertaking a fresh survey in the 2016 Budget, the survey and land acquisition process have not been taken up, reportedly owing to lack of political commitment from State and Union governments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/railways-asks-state-to-give-a-push-to-talguppa-honnavar-railway-line/article36240428.ece

The 155 cases, including 51 household contacts of recovered patients, were found to be positive for tuberculosis (TB) during the active case finding (ACF) campaign conducted from August 16 to 29. State Joint Director (TB) Ramesh Chandra Reddy told The Hindu that TB being detected among COVID-19-recovered individuals is a cause for concern. “Karnataka is the first State in the country to start a door-to-door survey to detect TB among COVID-19-recovered individuals and their household contacts. Based, on the results, we will issue an advisory asking people to mandatorily get screened for TB if they have symptoms,” he said. COVID-19 and TB are respiratory diseases that manifest with similar symptoms of cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. Studies suggest that presence or history of TB increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, TB co-infection increases the risk of severe COVID-19 disease, and TB/SARS CoV-2 co-infection is associated with rapid and severe symptom development and disease progression with poor outcomes for both diseases, Dr Reddy said. Both diseases require early detection and treatment to improve outcomes. During the drive, health personnel visited 6,02,887 houses of COVID-recovered individuals and screened 5,37,333 individuals for TB. While 24,598 were found to be symptomatic, 104 were diagnosed with TB. Of the 17,74,240 individuals among the household contacts of COVID-recovered persons who were screened during the drive, 8,523 were found to be symptomatic and 51 were diagnosed with TB. The ACF campaign is conducted in a staggered manner and is likely to continue even after August 31 to cover the remaining COVID recovered individuals.

In a letter addressed to BMRCL, Minister for Energy and Kannada & Culture V. Sunil Kumar said it was a serious lapse. “Ignoring Kannada during the inauguration of the metro line near Kengeri has been taken seriously by the State government. Despite the government issuing orders in the past on compulsory use of Kannada, it was ignored,” he said, adding that such lapses will not be tolerated by the Karnataka government. “I noticed that Kannada was not used on the board displayed on the stage of the inaugural event. I have sought clarification from the Managing Director and instructed him to initiate action against the officials responsible for the lapse.” The Minister said that language is an emotional issue and lapses at a function in the capital of the State were unfortunate. On August 29, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, Cabinet Ministers and elected representatives took part in the inaugural event. After flagging off the train, a function was held at Kengeri TTMC metro station. At the event, details were displayed only in English on the stage. On noticing this, citizens took to social media to vent their ire.

02 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice to govt. on plea against new advertisement rules for BBMP||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition questioning the legality of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Advertisement Rules, 2019, notified by the State government on the day the then Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa resigned from the post. A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the order on the petition filed by Sai Datta, a social worker from Bengaluru. The petitioner has claimed that the Rules are contrary to various directions issued by the High Court for removal of illegal hoardings and to prevent disfigurement of open spaces besides being violative of the guidelines of the court on erecting advertisement hoardings. Pointing out the draft of this Rule was notified back in July 2019, much before the BBMP Act, 2020, came into force from January 11, 2021, the petitioner has questioned the act of notifying the rule draft of which was not notified under the BBMP Act. Though the draft of the 2019 Rules was issued in July 2019, it was finally notified on July 26, 2021, the day then Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa resigned from the post, the petitioner has said. The petitioner has also contended that the manner in which hoardings are permitted under the 2019 Rules violates the provisions of the Karnataka Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act,1981. Also, the petitioner has questioned what was need for the State government to notify the new rule when the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Out Door Signage and Public Messaging Bylaws, 2018, dated September 6, 2019 is in existence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-to-govt-on-plea-against-new-advertisement-rules-for-bbmp/article36240405.ece

02 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NMP will lead to layoffs by pvt. firms: Sachin Pilot||Congress leader and former Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot has argued that the Centre’s National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) will lead to more layoffs by private firms and increase unemployment in the country. Speaking to mediapersons at the party office in Bengaluru on Wednesday, Mr. Pilot said private companies who obtain infrastructure assets of the Central government on lease would not retain the same employees or even the same number of employees. With the intention of making a profit, they would lay-off staff in public sector companies, he argued. The Centre has announced leasing infrastructure assets under a Rs. 6 trillion NMP while retaining ownership. Mr. Pilot said the Centre announced NMP without consultation or discussion in Parliament and criticised the lack of transparency. “Nobody knows what would be the condition of these assets after completion of the lease period,” he said The government was entering into agreements with crony capitalists, he said. As part of a nationwide plan, the Congress has decided to create awareness on NMP. On expansion of the Ashok Gehlot-led Cabinet in Rajasthan, Mr. Pilot said the party high command would take a decision. Congress general secretary Ajay Maken, who is in charge of Rajasthan, held meetings with MLAs and State leaders in Jaipur, to evolve a consensus on Cabinet expansion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nmp-will-lead-to-layoffs-by-pvt-firms-sachin-pilot/article36240426.ece
02 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Combination therapy cuts risk of CVD: Lancet study||A combination therapy of aspirin, statins, and at least two blood pressure medications given in fixed doses can slash the risk of fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) by more than half, stated an international study led by researchers in Canada and India. Published in The Lancet two days ago, the study has been presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress by the authors. The fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapies were examined both with and without aspirin versus control groups in a combined analysis of more than 18,000 patients without prior CVD from three large clinical trials. FDCs including aspirin cut the risk of heart attacks by 53%, stroke by 51%, and deaths from cardiovascular causes by 49%. About 80% of cardiovascular events occur in individuals without a prior history of such illness, meaning effective preventative strategies including medications in people without CVD is essential, if the majority of heart attacks, strokes and related deaths in the world are to be prevented, said the authors of the study. The study involved investigators from 13 countries, including St John’s Research Institute in Bengaluru, and included participants from 26 countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/combination-therapy-cuts-risk-of-cvd-lancet-study/article36240406.ece

He held a joint inspection with the local MLA and Horticulture Minister Munirathna and Higher Education Minister C. N. Ashwath Narayan, who represents the adjoining Malleswaram constituency, which is also affected by the bottleneck. A senior BBMP engineer said the road connects Mathikere flower and fruits market to Yeshwanthpur Circle and hence is critical for traffic. “It is just nearly 300 metres long, but has two-way traffic. As it is a crucial link road, traffic volumes are high. If widened it will ease a big bottleneck,” he said. However, earlier proposals to widen the road have not made headway as the road is lined with shops and the RTO. DPR awaited Mr. Gupta said the civic body had undertaken some improvements on the road to ease traffic earlier, but it was evidently not enough and the road needed to be widened. “I have directed my officials to come up with a Detailed Project Report (DPR). The widening will be taken up soon and completed in a time-bound manner,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yeshwantpur-rto-road-to-be-widened/article36240398.ece

The committee, headed by Member of the Legislative Council S.V. Sankanur, was constituted to examine if there was a need for managements to submit safety and security certificates when they apply for renewal of recognition for their schools. It submitted its report to Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.C. Nagesh in Bengaluru on Wednesday. A committee member stated that while private schools have been asked to follow all the safety and security measures, the department had failed to ask government schools to comply with the rules. In the report, it said that the government should allocate funds in the upcoming budget to upgrade the safety measures in State-run schools. It suggested that a State-level overseeing committee be formed to look into any grievances pertaining to the safety of children. Members should include officials from multiple departments who will follow up on complaints of buildings that are not structurally safe, the lack of toilets and drinking water, and inadequate infrastructure. Such a committee should also redress complaints of violence and abuse of children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ensure-that-govt-schools-follow-safety-norms-panel/article36240413.ece

02 September 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Kuvempu varsity VC gheraoed||The students of Sahyadri College in Shivamogga, on Wednesday, gheraoed Kuvempu University Vice-Chancellor B.P. Veerabhadrappa and questioned him on the university’s decision to hand over a portion of the campus for setting up a special training centre under the Khelo India project, sponsored by the Central government. A group of alumni and current students of the college have formed a committee against the project. Its representatives stopped the Vice-Chancellor, who visited the college to take part in a seminar. The protesters questioned the VC why he had been silent on the issue, when students and many intellectuals of the city opposed the project. The students required basic amenities such as hostels, toilets, and an auditorium on the campus. However, the university had been under pressure from politicians to hand over a major portion of the land for the project, they said. When the VC said he would ensure the students’ requirements were fulfilled, the protesters said they would not accept handing over the campus for any project. “The college has been named Sahyadri to represent the Malnad region. Constructing buildings alone should not be the motto of the university. It should ensure the campus remains green”, the protesters said. The students gave up the protest when the VC assured them that he would discuss the issue in detail with the protesters later. The college was set up in 1940 on 100 acres of land, granted by Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar. Gradually, a few acres were acquired by several departments for offices. In April this year, Shivamogga district administration wrote to the University seeking a transfer of 18.04 acres to the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports for setting up the training centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kuvempu-varsity-vc-gheraoed/article36240920.ece
02 September 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||CM says focus on pro-people, people-friendly governance||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has said that the focus of the government is ensuring “pro-people, people-friendly governance” by providing more decentralised services. It is also for giving more services at the gram panchayat level itself. Speaking to press persons after inaugurating various development works and initiating several others in his constituency, Shiggaon in Haveri district, on Wednesday, he said: “The plan is to have more services available in the gram panchayats so that people are not forced to frequent taluk headquarters for getting their works done.” Mr. Bommai said that to ensure that people are not made to run from pillar to post for their works, more use of technology is essential and the government has taken it up on priority. Decentralisation of power could very well be implemented through the use of technology and this has been communicated to the officials during Karnataka Development Programme review meetings, he said. Industrial township Regarding the proposed industrial township in Haveri, the Chief Minister said that a meeting will be convened next week. “An industrial township will help in providing employment to students who will get technical training. There is need for industries that provide employment to youths and based on this concept, the industrial township will be developed,” he said. Vaccination He said that vaccine doses were available in adequate quantity in the State. However, there is vaccine hesitance in a few districts where extensive sensitisation programmes are being taken up. Mr. Bommai said that students from neighbouring States should mandatorily undergo seven-day quarantine. The government has made arrangements for students from Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and other States to undergo quarantine. To a query, he clarified that the district administrations are not supposed to make vaccination compulsory for getting foodgrains from PDS shops. He said that he will instruct Chamarajnagar district administration on this. To another query, Mr. Bommai said that confusions in the sand policy will be resolved to ensure that people got the sand required for construction activities without much hassle. Development works Mr. Bommai inaugurated and laid foundation stone for various development works worth Rs. 97 crore in his home constituency. Accompanied by his Cabinet colleagues Govind Karjol, C.C. Patil and B. Basavaraj, the Chief Minister inaugurated the Shiggaon Lift Irrigation Project through which 39 tanks have been filled. During the series of programmes he attended, he was stopped at several villages where people greeted him and also submitted appeals to him. At Bada village, he interacted with students of Atal Bihari Vajpayee Residential School where students rushed to shake hands with him. The Chief Minister addressed a gathering Muslims in Hindi after inaugurating a Shadi Mahal at Bankapur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-says-focus-on-pro-people-people-friendly-governance/article36240697.ece
02 September 2021||HUBBALLI/ BELAGAVI,KARNATAKA||Parties slug it out in local body polls with larger gain in mind||As the countdown for polling to three major municipal corporations in the State – Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi and Kalaburagi – has begun, stakes are high for the ruling BJP and the principal Opposition Congress. With the next Assembly elections less than two years away, the outcome of elections to these three important local bodies in North Karnataka is being seen as a pointer to the general mindset and political inclination of people. While the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation was under the BJP for the last two terms, the Congress continues to hold its sway over Kalaburagi municipal corporation. In both these places, Congress and BJP are leaving no stone unturned to assume power since they know that councillors in power will come handy during Assembly polls. Belagavi’s unique case Belagavi, however, is a different story as aspiring councillors are fighting the elections on party symbols for the first time since 1981. Ever since the urban local body was formed in 1981 under the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act of 1976, these candidates have fought elections independently. Its predecessor, the Belgaum Municipal Corporation Committee is the oldest urban local body in Mumbai Karnataka. The British established it as a borough next to a military camp, in 1851, five years before they set up a local body in Dharwad in 1856. The Belagavi municipal elections have traditionally been fought on the basis of linguistic affiliation. It was always Kannada vs. Marathi groups and now in the last decade, a small group of Urdu speakers have also emerged. However, this time, it is the parties that are fighting it out. Other contenders Three corporations, this time around, have seen the entry of Aam Admi Party (AAP), making an effort to woo the urban voters through its “Delhi Model”. Another new entry is AIMIM of Asaduddin Owaisi and the JD(S). Political observers believe that the fortunes of the main political parties the BJP and the Congress depend much on the performance of AAP, AIMIM, and JD(S) as the candidates of these political parties are likely to eat into the vote share of the main parties. Being the ruling party, the BJP is under pressure to retain Hubballi-Dharwad where it has completed two terms in office, while the Congress is fighting to get it back. In Kalaburagi, it is the other way round. Despite serious attempts, the BJP has fallen short of candidates in Kalaburagi (contesting in 47 out of 55), while the Congress is struggling to retain power. Interestingly, this time BJP has fielded eight Muslim candidates in Kalaburagi, which had 27 Muslim councillors last time. Meanwhile, Belagavi presents a different picture. Whatever is gained in Belagavi will be a gain for all political parties, except Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, which kept its flock together harping on “merger of Marathi speaking areas”.

02 September 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||More than 100 economics teachers worried over losing their jobs||Over 100 economics teachers in degree colleges under Mangalore University are apprehensive of losing their jobs if the National Education Policy 2020 is implemented in the academic year 2021-22. But Vice-Chancellor of the university P.S. Yadapadithaya told The Hindu on Wednesday that their fears are unfounded. In an August 30 letter to the Vice-Chancellor, the Mangalore University Economics Association said that there were 179 full-time teachers in 96 colleges under the university in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kodagu districts. Of these, 119 teachers will lose their jobs. The association’s assessment is based on the fact that teaching economics has been omitted from the draft (model) of the curriculum of the Commerce and Management (Basic/Honours) provided by Karnataka State Higher Education Council (KSHEC). It will result in the reduction of workload of teachers. Economics is base for commerce and its importance in the global level is on the rise in view of liberalisation and the subject cannot be undermined, the association said. The teachers appealed to the Vice-Chancellor to continue economics in the first four semesters of Commerce and Management. With this, all teachers can continue their service, they said. A delegation of economics teachers also met Mr. Yadapadithaya on Tuesday. Mr. Yadapadithaya said that the curriculum of Commerce and Management of Mangalore University is yet to be finalised. It (the curriculum) has not yet been placed before the Board of Studies of Commerce and Management of the university. It will be finalised by September 15. The university will ensure that the workload of economics teachers is not reduced and they need not be apprehensive of losing their jobs. “The status quo will be maintained,” he said. Stating that economics is the mother of commerce, Mr. Yadapadithaya, who is also the chairman of the State level subject expert committee on Commerce and Management for drafting the curriculum as per the NEP 2020, said that teachers will have to look beyond curriculum in the implementation process of the new policy. He said that there will be skill enhancement, value enhancement, group study, case study activities in the B.Com (Basics/Honours) programme. The workload of teachers will be shared in those activities too. Economics teacher Purushothava K.V., who is also the Principal of Pompei College, Aikala, said that economics should be taught to Commerce students not only from the point of helping teachers retain their jobs but also mainly in the interest of students who need to know the basics of economics to excel in their different professions later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/more-than-100-economics-teachers-worried-over-losing-their-jobs/article36240866.ece

02 September 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||These Ganesh idols can germinate into plants||Taking eco-friendly Ganesh idols a step forward, four students from Mangaluru have made plant-germinating Ganesh idols by filling plant seeds in the stomach. “As and when the idol is immersed in water or disposed of in the open, there are many chances of these seeds growing into plants and extending the green cover,” said H.R. Hani, a Class IX student of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mudipu, Mangaluru. “We have not used any special clay, but collected soil from neighbouring paddy fields to prepare these eco-friendly idols without adding any chemical substances,” Ms. Hani, a resident of Jeppinamogaru on the outskirts of the city, said. Hardika, a first B.Com student from Canara College, Ananya and Jitesh, both Class IX students from Gunashree Vidyalaya, Adyar, are her companions for the project. Asked whether the four have taken up mass production and sales, Ms. Hani replied in the negative and said that their aim is to create awareness among the general public. “We want to tell people that Ganesh could be revered this way too, while giving back to nature,” she said. The four keep three-four seeds of fruit, vegetable and native forest plants inside the idol before giving the finishing touch. Ms. Hani’s mother, Pavithra Rathan, a home-maker, and father Rathan Kumar, who works with an optical store chain, have kindled the green passion in Ms. Hani and have been supporting her for the last about eight years. Since then she has planted about 300 saplings. Ms. Hani has also formed a group of like-minded friends, Green Warriors, which has now grown to have over 100 members to execute various green initiatives. Group members visit households during festivals spreading the message of eco-friendly celebration, including Deepavali, when they tell people to use earthen lamps and not to burst crackers. The group also collects clothes and books from people and provide them to those in need, Ms. Hani said. Commenting on the initiative, artist-environmentalist and convener of Sahyadri Sanchaya Dinesh Holla said that it is heartening to see the young generation developing concern for environment. When each and every child desires to preserve and protect environment, there could be no threat to it, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/these-ganesh-idols-can-germinate-into-plants/article36240873.ece

02 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Police lax in probing Mysuru rape case, says Siddaramaiah||Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah has slammed the police for their ‘failure’ to obtain the victim’s statement in the Mysuru gangrape case and said it showed their laxity. Speaking to media persons in the city on Wednesday Mr. Siddaramaiah said the law provides for the police to record a statement and it was mandatory but they have not followed the procedure. Incidentally, DGP and IG Praveen Sood had stated recently that the victim was traumatised by the incident and they would wait for her to recover before recording her statement. Mr. Sood had also said that they are building up technical and scientific evidence to get a conviction even without the victim’s statement and had cited the example of a similar incident reported in Manipal in 2013. But Mr. Siddaramaiah said the victim’s statement can ensure stringent punishment and the police was duty bound to record the statement. “I am not stating that the victim should have been forced and compelled to make a statement under duress. She and the family should have been counselled that it would ensure the accused receive stringent punishment’’, said Mr. Siddarmaaiah. Prima facie it appears that the family was perhaps being compelled not to issue a statement by the government as it is a stigma to the administration and hence wants to bury it, Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged. “This is a serious incident and I will also raise it in the Assembly.” Questioning the police for not registering the FIR as soon as the boy accompanying the victim narrated their woes at the hospital, Mr. Siddaramaiah said there was a delay of 15 hours in filing an FIR which was registered past noon the next day. The rape was a heinous crime and this showed the failure of the government and the police in upholding law and order in the State which has ‘collapsed’. There has been a series of dacoities and murders in recent days in Mysuru and yet the government has not taken measures to secure the city. The police and the government are taking credit for arresting the rape case accused within 5 days but they should have been a step ahead in preventing such incidents from occurring, said Mr. Siddaramaiah who earlier visited the scene of crime.  The place is deserted and the jurisdictional police does not know whether the area is under the Forest Department, the Mysuru City Corporation or the Mysuru Urban Development Authority. Despite the relative isolation of the place, the police has not deployed mobile squad Garuda which, he said, underlines their lack of seriousness in maintaining law and order. Though a heinous case was reported in Mysuru, Home Minister Araga Jnanendra did not display any seriousness and spent time in Mysuru visiting Chamundi Hills, inaugurating a shooting simulator at the police academy and posed for photos and finally visited the scene of crime, said Mr. Siddaramaiah, adding that there was “administrative collapse” in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-lax-in-probing-mysuru-rape-case-says-siddaramaiah/article36240919.ece
02 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||JD(S) preparing for Mission 123: HDK||A day after BJP general secretary Arun Singh described the JD(S) as a “sinking ship”, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Wednesday said the party was preparing to win 123 seats in the Assembly elections of 2023. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru on Wednesday, Mr. Kumaraswamy said he was drawing up a list of candidates for the Assembly polls and had prepared the first list of 102 candidates, who will be invited to a two-day workshop at his Bidadi farmhouse on September 28. Another 10 candidates would be added to the list by September 28, he added. They will be coached on how to approach the people, identify their problems, and offer solutions. Candidates will visit every village in their constituency, he said. “I have named this project Mission 123,” he said. He claimed the results of his efforts to build the party will be seen in the outcome of local body polls in Kalaburagi. The people of Karnataka will decide which party is “sinking ship” or “B team”. “Did we go to the BJP’s doors with an offer to align with them? Who came to our leader S.R. Mahesh repeatedly seeking support in the Mysuru mayoral polls?” Mr. Kumaraswamy said, referring to the meetings of Minister for Co-operation S.T. Somashekar, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and other BJP leaders with Mr. Mahesh. “On the contrary, it is the BJP which is a sinking ship. Let them set their own house in order,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said. When asked if Karnataka was in a position to release water to Tamil Nadu as per directions issued by the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA), the JD(S) leader told reporters to pose the question to Mr. Singh, who had claimed that the BJP and Centre will protect the interests of Karnataka. “Karnataka’s MPs and Ministers have no spine to take up the State’s issues with the Centre,” he added. Mr. Kumaraswamy said the Centre is aware of the storage levels in various reservoirs in the Cauvery basin and expressed fears about water shortage in Karnataka if rains fail in September. “The CWMA should understand this. In a federal structure, all States should be viewed equally,” he said. The shortfall in the monthly release of water during the ensuing year has further enhanced the relevance and need for constructing a balancing reservoir at Mekedatu, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jds-preparing-for-mission-123-hdk/article36240419.ece
02 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||As Dasara nears, time to identify next howdah carrier||With Dasara season round the corner the elephants are bracing for their annual tryst with the city. Though the Dasara High Powered Committee will decide on the scale of the festival this year in its meeting on September 3, the Forest Department is geared with the tentative list of elephants set to grace the festivities. The celebrations were scaled down last year due to the pandemic and all cultural programmes were cancelled while the elephants had their customary presence. However, Deputy Conservator of Forests Karikalan said that in case the festival is scaled down, 7 elephants will suffice and if it is a full-fledged event then they will have 14 elephants from a list of 17 of which 12 will participate and two will be on standby. He said they have a tentative list of 17 elephants and the technical committee in its meeting on September 2 will finalise the list based on their health history of the recent past, as to whether they were vaccinated for foot and mouth disease etc. In case of female elephants the veterinarians have to submit a report on whether the elephants are still tending a calf or whether they are pregnant etc. However, the Forest Department is taking a long-term view of the situation and scouting for the next elephant to carry the golden howdah once Abhimanyu retires in a few years from now. Abhimanyu took the mantle from Arjuna who was rested after attaining 60 years of age last year. A veteran of Mysuru Dasara having graced the festivities with his presence for almost 20 years, Abhimanyu - who leads the combing operations in the forests and known to take on the rampaging wild tuskers head on to subdue them - will be hard to replace. Any exercise to replace Abhimanyu should start now and hence there is a renewed focus on the male elephants in the prime of their youth. Mr.Karikalan said that they have identified Ashwathama who was captured in an operation a few years from Sakleshpur in Hassan as one with lots of promise. Ashwathama is not only mighty and has a strong presence but matches Arjuna in height though he may have to gain some weight. However, the elephant tends to panic and hence his mahout is not confident. So there are plans to deploy Ashwathama for jungle patrol duties along with Abhimanyu so that he sheds his nervousness and his fit to carry the golden howdah in future, according to Mr. Karikalan. There are others in the wings who match the majesty of Arjuna and Abhimanyu. But they need to be familiarised with the city and Dasara ambience apart from deployment on Dasara duty for a few years. They includes Dhananjaya, Gopi, Gopalswamy and Rajendra, said the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/as-dasara-nears-time-to-identify-next-howdah-carrier/article36240915.ece

When reporters sought his reaction to Cauvery Water Management Authority’s (CWMA) direction to Karnataka to release water to Tamil Nadu and the pending approval for Mekedatu project, Mr. Singh said the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal’s order on sharing of water between the riparian States will be honoured. But, the BJP and the State government are committed to protecting the interests of Karnataka and its farmers, he said. Pointing out that the welfare of the farmers is the top priority for the BJP, he said the State government is committed to doubling farmers’ income.

02 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Ambari set for restart from Sept. 4||The Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) is planning to resume its Ambari open-roof bus tours in Mysuru from September 4, after the initiative was interrupted by the pandemic and dearth of takers. After postponements, the initiative was finally launched in March this year. However, the buses were taken off the road when the pandemic situation worsened and a lockdown was announced. The service was resumed in August but had to be withdrawn soon due to lack of tourists. With the COVID-19 cases under control and reopening of tourist sites in and around Mysuru and also in neighbouring districts, the KSTDC is restoring the services from September 4. The tour was available between 9.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. The KSTDC is hoping to attract visitors this time as a lot of efforts have been put in for the initiative. The double-decker buses were the newest attraction for tourists as the bus tour assisted them to experience the city which is known for its splendid palaces and buildings with architectural marvels. Mysuru has four buses while two buses have been allotted to Hampi. The KSTDC launched Ambari inspired by London’s Big Bus Tours. The buses were flagged off in March. Tourists can buy tickets at the KSTDC office on JLB Road and the ticket has been priced at Rs. 250 per person. Ambari is a hop-on, hop-off initiative for tourists to experience the palaces and heritage buildings of Mysuru. Tourists get an audio guide the moment the bus reaches the tourist sites identified on the route. The audio will be available in two languages — Kannada and English. The bus route covers Hotel Mayura KSTDC office, Deputy Commissioner’s office, Crawford Hall, Kukkarahalli Lake, University of Mysore, Folklore Museum, Ramaswamy Circle, Palace Karikallu Thotti, Jayamarthanda Gate of the palace, zoo, Karanji Lake, Jockey Quarters’ Circle, Snow City, Chamundi Vihar Stadium, St. Philomena’s Church, Bannimantap, and City Railway Station. Built in Bengaluru, the bus has lower and upper decks with 40 seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ambari-set-for-restart-from-sept-4/article36240913.ece
02 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Siddaramaiah govt. leaked caste census report instead of accepting it: HDK||Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy accused the erstwhile Siddaramaiah-led government of “leaking” the caste census report during its tenure instead of accepting it, to settle political scores. If the Congress leader had respect for different castes, the census report would have been accepted during his tenure, Mr. Kumaraswamy told reporters in Mysuru on Wednesday. Mr. Siddaramaiah, reacting to this allegation in Mysuru, dismissed it as “childish and irresponsible”. He had accused Mr. Kumaraswamy of blocking submission of the caste census report during the tenure of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government. Mr. Siddaramaiah claimed that the caste census, which he had ordered as Chief Minister, was not ready by the time his tenure ended. It was ready when Mr. Kumaraswamy succeeded him as Chief Minister, but the JD(S) leader allegedly warned the then Backward Classes Minister against accepting the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-govt-leaked-caste-census-report-instead-of-accepting-it-hdk/article36240417.ece

The workers said they felt harassed by the local staff and wanted an end to it. The strike was however called off by late in the evening following intervention by the senior field staff of the tiger reserve. The strike was led by the department’s daily wage workers association whose members were assured that their grievances would be resolved. A majority of them were from the anti-poaching camps and they returned to duty soon after the assurance. State Wildlife Board member Joseph Hoover said nearly 200 workers had assembled at Melkamanahalli gate.

02 September 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Vehicle taking children to plantations seized||A vehicle carrying children to cardamom plantations was seized at Kumily on Wednesday amidst reports that child labour was widely used in the plantations during the lockdown period. The checking was led by the district child protection unit with the support of the police, Labour Department, and the Motor Vehicles Department. Three girls District child protection officer Geetha M.G. said there were three girls below the age of 17 with their parents in the vehicle used for carrying workers to the plantations. There were allegations that with the closure of schools following the lockdown in Tamil Nadu, children were deployed for work in the plantations. Ms. Geetha said the girls were shifted to a child care centre under the child protection council at Kumily. She said the parents told the council that they took the children with them as it was unsafe to leave them at home. An inquiry would be conducted and the facilities at their houses would be inspected. The vehicle was carrying workers to a plantation at Seventh Mile. After media reports of children being engaged for work in the cardamom plantations, where hundreds of workers arrive daily from Tamil Nadu, an inspection was held at the Kumily and Cumbom Mettu checkposts on Wednesday. The Motor Vehicles Department also registered cases against 52 vehicles carrying workers from across the border without proper documents. Cases against two The Nedumkandam police registered cases against two persons for engaging children in hazardous works. Cases were registered against Anakallu resident Shaju and Pachakanam estate manager Kochumon. The police said the children aged 16 years were engaged in hazardous works such as spraying pesticides on cardamom plants. They were residents of Jharkhand. The inspections by the district administration to check if children are employed in cardamom plantations will continue in the coming days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vehicle-taking-children-to-plantations-seized/article36240828.ece
02 September 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Closure of hill produce shops hits farmers, traders hard||The abrupt closure of shops by hill produce merchants following the COVID-19 restrictions has put hundreds of farmers in the district, a major coffee and spices growing region in the State, in a fix. Usually, the farmers pay the wages of the workers on weekends after selling the hill produce such as pepper, ginger, and coffee. But many a time, the farmers could not sell the produce owing to the closure of markets where triple lockdown has been imposed. Triple lockdown has been in force in 14 grama panchayats and many divisions of the three municipalities in the district to contain the spread of the pandemic. “We have closed our shops for the past one week owing to the restrictions,” said Abdurrahman, a hill produce dealer here. Such a closure was adversely affecting both the trading and farming communities, he said. If the authorities exempted the hill produce shops as in the case of vegetable shops, it would be a great help to the farming and trading communities, he said. The prices of the perishable goods such as ginger and ‘nendran’ variety of plantain have declined sharply owing to the uncertainties in the market. Hit by the crisis, some of the traders have started to procure produce like plantain from farms directly, but payment is made only after two or three weeks. The crisis has hit the ginger farmers the worst as the produce has had no demand in the market for the past few weeks owing to the pandemic restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/closure-of-hill-produce-shops-hits-farmers-traders-hard/article36240757.ece
02 September 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Farm residents pine for a roof over their heads||The fear of being trampled upon by elephants lurks in the minds of Shantha Karikan, 60, and her family members from the Paniya community living in a shed in the Aralam farm. Just a few metres away is her unfinished house, the construction of which began a few years ago with Rs. 60,000 provided under the Tribal Rehabilitation Development Mission. But the work was suspended midway, as the authorities did not release the remaining funds. Despite knocking on all doors, her pleas fell on deaf ears. She is not the only tribesperson awaiting funds to get a house constructed in Block 9 of the Aralam farm. Several others who reportedly refused to hand over construction work to contractors are facing a similar ordeal, and they continue to stay either in sheds or dilapidated houses constructed by Nirmithi Kendra. Shantha is one among the few Paniya community members who moved from Pookund colony, near the Aralam sanctuary, to settle in Aralam farm during the tribal agitation in 2004-05. “We had received patta after a prolonged struggle. But there are no basic amenities, and the absence of proper houses and constant threats from marauding elephants have made life difficult,” she lamented. “Every time we meet promoters, Tribal Resettlement and Development Mission [TRDM] site manager, and Tribal Department officials seeking release of funds, we feel neglected. They say the money is yet to be sanctioned,” she rued. P.P. Krishnan, another tribesperson, has received no money from the department, and he has a debt of Rs. 4 lakh after he started constructing a house. He too refused to let contractors do the work. As a result, he was yet to be granted the amount, even the promised Rs. 6 lakh despite being included in the LIFE project, he said. Many tribal families are refusing to hand over work to contractors, as their work has been found substandard. “Contractors use poor quality material to construct even a small hous, while we can construct bigger houses using better quality material at the same cost,” he explained. Interestingly, those who agreed to engage contractors were given the entire amount, he claimed. “Officials seem to be hand in glove with contractors and are swindling money earmarked for the welfare of tribespeople,” he alleged. Similarly, Nirmala Narayanan is yet to receive the Rs. 3.5 lakh sanctioned by the government. The authorities have paid only Rs. 2.10 lakh, and they have declined to pay the rest citing various reasons. “I have taken a bank loan and some money from Kudumbashree. I have to pay back Rs. 10,000 every month. If the authorities issued the amount, I could finish the work,” she said. Ms. Narayanan and her family have been staying in a shed for long. The house of Rajamma, which was constructed recently by a contractor, is already seeping, and she is yet to occupy the house. Many others too raised similar complaints. Meanwhile, Scheduled Tribes Development Department project officer S. Santhosh Kumar reiterated that all applications were being cleared. He informed that the government had already sanctioned Rs. 75 lakh for the housing project. However, tribal associations demanded an inquiry into the matter. Sreeraman Koyyon, president, Adivasi Dalit Munnet Samiti, alleged that there was large-scale corruption, and that the money allotted for tribal welfare was being diverted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/farm-residents-pine-for-a-roof-over-their-heads/article36240770.ece

Govindan, Minister for Local Self-Government and Excise, has said that the assistance given to differently abled persons was not anyone’s generosity but their right. He was speaking after inaugurating the handing over of electronic wheelchairs to differently abled persons in Kannur district under the Shubhayathra scheme here the other day. Maintaining that Kerala was a friendly State to differently abled persons, the Minister said such people must be able to overcome challenges and move on to a better standard of living. “It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that their rights are met after taking their needs into consideration,” he said. The government was implementing schemes with special consideration for job training and rehabilitation for those with special needs, Mr. Govindan said. The Minister said that the government would take precautionary measures to ensure job security and improve the living standards of persons with disabilities. Shubhayatra aims at providing free assistance devices and mitigation of disability. Beneficiaries are selected after certification by a medical board as having 40% or more disability. Wheelchairs, which can be re-charged and used for up to six hours and valued at over Rs. 2.5 lakh each, were given free of cost. It can travel up to 15 km on a single full charge. Financial assistance was disbursed as part of Hasthadanam scheme at a function held at the Kannur Government Engineering College auditorium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/aid-for-differently-abled-not-charity/article36240766.ece

The husband, Vijesh, in the complaint given to the district police, said that his wife’s family had made false allegations against him and his family members. He said that after the marriage, Sunisha had asked for her various certificates but her family had refused to hand them over. Sunisha was upset that her family did not cooperate in any way. He alleged that he and Sunisha were chased away when they reached the house after learning of her uncle’s death. Meanwhile, the Payyannur police on Wednesday took statements from Sunisha’s friends and relatives in connection with the death. Sunisha’s phone has been submitted to the court. The police said it would be handed over for scientific tests as soon as the court gave its approval.

The civic authorities estimate that over 80% of the city residents, including the floating population, have been administered the first dose of the vaccine. There could be isolated cases of city residents who have skipped the vaccination drive. The civic administration has decided to look out for such persons and bring them on board, said M. Anilkumar, Mayor. The search for those who have skipped the first dose of vaccines will be extended to the grass-roots levels. Councillors have been asked to identify those who have not been given the jab. In two weeks, the city hopes to fully vaccinate its population, the Mayor said.  Though the vaccines are provided by the government, the civic body is incurring significant expense for providing the infrastructure facilities for the campaign. The civic body needs to provide food for health workers and volunteers, arrange vehicles and provide data entry operators, said T.K. Ashraf, chairman, Health Standing Committee of the Kochi Corporation. A trend is visible among the city residents, who had their first shot of vaccine from private hospitals, to get their second dose from the civic body. The focus of the civic body is to attain 100 per cent first dose coverage. Currently, there are no plans to begin drive-in vaccination, said Mr. Anilkumar. The civic body is also making efforts to reach out to the bed-ridden persons in the city through health workers. Health workers will go to those persons and vaccinate them, said Mr. Ashraf.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-targets-100-vaccination/article36240781.ece
02 September 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Majority of active COVID cases in Ernakulam under home isolation||Around 85% of the COVID-19 patients in Ernakulam district are under home isolation, according to official estimates. Of the 24,607 active cases as on August 31, the number of people in home isolation is 21,070. The number of persons in hospitals is 1,832 while the corresponding number in domiciliary COVID care centres is 939. Nearly 390 persons are in first-line treatment centres while the number of infected in second-line treatment centres is 376. An assessment by the Centre in August on the rising cases in the State had attributed the surge to inadequate monitoring of patients in home isolation. However, health officials pointed out that there is little incentive in shifting everybody to institutional facilities as it would only help in exerting undue pressure on the system. “An infected person would transmit the virus to his contacts within 48 hours after they start showing the symptoms. We had initially opted for institutional quarantine, but later realised that it was not required in all the cases,” said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, District Programme Manager, National Health Mission. “Institutional quarantine had caused difficulties for the elderly and their family members. But people having symptoms like fever, cough, throat pain or cold should self isolate in their homes without delay. Those having co-morbidities like high diabetes, kidney or heart disease should immediately consult a doctor through the existing telemedicine facility. Patients who lack space in their homes for self isolation should shift to domiciliary care centres,” he said. Rajeev Jayadevan, scientific advisor and former president of the Indian Medical Association, Kochi, said that the description ‘home isolation’ should be replaced by ‘room isolation’. “People may think that they could watch television and enjoy the comforts of a home while hearing the word home isolation. Instead, it should be room isolation,” he said. Dr. Jayadevan said that institutional quarantine is necessary for people who lacked the facility to remain in room isolation in their homes. “Going by the national average, Kerala has considerable number of homes that have adequate rooms in their homes for self isolation. But we also have many homes that do not have the space to ensure room isolation. In those cases, we should definitely go for institutional quarantine,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/majority-of-active-covid-cases-in-ernakulam-under-home-isolation/article36240792.ece
02 September 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Space crunch gives impetus to multilevel parking options||The influx of people into cities and towns in private vehicles following the pandemic situation and the resultant parking space crunch have impelled urban planners and architects to give thought to multilevel parking options. The commissioning earlier this year of puzzle-type multilevel parking space for 102 cars in approximately 11 cents near the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation office and plans being readied for such amenities in more areas in the capital and in Kochi (under the aegis of Cochin Smart Mission Ltd.) has further given impetus to such initiatives. The benefits are many, provided such parking amenities are maintained well, say stakeholders. “There are basically two types of mechanised multi-level parking lots — puzzle and stack types. Puzzle type is more popular, although it needs an investment of around Rs. 4 lakh per car. Stack parking space can be readied at Rs. 2 lakh per car, although there are limitations,” said Oommen Mani, a Kochi-based architect. Space saver Mechanised multi-level parking is better than conventional ramp-type parking, which needs more space (mainly for the ramp) and comes at a premium in cities. On the contrary, such common space for mechanised vertical parking modes is limited to the entry slot from where cars are automatically taken to their dedicated parking area in different floors, Mr. Mani said. Even in multilevel puzzle parking, there are multiple options, said Abison K. Paulose, vertical solutions consultant, who helped ready the multilevel car parking system near the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation office. “The automated system works with the help of three sensors, which help gauge the height and other dimensions of each car or SUV, based on which they are assigned to specific slots. The sole condition is that one slot on each level, barring the top level, are kept vacant for the independent puzzle operation to happen,” he explained. Kozhikode-based architect P.P. Vivek said he preferred to keep parking space limited in cities, to limit the number of cars entering cities. For this, the public transport system must be improved, while cycle tracks and pedestrian-friendly footpaths must be readied, as in European and even most Latin American countries, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/space-crunch-gives-impetus-to-multilevel-parking-options/article36241041.ece
02 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Behera sets target of 2 lakh daily ridership for metro||Priority will be given to optimising ridership on metro trains, Loknath Behera, managing director of Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL), has said. Mr. Behera was addressing a press conference here on Wednesday after assuming charge two days earlier in Thiruvananthapuram. The peak daily ridership before COVID-19 hovered around 60,000-70,000 while it had now plummeted to 12,000-20,000 with only 12 of the 25 trains operating services. Critical of what he described as “very low” daily ridership for a mass transport service, Mr. Behera has set a target of 2 lakh riders a day by November 1, the Kerala Foundation Day. “Though it is a high benchmark, it could still be given a try through collective effort. Increasing revenue through increased footfall is necessary for development by minimising loans. Optimum utilisation of the existing structure should be prioritised and that calls for systemic changes and a marketing strategy, including concessions to students and senior citizens,” he said. Flexible fares A committee would be set up to interact with business establishments, schools, and corporates along the metro route to improve their use of metro trains. Mr. Behera expressed the idea of flexible fares and revisiting the high parking fee at metro stations. He is about to set up a social media cell for the KMRL as he did while heading the Kerala Police. A Facebook page will be set up with the help of professionals, including from the Kerala Police, which boasts highly popular social media handles. “Rentals for space along metro stations will have to be revisited to make them attractive as most of it now remains vacant, wasting significant potential for non-ticket revenue. An automated client management system coupled with personal interaction between KMRL officials and the clients will be put in place,” Mr. Behera said. A single window system for simplifying the hiring of land belonging to the KMRL is also on the anvil. Everything will be cleared in a fortnight and the lessee will have to occupy the space within a month. Kakkanad extension Mr. Behera exuded confidence about securing the approval of the Central government for the Kakkanad extension. He said he would visit New Delhi next week to follow it up. “Since the project has received budgetary allocation, the Central government approval can be attained through sustained follow-up. In the meantime, preparatory works using the State government funds will be intensified,” he said. Expediting the Water Metro project, which he said would transform the transport concept, remained another priority. The Vyttila and Kakkanad terminals were almost ready while dredging for floating jetties would also be expedited. Ensuring high-speed Internet aboard metro trains and expanding metro to the Kochi airport also figured in his dream mission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/behera-sets-target-of-2-lakh-daily-ridership-for-metro-by-nov-1/article36240774.ece

In the presence of external magnetic field, they get heated up and increase their temperature to 40 degree within 10 minutes in the presence of alternating magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as magnetic hyperthermia,” said Sailaja G.S., principal investigator of the project funded by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology. The magnetic measurements were carried out in the lab of Manoj Raama Varma, Chief Scientist, CSIR’s National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, who is the co-investigator of the project. Anjana K., Ph.D student and project fellow, had executed the experiments, according to an official communication. Dr. Sailaja said that the synthesis was designed in such a way that the flake like clays were separated from each other. “This will help in loading clinically used chemotherapeutic drugs in between the layers.

Opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) councillors sat in protest before the office as the chairperson entered the chamber around 2 p.m. The Thrikkakara police intervened to forcefully remove the LDF councillors after about two hours. The chairperson examined some of the files before leaving the office around 5 p.m. The chairperson could not be contacted for her comments. But a spokesman of the Congress party said that the allegations against the chairperson were politically motivated. The Opposition LDF was trying to bring down the UDF council at any cost and the Opposition had been engaged in such efforts since the early days of the council assuming power. The Opposition had alleged on Tuesday that the chairperson would try to tamper with evidence on allegations against her. The Opposition had also prepared itself to prevent the chairperson from entering the chamber on Tuesday. However, the chairperson did not come to the office even as a large posse of police personnel were posted to prevent any law-and-order problem. The VACB has already submitted a preliminary report on the allegations to the Vigilance directorate in the State capital. It had taken into consideration CCTV scenes from the chairpersons’ chamber, which have been claimed to be evidence showing the alleged distribution of envelopes containing money to the councillors. Denied The chairperson had earlier denied all allegations. The district Congress party leadership had given her a clean chit on the issue, calling the allegations baseless and politically motivated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dramatic-scenes-at-municipality/article36240783.ece

This follows groups of people engaged in adventure and water sports activities resuming their practice sessions in different parts of the district, albeit in adherence with pandemic protocol. The DTPC had entrusted Neptune Water Sports with the responsibility of conducting water sports like rides in banana boats, catamaran and speed boats, apart from wind surfing and kayaking, in the expansive breakwater beach at Munambam. Watersports got a fillip in 2019 after Kerala Tourism began promoting them as part of activity-based tourism, to woo tourists to the State following the 2018 deluge. Soon after, kayaks were shipped in from New Zealand and deployed in the Goshree backwaters. Watersports at the Cherai beachfront were suspended following large-scale sea erosion. In the meantime, disabled-friendly toilets and a watchtower for lifeguards have been readied at Cherai, while the parking area will be extended, for which 50 cents of revenue land on the Cherai-Kuzhipilly stretch has been sought, sources said. Solar boat Aimed at furthering the cause of sustainable tourism, the DTPC has readied a proposal to introduce a solar-powered boat capable of carrying 20 tourists in Bhoothathankettu, located off Kochi. The hybrid vessel can be recharged from the grid if it runs out of solar power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/watersports-to-resume-by-september-15/article36240773.ece

Sreejesh by naming a road after him remains somewhat tainted after waste, including biomedical waste, was found dumped along the road. The road near his home at Erumely ward in Kunnathunadu panchayat was named after him in honour of his sporting and Olympic exploits. Mr. Sreejesh took the matter to social media through a tweet and also tagged the Chief Minister. The rather acerbic tweet sarcastically compared the 100% literacy of the State and zero common sense. “This is the way people of my village decorated the road named after me. Kunnathunadu/Kizhakkambalam village officers have to look at this issue & take a decision,” he tweeted. Mr. Sreejesh said that though both the village officers visited and took stock of the situation on Tuesday, the waste was yet to be removed. “They had gone back promising to report the matter to panchayat officials,” he said. “We will take immediate steps to remove the waste and erect a board warning against dumping waste, and a surveillance camera. We will also lodge a complaint with the Kunnathunadu police,” said Kunnathunadu panchayat president Smithamol M.V. Preetha Raju, ward member, said that some medical prescriptions found along the dumped waste has helped identify people likely to be involved. “Even in the past, we were able to trace illegal dumpers in a similar way. We are awaiting a report of the health wing on receiving which a police complaint will be lodged,” she said. P.V. Sreenijin, Kunnathunadu MLA, attributed the incident to anti-social elements and said that necessary action will be taken. The road along the Kizhakkambalam-Erumeli bypass passing through both Kunnathunadu and Kizhakkambalam panchayats has been a hotspot for illegal waste dumping for long. There have been instances in the past when such illegal dumping of waste of hazardous nature wrecked the paddy fields along the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/olympian-fumes-over-waste-dumping-on-road/article36240790.ece

Around 50 per cent of India’s daily cases were coming from Kerala. This was a case of the State’s failure at its worst. The State government owed an explanation on the situation, he said. On the national monetisation pipeline programme of the Centre, Mr. Deora said it was the demonetisation of the poor and the monetisation of the rich.

The corresponding figure of children was 18.19%. Among those who tested positive last week included nearly 1.21% of persons who had not taken the first dose. Health officials found that there was an increasing tendency among the vaccinated to lose vigil against getting infected under the confidence that they were vaccinated. An analysis of the weekly infections and the percentage of infections among the vaccinated showed the need to ensure safety protocols.  Admissions in hospitals and intensive care units also recorded an increase in the fourth week of August.

The Union government had declared its intention to privatise the refinery in November 2019. There have been no permanent appointments in the refinery since the announcement was made and a total of 158 employees had retired and some had resigned from their jobs since then. However, none of these vacancies had been filled, the employees’ unions alleged. The company management had handed over the operation of the effluent treatment plant to a contractor and 26 jobs had been reduced on this account. Twenty-one employees had been reduced in the maintenance department. These unilateral actions were a violation of the mutual agreement between the management and the workers’ unions, said a statement from the trade union combine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/refinery-workers-stage-protest/article36240785.ece

According to many, cage farming carried out with quality fish seed is a risk-free method compared to others and it offers them a handsome harvest most times. While the method is popular in rural Kollam and islands such as Munroe Thuruthu, more and more farmers are opting for it of late. “Since there is a drop in marine catch, there are many takers for our fish. Most farmers who started cage culture are reporting good results and it is inspiring a lot of newcomers,” says Unnikrishnan, a farmer from Kallada. The Fisheries Department is also promoting cage farming and four units were started in the district with 90% subsidy as part of the government’s 100-day action plan. Subsidy given In connection with the Fisheries Department’s Blue Revolution programme, 10-member fisher groups were provided subsidy to install units that cost Rs. 60 lakh each. Farmers are using 20 floating cages, each four-metre in length, width, and height. A total of 24,000 fish seeds, including pearl spot, pompano and sea bass, were ranched and each unit is expected to produce 19 tonnes of fish within one year. Snehatheeram, a unit from Neendakara, received a reasonably good yield which was sold for export. MLA Sujith Vijayan Pillai, who made the first sale, said such projects would solve the crisis faced by fishers due to squally weather. District panchayat president Sam K Daniel, Matsyafed chairman T.Manoharan and Neendakara grama panchayat president P.R.

And today, the village in Kottarakara flaunts one more unique feature, a public open space that celebrates its agrarian heritage. Sora Varambu, a miniature park established by the Kairali Kalasamskarika Samiti by the roadside, has been drawing a steady crowd of late. Though the space was opened in early 2020, a couple of months back the samiti started cultivating paddy on one side to convert it into a real ‘varambu'. “Perumkulam is an agricultural village and it’s also an attempt to preserve that legacy. We have replaced tapioca with paddy after leasing the land on three sides. The members had raised around Rs. 3.5 lakh for the project and we will be harvesting the crop very soon,” says Perumkulam Rajeev, president of the samiti. The collective is planning to expand paddy cultivation to more stretches of land so that Sora Varambu will be flanked by rolling greenery on both sides. Though the park was started as an initiative to curb waste dumping by the roadside, over time, it developed into a cultural space. “At first, our plan was to clear the area and set up a couple of benches. Later, we added a desi tea stall made of bamboo and beautified the area. When the Bapuji library installed a pusthaka koodu with dailies and books, a lot of residents started thronging the area. At present, we also see a steady flow of visitors from other places,” he says. Vayal vanibham Even before Sora Varambu, the samiti used to conduct week-long ‘vayal vanibham’ programmes to sell all sorts of agricultural produce. “All agriculture-related products were part of our trade fairs. But we had to stop them due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Mr. Rajeev. Inspired by Sora Varambu, some other panchayats in Kollam and Pathanamthitta are currently planning to start similar initiatives. “We are happy that this concept showcasing a piece of Kerala countryside is spreading to more places,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/perumkulam-flaunts-its-agrarian-heritage/article36240805.ece

At many locations, road surfaces were just filled without meeting quality standards. “The best example is some of the filled spots along the Puthiyangadi-Kunduparamba road. There are now many bumpy patches along the road which Public Works Department officials are yet to inspect or adopt proper follow-up measures,” says V.A. Purushothaman, a local resident. He points out that it poses a safety threat to vehicles with low ground clearance and motorbikes. Motorists also point out that such newly filled spots slowly turn into potholes unable to withstand heavy vehicular traffic. Small bump-like structures are also causing huge jerks and even lead to accidents, they add. One of the main allegations is that Public Works Department Officials are not inspecting such works often carried out by local contractors. In the case of roads owned by local self-government bodies, the negligence to complete such re-tarring works is very evident. The shortage of site engineers is also preventing many local bodies to monitor such works. “There are also private firms and individuals who cut the road after obtaining permission from the authorities concerned for private pipe-laying or cable works. One can simply notice the difference in space before and after such works,” says a retired Civil Engineer from Pavangad. According to him, there should be a separate engineering team to inspect such works that affect road safety and take action against responsible persons. Meanwhile, some of the private contractors say that the payment for such smaller re-tarring works is very low and many are forced to finish the work with available budget. They also add that the time given to complete such tasks is limited considering the flow of vehicles and the disruption in water supply or power connectivity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poorly-re-tarred-city-roads-give-a-bumpy-ride/article36240772.ece

The app was launched in January. It also provided information about various government welfare schemes to the beneficiaries. People could schedule meetings with officials and people’s representatives and engage in video calls with them. It had won the first prize in “Digital Governance Mobile Challenge”, a national competition for novel district-level projects being implemented in association with the National Informatics Centre. The app was one of the major initiatives of the former District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao. It was hailed as an attempt to help the people avoid frequenting government offices to get their work done, especially during the pandemic period. Though the app is still available in Google Play Store, the last update seems to have been done on June 27. Incidentally, Mr. Rao was transferred in the first week of July and was replaced by N.

Shaji Madichery from Ottathengu near Kakkodi said information on his grama panchayat was found not updated on the app. He said the app still had the name of the previous grama panchayat president. He claimed that even earlier, it used to take a couple of months for the officials to respond to complaints. “I had complained about the streetlights not functioning at the Mananchira Square in January. I got a reply after four months, saying that the Kozhikode District Panchayat had passed a resolution against wild animal attack on farmlands,” he said.

A selection committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Education had conducted an online interview for eligible persons of the names shortlisted in September last. The committee also recommended the names for the appointment. However, the Ministry has not taken a call to recommend a name for the post and later ratified by the President. Currently, the Deputy Director P. S. Sathidevi has been given charge. The NIT-C, formerly the Regional Engineering College, today admits the largest number of students among the NITs in a year.

But even after two months of his taking over, things remained the same. It appears that the NIT-C is facing a similar situation that happened six years ago before Dr. Chakravorti was appointed as the permanent director. The post of director was lying vacant for more than a year then. Likewise, the post of director at the NIT- Delhi for which a notification has been called along with NITC, is also lying vacant. Incidently, the NIT-C is going ahead with the diamond jubilee celebrations in a hybrid mode, owing to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

According to sources, the crisis began on Tuesday night. Though the authorities attempted to arrange alternative measures, the efforts were not fully successful. It was decided to use the remaining stock only for the COVID-19 intensive care unit. Only emergency surgeries were allowed to be performed. According to a doctor there, some of the patients were nevertheless shifted to operation theatres on Wednesday morning hoping that somehow a solution could be found.

As of now, cases have been registered at Kuttiyadi, Nadapuram, and Payyoli police stations against the suspected persons apart from V.P. Sameer, one of the managing partners, being arrested. Some of the investors staged a protest at Kuttiyadi with the support of a local political party on Wednesday, alleging that the suspects were trying to escape from the district taking advantage of the slow police proceedings. They also called for the appointment of a special investigation team as there were many smaller income groups of families who fell as victims in the fraud. At Kuttiyadi station alone, 202 persons, who allegedly lost their money and gold, came up with written petitions against the jewellery shop owners. Nadapuram and Payyoli stations also received over 100 complaints. As part of the continuing legal action, three showrooms were sealed by the police apart from seizing a number of documents related to the investment schemes. According to the police, there were different types of schemes, including gold investments and cash deposits offering attractive monthly returns. There were also investors, who deposited more than 1 kg of gold, expecting monthly cash returns. The majority of smaller income groups had joined cash deposit schemes for purchasing gold, they said. ‘Ornaments safe’ Police sources said the managing partner, who was remanded in judicial custody, would be taken into police custody again for further investigation into the case. They also said the gold ornaments deposited by some of the investors were found safe in the jewellery’s locker, which could be released in a later phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/customers-allege-fraud-in-investment-scheme/article36240767.ece

According to Arun Karippal, university Senate member and political science faculty at Sree Kerala Varma College, Thrissur, the students at the university departments have portions on Nehruvian thought. However, students in affiliated colleges don’t have to learn about the late Prime Minister at all. Mr. Karippal said that the chapter on major social and political thinkers of modern India don’t have any reference to Nehru, widely considered as one of the architects of our nation. Though the issue was brought to the attention of the authorities earlier, it was left to the discretion of the Board of Studies, Mr. Karippal said. The board decided to consider it during the revision of the syllabus. Later, its chairman was replaced and a final decision got prolonged. A. Muhammed Maheen, chairman, Board of Studies, told The Hindu on Wednesday that the concerns raised by Mr. Karippal were genuine. He said that in a chapter on “Issues in Indian Politics”, references to Nehru’s contribution to secularism were already there. “A detailed paper on Pandit Nehru’s contributions to subjects such as secularism and diplomacy will be included during the next revision of syllabus in March 2022,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nehrus-thoughts-missing-in-ma-syllabus/article36240763.ece
02 September 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Greens to protest against land handover||The All Kerala River Protection Committee is planning public protests at Thusharagiri if the State government does not take steps to protect the disputed land there. Committee general secretary T.V. Rajan said the first such protest involving environmental activists from all over the State would be held in the second week of September. Activist Medha Padkar was expected to take part in it, he added. “We have documented proof that the State conceded defeat in several aspects of the case in the Supreme Court and that some of the arguments of the State were wrong, which resulted in the case going in favour of the earlier landowners,” said Mr. Rajan, adding that the committee was planning to approach the court on its own, since the government was not keen on doing it. The committee had earlier expressed fear that if the 24 acres of land was handed over to the earlier owners based on the Supreme Court order, it would affect the existence of the Chalipuzha river that originates from the waterfalls at Thusharagiri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/greens-to-protest-against-land-handover/article36240753.ece

Inaugurating the protest, Hindu Aikya Vedi State working president Valsan Thillankeri said that honouring Variyamkunnath would be a challenge not only to Hindus but also to humanity. He said some people pretending to be secular were trying to whitewash the Mapila Rebellion in its centenary year. He said the rebellion was a one-sided attack against the Hindus. According to Mr. Thillankeri, most people in Malappuram had converted to Islam out of fear. Aikya Vedi district vice president Varier S.

The country’s democratic values and institutions are being attacked collectively, and the state of affairs is worse than the Emergency, he said here on Wednesday. Mr. Rajesh said majority communalism was more dangerous than minority communalism as the former could capture power in the country. “A communalist cannot be a true believer or a follower of a faith. Jinnah and Savarkar were not believers but were communalists. Gandhi was a strong believer, but he was not a communalist,” he said. Mr. Rajesh said he had ignored the cyberattacks that were mounted on him in the wake of his comments about the 1921 Malabar Rebellion and its leaders such as Variyamkunnath Kunhahamed Haji and Ali Musliar. However, he said legal action would be initiated against those who attacked his wife and children. Mr. Rajesh said the renovation being made at the Jalianwala Bagh massacre site in Amritsar was corporatisation of history as commented by historians such as Irfan Habib.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nation-going-through-perilous-phase-speaker/article36240798.ece
02 September 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Away from herd, but the darling of all around||Flexing his little trunk, the little Thevar toddles around his shelter, often testing out his baby voice. It seems he has plenty to say while the people around him are all ears. The one-year-old elephant calf, rescued from a stream near the Kochandi checkpost in the Goodrickal forest range, has been sheltered at the Kochukoikkal station since Thiruvonam day. With their attempts a couple of times to reunite the male baby with its herd failing, the officials have now decided to take care of the animal for the time being. “He appears to be cheerful and active and is getting used to the new company. The animal will be under our observation for a few days more and any further decision on its rehabilitation will be based on a direction from the Chief Wildlife Warden,” says Jayakumar Sarma, Divisional Forest Officer, Ranni. Minor injuries According to him, it is quite common for elephants to abandon calves which are weak and fail to keep pace. “Barring a few minor injuries, the calf looks healthy, and we are yet to ascertain the actual reason for its separation from the herd. A detailed inspection will be required to see if it suffers from any internal injuries or other diseases,” says the official. After being rescued, the officials kept the calf in a temporary shelter at the location for almost 48 hours and waited at a safe distance to see if it reunites with the herd. Though there were a couple of herds nearby, none of those came to the location and the animal was finally shifted to the forest station on a pick-up van. Special team Since it was rescued from a location near the Thevar Mala (hill), the officials named him Thevar. A special team has been tasked to take care of the animal, which follows a diet comprising lactogen, glucose and ORS, as suggested by a forest veterinarian. Officials say the animal has been kept in isolation to minimise the risk of infections and after completing the observation period, it is most likely to be sent to the Konni elephant training camp. “On joining the camp, he will be getting a new name as well,” they say. The Ranni Forest Division has reported a rise in wild elephant population over the years, as evident from the rising instances of human-wildlife conflicts. A census carried out in 2017 confirmed the presence of at least 171 wild elephants in the region.  It is quite common for elephants to abandon calves which are weak and fail to keep pace||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/away-from-herd-but-the-darling-of-all-around/article36240835.ece
02 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Jury finds main TV serials unfit for award||The declaration of the State Television Award for the year 2020 became a commentary on the dismal quality of television serials as the jury decided not to choose any of the entries for the best teleserial, second best teleserial, best director, and best art director. The jury commented that majority of the entries did not meet the aims for which the award had been instituted. It also expressed concern at the negative portrayal of women and children in television serials. Channels should show more responsibility in choosing television serials and comedy programmes, which are often watched by the entire family together. The scope of the television award should be expanded to include web series, campus films, and new media creations, noted the jury. Preliminary screening Regarding documentaries, the jury said the directors often showed no inclination to look at contemporary life and the subjects were limited to beliefs, traditions, art forms and biographies. There is also a negative trend of news stories in television channels being expanded and submitted as documentaries. Culture Minister Saji Cherian, who had earlier expressed his concern on the falling standards of television content, declared the awards on Wednesday. The jury expressed its disappointment at the fact that not a single entry was submitted in the short film for children’s category, despite television being a medium widely watched by children. The members had to take a lot of effort in deciding on the awards because of the lack of quality in the other categories too. A preliminary screening committee should be constituted considering the number of entries lacking a minimum quality. An expert committee should be constituted to study and implement the issues pointed out, observed the jury. No ‘best book’ either No award was given in the best book on television category this year as there was only one entry. There was also a lack of academic rigour and originality in the submissions for best article on television category. A total of 39 entries were submitted for the jury’s consideration across the various categories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/main-serial-categories-left-blank-in-tv-awards/article36240756.ece

The Fire and Rescue Services Department had also issued an NOC. Meeting with firm According to Corporation officials, the power connection is expected within two days. The civic body had scheduled a meeting with the officials of the Tamil Nadu-based company, which constructed the facility and will run it, to decide on its management affairs and fixing of the rates. Council to approve rates With the company officials unable to reach here, the meeting has been postponed to next week. “Since the parking lot has now got all the required NOCs, it can be opened to the public as soon as the rates are fixed. The rates have to be approved by the council,” said a Corporation official. The multi-level parking lot was formally inaugurated in October last year, around a year after the construction works had started under the city Corporation’s Smart City projects. The structure of the parking lot was completed by December 2019. But the work on the fire safety equipment and testing had remained pending. The opening of the parking lot was further delayed after the inspectorate said that fire exit stairs need to be added to the structure. Cost shared Only the ground floor of the facility is being used currently, for parking the cars of Corporation officials. Executed under the Central government’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, the parking lot was completed at a cost of Rs. 5.64 crore. Half the cost was borne by the city Corporation, 30% by the Union government and 20% by the State government. An error in the estimates prepared by Kitco had led to a cost escalation of around Rs. 1 crore in the project. Other parking lots Meanwhile, the works on two other multi-level parking lots at Putharikkandam and Medical College have also been delayed. The company has now demanded a rate revision considering the delay. This will also be taken up for discussion in the meeting to be held next week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/multilevel-parking-lot-set-to-be-opened-to-public/article36241031.ece
02 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Police, SPC set up study centres for tribal students||When personnel from the Vithura police station and the Student Police Cadets (SPC) and teachers of Government Vocational and Higher Secondary School, Vithura, went to the Kalloopara tribal settlement during the first lockdown period to provide them food kits and medicines, more than food what the residents wanted was some facility for their children to study. A study room for 12 children was then arranged at the police station, but when the students informed the personnel of the difficulty to reach the station from the settlement, the police set out to see if a facility could be arranged in the settlement itself. Within five days, the parents readied a temporary structure made of bamboo and reed. The police and the teachers then arranged facilities such as TV, D2H connection, whiteboard, marker and furniture for online education, besides providing study kits. When the ‘pallikoodam’ (learning centre) at Kalloopara took off, the residents of Kongamarathinmoodu settlement, inside the forests near Kallar, demanded a similar centre. The settlement lacks vehicular access. The police and the SPC set up a centre there by the beginning of the second lockdown. The centre now accommodates 17 students. Educators appointed Schools across the State are closed owing to COVID-19, but these learning centres for students are up and running. The Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) has taken over the two centres and posted one educator each from the settlements on contract to monitor the classes telecast on Victers channel and to provide academic support. A third learning centre has come up at the Elavinmoodu settlement and another is coming up at Pallipurakarikkakom in the Kombarankallu settlement. Both will be inaugurated together. A fifth centre is on the cards at Kallar. People’s representatives, voluntary organisations, banks, and so on provide support in kind for the scheme, be it as TV, D2H connection, or furniture. How funds are raised Funds for the study kits are raised by the SPC students by rearing fish, delivering newspapers, and making pickles and payasam. English teacher at Vithura school and SPC community police officer Anver K. says a project has been submitted on the direction of Inspector General of Police P. Vijayan to expand the learning centre initiative to other parts of the State. “It is a matter of pride that a project launched in Vithura is set to take off across the State.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-spc-set-up-study-centres-for-tribal-students/article36241028.ece
02 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||CESL launches electric two-wheeler sales scheme||Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Central government entity Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), on Wednesday launched an electric two-wheeler sales scheme in Kerala. With the roll-out, the State also became the first user of the digital marketplace — MyEV (www.myev.org.in) — for booking and buying electric two-wheelers. Electricity Minister K. Krishnankutty launched the electric two-wheeler programme and digital marketplace. In the first stage, the programme is custom-designed for State government employees. The CESL is hoping to sell 10,000 vehicles to government employees and government offices. The CESL is making the vehicles available through its tie-up with the vehicle manufacturers. Initially 14 models from six companies are on offer, CESL officials said. The purchases will benefit from the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India Phase II (FAME II), the Central government’s subsidy programme, entitling customers to a subsidy which brings electric vehicle costs closer to that of their fossil fuel equivalents. In Kerala, the electric two-wheeler initiative is being carried out in collaboration with the Energy Management Centre (EMC). MyEV app The digital marketplace www.myev.org.in is designed to reduce physical visits to retail outlets in the COVID-19 situation. The mobile app MyEV can be downloaded from play store. Shifting to e-vehicles would have a big and positive impact on the monthly household Budgets given the petrol and diesel prices, Mr. Krishnankutty said. “The agreement with CESL is a big step towards ushering in a new era of e-mobility. Kerala has always been at the forefront in adapting to new technologies,” he said, adding that the two-wheeler programme would provide for the adoption of green transportation and energy transition. The Minister also said that the State hoped to have solar power units in one lakh houses by March next year. The CESL was working towards achieving the goals set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and NITI Aayog for the induction of green modes of transportation in different categories over the next five years, Mahua Acharya, managing director and chief executive officer, the CESL said. With the level of demand witnessed from cities, fleet operators, and financing entities, it was clear that the market was ready for a complete transition to electric mobility, Ms. Acharya said. The EMC had inked an MoU with the CESL on June 5 for rolling out the programme in Kerala, EMC director R. Harikumar said. The EMC was looking forward to manufacturers setting up more e-vehicle dealerships in the State, he said. Exhibition A four-day exhibition of the electric two-wheelers, jointly organised by the EMC and the CESL, is on at the Institution of Engineers, Vellayambalam. Visitors also have the opportunity for test driving the e-vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cesl-launches-electric-two-wheeler-sales-scheme/article36240824.ece
02 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||RSS gang within Kerala Police behind inaction: Annie Raja||CPI leader Annie Raja on Wednesday alleged that inaction of the police was the reason for the increased incidents of atrocities against women in Left-ruled Kerala. In controversial remarks about the State police, which is under Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan who holds the Home portfolio, Ms. Raja said she suspected the presence of a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) gang in the Kerala Police for their inaction in crimes against women in the State. The CPI is a key partner in the State’s ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front. Satheesan seeks action While Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said Ms. Raja was a national leader and there would be some basis for such allegations, senior BJP leader Kummanam Rajasekharan flayed her statement, saying she was unnecessarily using the name of the RSS for political gain. Talking to the media in New Delhi, Ms. Raja, wife of CPI general secretary D. Raja, alleged that the atrocities against women were happening in Kerala because of the inaction of the police. Citing incidents of suicides of women in domestic violence cases due to inaction of the police despite making complaints, she alleged that the approach of the police created a “suspicion that there was an RSS gang in the (Kerala) Police.” The Chief Minister should take such matters seriously, said Ms. Raja. Mr. Satheesan urged the Chief Minister to take appropriate action after talking to her. Mr. Rajasekharan said the State government was responsible for the plight of women and sought to know why the RSS was being unnecessarily dragged into such a matter. He also asked the CPI leader to provide names of RSS cadres in the State police. Ms. Raja’s statement came a day after a woman’s family in Kannur alleged police inaction for her suicide at her in-laws’ residence. The CPI leader also referred to the harassment of an eight-year-girl who was allegedly branded a thief by a woman police officer in Attingal last week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rss-gang-within-kerala-police-behind-inaction-annie-raja/article36240794.ece

The police have seized five double-barrelled guns and 25 rounds of ammunition from the men. They were employed as security guards for a private cash logistics firm in the city, Aneesh V., Station House Officer, Karamana police station, said. The men, who were arrested from their residence near Neeramankara, were identified as Mushtaq Hussain, Mohammed Javed, Gulsaman, Shukoor Ahmed, and Shoukat Ali. They are believed to have arrived in the city between one year and six months ago through a recruiting agency based in Maharashtra. The police had initially investigated the men on the basis of an anonymous complaint that they had declined to surrender the guns during the Assembly elections, Mr. Aneesh said. Subsequently, the police had contacted the Additional District Magistrate, Rajouri district, and the Station House Officer, Kandi (Rajouri), on August 13, seeking information about the men and the arms licences. “The men were arrested after we received a report from the ADM on Wednesday that they did not possess valid permits,” Mr. Aneesh said.

The meeting of public health experts, epidemiologists and virologists from across the globe was convened by Mr. Vijayan to discuss Kerala’s COVID-19 containment strategies and to seek their opinion on the way forward for the State.

However, hospitalisations and ICU occupancy figures showed an increase for the sixth consecutive day on Wednesday. Current ICU occupancy in hospitals continues to rise and went up from 2,336 on Tuesday to 2,354 on Wednesday, while the number of patients requiring ventilator support went up from 1,002 to 1,022 respectively. The State’s active case pool has risen, to register 2,29,912 patients at present, with 21,610 patients reported to have recovered on Wednesday. Meanwhile, COVID-19 deaths continue to show a rise. Even when the State claims that it has the lowest case fatality rate, in absolute numbers, this comes as huge. The official cumulative case fatality stands at 20,961, with Kerala adding 173 deaths, most of which occurred in the past few days, to the official list of COVID deaths. Hospitalisations up New hospitalisations showed a huge jump on Wednesday. The number of patients newly admitted to hospitals with the disease went up from 2,698 on Tuesday to 3,227.

N. Vasavan said on Wednesday. He was speaking after distributing the farmers’ awards instituted by the Kerala State Co-operative Agricultural and Rural Development Bank. Maintaining that stringent action would be taken against unlawful tendencies in the cooperation sector, the Minister urged caution against using ''isolated incidents'' to tarnish the sector as a whole. Cooperative banks today form a major support system for the farmers, he said. Over 2,000 branches of public sector banks have downed shutters due to mergers. The cooperative sector was able to emerge as a parallel financial mechanism for the farm sector in this scenario, he said. E. S. Thomas of Idukki was selected the best farmer, and K. M.

The collision took place around 5.30 a.m. on Wednesday, said a spokesman for the traditional fishers’ association, Paramparagatha Matsya Thozhilali Union, at Vypeen. P.V. Jayan of the union said that fishers on boats nearby came to the rescue of those on the boat. Their timely intervention helped save the lives of the 48 fishers, he said. According to fishers, two boats had sunk off the coast of Vypeen and the wreckages have been posing a hindrance to the movement of fishing boats, especially during the low tide. One of these boats, Poornasree, had sunk in the third week of May, 2021, and another boat, Ashiqmon, on August 31, said Charles George of Matysa Thozhilali Aikya Vedhi, a union of traditional fishers. Fishers’ unions have appealed to the Cochin Port Trust to help retrieve the wreckages to avoid recurrence of such incidents. K.N. Unnikrishnnan, Vypeen MLA, has written to Fisheries Minister Saji Cherian, pointing out that the accident in the early hours of Wednesday occurred after the fishing boat ran into the wreckage. While the primary responsibility of removing the remains of a sunken boat remained with the boat owner, institutions like the Cochin Port Trust should be held liable to pay compensation to the affected fishers for its failure to ensure that the wreckage was removed in a timely manner, he said. Group insurance Mr. Unnikrishnan said that since the premium for insurance was high, boat owners were reluctant to insure their vessels and that the Fisheries Department should make sure that boat owners and workers received group insurance cover. The MLA said that unless the wreckage of sunken boats was removed or if proper signage was not put up to mark the spots, more accidents were likely in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/48-fishers-rescued-off-vypeen-coast/article36240787.ece

Ramakrishna has criticised the posturing of the Telangana government with regard to the allocation of Krishna waters during the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) meeting after having signed the agreement arrived at during the 2015 meeting in the presence of Central Water Commission (CWC) representatives. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Ramakrishna said Andhra Pradesh was allocated 512 tmcft of water, and Telangana 299 tmcft, which the Telangana government now wants to change and is seeking additional allocation, which is nothing but greediness. It will deprive the Rayalaseema region of its rightful entitlement, he said. “The CPI seeks an all-party meeting at the national level to resolve the water sharing dispute in the presence of the Union Minister for Jal Shakti and settle it once for all so that in future no State would be able to arm-twist another and unauthorised tap precious water resources and waste it, as the Telangana government has been doing in the recent past,” said the CPI leader. Bandh call Nineteen political parties in the country have given a bandh call on September 25 to protest against the anti-people’s policies of the BJP-led Central government and not doing anything to stop the fuel price rise. Agitations would be organised from September 20 to 30 in Andhra Pradesh each day on a different issue, he said. CPI district secretary D. Jagadeesh was also present on the occasion. Earlier in the day, the party cadre led by Mr. Ramakrishna took out a rally seeking restoration of the pension scheme for the State government teachers and withdraw the Contributory Provident Fund scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-condemns-telanganas-posturing-on-krishna-waters/article36240948.ece
02 September 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Follow SC norms in bullock cart races: HC||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday said the State government will have to ensure that conditions imposed by the Supreme Court for bullock/bullock cart races in Maharashtra are followed, while permitting such races in Karnataka as per the law amended in 2018. A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the directions while disposing of a PIL petition filed by People for Animals, Mysuru. The petitioner had questioned the permission granted for bullock cart race in Mandya in March this year. The Bench observed that the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, 1960 was amended by the State through the PCA (Karnataka Second Amendment) Act 2017, allowing Kambala or Bulls race or Bullock cart race with certain conditions. The Supreme Court in its December 15, 2013, judgement in Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil Vs State of Maharashtra, imposed several guidelines for bullock/bullock cart races in Maharashtra. As the law in Karnataka permits bullock/bullock cart race, the authorities can grant permission by imposing the apex court’s guidelines, the Bench said while disposing of the petition, which had not challenged the amended law. The apex court’s guidelines in Maharashtra’s case, among other things, states that there must be a separate track for each bullock cart. No whipping of the bull would be permitted. The cartman can only swirl the whip in the air and hit it on the ground. The cartman should not cause pain or injury to the animals. A veterinary doctor attached to the village dispensary should first inspect all the bulls to ensure they are in good physical condition, they are not intoxicated, and chilly powder or mud is not applied to the genitals to make them more aggressive, so that they run faster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/follow-sc-norms-in-bullock-cart-races-hc/article36240293.ece
02 September 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||National Monetisation Pipeline will lead to lay-offs: Sachin Pilot||Congress leader and former Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot has argued that the Centre’s National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) will lead to more layoffs by private firms and increase unemployment in the country. Speaking to mediapersons at the party office in Bengaluru on Wednesday, Mr. Pilot said private companies who obtain infrastructure assets of the Central government on lease would not retain the same employees or even the same number of employees. With the intention of making a profit, they would lay-off staff in public sector companies, he argued. The Centre has announced leasing infrastructure assets under a Rs. 6 trillion NMP while retaining ownership. Mr. Pilot said the Centre announced NMP without consultation or discussion in Parliament and criticised the lack of transparency. “Nobody knows what would be the condition of these assets after completion of the lease period,” he said The government was entering into agreements with crony capitalists, he said. As part of a nationwide plan, the Congress has decided to create awareness on NMP. On expansion of the Ashok Gehlot-led Cabinet in Rajasthan, Mr. Pilot said the party high command would take a decision. Congress general secretary Ajay Maken, who is in charge of Rajasthan, held meetings with MLAs and State leaders in Jaipur, to evolve a consensus on Cabinet expansion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/national-monetisation-pipeline-will-lead-to-lay-offs-sachin-pilot/article36240308.ece
02 September 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Schools across T.N. welcome students back on campuses||Students of Classes IX to XII were welcomed back on school campuses across Tamil Nadu on Wednesday, with a slew of safety measures in place. In campuses across the State, temperature checks were carried out as students entered the premises while teachers stood near the entrance, briefing students and parents about the requirement for strict adherence to mask wearing and physical distancing norms. Many were thrilled to be back on campus after several months of online classes. At the Government Hobart Higher Secondary School, Royapettah, teachers welcomed students with new notebooks and chocolates. Mohamed Abdullah, headmaster of the Arignar Anna Government Higher Secondary School, Besant Nagar, said many students from disadvantaged backgrounds had difficulty learning online as they were expected to do chores or help parents with their jobs. “We are happy to have children back here. We have cleaned the premises, and will ensure distancing.” Schools across the State saw over 60% of the students return to campus. Minister for School Education Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi conducted surprise inspections of two government schools in the city, where he took stock of safety measures and adherence to SOPs. The Minister earlier said it would not be compulsory for all students to attend physical classes, and alternate modes of learning would continue if needed. “We have some students whose parents shifted out of Chennai during the pandemic since they lost their jobs. They were attending online classes, and will continue to do so till they can shift back here,” said Maheshwari Kalpana, headmistress, Chennai High School, Kottur. With COVID-19 protocols in place, schools in Madurai began functioning with nearly 90% student turnout. “There are 1,65,684 students in the district who belong to Classes IX-XII at 534 high and higher secondary schools. Close to 90% attended school today,” Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan said. Over 600 schools reopened in Coimbatore district. Education Department officials said some schools started functioning with students of only Classes X and XII. No major absenteeism was reported from the schools in the district, including those in the hilly regions of Valparai. With day scholars from Kerala not being allowed to enter the State, the representatives of a few private schools near the inter-State border approached Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer N. Geetha, saying they won’t be able to reopen the schools on Wednesday, and that they would continue with online classes, an official said. “We are compiling a list of students whose parents are yet to receive the vaccine, so that they could be inoculated,” said A. Nasarudeen, Chief Educational Officer, the Nilgiris district. More than 30,000 students from Classes IX to XII were back on 210 school campuses there. While most schools in the central region reopened on Wednesday, some private schools decided to reopen on Thursday. The authorities at a private school on Vayalur Road in Tiruchi said they decided to give students an additional day to prepare for the reopening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/schools-across-tamil-nadu-welcome-students-back/article36240415.ece
02 September 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vaccine hesitancy in villages gives a hard time for health staff||Health workers in Chittoor district are having a tough time in vaccinating the population in rural pockets as some, particularly women farmers and farm workers, are hesitant to take the COVID-19 jab. According to officials, the first dose of COVID vaccine was administered to more than 95% of the targeted age group of above 45 in the district. The remaining 5% is reportedly unwilling to take the vaccine for “unclear reasons”, which some perceive as “fear of side-effects.” With reports of the third wave rearing its head around September coming in and with many in the elderly age group yet to receive their first dose of the vaccine, the health staff in the district is a worried lot. Officials said that after completing 95% of the first jab target, they were in an upbeat mood thinking that the rest would be done in a matter of a day or two. But much to their dismay, they found convincing some villagers to get themselves vaccinated extremely difficult. The health workers say they had to pay repeated visits to houses of such villagers for the purpose. “I had visited a household in Pichatur mandal to administer the vaccine shot to some persons aged above 60. But, I was told that they did not want to take the jab. Their hesitancy makes our job difficult. Along with my team, I pursued after them and found them at a farmland. It took half-an-hour to convince and vaccinate them,” an Asha worker said. In another incident, a 65-year-old woman farmer of Nagalapuram mandal had tried her level best to shun the paramedical staff. “My neighbour fell sick for three days after taking the COVID jab,” the woman said. She was later administered the jab after much struggle. “Though the vaccines are safe, we can’t take chances with those who feel nervous. We can only request those who missed the jabs to visit the PHCs voluntarily and cooperate with us,” District Immunization Officer C. Hanumantha Rao said. Deputy District Medical and Health Officer (Deputy DMHO) P. Ravi Raju, who inspected the rural areas in Nagari, Narayanavanam and Karveti Nagaram mandals, urged the villagers to voluntarily come to the primary health centres and community centres to receive the jab. “Though we have initiated giving jabs in the fields and work stations, this is not methodical as those who take the first dose should be under observation for at least a few minutes and in case of any side effects, they need to be attended to by doctors immediately,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaccine-hesitancy-in-villages-gives-a-hard-time-for-health-staff/article36240934.ece

We have plans to name the new building after former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.

During a review meeting on agriculture, e-cropping, Rythu Bharosa Kendra (RBKs) and the projects regarding development and strengthening of infrastructure facilities in farm and its allied sectors here on Wednesday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that necessary steps should be taken to ensure that farmers got better remunerative prices for their produce. Referring to Agricultural Advisory Boards (AAB) meetings, the Chief Minister instructed the officials to resolve the issues highlighted by these boards and said that the authorities should take the responsibility of addressing the issues raised by farmers. The officials informed him that more than one lakh farmers were part of the AABs in the State. Reviewing the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs), the Chief Minister said that fertilizers, pesticides and seeds requested by farmers should be made available at the RBKs within the stipulated time and stressed on providing quality products through RBKs. “A system should be set up to resolve farmers’ issues directly through the RBK centres by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. The authorities must focus on creating awareness among farmers on natural farming,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and asked the officials to hire buildings on rental basis for setting up small godowns to store seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. ISO certification The Chief Minister said there should be continuous monitoring and review of the performance of RBKs and directed the authorities to take steps to get the ISO certification for the facilities. He said the YSR Agri Testing Labs must be launched in December this year.

He was also allegedly instigated by his father, Chennaiah. Sambasiva Rao had an arms license since 2013, while he was working as a security guard at a factory. Though he had resigned from the job, he failed to inform the police and continued to keep the weapon. On Sunday, he allegedly picked up a quarrel with the victims and shot them dead. Superintendent of Police, Guntur Rural, Vishal Gunni said thatinstructions had been given to inspect all arms licenses and weapons with ex army men, security agencies and security personnel. “A detailed audit will be held to find out the number of arms licenses, including those in possession of former military personnel, the number of such cases against ex army personnel, details of existing arms licenses and their expiry dates and those who have not yet revived their licenses,’’ said Mr. Gunni.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ex-army-man-held-on-charges-of-killing-cousins-over-property/article36240363.ece
02 September 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘State spending 3 times amount spent by TDP as pensions’||Brushing aside allegations that the State government is cutting social security pensions, Adviser (Public Affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy has said that the State has been spending three times the amount spent by the previous government, while a section of media has been giving distorted versions to mislead the people. Speaking to the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Reddy said while Rs. 500 crore was spent during the previous government towards pensions to 39 lakh people, the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government was spending Rs. 1,500 crores on 60 lakh pensioners. The TDP had nothing to claim of what it had done during its term and people had sent back Chandrababu Naidu home while the Chief Minister was working hard and the results would be tangible and benefit the future generations. “We are paying interest to a tune of Rs. 30,000 crore to Rs. 40,000 crore towards the loans raised by N. Chandrababu Naidu,” Mr. Reddy said adding that a person who was Chief Minister had nothing to claim as achievement during his term. Weeding out ineligible candidates The government was only weeding out the ineligible candidates from the pension list and putting a check to malpractices, the government has removed the 2 to 3 month lumpsum scheme for those residing in other States. He made it clear that all those staying in other States had to come within the first week of each month to avail themselves of the pension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-spending-3-times-amount-spent-by-tdp-as-pensions/article36240364.ece
02 September 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Confusion marks day 1 of school reopening||Under a mango-leaf decked arch, a line of students — some in uniform, some in regular clothes — walked behind drummers as they entered the Mandal Parishad Primary School in Rayalapur on Wednesday for the most unusual and memorable welcome after an 18-month gap. “Some of the children are seeing a school for the first time in their life. Our staff members thought up the idea yesterday and we implemented it today. The student strength of the school is 81 and 35 turned up,” said Siddi Ramulu, the school headmaster. But confusion, safety concerns and lethargy turned school reopening in Hyderabad into a tame affair. Schools across the State had been shut for the past one-and-a-half year due to COVID-19 pandemic. At prayer time around 9 a.m., at the MPP Primary School, Hyderguda, only three students turned up for classes. ‘Like attending school’ One boy cycled into the school to ask when the school will start functioning and then pedalled home to return in uniform. “Attending classes is better than online classes as we get to study as well as play and meet friends. I like to study in school; at home, it is different,” said Gnaneshwar, a Class V student, who returned to school after studying Class III. “I am sending across text messages and parents are calling up to ask about reopening. Parents got confused as the High Court orders for residential schools were misinterpreted as extending to all schools,” said Suhasini, the headmistress of the school in between attending multiple calls from parents. At Upparpally Primary School, five children turned up around prayer time. “Where is your mask? Collect it from the table,” said Manjula, a teacher, to a student who ambled in around 9.25 a.m. “We have made arrangements for additional masks and sanitiser for students. It is still early, once students turn up in numbers, we will ensure that they sit at a distance from each other,” said the headmistress, who teaches Class I students at the school. In private schools, the buses stayed parked in bus bays and only the teaching and non-teaching staff turned up. “We don’t have consent from parents for reopening of the school. There is a lot of confusion about when we can start offline classes. We are now planning to start classes from Monday,” said K.K. Kousallia, a correspondent of Priyadarshini High School in Golconda area. “The school has made it clear that if my child becomes ill, it will not be their responsibility. I decided that I will not take any chances and therefore, didn’t send my son to school. He is attending online classes,” said a parent whose ward is in Class VIII of Sri Vidyaniketan in Rambagh Colony.  The school has made it clear that if my child becomes ill, it will not be their responsibility. I decided that I will not take any chances. He is attending online classes.

Speaking after launching the ‘Bima Week’ at the LIC’s Kadapa divisional office here on Wednesday, he said the market leader would emerge successful to remain at the top by thoroughly studying the potholes in the insurance sector.  ‘Ensuring market share no mean feat’ “It is quite difficult to ensure 75% market share in the insurance sector. The LIC has achieved it by looking beyond the agents to get business from other channels and embracing technology”, he observed. Senior Divisional Manager K. Giridhar attributed the corporation’s success to the 1.08 lakh employees and the 13 lakh agents. The company stood ahead in terms of credibility by settling 99.96% of death claims in Kadapa division alone, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lic-can-overcome-challenges-apgb-chief/article36240940.ece

Durgesh on Wednesday said the party prepared an action plan to repair roads if the government did not mend them by October 2. “It is a State-level initiative of the party,” Mr. Durgesh told the media here. “The JSP will celebrate September 2, the birthday of its founder Pawan Kalyan, in a unique way by documenting the present state of road network in State. It will continue for three,” he said. “Every road in the district that requires repair will be photographed. The data will be shared on social platforms. We have also prepared an action plan to repair select roads in each mandal if there is no response from the government by October 2,” Mr. Durgesh said. “Women members of the party too will participate in the road repair activity,” Mr. Durgesh said, and urged party leaders to document the condition of roads and upload them on social networking sites. The online campaign is titled #JSPforAPRoads, he added. ‘Release White Paper’ In Vizianagaram, JSP Political Affairs Committee member Palavalasa Yashaswi and State secretary G.

02 September 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Probe tree-felling cases from all angles: Kerala High Court||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday directed the special investigation team (SIT) probing the cases relating to the illegal felling and removal of valuable trees from various parts of Kerala to investigate the cases from all angles at the earliest to protect the interest of the State and avoid such situations in future. The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali, while disposing of a public interest litigation seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the cases, observed that “if anybody, howsoever high he is, is involved” in the illegal cutting of trees, adequate and stringent action should be initiated by the SIT, headed by the Additional Director General of Police, Crime Branch, at the earliest to ensure that the evidence required for properly proceeding with the investigation and for the culmination of the prosecution proceedings was not “defaced or removed by the culprits.” Not only patta land The court ordered that the investigation “shall not be saddled only with regard to the trees cut and removed from the patta lands.” The SIT had been constituted for investigating the incidents of cutting and removal of valuable trees from forests, government and patta lands. Therefore, “the SIT has to conduct investigation not only into the cutting and removal of valuable trees from the patta land, but also from the government as well as forestland,” the court said. The issue was a serious matter. Therefore, “no manner of leniency or laxity can be shown in the matter. The State will have to take the matter forward more seriously,” the court observed. The court further observed that concerted action had been taken to cut and remove the valuable trees from the forest areas, government and patta lands, “which could not have been done without the connivance and blessings of the high officials of the departments concerned.” Clear inconsistency The court pointed out that even though in the statement filed by the State, it was stated that the investigation was being carried out into the cutting and removal of trees from the forest areas, patta lands, and government properties, going through the details furnished in the additional statement it was seen that the investigation was being done to find out the real culprits who were involved in the cutting and removal of trees only from the patta lands. Therefore, there was a clear inconsistency “on a bare comparison of the statement and additional statement filed on behalf of the State.” The court made it clear that this judgement would not prevent any member of the public from approaching the High Court with authentic materials, at a later point of time, if the investigation was not taken forward in the right direction. The court ordered that the report submitted by the SIT before the court shall be kept in a sealed cover, in the safe custody of the Registrar General, till further orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/probe-tree-felling-cases-from-all-angles-kerala-high-court/article36240299.ece
02 September 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||NIA moves to invoke UAPA in Sri Lankan arms seizure case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) moved a special court here on Tuesday for invoking the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) against the accused in the Sri Lankan arms and drugs seizure case, suspecting that they were aiding the revival of the activities of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the country and Sri Lanka. The Coast Guard intercepted a Sri Lankan fishing vessel, Ravihansi, in the Arabian Sea on March 18 last year and seized huge quantities of drugs, five AK-47 rifles and 1,000 pieces of 9mm ammunition from the vessel. Six Sri Lankan nationals were arrested. Later, the NIA took over the investigation and arrested A. Suresh Raj and Soundarajan of Chennai. A preliminary analysis of the social media accounts of the accused revealed that they were in contact with the convicted cadres of the LTTE and were coordinating in the exchange of illegal consignments. The accused used various SIM cards, including ones registered in foreign countries, for committing offences, the agency submitted. The arrested and some “fugitive accused persons” had conspired in Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan and the UAE since 2018 and formed a terrorist gang, which had collected and transferred huge amounts of money from various countries. According to the NIA, the custodial interrogation of the accused revealed that arms, ammunition and drugs were procured through a Pakistan national for further supply in India and Sri Lanka. The Pakistan national receives his remuneration through his associates in Dubai, which is made through a hawala network based in Sri Lanka and India. The agency said an analysis of digital devices of the accused revealed “audio threatening the Sri Lankan army on behalf of the LTTE.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nia-moves-to-invoke-uapa-in-sri-lankan-arms-seizure-case/article36240301.ece

The petitioner contended that the trees were cut and removed on the basis of certificates issued by the revenue authorities.

They had stopped to have lunch and he demanded evidence to prove they are mother and son. After verbally abusing them, he tried to smash the front glass of the car. When Salu tried to stop him, the 21-year-old was attacked with the rod. When Shamla intervened, she too was attacked. Both the son and mother suffered injuries in the incident, and they drove to the police station to file a complaint. “The accused has been absconding since Monday, but the same day his sister had filed a fake complaint against Shamla and Salu alleging that their vehicle had hit her goat," said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/accused-in-paravur-moral-policing-held/article36240306.ece

Municipal Commissioner D.K. Balaji said that each plant was geo-tagged and the municipal corporation would monitor the growth of all the saplings. Planting a sapling was not sufficient, but ensuring it grew into a tree was essential, he said.

02 September 2021||MYSURU,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘No official order linking ration with vaccination’||The Chamarajanagar district administration has come under flak for allegedly linking COVID-19 vaccination with disbursal of pension and ration. During an interaction with mediapersons recently, Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi said that a ‘No vaccination, no ration’ campaign would be launched on September 1 to ramp up vaccination coverage in the district. However, authorities insisted that it was only an oral statement. The DC has not issued an official order to launch such a campaign and neither have the departments concerned made it mandatory for people to show vaccination certificates before collecting ration or pension, they pointed out. But the issue triggered a political row with Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar tweeting: ‘The BJP government and Chamarajanagar administration have no shame. Their incompetence resulted in 36 deaths due to lack of oxygen. They want to punish those who don’t take vaccine, but they should first apologise for not arranging oxygen, vaccines, tests, compensation for deaths. The BJP Govt says it won’t give ration or pension to those not vaccinated. But are there enough vaccines? Have they persuaded people to take vaccines? Such denial of basic food and pension is illegal, unethical, unconstitutional’. A vaccination camp (Lasika Utsav) began in the district on August 27 and will end on September 3. Authorities said they have a target of vaccinating people in 170 villages sharing a border with Kerala and Tamil Nadu during the mela.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-official-order-linking-ration-with-vaccination/article36240291.ece

Narayana. He told mediapersons here on Wednesday that 19 opposition parties would be joining them in the campaign that will go on from September 20 to 30. A ‘Bharat Bandh’ would be enforced on September 25 to exert pressure on the Centre to withdraw the three farm laws and new labour codes, he said. “We have come together to stop the largescale privatisation of PSUs,” he said, adding that those who did not take part in the freedom struggle would not know the value of national assets. Reacting to State Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy’s statement that capital is where the Chief Minister chooses to function from, Mr. Narayana said Amaravati was chosen as the capital only after arriving at a broad consensus. Even CM Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who was then in the Opposition, had agreed to it. It was “highly absurd” for the Minister to say now that the capital could be where the CM stays, the CPI leader said, adding that the government was morally bound to implement the decision of the State(on the location of capital at Amaravati), for which purpose the farmers had given their land. Alleging that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had “mismanaged” the State’s finances by implementing ‘Navaratnalu’ schemes without taking steps to generate additional revenue, he feared that the State is heading towards “financial emergency”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-other-parties-join-hands-for-campaign-against-modi-govt/article36240935.ece

The CPI leader was reacting to a statement made by Minister in Chittoor on Tuesday that the seat of the administration was where the Chief Minister functions from and that the capital could be in Vijayawada, Pulivendula, Vizag or any other place.

Taking strong objection to the State government’s decision to divest its stake in the Gangavaram port to a Adani group firm at a “throwaway” price, he said it was unfortunate that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government competed with the Narendra Modi government in selling assets of the state-owned firms built over the years with the workers toil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ministers-capital-talk-is-irresponsible-cpi-leader/article36240982.ece

Lokesh on Wednesday dared the Ministers to visit the areas affected by Polavaram irrigation project and claim their achievements in delivering on the promises made by the government pertaining to the Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) package. Addressing a gathering on the concluding day of his visit in the project-affected areas, Mr. Lokesh said, “Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu is stating that our (TDP) field-level observations on the implementation of the R&R package are far from the reality. If so, why the Ministers are not able to visit the project-affected areas?” he asked. Mr. Lokesh said that the TDP was willing for the debate with the Ministers on the implementation of the R&R package. “The YSRCP government has completed half of the five-year term, but it is yet to deliver on the promises made on the land-to-land component for the project evacuees,” said the TDP leader. Mr. Lokesh visited the R&R colonies built in Rampachodavaram and its surrounding areas in the recent months and interacted with the families that have been shifted there from the area facing submergence. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to provide 25 families in the R&R colonies. However, the ground realities of the facilities available in the colonies are far from what the government is claiming,” claimed Mr. Lokesh.

02 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Probe panel gives Kerala’s Sprinklr deal a clean chit||A government inquiry has cleared Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar of the charge of mala fide abuse of position in the engagement of U.S.-based big data firm Sprinklr ostensibly to forecast the pandemic pattern in the initial days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala in early 2020. A panel headed by former Law Secretary and District Judge K. Sasidharan Nair found no “evil design, malice or bad faith" in the Sprinklr deal. There was no data loss or loss to the public exchequer either. The panel faulted Mr. Sivasankar for keeping the Law, Finance and Health Departments in the dark about the nature of the government’s engagement with Sprinklr. He should have sought prior consent of the departments. Mr. Sivasankar also did not adhere to a security protocol for the transfer and storage of sensitive data. Chennithala’s charge Former Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, who had sought an anti-corruption inquiry into the alleged transfer of the personal medical information of citizens to a foreign firm, cried foul. He dismissed the report submitted by the three-member committee as a whitewash and questioned the professional credentials of the committee. It attempted to systematically discredit the findings of the first inquiry committee that had probed the matter, he alleged. M. Madhavan Nambiar, former Civil Aviation Secretary, and renowned Cyber expert Gulshan Roy had headed it. Mr. Chennithala said Mr. Nambiar and Mr. Roy had found fault with the government and Mr. Sivasankar, who was then IT Secretary, for opening the door for a foreign firm to harvest citizens’ medical information for possible sale to big players in the medical insurance and pharmaceutical sectors. Discomfited by their findings, Mr. Vijayan had constituted a panel with questionable expertise to review the Sprinklr deal and protect his confidant Mr. Sivasankar, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/probe-panel-gives-keralas-sprinklr-deal-a-clean-chit/article36240303.ece

02 September 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Power utilities reduce AT&C losses, save Rs. 2,342 crore||The Andhra Pradesh power utilities reduced the aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses from 13.79% in 2018-19 to 10.95% in 2019-20, and saved Rs. 2,342 crore by procuring cost-effective power from the exchanges in the last two years (2019-20 and 2020-21), a press release by Energy Secretary N. Srikant said. Mr. Srikant claimed that various cost-cutting measures yielded the desired result, and the State had become a model for others in adopting best practices. The AP-Transco saved around Rs. 15.96 crore in finalising the tenders for high- performance analytic appliance enterprise cloud services for a period of five years through e-procurement. The power utilities have already deployed the day-ahead electricity model using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to forecast the next day’s electricity consumption. With this, they are able to control the electricity procurement costs. Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy appreciated the efforts of all the power utilities in saving money to a large extent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/power-utilities-reduce-atc-losses-save-rs-2342-crore/article36240956.ece
02 September 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Krishna river board has seen merit in A.P.’s arguments’||Officials of the Water Resources Department (WRD) on Wednesday claimed that the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) had appreciated the merit in their arguments against the power generation by the Telangana utilities at Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects. KRMB Chairman M.P. Singh, who chaired the meeting, took note of the objections raised by the Andhra Pradesh government and insisted that power generation be incidental to the irrigation requirements, and both sides ought to be bound by the board’s water release orders. This was apparently not accepted by the Telangana officials, who staged a walkout from the meeting in protest, leaving the deliberations inconclusive. The Andhra Pradesh government was represented by Secretary (WRD) J. Syamala Rao, Engineer-in-Chief C. Narayana Reddy and Chief Engineer (inter-State projects) Srinivasa Reddy. Mr. Narayana Reddy had written a letter to the KRMB recently, insisting the river borad that the administrative control of the Srisailam right bank powerhouse and the entire reservoir vests with the Government of Andhra Pradesh and that of the left side pumped storage scheme with Telangana by virtue of geographical boundaries of the divided States. He reiterated that the Telangana utilities were not supposed to generate power without water release orders by the KRMB and the relevant protocols laid down by the Central Water Commission (CWC).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/krmb-has-seen-merit-in-aps-arguments/article36240342.ece

Addressing the media on Wednesday, Mr. Veeranjaneya Swamy said the government’s decision was a rude shock to the old-age, widow and differently abled beneficiaries in the State. “It is atrocious on the part of the government to say that pensions not availed in a particular month will not be given later. In the past three months, the YSRCP government has removed over 2.28 lakh social security pensions across the State,” he alleged. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was bent on cancelling more pensions in the days to come in the name of ‘eKYC’ verification, the TDP leader alleged. “The pension amount too has not been increased from Rs. 2,250 to Rs. 2,500 as promised,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-cancelling-pensions-arbitrarily/article36240365.ece

In a statement on Wednesday, CPI(M) State secretary P. Madhu held the previous Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government and the present YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government responsible for the true up charges. The TDP government had desisted from taking a decision on the true up charges. The present government did not react for two years after coming to power. No fruitful efforts were made by either the TDP or the YSRCP governments. Consequently, the people were paying the price, he said. The true up charges would be levied till March next year. The Discoms would collect Rs. 1.27 per unit as true up charge every month. It means, the consumers, who consumed less than 50 units per month, would be paying Rs. 1.45 per unit. The poor would have to pay double the amount of their power bills every month. The total burden of true up charges would be Rs. 3,669 crore, he said. The Discoms were incurring losses due to the policies of the State and Central governments. Also, the people were already reeling under the financial crisis triggered by the covid pandemic. The government should shoulder the burden of farmers and consumers who consume less than 200 units per month, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-asks-govt-to-shoulder-true-up-charges-burden/article36240366.ece

02 September 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Main road from Anakapalle is a nightmare for motorists||The main road from Anakapalle, which connects the National Highway-16 (NH-16) bypass road and further up to Atchutapuram and beyond, has turned out to be a nightmare for motorists, be it day or night, rain or shine. Vehicles are getting stuck in the innumerable potholes and trenches. This double road is the gateway into the jaggery town for the vehicles coming from the Rajamahendravaram-side. With one side of the road being badly damaged, the other side, which is comparatively better, is being used by both up and down vehicles. Accumulation of drain water on the road is said to be adding to their woes. The closure of the other entry into the town from Visakhapatnam city side due to the flyover work has further added to the traffic on the road. “My car got stuck in the trench-like pits, which formed on the road, when I was returning home recently. Though there was no rain, drain water, which overflowed onto the road, collected in the pits and potholes and there was no way of knowing how deep the pothole is,” says R. Kiran Kumar of Green Hills Apartment, located beside the NH-16, at Anakapalle. “This double road, leading to the town from the NH-16, has some apartments, shops and motor vehicle service centres. The bad stretch of road is not far from the highway junction and soon after my car was stuck in the ditch, a policeman came and asked me to remove my vehicle as it was obstructing the free flow of traffic," he says. “I told him that my car could be damaged, if I move further without knowing the depth of the potholes. I had phoned for the towing vehicle to take my car safely out of the mess,” says Mr. Kiran, a techie from Hyderabad, who has returned to work from home in view of the pandemic. “We have been facing this problem for over a year now. The wheels of cars are getting stuck in the large holes and rotating on their axis instead of moving ahead. We have complained to the GVMC officials but only temporary measures like filling up the holes with crusher dust is being done and the problem was back to square one, after a spell of rain or due to accumulation of overflowing drain water,” says Srinivas, a resident of Simhadri Residency, located right beside the main road. Mr. Srinivas as also other residents of the apartment complex are unable to take out their cars from the cellar parking for the past several months. “Craters have formed right outside our complex and there is a danger of the underside of the cars (especially low height cars) hitting the ground, while entering or emerging out of the complex,” he says. “Sitting in the shop for 10 minutes is enough to get a coat of dust all over one’s body. Lack of proper outlet for the drains seems to be the cause of drain water accumulation,” says Venkata Kiran, who owns a chicken centre. “There is heavy movement of vehicles on this road and water logging has turned out to be a major problem for motorists,” says Santosh, a service advisor at Hyundai showroom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/main-road-from-anakapalle-is-a-nightmare-for-motorists/article36241081.ece

02 September 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Brain aneurysm treated using rare procedure in city||Doctors at Medicover Hospitals successfully operated on a brain aneurysm using a technique called intrasaccular flow diversion treatment, which the hospital claimed was never done before in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha. This is a new treatment option for brain aneurysm that is otherwise difficult to treat. This is an FDA-approved latest method of treatment recommended for Brain Bifurcation Aneurysm, the doctors said. Brain aneurysms are balloonings in blood vessels in the brain. Patients who endure brain aneurysms are at risk of the aneurysm growing and eventually rupturing, which may lead to severe bleeding in the brain, also known as brain haemorrhage, leading to death. Brain aneurysms can be treated by surgical clipping or endovascular methods. Subbalakshmi (50) of Kakinada had complained of severe headache, which was continuing till her neck along with visual disturbances. She approached a local physician, and underwent an MRI scan and the reports showed the rupture of a brain aneurysm. She was rushed to Medicover Hospitals where she consulted Dr. Siba Shankar Dalai, Senior Consultant Neuro Vascular Intervention. Considering the patient’s condition and the location of the aneurysm, Dr. Dalai decided to perform a ‘flow diversion’ technique. The intrasaccular flow diversion is the latest technology that enables doctors to divert the blood flow away from the aneurysm and to heal the aneurysm progressively. Dr. Dalai told reporters on Wednesday that the patient recovered and was ready for discharge.

The State Roads Development Corporation had submitted a report to the State government to this effect in March, he said. The JSP leader alleged that contractors were averse to taking up road works as the government had not settled the bills pertaining to 1,521 works done at a cost of Rs. 388 crore last year. Motorists and pedestrians were facing the brunt due to the bad roads. Though an allocation of Rs. 1,242 crore was made in the 2021-22 budget for roads, not even Rs. 1 crore was released for repairs, he claimed. Mr. Tata Rao alleged that for the past one year, the State government was levying cess of Rs. 1 on every litre of petrol and diesel towards maintenance of roads, thereby earning a revenue of Rs. 632 crore and Rs. 286 crore in the last five months. The funds were diverted for the implementation of the ‘Navaratnalu’ scheme and there was no money for undertaking road repairs, he alleged. Similarly, an allocation of Rs. 205 crore was made in the GVMC budget but the corporation has not spent even Rs. 1 crore so far, he claimed. “Visakhapatnam is referred to as a ‘smart city’ and a ‘metro city’, but even basic facilities are lacking,” Mr. Tata Rao lamented. He said that JSP has decided to organise a digital campaign on bad roads on September 2, 3 and 4 involving party leaders and workers. They would take pictures of damaged roads in their respective wards and upload the photos and videos on Twitter using the hashtag #JSPForAP_Roads and send them to the JSP main office at Mangalagiri. They would be sent to the government by JSP chief Pawan Kalyan, he said. He said that if the government fails to respond in four weeks, the JSP workers would construct one road in each constituency through ‘shramdaan’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/road-maintenance-cess-used-to-fund-navaratnalu-alleges-jsp/article36241068.ece

At a meeting with district officials at the Zilla Parishad hall here on Wednesday, Mr. Achari said that the BC Commission was striving to ensure that the opportunities being provided to BCs in education and employment reached them. The National BC Commission, which comprises a Chairman, Vice-Chairman and three members, was appointed by the Centre two years ago. The Commission would take up issues pertaining to injustice to BCs in any part of the country, and ensure justice to them.

The Commission would initiate action if the rule of reservation was not implemented. He suggested that students who come to the RDO and Tahsildar offices for obtaining certificates should not be harassed. He directed the police officials not to harass BCs if they come to the police station to register complaints regarding injustice done to them. Mr. Achari asked officials to ensure that all welfare schemes being implemented by the Central and State governments should also reach the BCs. Construction of houses should be taken up under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and all eligible persons should be given the benefit. Those living in slums and footpaths should also be provided shelter, he said. He directed officials to ensure proper implementation of the ‘Smile’ scheme, introduced by the Centre, for the dependents of COVID-19 patients who had succumbed to the disease. He asked the BC Welfare Officer on the number of persons in the district who were benefited by the scheme. District Collector A. Mallikarjuna told the BC Commission member that the complaints of encroachment of lands, belonging to BCs, would be investigated and immediate action taken on them. BC Welfare Officer Rajeswari said that there were 53 pre-Matriculate Hostels for BCs and 6,250 students were residing in them. Of these, 40 hostels were in government buildings, 11 in private buildings and two were in ‘rent-free’ buildings.

Siva Kumar and general secretary K. Dhanunjay Patnaiak on Wednesday urged the State government to restore the old scheme as the CPS was detrimental to the interests of the employees who joined service after 2003. They said a meagre pension of Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,000 would not ensure social security to the employees. Members of the association took out a rally from the APSRTC Complex to the District Collectorate here, and organised a public meeting at the Youth Hostel seeking the scrapping of the CPS system. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to scrap the CPS system within one week of assuming power. But there has been no discussion over the issue even after the YSRCP government completed two years in office,” said Mr. Siva Kumar. “Hoping that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy would restore the old pension system, we had extended our support to him during his padayatra in the run-up to the elections. Now, he has completely forgotten the issue,” said Mr. Siva Kumar. Mr. Dhanunjaya Reddy urged the government to scrap G.Os. 653, 654 and 655, and restore the old pension system as per the 1980 - Pension Rules and Regualations. Association State Executive member Ganta Srinivasa Rao hoped that the government would find a solution to the issue without further confrontation. Earlier, MLC P.

As per the latest census records, 86% of the farmers were small and marginal while the average land holding was 1.12 hectares. The industrial sector contributed nearly 17% to the GSDP. Telangana’s industrial landscape had been a mix of high-tech sectors such as pharma, biotechnology and nanotechnology and traditional sectors such as textiles, leather, food processing and minerals.

02 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Sporadic COVID cases among schoolchildren but natural: DPH||Taken aback by the Telangana government’s decision to reopen schools and other educational institutions from Wednesday, scores of parents sought to know who will take responsibility if their children contract COVID-19 and end up in hospitals. When this question was posed to Director of Public Health G Srinivasa Rao, he said it would be “collective responsibility”. “Everyone has to follow COVID protocols. Nothing will happen until we follow them,” said Dr Srinivasa Rao. A section of parents said they would rather have their child skip a year of academics, but will not put their life at risk. At a press conference held at the State Health campus on Wednesday, the senior health official presented a number of cases among children, chances of fatality among them, and other reasons. “Even if children get COVID, chances of the infection turning serious and hospitalisation among them is low. Fatality among children is almost zero and recovery rate among them is high. The number of cases among children aged one to 10 years is 3% of the total, and it is 10% for the 10 to 20-year age group. So, the number of cases among children and adults up to 20 years in the first and second wave is just 13%,” Dr Srinivasa Rao explained. The State’s COVID caseload stands at 6,58,376 since March 2 last year. The population of the State is around four crore. Stating that there are around 50 lakh to 60 lakh children pursuing primary or secondary education, he said that the remaining 3.4 crore people have to be on the move to attend jobs, business, or other purposes. The DPH added that the movement of children is not restricted to home, and that they have been going out into their colonies. Vaccination plea Several parents opined that it would be better if children attend schools after they were vaccinated against COVID-19. Currently, only those above 18 years are eligible for the jab. The senior official said that a vaccine for those above 15 years might be available some time this month, and another one for children above two years in October. Before Telangana, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh reopened schools in mid-August. Citing regular detection of five or more cases among school students, Dr Srinivasa Rao said that sporadic cases are natural and that parents don’t have to worry about it. He reiterated that 95% of the teaching and non-teaching staff across the State were vaccinated. Heads of educational institutions were directed not to allow staff who are not immunised. Chances of the virus springead from the staff to children is, therefore, low and masks are compulsory, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sporadic-covid-cases-among-schoolchildren-but-natural-dph/article36240712.ece

02 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Domestic LPG refill to cost Rs. 25 more||Cooking gas prices were increased by Rs. 25 per cylinder on Wednesday, the second such hike in a little over fortnight that is bound to impact the already strained budget of households across the country. Besides that of the 14.2 kg domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) refills, price of commercial LPG cylinders used by tea stalls, roadside eateries and restaurants as well as industrial units has also gone up. Eating out is likely to thus cost more if food joints decide to pass on the hike to customers. Following the revision, households in Hyderabad have to pay Rs. 937 per refill as against Rs. 912 at which they were getting the cylinders since August 17. These are market determined prices or in other words, non-subsidised cylinder prices households pay at the time of taking delivery. There, however, is little to cheer for households eligible for subsidy as sources say the subsidy component – credited subsequently into customers’ bank accounts – has shrunk to the extent of being negligible over the past one and a half year. Usually revised on 1st of every month, LPG prices are determined based on global prices of propane and butane as well as foreign exchange rates. With LPG prices on the boil since last quarter of 2020, oil marketing companies Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation had increased LPG cylinder prices more than once a few months during this period. The last time the three companies, who command a lion’s share of the market, revised LPG prices was on August 17. The quantum of increase then too was Rs. 25 per 14.2 kg domestic cylinder. The latest increase is the seventh such upward revision this year. Price of a refill has gone up by Rs. 190 for households since January and by Rs. 290 since December. The only instance of a reduction this year was on April 1, when the refill price dropped Rs. 10. Consumers are unlikely to get respite in the months ahead as global LPG prices firm up ahead of winter. LPG consumption in the country increases with the festive season in September and remains relatively high till February by when winter is also on the wane. Commercial (19-kg) LPG cylinder price, which was reduced by Rs. 5 per refill last month, is Rs. 1,872 (Rs. 1,798) after the latest revision. The price is expected to increase in the months ahead, sources in the trade said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/domestic-lpg-refill-to-cost-rs-25-more/article36240719.ece
02 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KCR checkmates opponents with bureaucratic transfers||Ignore opponents’ criticism, bide time and hit back silently seems to be the strategy of TRS supremo and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, if the recent shuffle of some top bureaucrats is any indication. A few weeks ago TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy, speaking at a party protest, cautioned State Intelligence chief T. Prabhakar Rao that the Congress would not hesitate to act against him when it comes to power. Accusing the officer of harassing party workers by siding with TRS, he threatened to drag Mr. Rao to court. Three weeks later, however, the State government replaced him with Hyderabad Traffic Police chief Anil Kumar. Mr. Prabhakar Rao was shifted to SIB as its chief. Not just Revanth Reddy, even KCR’s former Cabinet colleague and now BJP leader Eatala Rajender accused Mr. Prabhakar Rao of making concerted efforts with TRS workers to defeat him in ensuing Huzurabad by-election. No one from the TRS responded to the charges against Mr. Prabhakar Rao. Just when many thought that Opposition leaders successfully cornered TRS, came the order transferring him. Mr. Prabhakar Rao was SIB IG when he retired in June, 2020 and given service extension of three years. Eventually, he was appointed as Intelligence chief to the surprise of many as rarely was an officer on extension made boss of Intelligence wing which is described as eyes and ears of the government. By shifting Rao to SIB, KCR gave little scope to critics to target his government on this point. Another grouse for KCR’s opponents, including police-officer-turned politician and Bahujan Samaj Party State president R.S. Praveen Kumar was that not a single dalit officer was given key postings in the Chief Minister’s Office. TRS leadership maintained silence while even opposition leaders upped their ante accusing KCR of ignoring dalit officers in top postings of police department or other wings. The criticism became vociferous when KCR unveiled the Dalit Bandhu scheme of providing Rs. 10 lakh assistance to dalit families in the State. The Chief Minister showed his political shrewdness once again by announcing from the dais during Dalit Bandhu scheme launch in Huzurabad that IAS officer Rahul Bojja was being appointed a Secretary in CMO, specifically mentioning that the latter is son of noted civil rights activist and dalit leader late Bojja Tarakam. By posting some dalit officers in top posts including police department in recent shuffling of bureaucrats, the TRS chief succeeded in silencing his critics, who now have to find new points to target him. And KCR would apparently bide his time and come back at his opponents more strongly. One has to wait and watch how many turns this would take till next Assembly elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-checkmates-opponents-with-bureaucratic-transfers/article36240742.ece

Around 40 villagers belonging to Sitarampuram and Pocharam villages were in the bus after attending a marriage ceremony in Kamepalli. An employee of a private school allegedly arranged the bus to ferry them from Kamepalli to Sitarampuram with the permission of the school management, sources said. The bus driver lost control of the vehicle after its steering wheel rod broke. The bus turned upside down and ploughed into the roadside agricultural field. Nearly 20 occupants suffered minor injuries and were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khammam. Sources said the private school bus has long been lying unused due to the prolonged closure of the school due to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/20-injured-in-bus-mishap/article36241024.ece
02 September 2021||KHAMMAM/ BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TELANGANA||Govt. schools in Khammam see 35% turnout||As many as 1,258 government/local body schools reopened for regular classes with just 35% students turning up to attend the classes in Khammam district on Wednesday. Around 300 private schools recorded a low attendance of 10% in the district, sources in the school education department said. The main reason attributed to the low turnout is lack of proper transportation arrangements to ferry students to private schools due to non-operation of buses/vans for a prolonged period owing to the pandemic, leaving most vehicles in unused condition. All government residential schools, social welfare and tribal welfare schools with hostel facilities remained closed. Sources attributed the poor attendance to multiple factors like intermittent spells of rain, continued closure of hostels and initial hesitancy to send their wards to schools apparently over fears of a possible third wave of pandemic. Collector V.P. Gautham, during a surprise inspection, asked the mandal educational officer to seek explanation from a teacher of the MPP school at Lakshmipuram for reportedly proceeding on leave on the first day of school reopening, and submit a report immediately. In Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, a total of 1,064 government/local body schools and 198 private schools were reopened. The State-run schools recorded 31% attendance and the private schools witnessed a thin attendance of around 22%, sources said. However, some State-run schools in Agency mandals witnessed good student turnout owing to a vigorous campaign by teachers and mandal-level officials to motivate students to attend classes in schools to bridge the prolonged learning gap. According to sources, the mandal parishad primary school at Jagya Tanda in Gundala mandal recorded 100% attendance with all 34 enrolled students turning up on Wednesday. Collector D. Anudeep inspected the Zilla Parishad High School in the mandal headquarters town of Sujathanagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-schools-in-khammam-see-35-turnout/article36241022.ece
02 September 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Schools in Nalgonda reopen on a celebratory note||After the longest school shutdown of nearly 18 months, owing to COVID-19 pandemic, schools in Nalgonda were kept ready following all preventive measures to welcome back students on Wednesday. While approach to a few schools was not easy in the wake of rains and logged entrances, many other schools displayed a celebratory welcome to students. Teachers were seen offering flowers to students and some aimed the thermal gun scanners. Much like a festival, classroom entrances were decorated with thoranam made of mango leaves. The Telangana High Court directions making it clear that parents should not be compelled to send their wards to schools had an indicative effect, official figures showed. Government schools and colleges in Suryapet and Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri districts showed a first-day fair figure of attendance at 28% average. The respective attendance figures of private institutions were 12% and 8%. In Nalgonda, about 22% students were present in State-run schools and the college figure was about 30%. In contrast, those who attended private institutes was around 15%. Commissioner and Director of School Education A. Sridevasena inspected various schools and colleges in the district and interacted with students, on the first day of reopening of the institutes on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/schools-in-nalgonda-reopen-on-a-celebratory-note/article36241019.ece

The couple was on the way to their residence at Vanasthalipuram, when at around 11 p.m., their SUV rammed a heavy vehicle. Both Kavitha and Reddy died on the spot. According to information reaching here, the couple was in Nalgonda last week to complete their daughter’s post-wedding rituals. On Tuesday, they left the town at around 8.30 p.m., to reach their Hyderabad residence. The accident took place after exiting NH-65 (Hyderabad-Vijayawada) while just crossing the Nehru Outer Ring Road overpass near Pedda Amberpet in city limits. Hayatnagar police said the SUV was at a high speed when it rammed the rear side of a slow-moving tipper truck on the curve. It is understood that the heavy vehicle’s driver, the police added, did not display sufficient indication, and the truck rear also lacked significant reflectors for vehicles coming behind. Bodies of the victims were shifted to the Osmania General Hospital.

We request parents to send their wards to school and we assure thermal screening as well as compliance with social distancing. Even break hours are at different timings so that there would not be any large gathering at any point,” said Karunakar Reddy, principal of St. Anthony High School. “We are feeling insecure and tense. There was word about a third wave this month or the next. At the same time, we can not allow our wards to sit at home for years. We are taking a risk.

02 September 2021||GURUGRAM,||‘Boost Counter Magnet Areas to control migration’||The draft Regional Plan-2041 for the National Capital Region has put special emphasis on strengthening of the economic base of the Counter Magnet Areas (CMAs), the urban areas located sufficiently away from the NCR with significant economic growth, to intercept the flow of migration to the national capital and its neighbouring areas. However, the report said that the State governments concerned had taken “little” initiative for strengthening the economic base and regional linkages in these areas to enable them to undertake their assigned roles. The report said the State governments were keener on adding more areas to the NCR rather than focus on the development of the CMAs. Nine CMAs The nine CMAs to the NCR spread across six States are: Hisar and Ambala (Haryana), Kanpur-Lucknow corridor and Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh), Jaipur and Kota (Rajasthan), Patiala-Rajpura corridor (Punjab), Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh) and Dehradun (Uttrakhand). Population growth The report identifies large size and continuing growth of the population in the NCR adding to the burden on infrastructure and natural resources as a major challenge, adding that migration was one of the major contributors to it. The total population of the NCR is projected to be around 11.30 crore by 2041, with Uttar Pradesh sub-region contributing the maximum 3.75 crore, followed by Haryana 3.34 crore, NCT-Delhi 3.08 crore and Rajasthan 1.12 crore. Also, the NCT-Delhi is expected to be 100% urban by 2031. The NCRPB in its 31st meeting on 11 November 2009, had decided that CMAs would not limit to urban areas only and development could be proposed in the form of corridors. It was also decided that these Counter Magnet Areas shall consider its zone of influence for migration as the area within about 120 km radius around them. Also, the State governments concerned were to notify their respective CMAs and prepare development plans and related plans of action for implementation. Plans of action But the draft report pointed out that the plans of action were prepared only for Jaipur and Kota. Out of the nine CMAs, only five CMAs have submitted a total of 14 projects to the NCR planning board for financial assistance. The report suggested that various Ministries should prioritise the CMAs in “improving transport linkages by providing high-speed connectivity through expressways, national highways, rapid rail transport systems, airports, and by creating robust digital infrastructure as a tool for socio-economic development”. The State governments concerned should develop the CMAs as model industrial estates, technology parks, tourist hubs or nodes (e.g. Jaipur, Patiala, Gwalior), education or coaching hub (e.g. Kota), special economic zones for attracting economic investments, said the draft plan. The NCRPB, in its report, said it could also financially support the joint development projects prepared by the State governments and the development authorities concerned for these CMAs through its prevailing funding pattern.

02 September 2021||New Delhi,||Families of COVID-19 victims still awaiting relief||Hundreds of people, whose family members died due to COVID-19, are yet to be given a compensation of Rs. 50,000 each, despite their requests being verified and approved, multiple officials told The Hindu . They have not got the compensation as the Delhi government is yet to release funds for it, as per officials. Also, the government is yet to start distributing a monthly assistance of Rs. 2,500 each to specific categories of people, who have lost their family members to COVID-19, and it is in “various stages of verification”, according to officials. Scheme for children The beneficiaries of both the assistance include children who have been orphaned due to COVID-19 and others. On May 18, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had promised that every child who has lost both parents due to COVID-19 will be given Rs. 2,500 per month till the age of 25 and will be provided free education. “There was a meeting of senior officials last week on the compensation of Rs. 50,000 and work is being done on a war footing. Since it is a new scheme, funds have to be allotted under a new head by the Finance Department. It will be done in the next couple of days,” a Delhi government official said. The official said that there is no “fund crunch” for the scheme and it is “under process”. But some people have got the compensation as district officials have paid them from the “relief fund” that all 11 districts have been getting from the government since the outbreak of the pandemic to meet all COVID-19 related expenses. Volunteers not paid This fund is also used to pay expenses, including salary to civil defence volunteers (CDVs), who help the government with various COVID-19 work, including activities in containment zones. But salaries of volunteers have not been paid for July in many districts and in some cases June also, as there is a “fund crunch” with this relief fund, several officials said. “We have paid the CDVs till June, but only some of them have been paid in July,” a district official said. Also, many labs, which do COVID-19 tests for the government, are not paid since April. “Districts have to submit utilisation certificates for money released by the department to pay labs and it is pending in many districts. So, many labs have not been paid in the current financial year,” a health department official said. Despite multiple attempts, a Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to queries. After the May 18 statement, on July 6, Mr. Kejriwal announced ‘Mukhyamantri COVID-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojna’, under which Rs. 50,000 will be given as a one-time compensation to all families who lost someone to COVID-19. Additionally, children who were orphaned because of COVID-19, will get Rs. 2,500 every month, till they turn 25 years old, under the scheme, he said. An mount of Rs. 2,500 per month is also to be paid to other categories, as per the scheme. ‘No money’ In several districts, more than 100 requests each, for the one-time payment of Rs. 50,000 have been approved after verification, but the beneficiaries are yet to be paid, said officials.  “We don’t have money under the relief fund to pay even salaries of CDVs, then how will we pay the compensation? Whenever we get a request from a child who has lost parents, we try to prioritise it,” a district official said.  There are 6,200 children who are left with a single parent and 292 left orphaned as on August 16 due to COVID-19, as per a status report filed by the Delhi government to the High Court. On August 23, the High Court had said that it “would be unfair to expect children who lost their parents to be able to procure documents and avail benefits” and directed the government to fix issues in the process to get compensation. The HC had also noted that the government should take a proactive approach rather than taking the applications in a routine way. The High Court made the observation, after an NGO moved court that even though numerous schemes were framed after April this year, nothing much has moved on the ground.  There was a meeting of senior officials last week and work is being done on a war footing. Since it is a new scheme, funds have to be allotted under a new head by the Finance Dept.

02 September 2021||New Delhi,||Speeches by Sharjeel was for particular community: police||Delhi Police on Wednesday said Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam began one of his alleged inflammatory speeches with As-salamu alaykum salutation, which shows it was addressed to a particular community and not the public at large.  Sedition case Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad, representing the police, made the remarks during the argument in a sedition case filed against Mr. Imam for speeches made by him at two universities in 2019, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the northeast from India. During the hearing, Mr. Prasad apprised Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that Mr. Imam attempted to create complete anarchy and gave divisive speeches during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.  “The people called upon to take action were also from one community. The speech was definitely divisive. It was not made for the general public at large but a specific community. He is attempting to create complete anarchy,” Mr. Prasad added.  At two universities The alleged inflammatory speeches were made by Mr. Imam at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019. He has been in judicial custody since January 2020. Mr. Prasad emphasised that Mr. Imam is not a simple pickpocket or small-time drug peddler but a man with excellent oratory skills, who has written a thesis on rioting and has knowledge of how a critical mass can come together. Mr. Imam is accused of offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and has also been charged under IPC Sections for sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief. The police had filed a chargesheet against Mr. Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Centre and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/speeches-by-sharjeel-was-for-particular-community-police/article36240545.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Man bludgeoned to death over remark on cooking, 1 held||A 48-year-old man was bludgeoned to death and his face was found smashed in a field in North Delhi’s Burari on Tuesday morning. The police have arrested his friend in connection with the murder. A senior police officer said that the victim has been identified as Dahu Singh, a daily wage labourer hailing from Bihar and the accused has been identified as Ramesh Yadav, 22, from Uttar Pradesh. The police received a call on Tuesday morning wherein the caller stated that he had found a body during morning walk. The police found a body with his face unrecognisable as it had been smashed with stones. “However, there was a tattoo on his arm with his name written on it which helped in his identification,” the officer said. Further probe revealed that on Monday night, the victim was with two persons Ashish and Ramesh. During investigation, it was revealed that Ramesh, Dahu and Ashish were drinking in the fields and a while later, Ashish left the place. Ramesh was picked up for questioning. During sustained interrogation, it was revealed that both, the victim and the accused, were drunk at the time of the incident and following a quarrel, Ramesh first thrashed Dahu and then bludgeoned his face with a stone to ensure he isn’t recognised. Preparing a treat Sources said that Ramesh was working in a factory wherein he earned Rs. 10,000 a month and Dahu used to earn on a daily basis. Ramesh had promised Dahu to get him a full-time job like himself. “Dahu bought alcohol and meat to treat the other two. When he was cooking, Ramesh commented that it’s not the right way to cook which Dahu didn’t like and abused Ramesh. The accused in turn slapped Dahu and told him not to abuse. The matter escalated and Ramesh thrashed and bludgeoned Dahu to death,” the officer said. The accused then dragged and dumped Dahu’s body in the fields before fleeing the spot, the police said. In another murder reported from Sarai Rohilla, a 25-year-old man identified as Sunil was stabbed to death and his brother Ravi is undergoing treatment after the two were attacked on Monday night. The police said that a fight ensued between an autorickshaw driver and a vegetable van driver when two locals identified as Anil and Rahul intervened to stop the fight. However, the van driver and his accomplices attacked Anil and Rahul after which friends of both parties came to their rescue respectively. Anil and Rahul were joined by victims Sunil and Ravi and van driver Amar Singh (48) was joined by his sons and Raj Kumar (53). One of Singh’s sons brought the knife and stabbed the brothers Sunil and Ravi.  When Dahu was cooking, Ramesh commented that it’s not the right way to cook which the former didn’t like and abused Ramesh Police officer||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/man-bludgeoned-to-death-over-remark-on-cooking-1-held/article36240542.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Auto driver held for raping minor||A 32-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping a minor in east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar. His accomplice has been held for robbing her mobile phone. The police said that the incident happened on August 27 when the victim and her boyfriend — who had eloped from Bihar’s Champaran — came to New Delhi Railway Station and met the accused.

Justice Rekha Palli asked the Centre, the Delhi government and the police to coordinate and work out a solution so that the gathering does not act as a superspreader of COVID-19. “We are also dealing with COVID-19. Look at the pictures. You should ensure some protocol is there. Why are they not wearing masks?” the court remarked. “It is not the inconvenience only with which I am concerned. I am more concerned that it should not act as a superspreader of COVID-19 again. The city has barely coped with the second wave. You have to ensure that the protesters follow the protocols. Let them wear masks and then protest,” it said. The court’s observation came while hearing a petition which stated that the foreign nationals (refugees/ asylum seekers) have gathered outside the office of the UNHCR at B Block in Vasant Vihar since August 15, and the residents were facing difficulties due to this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/covid-19-concerns-over-stir-at-unhcr-office/article36240548.ece

02 September 2021||Pune,||8 more govt. medical colleges via PPP route||In a bid to ramp up Maharashtra’s health infrastructure, State Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh on Wednesday informed that the State Cabinet had approved a scheme under a public-private partnership policy to establish eight more government medical colleges and intensive care hospitals in the State. Currently, there are 18 government medical colleges and hospitals functioning in the State while eight more are in the pipeline. “The move will greatly shore up the infrastructure in those areas where government medical colleges are absent. This deficit, which has been brought to the fore by the pandemic, will now be rectified,” Mr. Deshmukh said. He said that the project to open new medical colleges would also ensure that vacancies in the medical field would be filled. ‘Provide quality services’ “The main objective of all the upcoming medical colleges, which would be equipped with all modern facilities, is to provide quality education and medical services to the people expeditiously,” said Mr. Deshmukh. He also said that while it was not possible to say with any certainty when or if a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic would strike, preparations to manage a medical crisis were in full swing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/8-more-govt-medical-colleges-via-ppp-route/article36240610.ece
02 September 2021||Washington,||‘Era of wars to remake countries is over’||A day after the last batch of American soldiers left Afghan soil, U.S. President Joe Biden defended his decision to go through with the withdrawal, which culminated in violent chaos focused around Kabul’s airport, with Afghans scrambling to escape the tightening grip of the incipient Taliban regime and terrorists using the opportunity to strike. In a televised address from the White House, Mr. Biden said an era of American interventions to “remake other countries” was ending. “Imagine if we had begun evacuations in June or July, bringing in thousands of American troops and evacuating more than 120,000 people in the middle of a civil war. There still would have been a rush to the airport, a breakdown in confidence and control of the government...” Mr. Biden said. While taking responsibility for the decision to withdraw troops, Mr. Biden said his predecessor, Donald Trump, had signed a deal with the Taliban that did not require the outfit to work with the government in Kabul and included the release of 5,000 prisoners. By the time he took office, the Taliban were at their strongest since 2001 and he was left with two choices — follow the agreement or send thousands of more troops in, Mr. Biden said. “To those asking for a third decade of war in Afghanistan, I ask: What is the vital national interest? In my view, we only have one: to make sure Afghanistan can never be used again to launch an attack on our homeland,” he said, adding, that al-Qaeda was “decimated” and Osama bin Laden had been brought to justice. With competition and challenges from China and Russia, Mr. Biden said his duty was to defend America against the threats of 2021 and the future, not the threats of 2001. “And there’s nothing China or Russia would rather have, would want more in this competition than the United States to be bogged down another decade in Afghanistan,” he said, adding that the country had to turn the page on two decades of foreign policy. ‘Extraordinary success’ “First, we must set missions with clear, achievable goals — not ones we’ll never reach. And second, we must stay clearly focused on the fundamental national security interest of the United States of America. This decision about Afghanistan is not just about Afghanistan. It’s about ending an era of major military operations to remake other countries,” he said. Praising America’s military and diplomatic personnel, and expressing gratitude to the family of killed soldiers for a “debt we can never repay,” Mr. Biden said the mission had evacuated more than 120,000 individuals and was an “extraordinary success”. He said he had decided to withdraw troops by August 31 based on an assumption that the “more than 300,000” Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), trained by the U.S. over the past 20 years, would be a “strong adversary” against the Taliban. “That assumption….turned out not to be accurate,” Mr. Biden said, adding that he had prepared for the eventuality that the ANSF would not fight beyond the U.S. withdrawal, authorizing 6,000 troops — most of whom were flown back in at short notice — to secure Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA) . Both Republicans and Democrats have criticised Mr. Biden for the manner in which the exit occurred. Less than 40% of Americans approve of how the exit was handled, with 49% saying U.S. troops should stay in Afghanistan until all Americans and Afghan allies are evacuated, as per the results of a pre-withdrawal survey conducted by Reuters/Ipsos poll (results of which were released on Monday). With many vulnerable Afghans, citizens from third countries and up to 200 Americans still left in the country, Mr. Biden said on Tuesday the administration had reached out 19 times to Americans in Afghanistan since March, with offers of help them evacuate. “Secretary of State [Antony] Blinken is leading the continued diplomatic efforts to ensure a safe passage for any American, Afghan partner, or foreign national who wants to leave Afghanistan,” he said, adding that he would not take the Taliban at their word but by assess their actions as regards their stated commitment to safe passage for these individuals. “…We have leverage to make sure these commitments are met,” he said. He said the U.S. had the ability to strike terrorists without boots on the ground (‘over the ground capabilities’) and warned the ISIS-K, the group that claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 170 civilians in addition to some U.S. troops. “And to ISIS-K: We are not done with you yet,” he said. In Tuesday’s speech, Mr. Biden said the U.S. would continue to support and speak out for Afghanistan’s people, particularly its women and girls, including via regional diplomacy and engagement, but was firm that the $2.3 trillion military operation (a Brown University estimate that includes debt servicing costs) had to come to an end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/era-of-wars-to-remake-countries-is-over/article36240005.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||What did America achieve in Afghanistan in 20 years?||For the first time since October 2001, there are no American troops in Afghanistan. While defending his decision to pull back the forces, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he was left with only two options after the withdrawal agreement the Trump administration signed with the Taliban in February 2020 — either honour the deal or renege on it and send in more troops to continue the war. “I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” he said. So the forever war has come to an end. What did the U.S. gain from it? Mr. Biden said on Tuesday the U.S. invaded Afghanistan not because it was ruled by the Taliban but because the September 11 attacks originated from Afghanistan. In early July, he said “America didn’t go to Afghanistan to nation-build”. America’s primary objectives were to disrupt al-Qaeda and capture or kill Osama bin Laden. The argument is that the Taliban were not America’s main enemy and defeating them was not its primary objective. While it’s true that America went to Afghanistan because the 9/11 attacks originated from that country, Mr. Biden’s assessment of the Taliban was not shared by his predecessors, as their actions suggest. The Taliban had offered to surrender on modest terms in December 2001, but President George W. Bush rejected the offer. America did not pull back from Afghanistan after the Taliban regime fell. America did not withdraw after bin Laden was killed in 2011 either. The U.S. stayed in Afghanistan, propping up the Islamic Republic because American leaders were of the view that a return of the Taliban to power would derail the global war on terror. While it’s still debatable whether the Taliban have changed over the past 20 years, American foreign policy thinking has clearly changed during this period. If the U.S. saw the Taliban, which hosted al-Qaeda, as part of the problem in 2001 and removing them from power as a key goal of the war on terror, in 2021, it extricated a victorious Taliban from the war on terror. The Taliban are now a problem of the Afghans, not of Americans, according to the Biden doctrine. War on terror When the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, it was touted as the first step in what Mr. Bush called a global war on terrorism. Where does that war stand now? In 2001, al-Qaeda was largely concentrated in Afghanistan. The U.S. invasion and the fall of the Taliban led to al-Qaeda’s disintegration. The terrorist outfit was driven underground, but was not defeated. Over the years, new branches of al-Qaeda sprang up in different parts of the world. Of them, the deadliest was al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Jordan-born terrorist was killed in a U.S. strike in 2006, but the AQI transformed into the Islamic State of Iraq, which later became the dreaded Islamic State (IS) that declared a Caliphate and established a proto-state across Iraq and Syria in 2014. Modest gains The IS’s physical infrastructure was destroyed by both coordinated and separate war efforts by a group of powers, including the U.S., Iran, Iraq, Kurdish and Shia militias, Syria and Russia. But the rump of the outfit continues to operate in parts of Syria and Iraq. The IS has also established provinces in other parts of the world, including the IS West Africa Province (ISWAP) and the IS Khorasan Province (ISKP) that claimed responsibility for the August 26 Kabul blasts in which about 200 people were killed, including 13 Americans. Al-Qaeda has also established a strong presence in Africa, particularly in the Sahel region, where they have carried out dozens of attacks in recent years, killing hundreds. So if al-Qaeda was an organised terrorist machinery concentrated in Afghanistan in 2001, it’s now a decentralised amalgam that has metastasised across the world. The U.S. can take credit for disrupting al-Qaeda’s networks in Afghanistan — which it thinks has neutralised the terrorists’ capability to strike the American mainland — and for killing bin Laden. But the question American policymakers and public faces is whether it was required to stay 20 years in Afghanistan, spend over $2 trillion and lose over 2,300 soldiers to meet these modest objectives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/what-did-america-achieve-in-afghanistan-in-20-years/article36240008.ece
02 September 2021||Colombo,||To contain food prices, Sri Lanka declares economic emergency||Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has declared an economic emergency to contain soaring inflation after a steep fall in the value of the country’s currency caused a spike in food prices. President Rajapaksa on Tuesday declared the state of emergency under the public security ordinance to prevent the hoarding of essential items, including rice and sugar. The emergency came into effect from midnight on Tuesday. “The President has promulgated emergency regulations under the Public Security Ordinance on the supply of essential goods,” presidential spokesman Kingsley Ratnayake told reporters.  Power to military The government has appointed a former General as commissioner of essential services, who will have the power to seize food stocks held by traders and retailers and regulate their prices. The military will oversee the action which gives power to officials to ensure that essential items, including rice and sugar, are sold at government-guaranteed prices or prices based on import costs at customs and prevent hiding of stocks, Mr. Ratnayake said. The emergency move followed sharp price rises for sugar, rice, onions and potatoes, while long queues have formed outside stores because of shortages of milk powder, kerosene oil and cooking gas. The wide-ranging measure is also aimed at recovering credit owed to state banks by importers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-declares-economic-emergency-to-contain-food-prices/article36240004.ece

The broadly worded law seeks to tighten the leash on China’s tech giants and what they do with information from their hundreds of millions of users. It also comes as fears grow over data security with government departments becoming increasingly dependent on cloud storage services. Broad scope Beijing has also flagged national security concerns as justification for the law. As Chinese tech firms look to branch out overseas, authorities fear domestic data will end up in foreign hands. The law lays down the responsibilities of all companies and organisations handling data. It stipulates fines of up to 10 million yuan ($1.55 million) for a range of offences, including leaks and failing to verify the identity of buyers or sellers of information. Its scope is broad, and includes data stored and handled within China’s borders as well as data abroad that could harm China’s national security or the rights of its citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/beijing-rolls-out-new-data-law/article36240006.ece
02 September 2021||Panjshir Valley,||In Panjshir, anti-Taliban forces repulse attacks||The Taliban on Wednesday called on fighters in the holdout bastion of the Panjshir Valley to lay down their arms, as the resistance movement said it had repulsed heavy attacks. The rugged mountain valley with towering snow-capped peaks — which begins around 80 kilometres north of the capital Kabul — is the centre of Afghanistan’s most important pocket of armed anti-Taliban forces. The National Resistance Front (NRF), comprising anti-Taliban militia fighters and former Afghan security forces, have vowed to defend the enclave as the Islamist group sends fighters to encircle the area. “My brothers, we tried our best to solve the Panjshir problem with talks and negotiations... but unfortunately all in vain,” senior Taliban official Amir Khan Muttaqi said, in an audio message to the people of the Panjshir posted on Twitter. “Now that the talks have failed and Mujahiddin (Taliban) have surrounded Panjshir, there are still people inside that don’t want the problems to be solved peacefully,” he added. “Now it is up to you to talk to them,” the Taliban message to the Panjshir people said. “Those who want to fight, tell them it is enough.” Bismillah Mohammadi, Afghanistan’s Defence Minister before the government fell last month, said the Taliban had launched a renewed assault on Panjshir on Tuesday night. “Last night the Taliban terrorists attacked Panjshir, but were defeated,” Mr. Mohammadi tweeted on Wednesday, claiming that 34 Taliban were killed and 65 wounded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/in-panjshir-anti-taliban-forces-repulse-attacks/article36240003.ece

In a report on the state of social protection globally, the UN’s International Labour Organization said that 4.1 billion people were living without any social safety net of any kind. Social protection includes access to health care and income security measures related especially to old age, unemployment, sickness, disability, work injury, maternity or the loss of the main breadwinner in a family, as well as extra support for families with children. In 2020, only 46.9% of the global population benefitted from at least one such protection, according to the report — ILOs first on the subject since 2017. That low rate came even as access to healthcare, sickness and unemployment benefits have more than ever proved their relevance during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/over-4-bn-dont-have-social-protection-un/article36240002.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The prognosis for school reopenings||Schools began opening in a phased manner across several Indian States on September 1. These include the States of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Schools for senior students have already been open for the past few weeks in a few States. Debates around when to open schools in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic have been divisive, and not just in India. These have focused on the balance between minimising the risk of disease for children and their family members, and maximising in-person schooling. The arguments have largely reflected the biases of those with strongly held points of view on both sides. Mathematical models With schools opening across India, will we observe an increase in cases in school children? Could this lead to another peak in overall cases as children bring infections back home? We addressed these questions using a mathematical model, presenting our findings (the meeting was in-camera) to an expert group of the World Health Organization this week. How did our model address this question? Our model describes schools embedded within communities, that comprised families of different sizes. If schools are open, children move between their homes and schools. Children stay at home if schools are closed. Adults go to work at assigned workplaces or stay at home. The distribution of ages in the community is based on the age structure of the population in a typical mid-sized Indian city. We describe the spread of COVID-19 from person to person, accounting for reductions in this rate from non-pharmaceutical interventions including masking. We account for a level of prior infection in the community, as measured by serological surveys that look for antibodies for COVID-19. Our model accounts for the possibilities of asymptomatic, mild and severe disease, as well as hospitalisations and deaths. These vary across different age groups. We allow two doses of vaccinations, separated by 90 days, as well as the possibility of breakthrough infections, where the immunity granted by vaccines is breached. We incorporate what is currently known about the protection provided by vaccines against mild and severe disease. Our model reflects the current state of the epidemic in India at the moment. We start with children at home and then study how cases spread in children and in adults when schools open. Findings of the model Based on our model, an increase in cases in children is expected as schools are opened, relative to keeping them closed. However, this does not lead to a new wave under the current epidemic conditions in India. Specifically, in regions with the levels of seroprevalence expected across much of north India, we expect this increase in cases to be marginal. Children are at lower risk of severe disease associated with COVID-19 — very few of these infections are likely to lead to complications. We can further restrict any increase in infections among children by ramping up immunisation in older age groups and by continuing non-pharmaceutical interventions, including requiring face masks, improving ventilation, shifting more activities to outdoor venues, and increasing the number of students attending school slowly over a period of several weeks. Such interventions should be continued until we achieve an overall seroprevalence of 75%-80%, adding numbers from recent infections and from vaccinations. Beyond this point, we find that these measures make little difference. We found that opening schools was not likely to contribute to an increase in cases among older individuals. A typical Indian community considering whether to open schools should be on the downswing of the pandemic or past it in terms of having sufficient numbers of those who are — at least for the time being — relatively immune to the disease since they have been recently infected. Roughly speaking, this corresponds to about 45% seropositivity to begin, in the absence of vaccinations. Adding vaccinations on top of that cushions any sharp rise in cases, especially if combined with COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions. Interpreting the results Much of India has encountered COVID-19, particularly the Delta variant. Some have been reinfected by it. Seropositivity levels in children are comparable to those in adults — keeping children at home has not served the purpose of keeping them from becoming infected. This is a point whose importance has been insufficiently stressed: if children are as likely to pick up an infection from the community while staying at home, there is little reason to keep them out of school. More than 60% of the vulnerable population have been given one dose of vaccine; in some cases, two doses. There is a case for prioritising the vaccination of family members, especially elderly ones, of school-going children as well as of teachers and other school staff. We see the advantages of this in our model simulations. We stress that a rise in cases could occur once schools are opened. Indeed, children who show symptoms after testing positive should be screened for potentially more severe versions of the disease. However, the number of severe cases in children is very small since children are better protected against disease than adults. With COVID-19 and schools, the trade-off is between the long-term consequences of disruptions in learning and socialisation in children and the short-term possibility of their contracting an infection. Finding the right balance between these two factors is crucial. Given the state of the Indian epidemic as well as the likely possibility that COVID-19 will transition into endemicity, there seems to be little reason to continue to have schools closed. This should be true especially in States and communities where seropositivity is in excess of 80%. State-specific approach For low seropositivity States such as Kerala and Maharashtra, a better understanding of the current fraction of the population that has antibodies, either from prior infection or from vaccination, would help. Once this crosses the 80% level, we see no reason why they should not also reopen. It remains important to continue studying the spread of COVID-19 over the next six months to understand how quickly immunity due to prior infection wanes over time. Actions called for Our simulations do not include testing and tracing, although this is one way of keeping any increase in cases in check; nor does it include the possibility of new variants. The possibility of random testing of schoolchildren at regular intervals has been raised. We favour, instead, local decisions to close schools if test positivity in the community exceeds a preset bound, since children seem to be acquiring the infection in their communities at the same rate at which adults acquire them. While models are imperfect guides to the future, especially because they must make assumptions about human and virus behaviour, they often provide useful intuition. Comparisons to other countries are not particularly helpful, since each country’s situation with respect to the disease is different. The recent uptick in vaccination numbers is encouraging and should hopefully be sustained in the coming weeks. This will help in ensuring that children can return to school. For this, we need not wait until vaccines for children are available.

02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||India must commit to net zero emissions||India is at the risk of being cast globally as an outlier on climate action, with a negative fallout. With over 50% of the global economy already committed to net zero emissions by 2050 — and China committing to be so before 2060 — this is not where you want to be. The pace and scale of climate action is only set to increase, with the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report unequivocal on the need for urgent and stronger responses. Events around the world underline the point — towns washed away in Germany, subways turned into storm water drains in China, forests fried in the United States and so many more lives lost to flooding in India. Massive opportunities It is not only governments that are increasing climate action. The business world is too, not just to protect themselves against the risks of climate change but also to take advantage of the massive opportunities arising as the global economy shifts to net zero emissions. Last year, investors injected over $500 billion into climate transition. In my country, Australia, the number of major companies that have put in place a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 has more than trebled in the past year. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November in Glasgow is shaping up to be the most important climate meeting since the Paris Agreement in 2015. It is squarely focused on supercharging global ambition and action on climate change, as all countries, including India, agreed to do in the historic Paris Agreement. Over 100 countries have already committed to net zero emissions by 2050, with more expected at COP26. Two key holdouts are India and Australia. In the case of my country, under mounting pressure at home and internationally, the government is moving toward such an announcement and I am confident they will do so by or at COP26. I am not so confident about India. From what I hear through networks from my time as the Australian High Commissioner to India and as Australia’s Ambassador for the Environment, India is resolutely not committing to net zero by 2050, including on the basis that as a developing country, it needs to see significant support from developed countries for climate action as part of making any such commitment. Perhaps this is negotiating tactics. Either way, I fear India may shoot itself in the foot by resisting net zero by 2050. First, India itself has a national interest in ambitious global and national climate action. Like Australia, it is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change and, therefore, should be among the more active against the threats. India faces harmful impacts related to sea level rise, heat stress, drought, water stress and flooding, biodiversity and natural disasters. Climate change is not coming — it is here. Second, as a rising power, India naturally seeks stronger influence globally. Being an outlier on the global challenge facing our generation does not support this aim. India is already the third largest emitter in the world, and is set to be the largest as the United States, China, and the European Union are all now signed up to net zero. This will become a significant drag on India’s international diplomacy. This applies not just to key relationships like with the U.S., where President Joe Biden’s administration is mainstreaming climate action into its economic, foreign and security policy, but also with much of the Group of 77 (G77) states, who are increasingly concerned to see climate action, and in multilateral groupings such as the United Nations and ASEAN-APEC. No longer a trade-off Finally, as the famous phrase goes, “it’s the economy, stupid”. There is no longer a trade-off between reducing emissions and economic growth. Solar energy costs have fallen 90% in recent years, providing the cheapest electricity in India ever seen. Also, given the negative impacts, addressing climate change in India’s economic development is now central to success, not an added luxury to consider. For example, agricultural policy that does not consider adaptive approaches to maximise productivity in the face of increased flooding and drought due to climate change is derelict. The transition of the global economy to net zero emissions is the biggest commercial opportunity in history. In just the energy sector alone, an estimated $1.6 to $3.8 trillion of investment is required every year until 2050. China gets this, which is why it is investing heavily in gaining an advantage in the technologies of the new economy, be it renewable energy and storage, electric and hydrogen transport, low emissions industry, green cities or sustainable agriculture. It is not as if India is at a standing start. It is set to significantly exceed its Paris Agreement commitment of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35% below 2005 levels by 2030, providing ready room for higher ambition. India is impressing the world with its leading roll-out of renewable energy and target for 450GW by 2030, linked to its leadership on the International Solar Alliance and recent national hydrogen strategy. Indian corporates are also stepping up, with the Tata Group winning awards on sustainability, Mahindra committing to net zero by 2040 and Reliance by 2035. There is plenty on which to build. And India should not be expected to build alone. India’s national interests on climate action are now engaged in ways that go significantly beyond waiting for donor support to drive ambition, notwithstanding reasonable arguments about historical responsibility, per capita emissions and equity. With growing wealth and stature, India is increasingly disinclined toward handouts. But that does not mean well-targeted donor investments and international partnerships should not be a factor in raising India’s climate ambition. This could come in many guises, from stronger political engagement and dialogue to policy support in areas of mutual challenge such as energy policy, carbon markets and post-COVID green economic recovery. Practical support and cooperation in areas like rolling out renewable energy and integrating it with the national grid, zero emissions transport, decarbonising hard to abate sectors like steel, cement and chemicals and decarbonising agriculture offer significant scope to raise ambition. As does working with India on innovative green financing for decarbonising investments, including using donor support to mobilise private sector finance, green bonds and climate transition funds. Whichever it is, they need to be lasting partnerships that deliver results. Yet, in the end, India’s tryst with destiny rests in its own remarkable hands, as it always has been. In a land where the earth is called mother, and Mahatma Gandhi, major religions and the Constitution enshrine environmental care, commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 should almost be foretold. The world hopes we will see it soon. Patrick Suckling was Australia’s High Commissioner to India and Ambassador for the Environment.

02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Where liberalism and nationalism are placed in Asia||Liberalism and nationalism mean different things to different people, and the two concepts are often considered mutually exclusive. Over 70 years after Indian independence, it is worth recalling that the British claimed that their empire rested on liberal foundations and the transfer of power to nationalists evidenced this claim. But liberalism often clashed with anti-colonial nationalism; the greatest material support to anti-colonial movements during the Cold War came from the illiberal Soviet Union. A ‘cause’ of war After the rise of the nation state, wars were attributed to the power and expansionist policies of nations. In Europe, nations were in almost constant conflict, and Japanese nationalism led to wars, particularly with China. In the early period of the last century, nationalism was regarded as the root cause of war, but this was an oversimplification, since many, especially Marxists, would argue that capitalism, which led to colonialism, was equally if not mainly responsible. In Europe, as the national idea spread, it became ethnic-oriented and increasingly illiberal, with an exception being Giuseppe Mazzini’s nationalist activism. The early decades Before Indian independence, nationalism was regarded with suspicion; Rabindranath Tagore had considered it a malign ideology, making a subtle distinction between the Nation of the West, which he critiqued as a mechanical and soulless, and the Spirit of the West representing Enlightenment values of internationalism and universalism. There were alternative strands of thinking; Vinayak Damodar Savarkar contrasted his espousal of Hindutva nationalism with Buddha’s universalism, the latter’s non-violence being regarded by him as weakening Indian patriotism, since “Buddhism had its centre of gravity nowhere”. Jawaharlal Nehru saw merit in nationalism as the focus of the Independence movement. In 1950, he asserted that “the strongest urge in Asia ...is the anti-colonial urge and the positive side of it is nationalism”, and in 1953, “nationalism has been and is a very good thing. It has been a great liberating force in certain stages of a country’s history”. Yet, he feared that extreme nationalism among colonised peoples could degenerate into fascism and expansionism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party’s dogma harks back to the thinking of Savarkar and M.S. Golwalkar, representing Indian cultural nationalism and attempting an impossible balance between the projection of hard power and promotion of peace. Nationalism may take various forms but essentially, it is about collective identity, whereas liberalism implies the defence of individual freedom and self-determination, the state’s role being to protect the private sphere. In practice, liberalism has advantages and disadvantages; it can underpin universal rights and Adam Smith’s natural laws of economics, but its appeal is mainly to the professional educated class, and lacks nationalism’s emotional appeal. Asian democracy Asian politics are politically conservative when the economy is booming, shown by lengthy autocratic governments in China, Singapore and Vietnam, whereas the Asian financial crisis of 1997 led to a democratic impulse in Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea, and intermittently in Thailand. Democracy in Asia is not shaped by the liberalism of the West; the centrality of civil and political rights is less dogmatic and a degree of state intervention considered acceptable when it comes to individual autonomy. The liberal tradition contributes the ideas underlying the post-Second World War international system, embracing democracy, free trade, international law, multilateralism, environmental protection and human rights. Problems arise when such ideas become a doctrine for nation-building irrespective of context, with western intervention in the developing world and its consequences of turmoil and Islamist extremism and terror. The current example of Afghanistan is a case in point. Power hierarchy Liberalism is now attacked in the West by both the far-right populism illustrated by former U.S. President Donald Trump, and the left represented by such as Senator Bernie Sanders who regard the global situation as the neo-liberal preserve of the rich and powerful. Despite American diplomatic rhetoric, there never has been a community of mutually supportive liberal democracies. International relations are conducted at the axial point of an egalitarian order of law and a hierarchical order of power: the United Nations represents this tension in the differing principles on which the Security Council and General Assembly are based. This is why the reform of the UN to include India, Japan, Germany and a few others as permanent members of the Security Council proves so difficult to achieve. In a future Asia How will nationalism and liberalism be reflected in a future Asia? Both India and China were at the receiving end of western imperialism and emerged as supporters of principles of international society reflected in the Panchsheel, namely sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference. This implies rejection of western efforts to qualify sovereignty by making it dependent on human rights protection. The Non-Aligned Movement and Afro-Asianism were efforts to project a soft power model, but soon China, India and Pakistan joined the nuclear weapons club of hard power. The two leading Asian nations, India and China, used the present world system to fashion their rise while protesting against the control of the United Nations and world financial institutions but have not formulated any alternative based on Asian nationalism. Their current rivalry makes such a desirable outcome a remote prospect.

02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Gauging household income key for microfinance clients||The microfinance movement in India is set to receive another dose of impetus with the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) recently released Consultative Document on Regulation of Microfinance in June 2021. Following the Malegam Committee Report, which is a decade old now, the current document looks to reassess the priorities of the sector. Some of the key regulatory changes proposed in the document takes household income as a critical variable for loan assessment. The definition of microfinance itself is proposed to mean collateral-free loans to households with annual household incomes of up to Rs. 1,25,000 and Rs. 2,00,000 for rural and urban areas respectively. The document requires all Regulated Entities to have a board-approved policy for household income assessment. Moreover, it caps loan repayment (principal and interest) for all outstanding loans of the household at 50% of household income. Given the importance accorded to household income, measuring this accurately becomes critical for effective implementation of these norms. An elusive figure Household income, however, is an elusive figure. With a high degree of informality in our economy, income streams, especially for non-salaried workers, tend to be erratic in time and volatile in volume. Low-Income Households (LIHs), who typically form the customer base for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), often also have seasonal and volatile income flows. An agricultural worker earns the most during the sowing seasons; households with migrant workers who migrate to the city for certain months of the year see an income peak during those months; and a flower vendor near a temple sees an income increase during festivals. These highs are also contrasted by lows during certain lean seasons when remunerative work is unavailable (drought), during growing season (before harvest) or general lull times. Since income for LIHs are seasonal and volatile, there have been attempts to understand their inflows by measuring their expenditure. But, given the rotational debts they avail, expenditure also does not truly reflect the household’s income. Moreover, for most LIHs, their expenditure on income-related activity is not separate from their personal expenses. Ask a farmer what their profit was during the last season and you would likely be told the market price they got for the produce. It is difficult to separate the household’s personal expenses from that of their occupational pursuits. In spite of the complexity in assessing household income for a typical microfinance client, creative ways to capture accurate data about household-level cash flows could be devised. Here, we present three ways. First, a structured survey-based approach could be used by Financial Service Providers (FSPs) to assess a household’s expenses, debt position and income from various sources of occupation. However, attention must be paid while designing such a questionnaire so that it captures seasonality and volatility in cash flows. Second, a template-based approach could be used wherein FSPs could create various templates for different categories of households (as per location, occupation type, family characteristics, etc.). Household templates could be defined based on publicly available data sets that contain State/district-level information about household cash flows and occupation types. These templates could then be used to gauge the household income of a client matching a particular template. Third, FSPs could collect and maintain household income data through a centralised database. This would allow for uniformity in data collection across all FSPs. It is worth acknowledging that the proposed suggestions to capture household income require time, energy and money on the part of FSPs. Therefore, finding cost-effective yet accurate ways of capturing this information becomes crucial. Technology service providers could play a crucial role in this exercise and create customised digital architecture for FSPs depending on their specific needs. Creating new technology to document and analyse cash flows of LIHs would not only facilitate credit underwriting/decisioning but also innovation in the standard microcredit contracts through customised repayment schedule and risk-based pricing, depending on a household’s cash flows. Eventually, an accurate assessment of household-level incomes would avoid instances of over-indebtedness and ensure long-term stability of the ecosystem.

02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Effectiveness of vaccines||That natural immunity following a virus infection stays robust and lasts longer is already well known. People infected with the 2002 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have been shown to have strong immunity for up to three years. Now, a vaccine effectiveness study undertaken in Israel has shown that natural infection confers stronger immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus than even full vaccination. They found that people previously infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus had better immunity and had reduced risk of reinfection, symptomatic disease and hospitalisation caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant than uninfected people who were fully immunised with the Pfizer vaccine. The results have been posted on medRxiv, a preprint server. Preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals. Since Israel was the first country to vaccinate a large percentage of the population with the Pfizer vaccine, the researchers were able to compare over 16,000 people who were previously infected but not vaccinated with an equal number of people who had not been naturally infected but fully vaccinated. During the follow-up, it became clear that even full vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine did not confer immunity that was superior to the one acquired through natural infection. There were 238 instances of breakthrough infections in the fully vaccinated compared with just 19 reinfections among those previously infected but not vaccinated. The infection or vaccination occurred during January and February this year. After adjusting for comorbidities, it was found that the risk of breakthrough infections was 13-fold higher than reinfection among the naturally infected group. Differences in protection were seen in symptomatic diseases too. At 191, the number of people with symptomatic disease in the fully vaccinated group was higher than in the previously infected group, which remained at eight. After adjusting for comorbidities, there was a 27-fold risk for symptomatic breakthrough infection compared with symptomatic reinfection. But waning of natural immunity against the Delta variant was seen when infections that had occurred anytime between March 2020 and February 2021 were compared with vaccination during January-February 2021. The risk of breakthrough infections and symptomatic disease in the fully vaccinated was nearly six-fold and over 7.1% higher respectively than in those previously infected. This study does not tell if the level and duration of protection varies depending on the severity of the disease, and whether asymptomatic infection confers the same protection as those with the disease. Since the correlates of protection are not yet known, it is unknown if the immune response from natural infection might be proving to be superior to antibodies generated in response to spike proteins in the case of vaccines. Though this is the largest real-world study evaluating the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine in preventing infections compared with natural immunity, it is only an observational study. Testing for the infection was not undertaken, thereby underestimating asymptomatic infections. More such studies involving Pfizer and other vaccines, carried out over a longer time period, are needed to fully understand the level and duration of protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccines. One encouraging finding is the absence of death among the vaccinated, a clear signal that the vaccine offers formidable protection against serious disease. Hence, natural immunity, even if found to be superior and long-lasting than vaccine-induced protection, is not what one should opt for. Since January 2020, there have been 4.5 million COVID-19 deaths recorded globally. A sizable number of deaths have been among the healthy and those younger than 60 years, which flies in the face of a section of scientists that came up with the Great Barrington Declaration before vaccines became available. Vaccination will always remain a safe and sure way to remain protected against severe COVID-19 disease and death, even if it means the protection is not robust or long-lasting. prasad.ravindranath@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/effectiveness-of-vaccines/article36239998.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Fleeting cheer||The latest GDP estimates expectedly show that national output rebounded in Q1 of the current fiscal from the record contraction in April-June 2020, when the pandemic’s onset and the lockdown gutted the economy. National Statistical Office data show GDP expanded 20.1% from a year earlier, as every one of the eight industries spanning the broad agriculture, manufacturing and services categories posted positive growth. And gross value added, which aggregates output from all the eight sectors, grew by 18.8%. The numbers, however, show a different picture when compared with either the preceding quarter or the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2019-20. GDP at constant prices was estimated at Rs. 32.38-lakh crore, a 16.9% contraction from January-March’s Rs. 38.96-lakh crore and more than 9% shy of the Rs. 35.66-lakh crore in April-June 2019. That the second COVID-19 wave extracted a significant toll is evident. With the exceptions of electricity and other utility services and the non-contact intensive services grouping of financial, real estate and professional services, all other six industries posted double-digit quarter-on-quarter contractions. On the expenditures front, private consumption spending flattered to deceive, posting year-on-year growth of 19.3% but still shrinking by 17.4% from the preceding three months. And most disconcertingly, government consumption expenditure, which has invariably in the past helped shore up the economy, contracted 4.8% from a year earlier and 7.6% from the previous quarter. Looking ahead rather than in the rear-view mirror, there have been signs of some traction in the current quarter as most States have gradually eased their localised second wave restrictions. Exports have been one of the bright spots as the U.S. and other western economies have ramped up vaccinations and posted economic recoveries that have underpinned demand for goods and services from India. And manufacturing has surged almost 50% year-on-year to be just under Rs. 24,000 crore short of the April-June 2019 output level. A fact borne out by the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index from IHS Markit, whose August release shows the sector experienced a second straight month of increase in production, albeit at a slower pace than July. Still, the same PMI survey also points to the challenges ahead. Rising raw material costs have been forcing manufacturers to either absorb the impact or raise prices, as several automakers have done, risking the prospect of dampening the already tenuous demand. And lingering uncertainty has led companies to yet again freeze hiring, according to IHS Markit. With monsoon rains in deficit, agricultural output and wider rural consumption also face a likely downturn. Policy makers must remain laser focused on expediting vaccination coverage and taking fiscal measures to ensure overall consumption demand does not weaken any further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fleeting-cheer/article36239984.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||For a bona fide press||In directing the State government to establish a ‘Press Council of Tamil Nadu’ within three months, the Madras High Court has come close to formulating policy and legislation. Its direction amounts to creating a body and clothing it with powers and functions, something that is normally done by law and after wider consultations. There is no doubt that it is a well-intentioned order that seeks to address problems arising from the dubious activities of ‘fake journalists’. In fact, the directives may constitute a remedy to the maladies highlighted by the Division Bench in its recent verdict, but it is quite surprising that such a far-reaching measure has sought to be created by judicial direction while disposing of public interest litigation somewhat unrelated to the case at hand. The original case initiated by a man claiming to be a journalist contained some allegations against the special team investigating theft of idols from various temples. It was disposed of with a direction to the Idol Wing CID to proceed with the investigation in accordance with the law. As there was suspicion over the petitioner’s credentials, the Bench has proceeded to address the larger problem of imposters masquerading as journalists for personal enrichment. The issues highlighted by the Bench are quite real and need remedial measures. Some people claiming to be journalists do run letter-pad publications, or even print some copies of obscure journals, but devote much of their time to using “connections” to wangle benefits and gifts, try and swing transfers and postings; or be fronts for vested interests. Broadly, the court wants a State-level ‘Press Council’ to weed out ‘fake journalists’, regulate the distribution of identity and accreditation cards and the recognition of media bodies, besides receiving and disposing of complaints about the media. As of now, the Press Council of India performs the watchdog role about public complaints, but without any substantive enforcement powers. Accreditation and dealing with journalist bodies are now the functions of the respective governments. A powerful body that will identify and accredit journalists, decide their entitlements to bus and rail passes and welfare measures, as well as act as a complaints authority will surely need a statutory framework. Besides, a separate body created by executive order may act over-zealously and end up eliminating bona fide journalists. As ‘newspapers, books and printing presses’ are in the Concurrent List, the State government needs to examine if the field is occupied by central legislation, and whether it can create a watchdog body, as suggested by the court, encompassing all forms of media. It may have to weigh its options carefully, including an appeal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/for-a-bona-fide-press/article36239985.ece

Special arrangements had to be made for the accommodation and they were given seats in a portion of the hall set apart for them. There was one main resolution and three amendments which were moved one after another and discussed together for three hours, after which the Council adjourned, before the debate concluded. The original resolution demanded the entire removal of sex disqualification for registration on electoral rolls and the provisions enabling women to record their votes. The first amendment asked for the extension of franchise to lady graduates only. The second amendment went a little further and demanded extension of franchise to ladies who had passed the matriculation examination. The third amendment which was moved by Kumar of Tahirpur, an orthodox Hindu Zemindar, was practically in opposition to the original motion. The amendment wanted the question of the removal of sex disqualification be referred to a committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/women-franchise/article36239993.ece

02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||August manufacturing PMI shows recovery losing steam||India’s manufacturing recovery lost momentum in August with the survey-based Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) sliding to 52.3. from July’s 55.3. as demand showed ‘signs of weakness due to the pandemic’ and input price pressures persisted. Growth in new orders softened, pushing the expansion below the long-term average. With overall optimism weakening last month, there was a fresh pause on hiring in the sector that had resumed recruitment in July after shedding jobs for 15 months. A score below 50 on the IHS Markit index indicates a contraction. The PMI had slipped to 48.1 in June, as the second COVID-19 wave took its toll. Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said August saw the Indian manufacturing sector extend its recovery, but growth lost momentum as demand weakened. “Yet, factory orders and output rose across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods categories,” she said. “The 12-month outlook for production remained positive, though confidence faded amid worries concerning the lasting scars of the pandemic and the adverse impact of rising costs on companies' finances parallel to a lack of pricing power,” she explained. Manufacturers’ cost burdens have now been rising for 13 straight months, and were linked by producers to raw material scarcity and transportation problems. “August data pointed to back-to-back increases in new export orders, but here too growth lost momentum. The pace of expansion was only marginal,” the economics research firm added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/august-manufacturing-pmi-shows-recovery-losing-steam/article36239970.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Auto sales growth is healthy, but chip shortage is a worry’||A majority of vehicle manufacturers posted strong growth in wholesales during August, and are betting on the festival season to help spur sales further. However, the shortage of semiconductors continues to impact production even as customer sentiment remains positive, they cautioned. Maruti Suzuki said its domestic passenger vehicle (PV) sales rose to 1.13 lakh units, from 1.03 lakh a year earlier. Total sales, however, fell 4.6% at 1.30 lakh units due to a fall in exports. “Sales volume of the company in August 2021 was affected due to electronic components shortage,” Maruti said. Hyundai Motor India saw domestic sales rise 2.3% to 46,866 units and exports climbing 79% to 12,202. Tata Motors said its domestic PV sales rose 51% to 28,018 units. However, sales declined 7% month-on-month from 30,185 units in July. Domestic commercial vehicle (CV) sales also grew 55% to 26,172 units. The semiconductor shortage continues to impact the auto industry globally and recent lockdowns in East Asia have aggravated the supply situation. Tata Motors is hence ‘forced to moderate production and offtake volumes’ in the coming months, the company said in a statement. “The situation is fluid and we will continue to work to mitigate the impact of this and aim to meet our customer orders... the order book is strong,” it added. For Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), PV sales increased 17% to 15,973 vehicles from a year earlier. However, commercial vehicle sales fell about 27% to 11,438 units. “Supply of semiconductors continues to be a global issue for the auto industry and has been a major area of focus for us.” M&M’s tractor sales fell 15% to 19,997 units “due to high base effect”. Hemant Sikka, president — Farm Equipment Sector, said, “With the festive period on the anvil, which also coincides with the harvesting season, we are anticipating robust demand in the coming months.” Two-wheeler sales dip In two-wheelers, market leader Hero MotoCorp saw domestic sales dip 24% to 4.31 lakh units. Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India saw domestic sales slip 6% to about four lakh units. TVS Motor said the domestic two-wheeler business registered sales of almost 1.8 lakh units compared with 2.18 lakh units a year earlier. “With pandemic restrictions easing and the festive season approaching, we expect the retails to improve significantly in the coming months,” it said. For Ashok Leyland, domestic sales grew 44% to 8,400 units. Bajaj Auto’s CVs rose 91% to 14,624 units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/auto-sales-growth-is-healthy-but-chip-shortage-is-a-worry/article36239972.ece
02 September 2021||CHENNAI,||TVS family to buy back CDPQ stake in TVS SCS||TVS Supply Chain Solutions (TVS SCS) on Wednesday announced that TVS family members, along with their associates, would buy back stake from private equity firm CDPQ, having received approval from the Competition Commission of India. The deal will allow the TVS family to consolidate its holdings in TVS SCS, the company said in a statement. It would also enable the firm to focus on scaling up business using ‘technology and strong customer relationships’, it added. The repurchase by the TVS family (R. Dinesh and T.S. Rajam family and associates) reaffirms the company’s growth potential, it said. In 2016, Canadian pension fund CDPQ had bought a minority stake in TVS SCS for Rs. 1,000 crore. “With the global supply chain’s centre of gravity shifting towards India and other ASEAN countries and the exciting future for the manufacturing and service sectors in India, TVS SCS is well placed to see exponential growth over the coming years,” said Mr. Dinesh, MD, TVS SCS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tvs-family-to-buy-back-cdpq-stake-in-tvs-scs/article36239976.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Power consumption rises 18.6% in August||India’s power consumption grew 18.6% in August to 129.51 billion units (BU) and remained higher than the pre-COVID level due to improved economic activities amid easing of lockdown curbs by States, according to Power Ministry data. Power consumption in August last year stood at 109.21 BU, lower than 111.52 BU in the same month in 2019, as per the data. Experts say the recovery in power demand and consumption in August is consistent and robust. They are of the view that the recovery would further improve as many States have eased lockdown restrictions to boost economic activities after the number of new cases declined. The only fear is that another wave of the pandemic can dampen this recovery in power consumption and demand, they said.  Peak power demand met or the highest supply in a day stood at 196.24 GW in August this year, which is 17.1% higher compared to a year earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/power-consumption-rises-186-in-august/article36239983.ece

02 September 2021||CHENNAI,||Manika Batra reiterates her stand||Manika Batra, India’s top woman paddler, is clear that she wants her personal coach Sanmay Paranjape to be court-side during the Asian table tennis championships in Doha from September 28 to October 5. The 2018 Commonwealth Games singles champion insisted that it is not an issue as having a personal coach involves ‘no cost’ to the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI). Happen naturally “I think it should happen naturally. TTFI has never sent or paid for the coach or even the physio I have travelled with,” said Manika, ranked 56th in the world, to The Hindu on Wednesday. “In the team event, the other coach is fine but after that, we have a singles event, where I would want my coach to be there in every tournament and I think this is a basic requirement of every player in an individual sport.” “So I really wish the problems aren’t there for anyone and the best chance to play is made for the country,” she added. It is reliably learnt that Manika has replied to the show-cause notice issued by TTFI and wants justice. “I hope the TTFI is fair and I am hopeful and wish they take some steps for justice. I am and have always been focused on my effort and the work we have to put in to give the best for India,” she said. Tough competition Manika said the competition in the Asians will be tough and said that it would be good preparation for the 2022 Asian Games. “At the Asian championships, I will try to give my best and as you all know Asia is a very special continent so it will be a good outing for all of us to give our best and prepare for the bigger events like the Asian Games,” she said. According to Manika, Indian women paddlers have improved as they travel regularly and train hard with their coaches. “I will say that the overall game has improved as the girls work hard with their coaches in India or travel abroad for training. So the results are seen in the level of the game. Let’s say I am willing to be a part of the growth and let’s hope our [Indian] team does well,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/manika-batra-reiterates-her-stand/article36240389.ece
02 September 2021||London,||Can India rise from Leeds low?||Vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane’s wretched form and senior off-spinner R. Ashwin’s possible inclusion will have the most significant impact on the Indian team’s efforts to move on from its Leeds debacle when it takes on England in the fourth Test at the Oval from Thursday. India skipper Virat Kohli knows that all is not well with his batting unit and the biggest problem is the performance of its three middle-order stalwarts — the skipper himself, his deputy Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara. Pujara might have redeemed himself with a knock of 91 which was high on “intent quotient” but the same can’t be said of Rahane, whose form is shaky despite a knock of 61 in the second innings at Lord’s. In all likelihood, Rahane would get another chance, but over the past two years, his inconsistency has hurt the team badly. If Rahane is dropped, Hanuma Vihari has a better chance of coming in as he also bowls off-spin. The Oval track has traditionally helped spinners and Ashwin is likely to get back into the side. The form of rival skipper Joe Root, who has already tallied over 500 runs in just three games with a hat-trick of hundreds is another cause for concern for the Indians. Prasidh included Meanwhile, the selection committee, based on a request from the team management, has added fast bowler Prasidh Krishna to the squad for the fourth Test.  The teams (from): India: Rohit Sharma, K.L. Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (Capt.), Ajinkya Rahane (Vice-capt.), Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant (wk), R.

With Sydney and Melbourne being COVID-19 hot spots, the Indian team and 12 out of 18 Australian players are currently in a two-week hard quarantine. “Our sports science people are quite rightly nervous,” said Mott, referring to seam bowlers Ellyse Perry, Annabel Sutherland, Tayla Vlaeminck, Maitlan Brown and Stella Campbell, who are currently in quarantine. “They won’t bowl for 14 days and will go straight into a very congested schedule, so our management of the players has to be right on point,” he added. “We’ll try and make it work but it’s going to be a really interesting series to see how we navigate around the complexities that will be thrown at us.”  The schedule:   ODIs: Sept. 21, Great Barrier Reef Arena, Mackay (4.35 a.m.); Sept. 24: Great Barrier Reef Arena, Mackay (8.45 a.m.); Sept. 26: Great Barrier Reef Arena, Mackay (4.35 a.m.).

02 September 2021||NEW YORK,||Djokovic overcomes Rune to kick-start calendar Slam quest||World No.1 Novak Djokovic won without playing his best to reach the second round of the U.S. Open on Tuesday in his quest for a calendar-year Grand Slam and record 21st Major title. The 34-year-old Serbiandominated much of the way in beating 18-year-old Danish qualifier Holger Rune 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-1 after two hours and 15 minutes in the night feature at Arthur Ashe Stadium. “It wasn’t the best of my performances,” Djokovic said. “At the same time, he played well in the second set when it mattered and I didn’t serve well in the second set.” Djokovic would complete the first men’s singles calendar-year Slam since Rod Laver in 1969 by winning the crown on the New York hardcourts. He would also break the deadlock for all-time men’s Slam titles at 20 which he shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, both absent due to injuries. Rune, ranked 145th, began cramping in the third set and struggled to finish. “From the third or fourth game in the third set, he couldn’t move much,” Djokovic said. “You could see he struggled a lot. I feel for him.”  Djokovic won the first set in 26 minutes without facing a break point, fell behind 3-0 to start the second before battling into the tie-breaker, where Rune grabbed leads of 4-0 and 6-3. After two Djokovic service winners, he sent a backhand service return long to drop the set. In the third set, Djokovic broke to lead 3-1 and Rune began getting treatments between games, grimacing at times and struggling to run for shots to the end.  French-born qualifier Maxime Cressy of USA fired 44 aces and saved four match points to upset Spanish ninth seed Pablo Carreno Busta 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6(7).  World No.1 Ashleigh Barty, coming off wins at Wimbledon and Cincinnati, began her chase for back-to-back Slam titles by defeating Russian Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 7-6(7). Meanwhile on Wednesday, defending champion Naomi Osaka advanced to the third round by walkover, after Olga Danilovic withdraew with illness, on Wednesday as rain showers interrupted play. 12th seed Simona Halep, ninth seed Garbine Muguruza and 20th seed Ons Jabeur also made the third round.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-overcomes-rune-to-kick-start-calendar-slam-quest/article36240328.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||There’s always room for improvement: Arun||India’s bowling coach B. Arun defended the performance of his bowlers in the last match in Headingley, saying it was a one-off, especially considering the team was defending a low first innings score. “In the last Test, yes, I would agree the English bowling looked a lot better. But I would like to see how they bowl when they are defending a total of 78,” said Arun when asked about India’s lacklustre bowling effort. Not an excuse “It is not an excuse for the bowlers, there is always room for improvement and we have looked at those areas. Ishant Sharma’s form in the last game was a bit of concern but we have sorted things out. So it will be a different cup of tea in the Oval Test,” he added. Explaining the inclusion of Prasidh Krishna in the squad, he said, “It is a precautionary inclusion. Considering the workload management issues, we needed to induct him into the Test team.” Discussing the chances of off-spinner R. Ashwin playing his first match of the tour at The Oval, Arun said the final call will be taken before the toss. “The history at Oval is that it takes spin but you also know the Englishmen are wary of Ashwin’s abilities and what he could do if there’s any assistance from the track. I think the most realistic option would be to look at the track in the morning because anything can happen from now to tomorrow,” said the former India pacer. On the team’s plans to contain England captain Joe Root who has made three centuries so far, Arun said, “We have given him pretty fast starts. Obviously, we will look deep into those areas and stem those.” When asked about how the team can bounce back after the innings defeat in the last Test, he pointed out the comebacks in the series against Australia and England recently after losses in the first Test. Done it in the past “We have done it in the past. We have been bowled out for 36 (Adelaide 2020) and bounced back from that. “Even in India, we suffered a big defeat to England in the first Test (Chennai). We can take confidence from what we have done in the past and I am sure you will see a much more spirited performance,” said Arun.  It was just a very normal precautionary scan that he went through. All he had to do was wear the hospital dress. He took a picture of it and that created a big issue.

While 80 players took part in the four categories (men’s and women’s singles, and men’s and women’s doubles), a robust format was used to judge the performance of the players in the absence of tournaments. The new format also ensured that both the elite and domestic players were given adequate opportunities to prove their mettle. Based on the rankings, the selectors will soon meet to pick the final squads for the Sudirman (10 members) and Thomas/Uber Cups (20).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bai-trials-end-teams-to-be-picked-soon/article36240702.ece
02 September 2021||KOCHI,||Quartermiler Anilda Thomas working on a comeback||Just three years ago, India won the women’s 4x400m relay gold at the Jakarta Asian Games but this year the country could not even field a team for the World Relays in Poland and failed to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. There are three major events lined up next year — World Championships (USA), Asian Games (China) and Commonwealth Games (England) — and Olympian Anilda Thomas, who is now married to Jibin Reji and has a 15-month-old son Evan Sebastian, is dusting her spikes and working on a comeback after two and half years. And the dismal state of the Indian women’s relay team has offered her hope. “I’ve started jogging at the Poojappura ground in Thiruvananthapuram and I’m planning to join coach P.B. Jaikumar’s camp in a week. Next year’s Asiad is the big motivation,” said Anilda, who ran for India in the women’s 4x400m relay at the 2016 Rio Olympics, in a chat with The Hindu on Wednesday. “If I can run the 400m in something like 53s, I have a good chance of getting back into the Indian team,” said the 28-year-old whose personal best 52.40s came in New Delhi in 2016. Give it a try “Because of the long break, I don’t know how successful I will be. But I want to give it a try. I was in the national camp till 2018.” In April, the AFI withdrew its women’s 4x400m relay team from the World Relays as its top runners were either injured or had fitness issues. Later, the country was forced to miss the World Relays altogether as many nations banned flights from India. Universities in Kerala frequently throw up quality quartermilers and Assumption College’s V.K. Vismaya entered the national camp through this route in 2017 and a year later ran for the gold-winning Indian team at the Jakarta Asian Games. P.T. Usha’s trainee Tintu Luka was also a part of the Asian Games gold-winning team in 2014 (apart from being a former Asian 800m champion) while another trainee, former Asian 400m silver medallist Jisna Mathew helped India qualify for the Tokyo Olympics in the mixed relay after finishing seventh in the 2019 Doha Worlds. Surprisingly, the Kerala team for the Open Nationals, which begin in Warangal on September 15, will be without a single female quartermiler. With the global pandemic messing up athletes’ training, the timings in the State’s university championships were also disappointing with the 400m gold in the recent Kerala University meet going for 1:04.92s. 2022 could be a year of opportunities for Anilda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/quartermiler-anilda-thomas-working-on-a-comeback/article36240373.ece

02 September 2021||Sydney,||CA still hopes to host Afghanistan Test||Cricket Australia says it is still hoping a planned Test match against Afghanistan will go ahead, despite the Taliban takeover of the country and acute uncertainty over their rule. The governing body said preparations for the one-off match in Hobart beginning Nov. 27 were proceeding as planned. “Cricket Australia’s planning for the historic first Test match between Australia and Afghanistan in Hobart is well underway,” CA said on its website late Tuesday. “There is goodwill between CA and the Afghanistan Cricket Board to make the match happen.” The match was originally slated for late last year but was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. CA was responding to reported comments from the Taliban saying the Afghanistan team’s schedule would not be interrupted. ‘Good relations’ “In the future, we want good relations with all countries,” the deputy head of the Taliban’s cultural commission Ahmadullah Wasiq told Australia’s SBS television. “When good relations are established, Afghan players can go (to Australia) and they can come here.” The rescheduled match in the Tasmanian State capital will take place just after the ICC T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in which both Australia and Afghanistan are set to play. The Australians will use the Test as a warm-up for its home Ashes series against England beginning in December.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ca-still-hopes-to-host-afghanistan-test/article36240381.ece
02 September 2021||Sao paulo,||Brazil missing key EPL players||Brazil will be missing nine of its players from the English Premier League for its next three World Cup qualifiers, including Thursday’s clash at Chile. But second place Argentina expects to have four of its England-based players at Venezuela on the same day. FIFA has told South American soccer body CONMEBOL there will be consequences for clubs who don’t release players as required. Brazil leads with six wins in six matches, but few analysts are taking any risks predicting who will play against seventh place Chile in Santiago on Thursday. The first training sessions in Sao Paulo did not offer any hints. A win in Santiago could put Brazil on the verge of qualification for next year’s tournament in Qatar. If coach Tite’s team brings three points from Chile and beats Argentina and Peru at home it will have 27 points after nine matches. Second place Argentina, with 12 points, will have four Premier League players for the match in Caracas. Captain Lionel Messi, who finally lifted a major trophy with Argentina, will play for his country for the first time as a Paris Saint-Germain player. Also Thursday, third place Ecuador will host Paraguay. Colombia will travel to Bolivia. And Peru will host Uruguay, which will be without Edinson Cavani and the injured Luis Suarez.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/brazil-missing-key-epl-players/article36240439.ece
02 September 2021||Kathmandu,||India takes on Nepal||The Indian men’s football team will kick start its preparations for the next month’s SAFF Championships in Maldives with the first of the two international friendly matches against Nepal here on Thursday. The five-team SAFF Championships will be held from October 3 to Oct. 13 at the National Stadium in Male. Besides India, the other participating teams are Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, hosts Maldives and Nepal. “We are happy to be here and happy to be together again. These two international friendlies will help us prepare for the SAFF Championship in the Maldives next month,” India’s head coach Igor Stimac said in a release. “I just know these games will be good and we need to learn on the pitch.” The second friendly against Nepal will be played on Sept. 5. This will be the first time India will feature in an international game since playing Afghanistan in its final group match of the 2018 World Cup and 2023 Asian Cup joint-qualifiers in Qatar on June 15. With dark clouds hovering in the sky, rain threat looms large over the match. The pitch conditions at the practice ground were already tough because of torrential downpour. “I hope that we don’t suffer heavy rains during the matches so that we can play some exciting football,” Stimac said. “We have analysed Nepal as an opponent and the kind of progress they made in the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-takes-on-nepal/article36240382.ece
02 September 2021||Paris,||European champ Italy still has some unfinished business||For Italy it is back to business less than eight weeks after its Euro 2020 triumph. The Azzurri will take the acclaim of their own supporters when they play Bulgaria in Florence in a World Cup qualifier. Roberto Mancini’s team cannot afford to rest on its laurels because until it has secured qualification for the finals in Qatar, it will not have completely erased the memory of its failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. Italy is unbeaten in 34 games — including winning its first three qualifiers for Qatar back in March — and now it faces three more matches in eight days with a trip to Switzerland and a home meeting with Lithuania also on the agenda. Italy’s game on Sunday in Basel against Switzerland, its biggest rival in Group C, will therefore be crucial. At the moment the biggest European names with work to do are the Netherlands and Germany, two powerhouses who head into the autumn with new coaches. Hansi Flick is the new man in charge of Germany after 15 years under Joachim Low. Germany, however, will be without captain Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Muller who are both injured and ruled out of Thursday’s qualifier against Liechtenstein. Leno to deputise Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno will deputise for Neuer, who sat out training all week with an ankle knock. Flick is hopeful he will be fit for for their next qualifier against Armenia in Stuttgart. The Netherlands, which also failed to qualify for the last World Cup, sacked Frank de Boer after going out of Euro 2020 in the last 16 and has reappointed Louis van Gaal. The man who led the Oranje to the 2014 World Cup semifinals takes over a team currently trailing a point behind Group G leader Turkey. It could be a challenging start to the 70-year-old Van Gaal’s third stint as national coach as the Netherlands plays Erling Haaland’s Norway in Oslo before hosting Montenegro and Turkey. For England it is all about putting the pain of its Euro final defeat behind it as it faces potential pitfalls away in Hungary and Poland, either side of a home meeting with Andorra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/european-champ-italy-still-has-some-unfinished-business/article36240391.ece

02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The Lord's Maya||The Gita stresses the importance of the knowledge to discriminate between the self and the body. The cause for the body and the senses of the jivatmas is Prakriti and is comprised of the three gunas, satva, rajas and tamas. All jivatmas are subject to the influence of the three gunas and they are able to experience joy and sorrow in every birth. When a jiva takes birth, the association with Prakriti, the senses, mind and intellect is automatic. The jivatma appropriates all the qualities and nature of Prakriti as belonging to him. The jiva thus begins to think, "I am happy, I am sad, etc." This Prakriti is called the Lord's Maya and also His Sankalpa pointed out Asuri Sri Madhavachariar in a discourse. It is a powerful force on the jivatma and enslaves him in many ways. It draws him away from awareness of God and plunges him into a kind of chronic self forgetfulness. Krishna tells Arjuna that unless one learns to see the self as distinct from Prakriti, and understands the importance of transcending the involvement with the gunas, it will not be possible to get out of samsara. The first step is to leave aside rajas and tamas and cultivate satva. This will help one to obtain a higher birth. But even satva has to be transcended if one has to seek that Truth which lies beyond the gunas and Prakriti. It is not possible to come out of this Maya on one's own effort, says the Lord; and He makes it clear that He does not want the jiva to continue in Maya. Out of His infinite power and boundless compassion, He offers His helping hand to the jivatma, and promises to guide him out from this mire to experience the life of freedom. "He who surrenders to Me shall surely cross this otherwise insurmountable Maya," is His word.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/the-lords-maya/article36240041.ece

02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Silver chains that tinkle on||On a muggy afternoon, men in vests and lungis are busy at work at this nameless unit behind the Pallapatti Lake in Salem, assembling an ornament that the South Indian city has been famous for, for nearly a century: the silver kolusu or anklet. Artisans lay out varying lengths of silver wire that has already been cast in the ‘Khusbhoo’ pattern (named, like theidli, after the actress when she was at the peak of her popularity in the 1980s) and manually fix die-cut embellishments like flowers and enamel accents in a painstakingly slow process. Made of silver alloyed with copper, these ornaments come with tinkling bells ( salangai ) attached. Mud from the road outside has been mixed with water to create a paste that is packed into iron trays, forming a non-reactive base that keeps all the tiny parts of the anklet from dislodging. Once done, the tray is sent to another worker who solders the pieces on each anklet, until it is ready for the next process of cleaning and polishing. “There are 30 steps to making an anklet, and each one goes to at least 10 places before it returns to the unit for the finishing stage,” says V Suresh, who has been manufacturing the ornaments with his elder brother for the past 15 years in Salem. “One of the unique features about the Salem anklet is that except for a few stages, most of the manufacturing is still done by hand,” he adds. In the inner chambers of his home-cum-office, Suresh keeps rods of kachcha silver, made of melted down anklets that will be mixed with pure silver to manufacture a new batch of ornaments. Plastic bags of rasagolla (silver globules), screws and other accessories fill the small steel cupboard. With the recent easing of the lockdown, production is almost back to normal in this family-run business. Historic links Suresh is part of a cottage industry that is thought to employ up to 10 lakh people in and around the city. With nearly 60% of the anklets sold across India reportedly from Salem, the ornament has made the city one among the leading manufucturing hubs in India. In areas of the city like Shevapet and Sivathapuram, it is possible to see anklets in different stages of manufacture laid out in long lines, twinkling in the sunlight. Despite this, Salem’s kolusu industry does not have a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for its products. A lack of supportive documentation to prove the antiquity and uniqueness of the business in Salem is the main cause, say local history enthusiasts and jewellery industry players. “According to our research, silver anklet production in Salem has been supported by a community of traders who migrated from Saurashtra. They were initially into textiles, but when the industry became shaky due to restrictions imposed by the British, they moved into making silver anklets,” says A Anand Kumar, managing partner, ANS Guptha and Sons, a leading jeweller in the city. This demographic has changed in recent decades to include skilled artisans and sellers from a multicultural background. Anand Kumar is also a part of the local chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), and has been spearheading an initiative to get a GI tag for the Salem kolusu . In 2019, the brand’s ANS Dhivyam showroom got 20 anklet makers in the city to create a 127-feet long anklet, weighing five and a half kilograms and featuring five of Salem’s most popular patterns, within a month, for a special public display. “We did this mainly to give some pride to the artisans who are always in the shadows, compared to the retailers,” says Anand Kumar. “Even when you take images and statuary of 200 years ago, you will find the anklet, which was called the kaapu then. It may be in a slightly different form, but it would be a key way to identify the cultural and ethnic origins of a woman,” he adds. Among Salem’s unique designs is the thala kolusu , made for infants. The silver wire is wound in such a way that it loosens as the child grows, and can be used for up to four years. Impact of technology Technology and competition from mechanised production have affected Salem’s anklet industry in myriad ways. While social media has facilitated nationwide trade, a growing number of people are making ‘true copies’ of the original product. “North Indian manufacturers are putting up replicas of our designs on their Facebook pages, claiming it to be their product. A GI tag will help prevent this plagiarism,” says C Srianandarajan, secretary of Salem District Kolusu Manufacturers Kaivinai Sangam. The industry body, which has 300 anklet manufacturers on its rolls, hopes to get this heritage jewel given due recognition. “This is an industry that defines our city. We should do more to honour this ornament that has given Salem so much,” says Srianandarajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/silver-chains-that-tinkle-on/article36240270.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Time and tide...||Perched atop a docked boat, Kutraleeshwaran Ramesh looks pensively at the sea. It has been years since he visited Chennai’s Marina Beach, the hauntingly familiar place where he got his first shot at fame when he was just nine. In the Nineties, as a child who loved being in the water, Kutral took part in a five-kilometre swimming competition at sea. “I came fourth,” he recalls, “After finishing it, I started building sand castles. People were curious; I had accomplished something phenomenal at such a young age and yet was nonchalantly playing.” Kutral remembers this incident distinctly for it was a turning point in his life. Until then, he mostly swam in pools and felt “bored”. Swimming soon took over his life and he was hailed a child prodigy: Kutral swam the English channel when he was 12, entered the Guinness World Records for swimming across six straits within a calendar year and represented the country at several international competitions. Then, when everyone expected him to achieve greater heights, he quit swimming. Cut to the present, and Kutral has done multiple things; he has an MBA from MIT Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts, USA, worked with Intel and is currently with Nanban Ventures in Canada. “Swimming isn’t a lucrative field. I aspired for a certain quality of life, which wouldn’t have been possible had I continued. Today, I am in a position to give back to society,” he says. Life and sport Kutral hopes to do that with his latest venture, Nanban Sports Foundation, which aims to identify and nurture sporting talents from the grassroots level. “The ultimate vision is that an IT engineer and a sportsperson should have the same quality of life,” he explains. “We hope to increase the talent pool to represent the country, which will in turn translate to medals. The reason parents push children to pursue Engineering or Medicine is because they see successful people in those professions leading a good life. In sports, you will have to retire after a few years. The financial security post retirement is a big question mark for many.” He hopes to address that issue too. Under the Legends category, the Foundation will also support star sportspersons who once earned laurels but are now financially struggling. “These are two sides of thecoin: people who have been there and done that, are the ones who will encourage future generations to take up the sport,” adds Kutral. Water tales Growing up in the quiet bylanes of Chennai’s Gopalapuram, Kutral was a regular, everyday kid whose life changed once he discovered swimming. There was a phase when he hated it — and the recognition that came with it (he was once summoned from a galli cricket match to attend a press interview) — but today, he looks back with a smile. Fortunately for him, the choice of whether to continue professional swimming or not came just after his Class XII exams, by when he had already represented India in two world series. The option was to choose between swimming and a college education, and Kutral chose the latter. After a degree at the College of Engineering, Guindy he went to the US for higher studies. “I feel the word ‘passion’ is overrated. If I’m passionate about something today, it doesn’t mean I would be as passionate about it a few years later.” Such crucial life decisions have been possible, he says, thanks to murattu dhairiyam (bravado). “I do not take anything very seriously in life; its easier if you are detached. It also helps that I always see the worst-case scenario while taking decisions. Its a misconception that people think I was a champion swimmer and then left it,” he says. Then adds, “I was talented, but my quality of life would have suffered drastically. It was a practical and conscious decision to quit...I have no regrets.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/time-and-tide/article36240251.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s Oliver Twist on the phone||When Oliver Twist, in Rojin Thomas’ recent Malayalam film #Home , streaming on Amazon Prime Video,  gets a smartphone, it unleashes a series of goof-ups, which impact his award-winning filmmaker son’s life adversely. Indrans as Twist conveys the confusion of a ‘not-so-extraordinary man’ (as his son reminds him) in his 60s who does not understand technology or social media, and therefore cannot connect with his always-on-their-smartphones sons. Indrans reminds you of your parents as he wrestles with technology and video calls. “I was just doing what the director asked me to. Some of it is my story. All of us, especially those as old as me, have had these experiences with smartphones and constantly evolving technology,” says the actor, who shot for the film last year when lockdown restrictions were eased. The portrayal has won praise for Indrans, who was awarded the Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor (2018) for his role as an Ottanthulal artist, Pappu Pisharody, in Aalorukkam . The 40-year journey for Indrans (Surendran K) from his first minor role in Choothattam (1981), to the lead actor of a mainstream Malayalam film (initially planned for a theatre release) has been rewarding. On whether he coveted a lead role, Indrans says, “We are all greedy that way...we want to do as many roles as possible and dream of being the lead,” he says laughing. Though this is not his first film in a lead role, #Home is perhaps the first that has garnered this kind of attention thanks to the OTT release and its reach. “I am getting calls in languages I cannot even understand! All I can say is ‘yes, yes’!” Indrans says that he felt affection for the character he played. “He is unusual... But being the lead was kind of worrying. The constant thought was that the producer should not suffer losses because of me. Doing a small role in a film with someone else as lead is easier. This role, however, was too good to refuse.” #Home also stars KPAC Lalitha, Manju Pillai, Sreenath Bhasi in vital roles. A tailor by profession, Indrans entered the film industry due to his love for cinema. He had made his name more as a comic actor, sidekick to the lead or main comic, before transitioning into a character actor with serious roles. Last seen as a cop in Malik , the lead role in #Home has given more visibility.  “I would have liked it to be a theatre release. A large section of the population or audience does not have access to such OTT platforms and would have enjoyed it on the big screen. But given the situation, we had to take this decision.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/its-oliver-twist-on-the-phone/article36240242.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A home for you and me||At the turn of the century, Jacklin Janaki found herself wandering the streets of Chennai, 300 kilometres from her home in Kovandakurichi. Homeless and in the throes of a mental breakdown she did not quite understand, she experienced two sides to the city: one that tossed stones and disdain at her, and the other, fortunately, that gave her shelter, meals, a diagnosis and the help to manage it. Over the next 10 years at The Banyan, she found her calling as an auxiliary nurse. Wishing others like her too find the support they need, she returned to her hometown in Tiruchi to start an initiative, Home Again, with the help of her sister, Amali Margaret, and The Banyan. Spread across nine homes in Kovandakurichi and nearby villages, 44 women, who much like Jacklin, have experienced mental illnesses, homelessness and marginalisation, live together as families, supporting and caring for each other. The sisters are the protagonists of The Banyan’s first illustrated book for children, Jacklin & Amali . Their journey — one of homelessness, grief, abandonment, finding support and care, and passing it on — makes for a stark subject for children, but author Rega Jha, believes that is why it is all the more important to narrate. “The Banyan is quite invested in introducing these themes to adolescents and bringing about mental health sensitisation,” she says. The narrative is complemented by loving illustrations by Akshaya Madhavan. The book was launched last week with a reading session that featured actors Shobana and Revathi, Dr Vikram Patel, and author Shaheen Bhatt among others. A long way home On a call from Home Again in Kovandakurichi, Jacklin recalls, hesitant but determined, the circumstances that led to her boarding that fateful train to Chennai. “My marriage broke apart a few years ago, and then, I lost my parents. I came to Chennai with Rs. 300 in hand, which soon got over,” she says. She meant to find her aunt in Chennai but lost her way, and ended up living on the streets. She was taken to The Banyan, where she got better and re-trained herself in nursing. “This was my second time in Chennai, I had lived and worked as a nurse for a year here once before. This time, I also learnt how to nurse people with psychiatric issues,” she says. Amali, who had been battling depression on her own all this while, also came to The Banyan, where she picked up the skills of house management. Together, the two of them started Home Again in 2016. “I was inspired by the work The Banyan was doing — supporting people in need, and providing medication free of cost. I thought, why not go back to my home town and help my community,” says Jacklin. Awareness about mental health had been low in Kovandakurichi, says Amali, from her experience with depression in the village. “Sometimes, it gets labelled as a ‘possession’. People who need medication and treatment are locked up instead. But now, things are changing. People voluntarily come up to us, asking for medication to become better,” she says. Jacklin also runs a private clinic under which she visits patients and fixes appointments with doctors. Home Again has been expanded by The Banyan to 10 other states, offering 49 homes to over 200 residents. “There is still work to be done,” says Amali. “Of the 44 women with us, many of them have families that don’t want to take them back because they don’t know how to manage them at home.” Which is why the sisters are glad this book has come into being. “It is a proud feeling to have our life story written down. When we were young, we didn’t have anyone telling us about mental illnesses,” says Jacklin, adding “This book explaining these issues to children at a young age will have a huge impact.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-home-for-you-and-me/article36240254.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||How guitars saved the barracks||From barracks to ancestral home, to wedding venue, Chennai’s Luz House has seen many uses over the centuries. As the 250-year-old property inches its way back into the city’s social life, after a pandemic-prompted hiatus, it finds other heritage properties in the fray, newly inaugurated to woo Chennai in imaginative ways. Cafes, event venues, performance platforms, flagship stores… a clutch of young entrepreneurs are now basing their businesses in age-old city architecture. In the process, they not only find steady means of upkeep for these maintenance-heavy structures, but also make sure they continue to be a part of contemporary Chennai life. Primrose, a 1950 bungalow in Mylapore, underwent an Art Deco renovation in 2020 before opening its doors in July 2021. The old family home now boasts subtly stylised pillars and lights, central cooling and an elevator, but still retains sloping red oxide flooring on the terrace, an inner courtyard open to the skies, and an old mango tree that has stood there for as long as Archana Kalpathi can remember. “The property belongs to my husband’s family, and we wanted it to be a space where the family could celebrate happy occasions,” she says, adding that the idea of using it as an events space stems from there. Since its opening, Primrose has hosted birthdays and intimate dinners, and plans to woo everything from exhibitions and bake sales to pre-wedding functions. “We plan to keep it exclusive,” adds Archana, “Since it’s a family property, we want to make sure that it’s used properly.” On the other hand, PH Cafe in Egmore welcomes anyone who wants to spend a day in their own little creative shell, and even provides a platform to some of them. The indie music and art cafe has been functional since 2019. For Rashmi Nandita, the same old walls that house her childhood memories are now witness to her professional ones. She calls it her old “Kerala family house”, built in 1948. “My family has been here for generations,” says Rashmi, “We didn’t want to touch the architecture, or do anything to the house. We just redid the garden. OTS [On The Streets of Chennai, a collective] performs here, and we have a little rural art setup inside,” says Rashmi. PH used to have seating inside, where freshly painted furniture shared space with decades-old wooden swings, a nostalgic Singer sewing machine complete with a pedal, and even a badminton racquet from Rashmi’s grandmother’s youth. Traditional paintings from the Ravi Varma Printing Press give company to louvered windows and to little cabinets built into wall crevices, with stately wooden shelves and simple glass doors. They watched sedately as servers tread the red oxide floors with trays of cold coffee thickened with homemade ice cream. But since the pandemic broke out, the interiors have been shut. Guests are now only seated on the pillared balcony, which curves around the house, looking over a little courtyard, a makeshift stage, and a row of coconut tree stumps that double up as seats. Despite the Egmore traffic roaring right outside, it is easy to see why this space is so inviting to budding artists, musicians and comedians, many of whom spend hours working here. It is a sturdy house; the foundation below expands about two or three feet beyond the visible structure above ground. “It’s difficult to even drill a nail into a wall, and plumbers and electricians have a tough time,” says Rashmi, rapping her knuckles on a hefty balcony column. Columns are an eye-catching feature not only of this 1940s house, but also of the over-a-century-old Kingsley on Spur Tank Road. Home to the flagship store of Kanakavalli, this colonial-era family home was deliberately picked out for that purpose six years ago by Ahalya S. “The point was to create a showcase primarily for our Kanjeevaram saris. We wanted a space as well-crafted as the saris themselves,” says Ahalya. “We had to renovate almost all of it — it was being used as a home, but as a store our requirements where high, like for example lighting and security. The floor used to be a regular cement I think; it is now a classic black and white chequered floor,” she adds. When it comes to renovating old properties, no one understands “tough times” better than Abhimanyu Prakash, the man who opened Luz House to the public. Abhimanyu remembers that entire year of work that went into Luz House, before the family property was ready in 2014. “It is more than two centuries old, and needs a lot of maintenance. I couldn’t imagine selling it; in my mind, the house belongs not to me or my father, but to my children and those who will come after them. So I had to think of ways to make the place at least earn its own upkeep,” he explains. Curb your enthusiasm The original plan was that of a yoga and spa retreat, but the family later decided to keep it open for multiple uses, interfering as little with the original structure as possible. “We managed it without opening up a single wall, retaining the original teak wood and country tiles. Parts of the roof that had to be redone, were fixed with wood recycled from other parts of the house,” he says, adding that the entire renovation was done under the watchful guidance of conservation architect Kalpana Mohamed, who “stayed our hand whenever we got too enthusiastic”. Built well before the times of indoor plumbing, Luz House required an overhaul of not only pipelines, but also the electric system, wall finish and parts of the roofing. “Typically, in a normal building or house, you could expect to paint it about once every four years. Here, it has to be done twice a year with a light, lime-based paint instead of the regular ones,” says Abhimanyu, adding, “The walls are different. They are not meant to stop heat, but to absorb moisture and to breathe,” he says with a hint of pride. He adds, “It is about 8,000 square feet now, but there was a time when the whole property was 30 acres, and this was only one of three houses owned by the Buchi Babu family. This particular one was the zenana , or ladies quarters.” Since its opening in 2015, the centuries-old bungalow has been used to hosting about 12 to 15 events a month including traditional weddings. “In 2020-2021, there was barely any income,” says Abhimanyu, “We wanted to put in a restaurant and five or six large rooms for people to stay, but that may not be a possibility now.” History has a steady hand here, but the future will have to wait.

02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The Glass Palace travels to Sri Lanka||While crisscrossing the globe on diplomatic postings, there is one trusted companion Niluka Kadurugamuwa never forgets to take along — his books. The Sri Lankan foreign service officer does not stop with just reading them. He translates critically acclaimed fiction from around the world to Sinhala, the language spoken by a majority in the island nation. His latest work Veeduru Maligawa (by Colombo-based Sumitha Publishers) is a translation of the novel The Glass Palace , bringing its acclaimed author Amitav Ghosh to the Sinhala reader for the first time. Kadurugamuwa began translating the historical novel — over 500 pages long — in October 2020, at the height of the pandemic. He completed the task in July this year and the Sinhala version, which is more than 800 pages, is now ready for launch. It marks his first major translation of an Indian author, and coincides with his time in New Delhi, where he is currently the Deputy High Commissioner at the Sri Lankan mission. On why he chose Ghosh’s historical fiction published in 2000, Kadurugamuwa said it was the “mesmerising prose”. “I like all his work but this novel speaks to our shared histories. Ghosh captures the anti-colonial sentiment so powerfully. And that is something intertwined with all our stories, because we were all colonised in the past,” he says in a telephone interview. “The story spans generations and countries, covering South-East Asia, Burma and India… it is so well-researched and rich in context,” adds the 46-year-old diplomat. Growing up in Diyatalawa town in Badulla, located in Sri Lanka’s scenic hill country, Kadurugamuwa began reading Sinhala translations of European, American and Russian writing, mostly fiction. Soviet literature has for long had a dedicated readership in Sinhala, especially in Leftist circles. Later, Kadurugamuwa took a strong liking to Latin American literature, introduced to Sinhala readers by writer-activist Gamini Viyangoda. In his late teens, Kadurugamuwa attempted his first translation, with African-American author Richard Wright’s short story Silt . “I was so thrilled to see my translation in print, although it was heavily edited,” he says, chuckling at his writer’s scepticism of newspaper editors. He continued through his university days, sending translated short stories to newspapers and magazines. “They would pay some 500 rupees (LKR), and that was big money for a student in the mid-1990s.” Kadurugamuwa’s interest in world politics and languages led him to Masters’ degrees in International Affairs and Languages, and eventually to Sri Lanka’s foreign service in 2003. Despite a hectic career, marked by regular moves and busy days, his late evenings were invariably dedicated to a page or two of translation work. Over the years, he has translated Columbian writer Gabriel Garcia Márquez’s novel In Evil Hour , Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk’s The Red-haired Woman , Chilean writer Isabel Allende’s Island Beneath the Sea , American author Mario Puzo’s Six Graves To Munich , and fellow Sri Lankan writer Manel Abhayaratne’s novella Maya — in addition to several short stories — traversing genres such as crime, historical fiction and magic realism. His translations have been published mostly by Colombo-based Vidarshana Publishers until now. Kadurugamuwa’s translations sell at least 2,000, which is considered a good figure in the Sri Lankan market. The books are often priced a little over LKR 1,000 (roughly Rs. 366); The Glass Palace’ s translation will be priced at LKR 1,600. With long days, full of high-stakes bilateral meetings or discussions at UN forums, it cannot be easy to meet deadlines, even those set by him. “Oh, it is certainly not. In the case of The Glass Palace , I bought a copy in Bangkok about a decade ago, but never got to reading and translating it. Then I bought another copy when I was posted to New York, but still couldn’t do it. I brought it back to Colombo but never got to it. And then I bought a third copy when I was posted to New Delhi this time, and actually sat down with it,” says the writer-diplomat, who has won Sri Lanka’s State Literary Award for the best translation twice. In terms of style, Kadurugamuwa prefers literal translations. “I don’t drop anything from the original, I try to be as faithful as possible to the text. Of course, there are things you can’t translate quite literally, because the context could be vastly different. In those cases, I use footnotes. Veeduru Maligawa has about 110 footnotes.” Despite the effort and time that translation warrants, Kadurugamuwa revels in the exercise. “You get to inhabit another writer’s head, temporarily becoming that person while writing. It is a marvellous feeling!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-glass-palace-travels-to-sri-lanka/article36240265.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Hopeful beginnings||Vetri Duraisamy developed a fondness for animals and birds while growing up. He has a few domestic animals in his farm that he raised. The closeness he felt with the animals left him wondering about the man-animal relationship, which ultimately became an idea for a script he wrote in 2017. The idea was still nascent but the goal was to explore domestic animals being an integral part of a family from the Kongu belt with an agricultural background. Marking his directorial debut with Tamil film Endravadhu Oru Naal , Vetri admits that he was wary of the issues he talks about in his first film. He even thought if he should make a lighter film until he met actors Vidharth and Ramya Nambeesan who boosted his confidence by agreeing to star in it. “They gave me valuable feedback. Their cooperation was a major factor to the way the film has shaped up,” says Vetri.  Endravathu Oru Naal did not have a music composer till the course of the shoot, says Vetri. He screened the film for music director NR Raghunathan, who liked the subject and agreed to score. The songs and music were added later in the post-production. Like the composer, the film’s title was also fixed post filming. Vetri settled on Endravathu Oru Naal , based on a dialogue spoken by one of the prominent characters that was tied to its theme. “We have a mother character who says that things are going to change for the better someday, one day.” Also serving as the film’s producer, Vetri says he wrapped the filming just before the nation-wide lockdown last year. Since theatres were shut owing to the pandemic, he worked on the post-production and an international cut, without songs and background score, was sent to a few film festivals where it earned appreciation. But Vetri truly got his validation for his work when Endravathu Oru Naal was screened as part of the Chennai International Film Festival 2021 in February and won the Best Tamil Feature Award. “It was the first time I watched my film with an audience. It was a different feeling sitting with the home crowd and watching the film at Sathyam Cinemas,” says Vetri, adding that he is planning for a theatrical release in October.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/hopeful-beginnings/article36240211.ece

These anecdotes, which Suresh had recorded, were sort of similar to Spirited Away , one of the most acclaimed works of Adithi’s favourite animator Hayao Miyazaki. When she put the recordings together, she saw the possibility of a film. She worked on the idea for about one and a half years and came up with Kandittund (‘Seen It’, in Malayalam). The 12-minute short won the Satoshi Kon Award For Excellence in Animation at Fantasia International Film Festival (FIFF) Awards 2021. The film, produced by Nilima Eriyat, had Oscar-winner Resul Pookutty along with Vijaykumar working on its sound design. Adithi, a graduate of the National Institute of Design, is now looking forward to working on more ideas, including an animated series. “I want to make something that gives you a feeling of having read a book,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/kerala-based-animators-short-film-wins-at-fantasia-international-film-festival/article36240226.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Shin Ha Ri says namaskaram||Nineteen-year-old Prathyusha G credits her interest in everything K- to the Korean face masks she stumbled upon at a neighbourhood store. While K-beauty and fashion trends play seminal roles, K-pop — more specifically the boy band BTS — forms the core of her love. Then, Prathyusha discovered K-webtoons, Korean digital comics that are specifically fashioned for smartphones. Now, she collects digital episodes to binge-read over the holidays on her phone. Sixteen-year-old Subiksha, another loyal reader, says she enjoys Korean webtoons “way better” than Indian movies or TV shows. She got hooked in November 2020, and has not looked back since. Even as the Korean cultural wave or hallyu has gained momentum in the past few years, it was the lockdowns that led a rush of Indians to Korean comics. In the form of webtoons that are available in regional languages, they are more accessible than ever before. In India, Kross Comics pioneered the entry of this format to the Indian market through its app, on which are titles — sometimes episodic — that can be accessed for free.  Manhwa , as K-comics are commonly referred to in South Korea, came into existence as early as the 1920s when Korea was under Japanese occupation. An offshoot of cultural imitation, manhwa quickly became a cousin to the more popular Japanese cartoons and comics, manga . In India, manga has had a strong and loyal fan base for many years, while manhwa the newest entrant, is often accessed digitally. Within South Korea, the format of webtoons that took form in the early 2000s, are now part of a billion dollar market. A gradual boom “The hallyu started in the early 2000s in Japan, with Korean dramas becoming popular. Since then, K-dramas have been finding new audiences across China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan... In India, in particular, back in 2015 I was surprised to find that the wave had not started despite the glaring similarities in culture,” says Hyunwoo Thomas Kim, co-founder of Kross Comics, headquartered in Seoul. Around 2019, the scene changed. By then, BTS was also on its way to becoming a household name in India. “That’s when I realised that K-pop and K-drama are already here in a big way. What could be next? I started showing some of the digital comics to Indian friends and the interest was palpable. From a storytelling point of view, K-dramas and Korean webtoons are very similar,” says Kim. In December 2019, they rolled out about 100 titles and have been growing fast since. Now, with the pandemic, their app stands at over three million downloads. Some of them are also being adapted into K-dramas: Kross Comics’ webtoons, A Business Proposal is currently being made into a serialised drama which is expected to release in 2022. Similar to music and drama, webtoons also have a target audience of people between the ages of 15 and 24. Readership records show that 80% of the response is from a female audience. “It is very different from the comics that the Indian youth is used to, like Amar Chitra Katha for instance, which deals with mythology, superheroes and so on. We talk about love, dating, romance and just everyday life,” says Kim. Culturally, while Indians and Koreans in their mid-40s might be very different in their way of thinking, the Gen Z audience globally is similar in many ways. Kim says that their online social exposure is perhaps the reason for these similarities. More importantly, the webtoon format strikes an easy balance between visuals and text, with the latter mostly in the form of concise dialogues. Visualisation is episodic. Tap to read Author of the popular webtoon She Hates Me , Amadoji, 31, from Korea believes that webtoons resonate with the audience because of digital accessibility. “Many read webtoons as most people now own smartphones. I wasn’t expecting it [the global reaction] at all, because this work includes a lot of parodies and memes that are specifically used in Korea, and the main background itself is Korea.” Illustrations and colours also contribute to this attraction, especially when published in a serialised manner, says Endless ’ creator Kim-Yeon. “I start doodling without any plans. And when I encounter a character’s face that I like, I start attaching surrounding characters one by one by imagining their personality and background,” she says. Now with translations made available in regional Indian languages like Hindi and Telugu apart from English, they are slicing through a larger Indian demographic. “The response from Telugu readers has been good. So we are thinking of adding more southern languages. Our goal is to expand to at least 11 Indian languages in the next few years,” adds Kim. The average daily readership varies between 60,000 to 1,00,000, of which 70% reads in English, 25% in Hindi and 5% in Telugu. Twenty six-year-old Dhanashree Kodkani had never read a Korean comic until she began translating one to Telugu in September 2019. Now, she feels disheartened when a series she is translating, ends. Dhanashree recalls titles she started with: Que Sera Sera and The Reason Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke's Mansion . “As someone who has a habit of reading subtitles, it really gets me when a joke or a moment is lost in translation. Hence, I am extra careful when I do this ,” she says. With the pandemic, there is a shift in preferences too. In 2021, K-webtoons that revolve around positive and uplifting stories are seeing more takers. Young adults are finding these simple narratives in the webtoon format a welcome escape. “It is more convenient, doesn’t cost any money if I am willing to wait for new episodes and it doesn’t require me to go to a store,” says Subhiksha, adding “For students like me, it is ideal entertainment. Everything can happen right from my phone.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/shin-ha-ri-says-namaskaram/article36240283.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Nikhil Advani on ‘Mumbai Diaries 26/11’: A feature film is like a sprint; a series is like running a marathon||Writer-director-producer Nikhil Advani wears multiple hats and makes it look easy. At his production house Emmay Entertainment, work is on in full swing on feature films and web series in different stages of development. There is a method to the madness, Advani explains, as he takes time out to talk about Mumbai Diaries 26/11 , a medical drama series that will premiere on Amazon Prime Video on September 9. Starring Konkona Sen Sharma, Mohit Raina, Shreya Dhanwanthary, Satyajeet Dubey, Natasha Bharadwaj, Mrunmayee Deshpande and Prakash Belawadi, the series is jointly directed by Nikhil Advani and Nikhil Gonsalves. Excerpts from an interview with Nikhil Advani :  The trailer indicates a story unfolding in a hospital, against the backdrop of 26/11 attacks. What prompted you to write a medical drama?   Vijay Subramaniam and Aparna Purohit of Amazon Prime Video approached me to do a show in the same grungy, gritty space as D-Day (2013 film) and P.O.W - Bandi Yudd Ke (2016 series for Star Plus). I wasn’t keen on another espionage story or pitting India against Pakistan. I wanted to make a medical drama about doctors, nurses and ward staff in a Mumbai hospital. In a large, Government hospital in Mumbai, they handle about 300 admissions a day. It is like going to war. What happens when they go through an extraordinary day like 26/11? COVID-19 has made all of us more aware of the shortcomings in the healthcare system and how much healthcare workers do to keep our cities alive. This series was planned (and filmed) before the pandemic.  Does Mumbai Diaries 26/ 11 become the story of a city as well as the characters?  I believe everyone has a story to tell about 26/11, irrespective of whether they watched the traumatic events on television or had a friend/acquaintance in one of the affected areas. The line ‘people who are meant to heal us are quite broken themselves’ defines the series. The characters are dealing with their own demons. Early in the day, Mohit’s character has an argument with his wife, who is an F&B manager at The Taj hotel. As the attacks happen, he is unable to reach her. Someone else is anxious about their parents who are stuck at the hotel. We began by wanting to narrate personal stories and it became the story of the city.  Can you discuss the process of writing fictional stories inspired by real life events? You have had quite a few — D-Day, Batla House, P.O.W and this series.  The advantage is that no matter how incredible an event may sound, no one can dispute that it happened. On 27/11, the first train left from Churchgate station to Virar as usual, which means the driver somehow managed to reach his workplace. That is a symbol of Mumbai’s resilience. So many came forward to donate blood. There is also tremendous responsibility of narrating these stories without sensationalising them. When a ward boy or a nurse sees Mumbai Diaries 26/11 , they have to feel proud of seeing their story on screen. Nurses protected patients by hiding them under the beds and switching off lights. A woman who took six bullets managed to survive...  Does the digital space lend itself better to narrate long form stories?  Absolutely. Writing for a series on a digital platform allows us to write episodic stories and longer character arcs. A feature film is like a sprint; a series is like running a marathon.  You began your career with Kal Ho Naa Ho and Salaam-e-Ishq and later moved to gritty stories...  I am a big fan of Mani Ratnam. Whatever be the genre, there is great characterisation and drama in his films. I loved Roja, Thiruda Thiruda, Iruvar, Yuva and Kannathil Muthamittal , all of which were different from each other. At this stage of my life, I value companionship more than romance. When I have an interesting story to narrate in that space, I will definitely do it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/nikhil-advani-on-mumbai-diaries-2611-a-feature-film-is-like-a-sprint-a-series-is-like-running-a-marathon/article36240238.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Silver chains that tinkle on||On a muggy afternoon, men in vests and lungis are busy at work at this nameless unit behind the Pallapatti Lake in Salem, assembling an ornament that the South Indian city has been famous for, for nearly a century: the silver kolusu or anklet. Artisans lay out varying lengths of silver wire that has already been cast in the ‘Khusbhoo’ pattern (named, like theidli, after the actress when she was at the peak of her popularity in the 1980s) and manually fix die-cut embellishments like flowers and enamel accents in a painstakingly slow process. Made of silver alloyed with copper, these ornaments come with tinkling bells ( salangai ) attached. Mud from the road outside has been mixed with water to create a paste that is packed into iron trays, forming a non-reactive base that keeps all the tiny parts of the anklet from dislodging. Once done, the tray is sent to another worker who solders the pieces on each anklet, until it is ready for the next process of cleaning and polishing. “There are 30 steps to making an anklet, and each one goes to at least 10 places before it returns to the unit for the finishing stage,” says V Suresh, who has been manufacturing the ornaments with his elder brother for the past 15 years in Salem. “One of the unique features about the Salem anklet is that except for a few stages, most of the manufacturing is still done by hand,” he adds. In the inner chambers of his home-cum-office, Suresh keeps rods of kachcha silver, made of melted down anklets that will be mixed with pure silver to manufacture a new batch of ornaments. Plastic bags of rasagolla (silver globules), screws and other accessories fill the small steel cupboard. With the recent easing of the lockdown, production is almost back to normal in this family-run business. Historic links Suresh is part of a cottage industry that is thought to employ up to 10 lakh people in and around the city. With nearly 60% of the anklets sold across India reportedly from Salem, the ornament has made the city one among the leading manufucturing hubs in India. In areas of the city like Shevapet and Sivathapuram, it is possible to see anklets in different stages of manufacture laid out in long lines, twinkling in the sunlight. Despite this, Salem’s kolusu industry does not have a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for its products. A lack of supportive documentation to prove the antiquity and uniqueness of the business in Salem is the main cause, say local history enthusiasts and jewellery industry players. “According to our research, silver anklet production in Salem has been supported by a community of traders who migrated from Saurashtra. They were initially into textiles, but when the industry became shaky due to restrictions imposed by the British, they moved into making silver anklets,” says A Anand Kumar, managing partner, ANS Guptha and Sons, a leading jeweller in the city. This demographic has changed in recent decades to include skilled artisans and sellers from a multicultural background. Anand Kumar is also a part of the local chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), and has been spearheading an initiative to get a GI tag for the Salem kolusu . In 2019, the brand’s ANS Dhivyam showroom got 20 anklet makers in the city to create a 127-feet long anklet, weighing five and a half kilograms and featuring five of Salem’s most popular patterns, within a month, for a special public display. “We did this mainly to give some pride to the artisans who are always in the shadows, compared to the retailers,” says Anand Kumar. “Even when you take images and statuary of 200 years ago, you will find the anklet, which was called the kaapu then. It may be in a slightly different form, but it would be a key way to identify the cultural and ethnic origins of a woman,” he adds. Among Salem’s unique designs is the thala kolusu , made for infants. The silver wire is wound in such a way that it loosens as the child grows, and can be used for up to four years. Impact of technology Technology and competition from mechanised production have affected Salem’s anklet industry in myriad ways. While social media has facilitated nationwide trade, a growing number of people are making ‘true copies’ of the original product. “North Indian manufacturers are putting up replicas of our designs on their Facebook pages, claiming it to be their product. A GI tag will help prevent this plagiarism,” says C Srianandarajan, secretary of Salem District Kolusu Manufacturers Kaivinai Sangam. The industry body, which has 300 anklet manufacturers on its rolls, hopes to get this heritage jewel given due recognition. “This is an industry that defines our city. We should do more to honour this ornament that has given Salem so much,” says Srianandarajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/silver-chains-that-tinkle-on/article36240923.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||How guitars saved the barracks||From barracks to ancestral home, to wedding venue, Chennai’s Luz House has seen many uses over the centuries. As the 250-year-old property inches its way back into the city’s social life, after a pandemic-prompted hiatus, it finds other heritage properties in the fray, newly inaugurated to woo Chennai in imaginative ways. Cafes, event venues, performance platforms, flagship stores… a clutch of young entrepreneurs are now basing their businesses in age-old city architecture. In the process, they not only find steady means of upkeep for these maintenance-heavy structures, but also make sure they continue to be a part of contemporary Chennai life. Primrose, a 1950 bungalow in Mylapore, underwent an Art Deco renovation in 2020 before opening its doors in July 2021. The old family home now boasts subtly stylised pillars and lights, central cooling and an elevator, but still retains sloping red oxide flooring on the terrace, an inner courtyard open to the skies, and an old mango tree that has stood there for as long as Archana Kalpathi can remember. “The property belongs to my husband’s family, and we wanted it to be a space where the family could celebrate happy occasions,” she says, adding that the idea of using it as an events space stems from there. Since its opening, Primrose has hosted birthdays and intimate dinners, and plans to woo everything from exhibitions and bake sales to pre-wedding functions. “We plan to keep it exclusive,” adds Archana. “Since it’s a family property, we want to make sure that it’s used properly.” On the other hand, PH Cafe in Egmore welcomes anyone who wants to spend a day in their own little creative shell, and even provides a platform to some of them. The indie music and art cafe has been functional since 2019. For Rashmi Nandita, the same old walls that house her childhood memories are now witness to her professional ones. She calls it her old “Kerala family house”, built in 1948. “My family has been here for generations,” says Rashmi, “We didn’t want to touch the architecture, or do anything to the house. We just redid the garden. OTS [On The Streets of Chennai, a collective] performs here, and we have a little rural art setup inside,” says Rashmi. PH used to have seating inside, where freshly painted furniture shared space with decades-old wooden swings, a nostalgic Singer sewing machine complete with a pedal, and even a badminton racquet from Rashmi’s grandmother’s youth. Traditional paintings from the Ravi Varma Printing Press give company to louvered windows and to little cabinets built into wall crevices, with stately wooden shelves and simple glass doors. They watched sedately as servers tread the red oxide floors with trays of cold coffee thickened with homemade ice cream. But since the pandemic broke out, the interiors have been shut. Guests are now only seated on the pillared balcony, which curves around the house, looking over a little courtyard, a makeshift stage, and a row of coconut tree stumps that double up as seats. Despite the Egmore traffic roaring right outside, it is easy to see why this space is so inviting to budding artists, musicians and comedians, many of whom spend hours working here. It is a sturdy house; the foundation below expands about two or three feet beyond the visible structure above ground. “It’s difficult to even drill a nail into a wall, and plumbers and electricians have a tough time,” says Rashmi, rapping her knuckles on a hefty balcony column. Columns are an eye-catching feature not only of this 1940s house, but also of the over-a-century-old Kingsley on Spur Tank Road. Home to the flagship store of Kanakavalli, this colonial-era family home was deliberately picked out for that purpose six years ago by Ahalya S. “The point was to create a showcase primarily for our Kanjeevaram saris. We wanted a space as well-crafted as the saris themselves,” says Ahalya. “We had to renovate almost all of it — it was being used as a home, but as a store our requirements where high, like for example lighting and security. The floor used to be a regular cement I think; it is now a classic black and white chequered floor,” she adds. When it comes to renovating old properties, no one understands “tough times” better than Abhimanyu Prakash, the man who opened Luz House to the public. Abhimanyu remembers that entire year of work that went into Luz House, before the family property was ready in 2014. “It is more than two centuries old, and needs a lot of maintenance. I couldn’t imagine selling it; in my mind, the house belongs not to me or my father, but to my children and those who will come after them. So I had to think of ways to make the place at least earn its own upkeep,” he explains. Curb your enthusiasm The original plan was that of a yoga and spa retreat, but the family later decided to keep it open for multiple uses, interfering as little with the original structure as possible. “We managed it without opening up a single wall, retaining the original teak wood and country tiles. Parts of the roof that had to be redone, were fixed with wood recycled from other parts of the house,” he says, adding that the entire renovation was done under the watchful guidance of conservation architect Kalpana Mohamed, who “stayed our hand whenever we got too enthusiastic”. Built well before the times of indoor plumbing, Luz House required an overhaul of not only pipelines, but also the electric system, wall finish and parts of the roofing. “Typically, in a normal building or house, you could expect to paint it about once every four years. Here, it has to be done twice a year with a light, lime-based paint instead of the regular ones,” says Abhimanyu, adding, “The walls are different. They are not meant to stop heat, but to absorb moisture and to breathe,” he says with a hint of pride. He adds, “It is about 8,000 square feet now, but there was a time when the whole property was 30 acres, and this was only one of three houses owned by the Buchi Babu family. This particular one was the zenana , or ladies quarters.” Since its opening in 2015, the centuries-old bungalow has been used to hosting about 12 to 15 events a month including traditional weddings. “In 2020-2021, there was barely any income,” says Abhimanyu. “We wanted to put in a restaurant and five or six large rooms for people to stay, but that may not be a possibility now.” History has a steady hand here, but the future will have to wait.

02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A home for you and me||At the turn of the century, Jacklin Janaki found herself wandering the streets of Chennai, 300 kilometres from her home in Kovandakurichi. Homeless and in the throes of a mental breakdown she did not quite understand, she experienced two sides to the city: one that tossed stones and disdain at her, and the other, fortunately, that gave her shelter, meals, a diagnosis and the help to manage it. Over the next 10 years at The Banyan, she found her calling as an auxiliary nurse. Wishing others like her too find the support they need, she returned to her hometown in Tiruchi to start an initiative, Home Again, with the help of her sister, Amali Margaret, and The Banyan. Spread across nine homes in Kovandakurichi and nearby villages, 44 women, who much like Jacklin, have experienced mental illnesses, homelessness and marginalisation, live together as families, supporting and caring for each other. The sisters are the protagonists of The Banyan’s first illustrated book for children, Jacklin & Amali . Their journey — one of homelessness, grief, abandonment, finding support and care, and passing it on — makes for a stark subject for children, but author Rega Jha, believes that is why it is all the more important to narrate. “The Banyan is quite invested in introducing these themes to adolescents and bringing about mental health sensitisation,” she says. The narrative is complemented by loving illustrations by Akshaya Madhavan. The book was launched last week with a reading session that featured actors Shobana and Revathi, Dr Vikram Patel, and author Shaheen Bhatt among others. A long way home On a call from Home Again in Kovandakurichi, Jacklin recalls, hesitant but determined, the circumstances that led to her boarding that fateful train to Chennai. “My marriage broke apart a few years ago, and then, I lost my parents. I came to Chennai with Rs. 300 in hand, which soon got over,” she says. She meant to find her aunt in Chennai but lost her way, and ended up living on the streets. She was taken to The Banyan, where she got better and re-trained herself in nursing. “This was my second time in Chennai, I had lived and worked as a nurse for a year here once before. This time, I also learnt how to nurse people with psychiatric issues,” she says. Amali, who had been battling depression on her own all this while, also came to The Banyan, where she picked up the skills of house management. Together, the two of them started Home Again in 2016. “I was inspired by the work The Banyan was doing — supporting people in need, and providing medication free of cost. I thought, why not go back to my home town and help my community,” says Jacklin. Awareness about mental health had been low in Kovandakurichi, says Amali, from her experience with depression in the village. “Sometimes, it gets labelled as a ‘possession’. People who need medication and treatment are locked up instead. But now, things are changing. People voluntarily come up to us, asking for medication to become better,” she says. Jacklin also runs a private clinic under which she visits patients and fixes appointments with doctors. Home Again has been expanded by The Banyan to 10 other states, offering 49 homes to over 200 residents. “There is still work to be done,” says Amali. “Of the 44 women with us, many of them have families that don’t want to take them back because they don’t know how to manage them at home.” Which is why the sisters are glad this book has come into being. “It is a proud feeling to have our life story written down. When we were young, we didn’t have anyone telling us about mental illnesses,” says Jacklin. She adds, “This book explaining these issues to children at a young age will have a huge impact.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-home-for-you-and-me/article36240928.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The Glass Palace travels to Sri Lanka||While crisscrossing the globe on diplomatic postings, there is one trusted companion Niluka Kadurugamuwa never forgets to take along — his books. The Sri Lankan foreign service officer does not stop with just reading them. He translates critically acclaimed fiction from around the world to Sinhala, the language spoken by a majority in the island nation. His latest work Veeduru Maligawa (by Colombo-based Sumitha Publishers) is a translation of the novel The Glass Palace , bringing its acclaimed author Amitav Ghosh to the Sinhala reader for the first time. Kadurugamuwa began translating the historical novel — over 500 pages long — in October 2020, at the height of the pandemic. He completed the task in July this year and the Sinhala version, which is more than 800 pages, is now ready for launch. It marks his first major translation of an Indian author, and coincides with his time in New Delhi, where he is currently the Deputy High Commissioner at the Sri Lankan mission. On why he chose Ghosh’s historical fiction published in 2000, Kadurugamuwa said it was the “mesmerising prose”. “I like all his work but this novel speaks to our shared histories. Ghosh captures the anti-colonial sentiment so powerfully. And that is something intertwined with all our stories, because we were all colonised in the past,” he says in a telephone interview. “The story spans generations and countries, covering South-East Asia, Burma and India… it is so well-researched and rich in context,” adds the 46-year-old diplomat. Growing up in Diyatalawa town in Badulla, located in Sri Lanka’s scenic hill country, Kadurugamuwa began reading Sinhala translations of European, American and Russian writing, mostly fiction. Soviet literature has for long had a dedicated readership in Sinhala, especially in Leftist circles. Later, Kadurugamuwa took a strong liking to Latin American literature, introduced to Sinhala readers by writer-activist Gamini Viyangoda. In his late teens, Kadurugamuwa attempted his first translation, with African-American author Richard Wright’s short story Silt . “I was so thrilled to see my translation in print, although it was heavily edited,” he says, chuckling at his writer’s scepticism of newspaper editors. He continued through his university days, sending translated short stories to newspapers and magazines. “They would pay some 500 rupees (LKR), and that was big money for a student in the mid-1990s.” Kadurugamuwa’s interest in world politics and languages led him to Masters’ degrees in International Affairs and Languages, and eventually to Sri Lanka’s foreign service in 2003. Despite a hectic career, marked by regular moves and busy days, his late evenings were invariably dedicated to a page or two of translation work. Over the years, he has translated Columbian writer Gabriel Garcia Márquez’s novel In Evil Hour , Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk’s The Red-haired Woman , Chilean writer Isabel Allende’s Island Beneath the Sea , American author Mario Puzo’s Six Graves To Munich , and fellow Sri Lankan writer Manel Abhayaratne’s novella Maya — in addition to several short stories — traversing genres such as crime, historical fiction and magic realism. His translations have been published mostly by Colombo-based Vidarshana Publishers until now. Kadurugamuwa’s translations sell at least 2,000, which is considered a good figure in the Sri Lankan market. The books are often priced a little over LKR 1,000 (roughly Rs. 366); The Glass Palace’ s translation will be priced at LKR 1,600. With long days, full of high-stakes bilateral meetings or discussions at UN forums, it cannot be easy to meet deadlines, even those set by him. “Oh, it is certainly not. In the case of The Glass Palace , I bought a copy in Bangkok about a decade ago, but never got to reading and translating it. Then I bought another copy when I was posted to New York, but still couldn’t do it. I brought it back to Colombo but never got to it. And then I bought a third copy when I was posted to New Delhi this time, and actually sat down with it,” says the writer-diplomat, who has won Sri Lanka’s State Literary Award for the best translation twice. In terms of style, Kadurugamuwa prefers literal translations. “I don’t drop anything from the original, I try to be as faithful as possible to the text. Of course, there are things you can’t translate quite literally, because the context could be vastly different. In those cases, I use footnotes. Veeduru Maligawa has about 110 footnotes.” Despite the effort and time that translation warrants, Kadurugamuwa revels in the exercise. “You get to inhabit another writer’s head, temporarily becoming that person while writing. It is a marvellous feeling!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-glass-palace-travels-to-sri-lanka/article36240922.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Kerala-based animator’s short film wins at Fantasia International Film Festival||Adithi Krishnadas was intrigued when Suresh Eriyat, her boss and founder of Eeksaurus Studio, told her about his father, who claims to have spotted various supernatural beings. These anecdotes, which Suresh had recorded, were sort of similar to Spirited Away , one of the most acclaimed works of Adithi’s favourite animator Hayao Miyazaki. When she put the recordings together, she saw the possibility of a film. She worked on the idea for about one and a half years and came up with Kandittund (‘Seen It’, in Malayalam). The 12-minute short won the Satoshi Kon Award For Excellence in Animation at Fantasia International Film Festival (FIFF) Awards 2021. The film, produced by Nilima Eriyat, had Oscar-winner Resul Pookutty along with Vijaykumar working on its sound design. Adithi, a graduate of the National Institute of Design, is now looking forward to working on more ideas, including an animated series. “I want to make something that gives you a feeling of having read a book,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/kerala-based-animators-short-film-wins-at-fantasia-international-film-festival/article36240927.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Shin Ha Ri says namaskaram||Nineteen-year-old Prathyusha G credits her interest in everything K- to the Korean face masks she stumbled upon at a neighbourhood store. While K-beauty and fashion trends play seminal roles, K-pop — more specifically the boy band BTS — forms the core of her love. Then, Prathyusha discovered K-webtoons, Korean digital comics that are specifically fashioned for smartphones. Now, she collects digital episodes to binge-read over the holidays on her phone. Sixteen-year-old Subiksha, another loyal reader, says she enjoys Korean webtoons “way better” than Indian movies or TV shows. She got hooked in November 2020, and has not looked back since. Even as the Korean cultural wave or hallyu has gained momentum in the past few years, it was the lockdowns that led a rush of Indians to Korean comics. In the form of webtoons that are available in regional languages, they are more accessible than ever before. In India, Kross Comics pioneered the entry of this format to the Indian market through its app, on which are titles — sometimes episodic — that can be accessed for free.  Manhwa , as K-comics are commonly referred to in South Korea, came into existence as early as the 1920s when Korea was under Japanese occupation. An offshoot of cultural imitation, manhwa quickly became a cousin to the more popular Japanese cartoons and comics, manga . In India, manga has had a strong and loyal fan base for many years, while manhwa the newest entrant, is often accessed digitally. Within South Korea, the format of webtoons that took form in the early 2000s, are now part of a billion dollar market. A gradual boom “The hallyu started in the early 2000s in Japan, with Korean dramas becoming popular. Since then, K-dramas have been finding new audiences across China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan... In India, in particular, back in 2015 I was surprised to find that the wave had not started despite the glaring similarities in culture,” says Hyunwoo Thomas Kim, co-founder of Kross Comics, headquartered in Seoul. Around 2019, the scene changed. By then, BTS was also on its way to becoming a household name in India. “That’s when I realised that K-pop and K-drama are already here in a big way. What could be next? I started showing some of the digital comics to Indian friends and the interest was palpable. From a storytelling point of view, K-dramas and Korean webtoons are very similar,” says Kim. In December 2019, they rolled out about 100 titles and have been growing fast since. Now, with the pandemic, their app stands at over three million downloads. Some of them are also being adapted into K-dramas: Kross Comics’ webtoons, A Business Proposal is currently being made into a serialised drama which is expected to release in 2022. Similar to music and drama, webtoons also have a target audience of people between the ages of 15 and 24. Readership records show that 80% of the response is from a female audience. “It is very different from the comics that the Indian youth is used to, like Amar Chitra Katha for instance, which deals with mythology, superheroes and so on. We talk about love, dating, romance and just everyday life,” says Kim. Culturally, while Indians and Koreans in their mid-40s might be very different in their way of thinking, the Gen Z audience globally is similar in many ways. Kim says that their online social exposure is perhaps the reason for these similarities. More importantly, the webtoon format strikes an easy balance between visuals and text, with the latter mostly in the form of concise dialogues. Visualisation is episodic. Tap to read Author of the popular webtoon She Hates Me , Amadoji, 31, from Korea believes that webtoons resonate with the audience because of digital accessibility. “Many read webtoons as most people now own smartphones. I wasn’t expecting it [the global reaction] at all, because this work includes a lot of parodies and memes that are specifically used in Korea, and the main background itself is Korea.” Illustrations and colours also contribute to this attraction, especially when published in a serialised manner, says Endless ’ creator Kim-Yeon. “I start doodling without any plans. And when I encounter a character’s face that I like, I start attaching surrounding characters one by one by imagining their personality and background,” she says. Now with translations made available in regional Indian languages like Hindi and Telugu apart from English, they are slicing through a larger Indian demographic. “The response from Telugu readers has been good. So we are thinking of adding more southern languages. Our goal is to expand to at least 11 Indian languages in the next few years,” adds Kim. The average daily readership varies between 60,000 to 1,00,000, of which 70% reads in English, 25% in Hindi and 5% in Telugu. Twenty six-year-old Dhanashree Kodkani had never read a Korean comic until she began translating one to Telugu in September 2019. Now, she feels disheartened when a series she is translating, ends. Dhanashree recalls titles she started with: Que Sera Sera and The Reason Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke's Mansion . “As someone who has a habit of reading subtitles, it really gets me when a joke or a moment is lost in translation. Hence, I am extra careful when I do this ,” she says. With the pandemic, there is a shift in preferences too. In 2021, K-webtoons that revolve around positive and uplifting stories are seeing more takers. Young adults are finding these simple narratives in the webtoon format a welcome escape. “It is more convenient, doesn’t cost any money if I am willing to wait for new episodes and it doesn’t require me to go to a store,” says Subhiksha, adding “For students like me, it is ideal entertainment. Everything can happen right from my phone.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/shin-ha-ri-says-namaskaram/article36240924.ece
02 September 2021||September 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Of sex, politics and discomfort||It’s the start of the day in Oxford. Amia Srinivasan probably woke up quite early for our morning Zoom call, but she doesn’t let on. Her long hair loose and her skin glowing, the Indian-American speaks in a clipped accent, pausing between questions as she frames her responses. It is easy to imagine the 36-year-old in the classroom at Oxford’s All Souls College, where she teaches philosophy and has held the prestigious Chichele Chair for Social and Political Theory (a statutory professorship) since January 2020. Much has been written about her being the first woman, the first person of colour, and the youngest to hold this position, but it is evident Srinivasan shrugs off these labels. Now, with the launch of her first non-fiction book, The Right to Sex , much is being written about her again. The divisive work — a collection of six essays that attempts to break down the politics of desire, discusses the pitfalls of pornography, and asks questions about whether one has the right to sex in a world where the personal is political — has had armchair philosophers, feminists, the LGBTQI+, and even peers critique her for her brazen take on sex. But she is open to it all. “I like criticism; I think it is an important part of the feminist tradition,” she tells me with a smile. The book grew out of an essay, Does anyone have the right to sex? (published in the London Review of Books in 2018), and was written over two summers in California, where, as she told The Guardian , she “would get up at 6 a.m. to surf before settling down to work”. It delves into uncomfortable questions: what makes one person eminently more desirable than another, who decides this, what is the relationship between feminism and state power, how does consent work in the #MeToo era. It is also a heavily-loaded gun that challenges what many feminists and philosophers have said so far. Srinivasan addresses some of these in her conversation with The Hindu.      What does The Right to Sex mean to you?  The notion I’m interested in is this idea rooted in male sexual entitlement — that men have a right to have a certain amount of sex, regardless of whether the women want to. You see this explicitly in play in the so-called incel subculture [involuntary celibates, who claim they are unable to get a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one]. These young men talk about themselves as if they are lonely and sexually marginalised, but what they are really upset about is that they are not getting their due, sexually speaking. [As Srinivasan explained in an earlier interview, they aren’t able to attract the sort of women that could confer a high sexual status on them.] This comes out of an ideology of male sexual entitlement.  Feminism has been repurposed today to suit the world we live in.  I think the resurgence of feminism is a good thing, but I do worry about some of the forms that it can take. Globally, there exists a certain kind of mainstream feminism that’s not fundamentally interested in critiquing structures, but in slotting women into pre-existing structures of inequality. So, while the question of how many women are in your boardroom, or how many women are in positions of political leadership matter, it stop us from questioning whether the boardroom is a good democratic structure to begin with. Should we have corporations exercising this much influence over society? Does party politics, as it now exists, really enfranchise people, especially women? I think there can be a tendency to focus on middle-class and wealthy women, and not pay enough attention to those most vulnerable.  H ow does the politics of desire play out in countries that are deeply patriarchal?  There’s a profound asymmetry in most societies. On the one hand, there’s an implicit understanding, even if people deny it objectively like they do in the U.K., that men, in some sense, are entitled to sex. For example, mostly everywhere rape in marriage is not recognised, or has only been recognised very recently. The whole point of the marriage contract is that men get to secure their entitlement to as much sex as they want. The flip side is that women aren’t entitled to sex on their terms. They play out differently in different cultures, but I do think it’s no coincidence that the assertion of male sexual entitlement goes hand in hand with the denial of women’s sexual agency, desire, and pleasure.   Why is u nhindered access to pornography problematic?   I wasn’t really concerned about pornography until I started teaching about the debates that feminists had in the U.S. and the U.K., especially in the 70s and 80s. And I found that my students responded very strongly, often siding with those who were very critical of pornography. I think the reason is because they are of a generation who have come of age sexually when online pornography is ubiquitous. This mainstream porn doesn’t help set expectations, tell them the truth about sex, offer alternative views. It’s porn [that is limiting] that trains people to experience pleasure as acts of male domination and female subordination.  Many of the concepts you refer to are quite w estern. What is the audience you wrote for ?  I’m a member of the Indian diaspora [born to Indian parents in Bahrain]. I’ve grown up in the U.S. and the U.K. and, as a result, most of my orienting points come from a feminist tradition within a kind of Anglophone tradition. I think some of these notions, like male sexual entitlement and rape culture, do travel quite well, but there are also important specificities of culture and history that shape regimes of sexual entitlement in particular countries. I don’t expect the book to make automatic sense, and I don’t aspire to a kind of completeness or global reach. But I do hope it contributes to a conversation.

02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Record rain creates mayhem as Delhi streets turn into rivers||Heavy rain lashed the national capital for the second straight day on Wednesday, leading to chaos on the streets due to waterlogging. Delhi received 112.1 mm of rainfall over a 24 hour period ending at 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday, and 76.5 mm of rainfall thereafter. It is the highest single-day precipitation in September in 19 years Delhi had recorded 126.8 mm of rainfall on September 13, 2002. The all-time record is 172.6 mm rainfall on September 16, 1963. The rain led to waterlogging on several major roads and serpentine queues of vehicles were seen moving at snail’s pace. There were also complaints about water entering shops and homes. At Connaught Place, water entered shops and the middle circle, and parking areas in the inner circle were waterlogged. Areas categorised as ‘critical’ by the Public Works Department (PWD), such as Minto Bridge, as well as hundreds of those categorised as ‘vulnerable’ were inundated for most of Tuesday night and most part of Wednesday. The PWD logged over 119 waterlogging complaints between 8.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, compared to 60 on Tuesday. Apart from Minto Bridge, the Pul Prahladpur and Azadpur underpasss were flooded yet again. The average rainfall that the drainage network of the city can cater to, according to the PWD, is 50 mm per day. The intensity of rain is likely to reduce with the Meteorological Department forecasting a generally cloudy sky with light to moderate rain/thundershowers on Thursday. Maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be around 31 and 25 degrees Celsius respectively. Delhi govt. statement On waterlogging causing mayhem in the city, the Delhi government said: “It has been raining heavily over the last two days. But what bears testimony to the work done to prevent waterlogging over the last few days is that issues such as buses getting stuck below the Minto Bridge did not arise. In addition, many places did not witness waterlogging. In future, we will try to ensure that waterlogging does not take place no matter how much it rains. The Delhi government will do whatever is needed in this regard.” BJP takes to Twitter Meanwhile, the Delhi BJP took to social media to accuse the AAP government of having completely failed at checking waterlogging across the Capital. “Government run by @ArvindKejriwal stands exposed, they have not worked on the Fundamentals which were the basic need of Delhi [sic],” North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari tweeted. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri shared a video of water falling from a flyover and tweeted: “Congratulations Kejriwal! They couldn’t transform Delhi into London or Singapore but by not cleaning PWD drains effectively the government has at least been able to inundate Delhi with water from the Niagra Falls!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/record-rain-creates-mayhem-as-delhi-streets-turn-into-rivers/article36240598.ece
02 September 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Rawat meets Amarinder to end infighting in Punjab Congress||Amid the ongoing infighting in the Punjab Congress, All India Congress Committee in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat on Wednesday met Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, a day after he met State party president Navjot Singh Sidhu. After the meeting, Mr. Rawat said he expects his party colleagues to restrain raising their grievances or issues through media as he himself follows the same practice. “When I impose a restrain over myself to not to talk to my party leaders through media, I believe that my party colleagues will also keep it in mind,” said Mr. Rawat, talking to reporters. Party’s central leadership is learnt to have sent Mr. Rawat to resolve the infighting in Punjab after four Ministers, including Sukhjinder Randhawa, Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Sukhbinder Sarkaria and Charanjit Channi, besides a few MLAs on August 24 had expressed “lack of faith in the leadership of the Chief Minister in fulfilling the party’s 2017 Assembly election promises.” Mr. Rawat said that he has urged that certain relief to electricity consumers should be given by the government, besides on the issue of Centre’s farm laws, the Chief Minister was requested to meet the State Governor again. “The Chief Minister informed me that actions were being taken surrounding the 18-point programme of the central leadership,” he said. Earlier last evening, Mr. Rawat had a meeting with Mr. Sidhu and working presidents Kuljit Nagra and Pawan Goel and Punjab Congress Committee general secretary (organisation) Pargat Singh. ‘Demand not justified’ Deliberations were held on finalising State unit’s organisational structure, on which Mr. Rawat said that Mr. Sidhu has given an assurance that the whole process will be geared up in the next fortnight, said sources privy to the matter, adding that Mr. Rawat also conveyed that demand for replacing the Chief Minister ahead of the polls was not justified. Party insiders said that Mr. Sidhu asserted that issues surrounding five priority areas of the ‘high commands’ 18-point agenda needed to be quickly addressed by the State government. Apology for remark Meanwhile, Mr Rawat courted a controversy after comparing State party president and working presidents with ‘Panj Pyaras’ (five beloved ones, who have a special place in Sikhism). However, on Wednesday he apologised, saying he didn’t have any intention to hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community. “It was wrong on my part to compare the working presidents with ‘Panj Pyare’, for which I sincerely apologies,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rawat-meets-amarinder-amid-infighting-in-punjab-congress/article36240579.ece
02 September 2021||JAIPUR,||Gandhian groups demand land restoration to Jaipur institution||Gandhian organisations here have demanded restoration of land to one of the oldest and leading institutions, Rajasthan Samagra Seva Sangh, whose allotment was cancelled and the buildings were sealed by the previous BJP regime in 2014. The land at a prime location in Jaipur also has the ‘samadhi’ of freedom fighter Gokulbhai Bhatt. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had assured a delegation of activists after the formation of Congress government in 2018 that the land would be restored without delay. However, the ‘samadhi’and the buildings still remain locked and the evicted persons are waiting endlessly. The current value of the land in Durgapura area, measuring around 8 bighas, runs into crores of rupees. The Samgara Seva Sangh had bought the land with a token sum in 1959 to establish its office and opened a Gram Swaraj School there to promote Sarvodaya and Gandhian thought and organise conferences and training camps. Allotment cancelled The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) sealed the premises, threw out all the residents and their belongings, cancelled the allotment and took over the land on June 7, 2014. Activists alleged that the JDA wanted to grab the property, convert it into real estate and grant it to land sharks. Samagra Seva Sangh president Sawai Singh told The Hindu on Wednesday that the sealing of the land and buildings amounted to the BJP’s “direct assault” on a civil society institution opposed to its ideology. “The BJP’s prejudice is understandable. What is more surprising is that we are not getting justice even in the Congress regime supposedly led by a Gandhian leader,” Mr. Singh said. Mr. Singh has shot off a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking her intervention in the matter. He pointed out that Samagra Seva Sangh had launched the Bhoodan-Gramdan movement and distributed about 6-lakh acre of land to landless villagers in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/gandhian-groups-demand-land-restoration-to-jaipur-institution/article36240572.ece

02 September 2021||Guwahati,||Meghalaya ‘scraps’ power project post protests||The Meghalaya government has “scrapped” an agreement with private power developers to execute the proposed 210 MW Umngot hydroelectric project following protests. But the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of local pressure groups is wary of the “ambiguity” of the announcement, as the government had sought public hearings on the project in April, a year after it was said to have been terminated. On August 30, Power Minister James Sangma said the project on the Umngot river was not on the government’s priority list. “We would like to supplement our existing hydropower generation with solar, wind and other renewable sources of energy,” he stated. What planted the seeds of doubt about Umngot was his statement that the government would seek the views of stakeholders if the project was taken up in the future. ‘Statement is ambiguous’ “The Power Minister’s statement is ambiguous. He did not specifically say if the project will be scrapped,” JAC member Treibor Raul Suchen told journalists in State capital Shillong. The memorandum of understanding for the Umngot dam was signed with the JP Group in 2007 but the government, in 2020, said the project stood terminated. “Yet, the government called for a public hearing each in East Khasi Hills and West Jaintia Hills district, indicating some other motive. The government should come up with a clear message to the stakeholders opposing the project about its fate,” Mr. Suchen said. Tourism forums have also sought clarity from the government. Meghalaya Tourism Development Forum (MTDF) president Allan West Kharkongor said, “We shall not entertain any discussions on the views of stakeholders on any future projects on the Umngot as the Power Minister said”. India’s clearest river The government had defended its plan to dam Umngot, arguably India’s clearest river. The dam was proposed to have been executed by the cash-strapped Meghalaya Energy Corporation Limited at a site in the coal-rich East Jaintia Hills district but more than a dozen villages downstream in the West Khasi Hills district opposed it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/meghalaya-scraps-power-project-post-protests/article36240577.ece
02 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||JNU Executive Council to take call on counter-terrorism course today||Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar on Wednesday said the Academic Council of JNU had approved a course titled ‘Counter Terrorism, Asymmetric Conflicts and Strategies for Cooperation among Major Powers’ for students at the School of Engineering. The JNU Executive Council will discuss granting final approval to the course on Thursday. The objective of the new course is to give an in-depth understanding on the challenges emanating from terrorism to India’s national security and how India can equip itself with the adequate responses in the case of any eventuality. “The way things have unfolded in India’s neighbourhood are proving highly detrimental to India’s national security. It is imperative that an academic institution like JNU takes the lead and builds a good set of counter-terrorism specialists,” he said. Teachers raise concerns A section of JNU teachers and students has objected to the introduction of the course, alleging it states that ‘jihadi terrorism’ is the only form of ‘fundamentalist-religious terrorism’. JNU Teachers’ Association secretary Moushumi Basu said, “Such a course should not be taught and should be withdrawn. It’s problematic and gives a simplistic view on the topic.” Meanwhile, Mr. Kumar said there is a need to evolve India’s perspective in a balanced and objective manner: “The course has the potential to build a strong narrative for India and provide an in-depth understanding of global and regional terrorist networks.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/jnu-executive-council-to-take-call-on-counter-terrorism-course-today/article36240585.ece
02 September 2021||Guwahati,||Assam providing cash relief only to teachers of RSS-managed schools: SFI||The Assam State Committee of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) has slammed the Himanta Biswa Sarma government for providing financial relief to teachers of schools managed only by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The SFI’s State committee members told journalists on Wednesday that the BJP-led Assam government has taken up a discriminatory policy of providing one-time financial aid of Rs. 5,000 from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund only to the teachers of Sankaradeva Shishu Niketan, a chain of educational institutions under Vidya Bharati, a private organisation managed by the RSS. The aid is for minimising financial difficulties faced by lowly-paid private school teachers due to the prolonged COVID-19 restrictions. One-time support “We condemn this biased act and demand extension of this one-time financial support to all teachers of private as well as venture schools,” SFI’s State general secretary Nirangkush Nath said. A venture school is a category of education institution established by the people of a locality or village prior to January 1, 2006. The SFI said Dr. Sarma had earlier provided a financial grant to the Sankaradeva Shishu Niketans for building infrastructure when he was the Education Minister. “The current Education Minister, Ronoj Pegu, said ‘no’ when our delegation had met him on August 28 to ask if any financial support was being provided to the private schools,” SFI’s State vice-president Pratul Barman said. The act of spending government or public funds for political gain cannot be accepted, the SFI said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-providing-cash-relief-only-to-teachers-of-rss-managed-schools-sfi/article36240576.ece

Black-necked crane, only found in Ladakh region, was the State bird of J&K before August 5, 2019. “Black-necked crane and snow leopard are two endangered species and the pride of Ladakh,” said Konchok Stanzin, Councillor from the Chushul constituency. Black-necked cranes, considered loyal couples, are only found in Ladakh’s Changthang region. Snow leopard, whose numbers are dwindling wordwide, has been categorised as “vulnerable” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ladakh-adopts-state-animal-and-bird/article36240583.ece

The university’s highest decision-making body, on August 31, paved the way for implementation of FYUP from the 2022-23 academic session. Teaching jobs “FYUP will dilute the quality and rigour of the courses and reduce the requirements of the teachers. The fluctuating workload caused by Academic Bank of Credit and Multiple Entry and Exit Scheme will enhance contractualisation of teaching jobs. The teachers moved a resolution for absorption of Adhoc and temporary teachers... but it was not allowed by the chairperson undemocratically,” the AAD said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/fyup-will-dilute-quality-of-courses/article36240602.ece

Despite heavy rain, a large number of party workers turned up for the Yatra. Earlier this week, the U.P. police booked over 500 workers, including senior party leaders Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh, for taking out a similar Yatra in Agra.
