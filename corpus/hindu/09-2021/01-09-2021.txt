01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||UNSC resolution addresses ‘key concerns’ on Afghanistan: India||Despite the abstention of two “P5” countries — Russia and China — from the India-led United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2593, the Government of India said it was a “matter of satisfaction” that the resolution addressed India’s “key concerns” on Afghanistan. P5 refers to the five permanent members of the UNSC — China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. According to official sources, the resolution, which called on the Taliban to keep their commitments on preventing terror groups in Afghanistan and urged them to assist the safe evacuations of all Afghan nationals wishing to leave the country, was the result of a careful coordination and “high-level” official contacts with UNSC members, including a call to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The efforts were overseen by a special new group led by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. “The resolution demands that Afghan territory should not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter and train terrorists and plan or finance terrorist attacks. It mentions individuals designated by Resolution 1267, (which includes the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammad),” said the sources, explaining why India played an “active role” in ensuring that the resolution went through on Monday, a day before it demitted presidency of the UNSC. Explaining the split within the P5, Russia and China said they wanted all the groups, especially the Islamic State and the Uighur East Turkestan Islamic Movement to be named specifically in the document, and listed a number of objections to the drafting of the resolution. They accused the U.S., the U.K. and France, the sponsors of the resolution, of having rushed it through on a “tight schedule” while seeking to absolve the U.S. of responsibility, and distinguishing between “their and our terrorists”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/unsc-resolution-addresses-key-concerns-on-afghanistan-india/article36216444.ece
01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Economy grows 20.1% in Q1, lags pre-pandemic level||India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 20.1% in the first quarter of 2021-22, compared with the 24.4% contraction recorded in the corresponding quarter a year ago, but economic activity remained well below the pre-pandemic levels, thanks to the second wave of COVID-19. Gross Value Added (GVA) in the economy during the April to June period rose 18.8%, as per the National Statistical Office (NSO), from a 22.2% dip in the first quarter of 2020-21. GVA from agriculture, forestry and fishing, the only sector to grow amid last year’s national lockdown, picked up pace to grow 4.5% in Q1 this year from 3.5% in Q1 2020-21. Overall GVA in Q1 was still 7.8% lower than the first quarter of 2019-20, at Rs. 30,47,516 crore, while GDP remained 9.2% lower, indicating that the economy still has some way to go before it returns to activity levels prevalent prior to the pandemic. Electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services, whose GVA grew 14.3% in Q1 of 2021-22, compared with a 9.9% fall last year, was the only sector along with agriculture, forestry and fishing, to recover beyond the pre-pandemic levels of 2019-20. The government said the NSO numbers reaffirmed its prediction of an “imminent V-shaped recovery” made this time last year, and said the 20.1% rise in GDP “despite the intense second wave in the months of April and May” highlighted the continued economic recovery. However, economists, as well as the NSO, cautioned about reading too much into the record quarterly growth print. “The spectacular headline number cannot be interpreted as a V-shaped recovery. The fact that the economy has still not recovered to the 2019-20 level, which was in itself seen as a disastrous year for growth, is not good news,” said Alok Sheel, the RBI Chair Professor for macroeconomics at ICRIER. He added that the first quarter GDP was even lower than that of the first quarter of 2018-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/economy-grows-201-in-q1-lags-pre-pandemic-level/article36216438.ece

01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Apex court orders demolition of Supertech’s twin towers in Noida||The Supreme Court on Tuesday condemned the “dubious dealings” of builders and authorities in metropolitan cities that rob ordinary people of their life savings and dream of owning a house. Ordering the demolition of two unauthorised 40-storey towers of real estate major Supertech Limited in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah said flat buyers were the ones who suffered the most from these illegal activities. ‘Long battle’ “Flat buyers suffer the impact of the unholy nexus between builders and planners. Their quality of life is affected the most. Yet, confronted with the economic might of developers and the might of legal authority wielded by planning bodies, the few who raise their voices have to pursue a long and expensive battle for rights with little certainty of outcomes… They are denied access to information and are victims of misinformation,” Justice Chandrachud wrote in a 140-page judgment pronounced. The court said the case at hand had revealed numerous occasions on which the officials of the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) and Supertech colluded to devise the building of the mammoth and illegal constructions. “The case has revealed a nefarious complicity of the planning authority in the violation by the developer of the provisions of law,” Justice Chandrachud observed. The court upheld the Allahabad High Court’s order to demolish the two towers. It ordered the demolition to be carried out in three months at the cost of Supertech and under the supervision of NOIDA. Supertech should pay the RWA Rs. 2 crore in costs in a month, the SC directed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/apex-court-orders-demolition-of-supertechs-twin-towers-in-noida/article36216720.ece
01 September 2021||HYDERABAD,||Krishna river board to try for a balancing act||The Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) has a tough job in hand of convincing the two member states, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, for a mutually agreeable ratio of water sharing for the ongoing (June 2021-May 2022) water year, when it hears the two States’ demands across the table on Wednesday. The meeting, which was initially scheduled for August 27, is basically convened to discuss water sharing for the current water year in the backdrop of escalation of disputes between the two states, particularly after AP has taken up Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) to divert about 6 tmc ft water from Srisailam reservoir every day. As part of discussing and deciding the water sharing, the river board has Telangana’s demand for water share in the 50:50 (TS:AP) ratio and the AP’s demand for 70:30 (AP:TS) ratio before it. Since bifurcation of combined AP in June 2014 into TS and AP, the two states have mutually agreed for 66:34 ratio share in 2015 on temporary basis for that year since the finalisation of State-wise share is yet to be decided by the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal (KWDT-II). The same ratio is being renewed and followed every year by agreeing for the share afresh at the river board meetings. “It was mutually agreed at the June 2015 meeting to treat 512:299 tmc ft share (AP:TS) only as a temporary arrangement and it should not be claimed as a right before any forum/tribunal. However, in violation of the agreement reached before the then Union Water Resources secretary, AP had claimed the share before KWDT-II,” a senior official of the Irrigation Department told The Hindu . “Even as per parameters such as catchment area, cultivable area, drought prone area and population, Telangana is entitled for 70.8% share in Krishna water against 29.2% of AP out of the combined share of erstwhile AP,” the official explained. AP’s demands are to stop Telangana’s continuous power generation at Srisailam, and to account for only 34 tmc ft water utilisation under minor irrigation sources (in the Krishna Basin), including evaporation losses, to consider Godavari water being diverted to Krishna Basin and allot a similar quantity to it in Krishna water. Similarly, the demands of Telangana are to stop AP ‘unapproved’ diversion of water from Srisailam to outside basin areas, to account for only 20% of water being drawn for drinking needs as per prescribed norms and for allocation of water in Krishna in lieu of Godavari water being diverted to Krishna Basin by AP from Pattiseema project. “Andhra Pradesh has huge unapproved and unauthorised diversion capability of 4.7 tmc ft per day (existing) from Srisailam even without RLIS, but Telangana has the capacity to draw only 0.28 tmc ft a day from the common reservoir, and that too, by lifting the water against Andhra Pradesh’s gravity drawal of 4 tmc ft and 0.7 tmc ft drawal capacity by lifting,” the Telangana official said. A joint meeting of the Krishna and Godavari river boards is scheduled for Wednesday evening to discuss the way forward for operationalising the boards’ purview from October 14, including deposit of Rs. 400 crore each funded by the two States as one-time seed money by September 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/krmb-to-try-for-a-balancing-act/article36216836.ece

01 September 2021||Mumbai,||Jan Ashirwad Yatra is putting lives at risk: CM||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party for organising Jan Ashirwad Yatra despite warnings about a third wave of COVID-19. Such yatras put people’s lives at risk, he added. Health guidelines being followed the world over have to be followed at any cost, the CM said. “This government is not against any festival... The guidelines prescribed to combat against this pandemic have to be followed. The Central government has directed States to take precautions, expressing fears that the spread of the virus might increase during festivals,” said Mr. Thackeray. He was speaking at an event organised by Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, at which an oxygen plant built by his foundation was dedicated to the service of people on the occasion of Dahi handi festival. BJP and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena have called a protest demanding permission to celebrate Dahi handi.

Tej Lohit Reddy on Tuesday ordered the demolition of four check dams of PVR Naturo Resorts, owned by P.V. Anvar, Nilambur MLA, at Kakkadampoyil in the district. The order said the owner was to demolish the illegal check dams within a month or else the Koodaranji gram panchayat secretary should take up the job and the expenses should be incurred from the owner. In his order, the Collector said the check dams were constructed blocking the natural flow of water and it could trigger disasters in the area. This had been reported by the district geologist and the soil conservation officer. Invoking the Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation Act of 2003, the Collector said that all rivers, streams, lakes, and rivulets existing in non-private lands belonged to the State government. Any person or establishment constructing check dams or dams or bunds and diverting water had been prohibited from doing so by the law. The district soil officer had reported that three concrete check dams and four check dams were constructed in the resort and they prevented the natural flow of water during the monsoon. The Collector’s order followed a verdict of the Kerala High Court on a complaint filed by All Kerala River Protection Committee secretary T.V. Rajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/collector-orders-demolition-of-check-dams-at-kakkadampoyil/article36216852.ece

In the same event, Sharad Kumar secured bronze. Mariyappan, the 26-year-old from Salem in Tamil Nadu, had won a gold in the T42 section during the previous edition at Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Cut to the latest Paralympics, he narrowly missed the glittering medal but his best of 1.86 m helped him seal the silver with Sharad following at 1.83 m. American Sam Grewe topped at 1.88 m to keep the two Indians at bay. If shooting was a dampener for India in the preceding Olympics, amends have been made during the current Paralympics. Extending that vein of form was Singhraj Adhana, who won a bronze in the P1 men’s air pistol SH1 category. Singhraj finished with a score of 216.8, which proved adequate. The cumulative effort of Mariyappan, Sharad and Singhraj boosted India’s overall medals tally to 10 inclusive of two golds, five silvers and three bronzes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/triple-delight-for-india-at-tokyo-paralympics/article36216434.ece

Meteorologists said that because of the shortfall in August, which normally receives the second highest rainfall in the four monsoon months, it was unlikely that rainfall in September, even if substantial, would be enough to wipe out the deficit., and India could well end up with “below normal” rainfall, which is characterised by rainfall being 90-96% of the long period average of 88 cm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/24-shortfall-recorded-in-august-rain/article36216428.ece

01 September 2021||Srinagar,||Militants’ kin get olive branch||Top Army and police officers on Tuesday held a conversation-cum-counselling session with nearly 80 families of militant recruits in south Kashmir in a bid to initiate their safe return to the mainstream. “We have been providing opportunities [to trapped militants] to surrender during live encounters since the past year. These families whom we met on Tuesday were asked to convince their children [newly-recruited terrorists] to return to the mainstream. We made an earnest appeal to them,” Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar told The Hindu . Mr. Kumar and the Army’s General Officer Commanding (GOC) 15 Corps Lt. Gen. Devendra Pratap Pandey interacted with the family members in the volatile Shopian district and exhorted them “to shun the path of violence”. The Army promised to “offer all assistance if the youths intend to lay down their arms”. “All assistance will be provided to the misguided youth, in enabling them to surrender and the security forces will work with these youth, to address their concerns and assist them in joining the mainstream,” the GOC said. The Army said the interaction was intended “to instil confidence and convey the intent of the security forces, among the families of active terrorists”. The relatives of the militants were called from the districts of Pulwama, Kulgam and Shopian, which have contributed around 60% of the 88 recruitments made by militant outfits this year. The parents of Sumair Ahmad Najar, Umar Ishfaq Malik, Naseer Ahmad Wani, Adil Ahmad Wani, Abid Ramzan Sheikh and Sameer Ahmad Sheikh, all hailing from Shopian, were counselled by top officials of the security forces. According to the police data, militant recruitment has shown no let-up since the Centre ended Jammu and Kashmir’s special constitutional position on August 5, 2019. A total of 167 youth were recruited by militants in 2020 and 88 have been recruited this year so far. Meanwhile, the police arrested four militants behind the grenade attack on a sarpanch’s house in north Kashmir’s Baramulla on August 22. “During the interrogation of these two youths, it came to fore that that they were working as over-ground workers of the Lashkar-e-Taiba [LeT],” a police spokesman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kin-of-militants-offered-an-olive-branch/article36216436.ece
01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||India envoy in Doha meets Taliban leader||In signs that the Government of India has softened its stance on the Taliban, the Ministry of External Affairs announced that its Ambassador to Qatar Deepak Mittal met with the head of the Taliban’s political office, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, on Tuesday. While Indian security officials and diplomats are understood to have engaged with Taliban representatives for several months, this is the first time that the government has publicly acknowledged such a meeting, which, the Ministry said, came at the request of the Taliban. Officials told The Hindu that the request came as Taliban leaders have been keen to receive some “acceptability”, and that India remained “cautious” about its approach to the group. “Discussions focused on safety, security and early return of Indian nationals stranded in Afghanistan. The travel of Afghan nationals, especially minorities, who wish to visit to India also came up,” a statement issued by the Ministry said, adding that Mr. Mittal said India’s concern was that “Afghanistan’s soil should not be used for anti-Indian activities and terrorism in any manner”. About 140 Indians and members of the Sikh minority still remain in Kabul, and need to be brought back. India has thus far transported 565 persons, including 112 Afghan nationals, to Delhi. According to the Ministry’s statement, the Taliban leader assured the Indian Ambassador that all the issues would be “positively addressed”. Mr. Stanekzai, who trained and graduated out of the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun, made a statement on Saturday calling for India to continue its political and trade ties with Afghanistan. The meeting and the statements came after signals from New Delhi that it was recalibrating its earlier position on the Taliban as a terrorist group. In particular, India has had concerns about the Haqqani Group, which is a part of the Taliban, and Taliban deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, who were responsible for the attacks on the Indian Embassy in 2008-09. In the past few months, however, the Ministry had said it was in touch with “various stakeholders” in Afghanistan, and, according to sources, Indian officials have met with Taliban representatives in Doha. After the Taliban takeover of Kabul, when India decided to pull out all Embassy staff, they were stopped from leaving for the airport by gunmen guarding the city, and the government had to open its channels to the Taliban to secure their release. According to sources, the Embassy in Kabul worked its communications to the Taliban through other countries, and eventually received permission after some money changed hands. As a result, it remains to be seen whether the Modi government will agree to re-establish its diplomatic presence in the country and to recognise a Taliban government, once it is formed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-envoy-in-doha-meets-taliban-leader/article36216374.ece
01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||IMD forecast foiled by 24% rain shortfall||Far from the forecast of a “normal” monsoon in August, India ended the month with a 24% shortfall, according to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This brings India’s overall monsoon rainfall deficit to 9%, just a percentage-point shy of what would be considered “deficient” rainfall. Meteorologists said that because of the shortfall in August, which normally receives the second highest rainfall in the four monsoon months, it was unlikely that rainfall in September, even if substantial, would be enough to wipe out the deficit, and India could well end up with “below normal” rainfall, which is characterised by rainfall being 90-96% of the long period average of 88 cm. In June, the IMD, as part of its forecast, had also said that rainfall in northwest, south, east and central India would be “normal” or within an 8% error window of their historical average. This forecast too has been significantly off the mark, with Northwest India and Central India registering a 14% shortfall. The key reason for the August monsoon failure has been an extended break in rainfall from August 8 to 18. “We expected it to last three or four days, but a week or a 10-day break is quite difficult to recover from,” said Mahesh Palawat, meteorologist at Skymet, a private weather forecasting company. It too, as the IMD, expected August rain to be “normal”. M. Mohapatra, Director-General, IMD, declined to comment to The Hindu , saying that the organisation would be addressing the forecasting failure at a press conference shortly. Depressions on decline Given the influence of the ocean surface temperatures on the monsoon, meteorological forecasts in June were of “neutral conditions” in the central Pacific, implying that these would not have a bearing on the monsoon. The Indian Ocean too was not expected to contribute. Wind-bearing depressions in the Bay of Bengal, coupled with moisture from the Arabian Sea, usually inject surges of rain over central India. But this did not happen and did not salvage the break-like conditions, according to Mr. Palawat. He said that September, though contributing only 17 cm of rainfall unlike 25 cm in August, would see a few more depressions. Other meteorologists said that large effects of global warming were impacting monsoon rainfall. The number of rain-bearing depressions in the Bay of Bengal was declining and pre-monsoon cyclones, such as Tauktae that veered very close to Mumbai, possibly altered heat distribution patterns over the landmass, influencing moisture distribution and thereby causing erratic rainfall, said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. “A single month’s failure isn’t climate change, but the predicted pattern of long dry spells with bursts of heavy rain is one of the consequences of warming,” he told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/imd-forecast-foiled-by-24-rain-shortfall/article36216384.ece

01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||In a first, nine SC judges take oath in one stroke||Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana on Tuesday read out the oath of allegiance to the Constitution to nine new judges of the Supreme Court, reducing the vacancies in the court to just one. The occasion was historic on several fronts. It was the first time as many as nine judges were sworn in to the Supreme Court in a single stroke. Three of them are women judges. One of them, Justice B.V. Nagarathna, is slated to be CJI in 2027. With the new appointments, the number of women judges in the Supreme Court has gone up to four from the existing one, Justice Indira Banerjee. This is the highest number of women judges ever in the Supreme Court. It was also the first time the court allowed a live telecast of the ceremony. Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka took oath as the Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court on May 10, 2019. As Chief Justice, he led the Bench that passed a slew of directions to monitor COVID-19 management in the State. Justice Vikram Nath took oath as the Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court on September 10, 2019. He has championed personal liberty in preventive detention cases. He has highlighted need for transparency in COVID-19 data. He is in line to be CJI. Justice Jitendra Kumar Maheshwari was the Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the Sikkim High Court before his appointment to the Supreme Court. Justice Hima Kohli was the Chief Justice of the Telangana High Court. She played a vital role in ensuring that people were not denied medical treatment during the pandemic. Justice Nagarathna was a judge at the Karnataka High Court before her appointment as a Supreme Court judge. She is a vocal champion of women’s rights. Justice C.T. Ravikumar was a judge in the Kerala High Court before his elevation as Supreme Court judge. He famously said “law is long but life is short” in the context of the need for speedy justice while splitting the trial in the SNC Lavalin case. Justice M.M. Sundresh was a judge of the Madras High Court before his elevation to the Supreme Court. Justice Bela M. Trivedi is the first woman judge from the Gujarat High Court to be elevated to the Supreme Court. Justice P.S. Narasimha was a senior advocate before his appointment as judge of the Supreme Court. He is the ninth lawyer to be directly appointed from the Supreme Court Bar. He was the Additional Solicitor-General.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-a-first-nine-sc-judges-take-oath-in-one-stroke/article36216368.ece
01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||School staff to get first jab before Sept. 30||States have been given a month’s time to ensure all school staff get at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, School Education Secretary Anita Karwal said after a meeting with State Education Departments on Tuesday. An initial comprehensive assessment of the current levels of vaccination among teachers and non-teaching staff will be available by Friday, according to a senior official. States will then continue to update the information on a weekly basis. This comes a week after the Health Ministry announced that two crore additional vaccines would be sent to States by August 31 to vaccinate all teachers and non-teaching staff. Most States have reopened school buildings and started in-person classes for high school students or will do so next month. [NOTE: that is, in September] The vaccination strategy was discussed at a virtual meeting chaired by Ms. Karwal on the implementation of the school safety guidelines issued by the National Disaster Management Authority. She advised all States and Union Territories to complete the first dose during September, adding that there must be rigorous follow up for the second dose. Joint road map “States and UTs will jointly design a road map at the district level for vaccination of all teaching and non-teaching staff,” Ms. Karwal said, according to an official statement. .” Most States have launched priority vaccination drives for school staff, with some making it mandatory for teachers to get at least one dose. On Tuesday, Tamil Nadu Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said 95% of teaching and non teaching staff have been vaccinated. Over 98% of Delhi government school teachers have received at least one dose. Chhattisgarh’s Principal Secretary for school education Alok Shukla told The Hindu that though the State had prioritised teachers as frontline workers requiring vaccination, it did not have a sufficient supply of vaccine doses. “We have used all the doses we have been given, and have not received any additional doses for teachers as was promised,” said Dr. Shukla, adding that whatever was available needed to be used for the second dose of those who had already got a first dose. “The Centre can only give deadlines, but they are not giving us vaccines,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/school-staff-to-get-first-jab-before-sept-30/article36216389.ece
01 September 2021||New Delhi,||G-23 debates possibility of Kishor joining Cong.||Janmashtami celebrations at Congress leader Kapil Sibal’s residence on Monday provided the perfect setting for the G-23, or the group of 23 dissenting leaders, to deliberate the state of affairs in the party, including the possibility of election strategist Prashant Kishor joining it. Some of them are said to be strongly opposed to the idea of Mr. Kishor’s lateral entry, but the group is likely to adopt a “wait and watch” policy. The “informal get-together” comes a year after the G-23 had written to party chief Sonia Gandhi about revamping the organisation. Among those who assembled at Mr. Sibal’s house were Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Mukul Wasnik, Vivek Tankha and Bhupinder Singh Hooda. A few senior leaders, who are said to be backing Mr. Kishor’s induction, are learnt to have joined the discussions virtually. “There are certainly grave apprehensions about outsourcing the party. It does not reflect well on the leadership since the Congress has a lot of talented people. But it won’t become a flashpoint as we are adopting a wait and watch policy for now,” a member of the G-23 told The Hindu . “Eventually, it is the Congress Working Committee [CWC] and not the G-23 that will take a call,” he said. Senior leaders A.K. Antony and Ambika Soni had been asked to take the feedback of the CWC members. Accordingly, discussions were held among CWC members in separate groups. Opinion, however, is divided over making Mr. Kishor a general secretary and a CWC member straight away. “The Congress is a 135-year-old institution and not a start-up where someone comes in with fancy ideas and takes over. Without leaders like West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin or Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, his strategy won’t be much. We have seen his effectiveness in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election when he worked for the Congress-SP alliance,” a leader said. The G-23 leaders are said to have discussed the party’s handling of the Punjab and Chhattisgarh crises and the debacle in the Assembly elections in Kerala, Assam and West Bengal. “The report of the committee that went into the reasons for the debacle in these States has neither been discussed at the CWC nor among the leaders. Like the A.K. Antony report [that examined the 2014 Lok Sabha poll results], this report, too, may be buried,” said a third leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/g-23-debates-possibility-of-kishor-joining-cong/article36216371.ece
01 September 2021||New Delhi,||Nyay to be Cong. pivot in Uttarakhand||The Congress campaign in the upcoming Uttarakhand Assembly election will centre on “Nyay”, the minimum income guarantee programme that the party had first proposed in its manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The Nyay-Nyuntam Ayay Yojana guaranteed a cash transfer of Rs. 72,000 a year to five crore families who constitute the poorest 20% of India. The Congress manifesto had said the scheme had been crafted to help the poor without in “anyway affecting the goal of fiscal prudence”. However, the party has been unable to implement Nyay in the original form as promised in its 2019 manifesto in any of the Congress-ruled States. Sources said in Uttarakhand, too, the scheme will be adjusted according to the fiscal health of the State. “We are still working out the details but the form and contours of the State-specific NYAY scheme will not be the same as the 2019 one. It could have different components like an unemployment allowance or a minimum income for women,” a senior Congress leader in the State said. The Congress’s social media campaign in the State will be based on two slogans — “ Nyay Sangh Samruddh Uttarakhand ” and “ Shuru Hoga Vikas Ka Naya Adhyay, Har Uttarakhandi Ko Milega Nyay ”. On September 3, the party’s State unit has planned a massive Parivartan Yatra. The party has also started its social media outreach. “We have managed to rope in 1,000 volunteers who shall amplify the Congress message further through WhatsApp groups in each district,” the party’s social media in-charge, Rohan Gupta, said. The work on the social media campaign started about a month back and a control room has been set up in Dehradun. In the next few months, the party aims to have such control rooms in every zone in the State. While Nyay will be the central theme, Mr. Gupta said that the rest of the manifesto will be framed by the voters themselves. “Our volunteers will reach out to people and get direct feedback on the shortcomings of the BJP government and their expectations from us. Our manifesto will be based on this exercise,” he said. On July 3, Pushkar Singh Dhami was sworn in as the fourth chief minister in this term of the BJP government. The Congress is banking on the disarray in the BJP along with the strong resentment against the State government for its inept handling of the COVID pandemic. The tourism industry, which is the mainstay for the people of the stay has collapsed because of the pandemic induced travel restrictions leading to high unemployment rate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nyay-to-be-cong-pivot-in-uttarakhand/article36216352.ece
01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Concerns over Afghanistan’s membership in SAARC arise||With uncertainty hanging over the international representation of Afghanistan under the Taliban, a question has risen over its membership in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which is scheduled to meet next in Islamabad. Veteran diplomats here observed that the fate of Afghanistan’s membership, and even the future of the SAARC to some extent, depends on the Taliban creating an inclusive government. “The responsibility of inviting the member countries lies with the host, which in this case is Pakistan. After Tuesday’s meeting in Doha between Indian Ambassador Deepak Mittal and Taliban’s Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, it appears that the South Block is not averse to revising its policy. Ultimately, it depends on what kind of an inclusive government the Taliban can create in Kabul,” said former Indian Ambassador K.P. Fabian. Despite the Indo-Pakistan political problems that created a hurdle in the smooth functioning of the SAARC in recent years, the organisation’s members have maintained coordination in dealing with the pandemic. Pakistan, though not a beneficiary of India’s vaccine diplomacy, has participated in discussions on the pandemic at virtual events. The question on representation of Afghanistan at the SAARC has come up especially since a similar issue is yet to be addressed by the United Nations. Given the Taliban’s past of human rights violations and violent methods, there are concerns about granting it a seat at the world platform. India’s main challenge may arise if Pakistan insists on an unreformed Taliban representing Kabul at the SAARC summit. A major disagreement on this line may even splinter the SAARC, said an expert. Afghanistan was admitted into the SAARC as the eighth member in 2007 when the country was led by President Hamid Karzai. Over the years, it has found representation in many SAARC projects covering education and sustainable development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/concerns-over-afghanistans-membership-in-saarc-arise/article36216366.ece
01 September 2021||GUWAHATI,||PM calls Himanta as floods hit 5.74 lakh people in Assam||Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday as floods forced 5.74 lakh people out of their homes in 22 of the State’s 34 districts. “Spoke to Assam CM Shri @himantabiswa and took stock of the flood situation in parts of the State. Assured all possible support from the Centre to help mitigate the situation. I pray for the safety and well-being of those living in the affected areas,” the PM tweeted. According to an update by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), a child died on Tuesday, taking the death toll to three in two days. Several rivers, including the Brahmaputra, were flowing above the danger level. The ASDMA data said 1,278 villages in 61 revenue circles have been affected. Crops across 39,831 hectares have been affected was in areas. Of the 5,73,938 affected people, 1,91,821 were women and 1,44,582 children. The authorities set up 105 relief camps where 4,009 of the displaced people were taking shelter. Roads and infrastructure were damaged in several districts. The rising water of the Brahmaputra inundated more than 70% of the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve. So far, nine animals died.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-calls-himanta-as-floods-hit-574-lakh-people-in-assam/article36216386.ece
01 September 2021||New Delhi,||‘Discipline’ lawmakers, says Venkaiah||Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday exhorted voters to discipline the 5,000 elected representatives in Parliament, Legislative Assemblies and Legislative Councils by naming and shaming “disruptors”. Disrupted and dysfunctional legislatures can disrupt the lives of the people and the dreams of the nation, Mr. Naidu said while delivering the first Pranab Mukherjee Memorial Lecture, organised by the Pranab Mukherjee Legacy Foundation on the occasion of the first death anniversary of the former President. Calling the campaign ‘Mission 5000’, Mr. Naidu also prescribed the possible action that the public can take. “Various elements of this campaign could be to identify the disruptors and raise the same when such lawmakers visit respective constituencies and areas; to launch Mission 5000 social media handles constituency or State-wise and post the names of disruptors with comments,” he said in his lecture delivered online. The Vice-President’s speech has to be seen in context of the recent monsoon session which was washed out because of impasse between the government and the Opposition on holding a debate on Pegasus cyberattack. On the last two days of the session, Opposition protests turned violent in Rajya Sabha as contentious bills like the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill were passed ignoring demands for scrutiny by a Parliamentary Committee. Mr. Naidu is considering taking serious disciplinary action against many opposition members. The “common Indian”, he said, has been the hero of India’s democratic project, who sometimes even forgoes daily wages to vote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/discipline-lawmakers-says-venkaiah/article36216362.ece
01 September 2021||Firozabad,||40 die of suspected dengue in Firozabad||Firozabad District Magistrate Chandra Vijay Singh has ordered closure of all schools for classes 1 to 8 till September 6 following the death of around 40 persons, mostly children, due to suspected dengue in the past few days. The District Magistrate, in his order issued on Monday night, said it will be applicable to all government and non-government schools as well as coaching institutions. He warned of strict action against anyone disobeying the order. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who had visited some dengue patients in the district on Monday, said 32 children and seven adults have died till now. He had said that teams would be formed to ascertain the cause of the deaths. However, Firozabad MLA Manish Asija had told PTI on Sunday that more than 40 children have died due to dengue in the district since August 22. The Chief Minister said that the first case was detected on August 18 and family members of patients started their treatment in private hospitals and clinics. Testing samples He had also said that samples from some patients should be sent to King George's Medical University in Lucknow and National Institute of Virology in Pune. The Chief Minister had directed officials to ensure proper sanitation in the district. He had also visited the 100-bed ward of the government hospital to meet the children affected by dengue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/40-die-of-suspected-dengue-in-firozabad/article36216379.ece
01 September 2021||GUWAHATI,||Two years since NRC draft, lakhs still in limbo||More than 19 lakh of the 3.3 crore applicants were left out of the complete draft of Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) published on August 31, 2019. But the stalling of the updating exercise has cast a cloud of uncertainty over 8.37 lakh more people across the State. This is because the biometric details of 27,43,396 people collected before the publication of the draft continue to be frozen. “The NRC process should have been taken to its logical conclusion or continued within the schedule. But the suspension of the exercise has denied documents such as Aadhaar card to many while thousands are being deprived of ration cards and other government benefits,” senior advocate Hafiz Rashid Ahmed Choudhury said. Increasing trauma The trauma for the excluded people is increasing with the time taken for the exercise to resume, he said. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) had collected the biometric details of 27.43 lakh people who had been delisted from the initial complete draft published on December 31, 2018. Some 8.37 lakh of them made it to the NRC compete draft published eight months later. The collection of biometrics followed a Supreme Court-approved standard operating procedure (SOP) in November 2018. Fingerprints, retina scan and other details were collected during the hearing of claims for the excluded people to be included in the NRC and objections to the inclusion of people who may have figured in the citizens’ list erroneously or through alleged manipulation. These hearings were conducted from January 1 to a few weeks before the publication of the complete list. There are several factors why the biometrics are frozen. The Registrar General of India (RGI) has not yet issued a notification on the NRC, which questions the legality of the list. The Supreme Court, which supervised the exercise from 2013, has not heard cases related to NRC since January 2020. And the BJP government in the State wants the NRC reverified for a “corrected” list. In February 2020, NRC State Coordinator Hitesh Dev Goswami wrote to the Assam government advising the unlocking of the biometric details of the 8.37 lakh people who made it back to the list. The State’s Home and Political Department said the Centre had accordingly been sounded. Officials at the UIDAI’s regional office in Guwahati said the Aadhaar numbers of people with the “NRC cloud” could not be issued until a clarification from the RGI reached the authority via the department. Rejection slips Without the RGI’s notification, the NRC authority cannot issue rejection slips to the 19.06 lakh people excluded from the register. Such a slip outlines the reasons for a person left out of the list. According to the SOP, each excluded person was to have been issued a rejection slip for appealing to a Foreigners’ Tribunal within 120 days of receiving the slip. The tribunals would then hear their cases for inclusion in the register or exclusion for good. Apart from those who were delisted for faulty or lack of proper documents, the excluded include the DF, DV and PFT — acronyms for “declared foreigner”, “doubtful voter” and “pending in Foreigners’ Tribunal”. A majority of those excluded are Bengali-speaking Muslims and Hindus suspected to have come illegally from Bangladesh. About a lakh are ‘DV’ Gurkhas, who are expected to make it to the NRC automatically after the Assam government had through a recent notification exempted the community from cases in Foreigners’ Tribunals. Pending cases were also ordered to be withdrawn and the DV tag on community members in the electoral rolls was asked to be removed. ‘If the notification is implemented timely in letter and spirit, Gurkhas excluded from the NRC due to DV and PFT tag will be included in the final register,” Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangh leader Nanda Kirati Dewan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/two-years-since-nrc-lakhs-still-remain-in-limbo/article36216358.ece
01 September 2021||Srinagar,||NC will emerge largest party, says Farooq||National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah said here on Tuesday that his party “will sweep the upcoming election in J&K and emerge as the largest party”. “If there are fair elections in J&K, our party will sweep and win it. I am saying it with authority. The NC will emerge as the biggest party,” he said. Dr. Abdullah made the remarks on the sidelines of a function chaired by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. Mr. Birla is in the Valley as a part of the parliamentary outreach programme for the empowerment of panchayati raj institutions. Referring to his party’s boycott of the panchayat polls in 2018, Dr. Abdullah said, “I regret it. The NC should have participated in the polls.” J&K is without an elected government since 2018, when the BJP pulled out of the alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party. The Election Commission, which awaits the J&K delimitation commission report, is yet to announce any dates for polls in the Union Territory. Dr. Abdullah, Srinagar MP, highlighted the security issues of the sarpanchs and panchs. “We still face militancy and one of the most important things that we need to look after is the security of panchayat members,” he said. On the occasion, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his August 15 speech, made it clear that elections would follow the delimitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nc-will-emerge-largest-party-says-farooq/article36216359.ece
01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Economy grows 20.1% in Q1, lags pre-COVID level||“The share of consumption in GDP was lower this time which indicates that the second wave and lockdowns impacted households more than the first wave,” CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis noted. ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said the low base of last year's stringent nationwide lockdown had ended up concealing the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 on the economy and the sharp year-on-year expansion in Q1 is analytically misleading, as it marks a sequential slowdown of 16.9% over the last quarter of 2020-21. Masking the impact “The growth rates in 2021-22 in some cases are unduly high due to the low base,” the NSO pointed out as a caveat for interpreting the GDP estimates that show all major industries rebounding from sharp contractions in the first quarter of last year. Construction and Manufacturing GVA recorded a 68.3% and 49.6% uptick between April and June this year, compared to a 49.5% and 36% contraction, respectively, last year. GVA from Trade, Hotels, Transport, Communication & Services related to Broadcasting recorded a 34.3% jump after dipping 48.1% in the same quarter last year. However, this employment- and contact-intensive services sector was still 30.2% below 2019-20 levels, suggesting a contraction of Rs. 2.1 lakh crore, said EY India chief policy advisor D.K. Srivastava. “The main disappointment comes from the contribution of the government sector, both from the demand and output sides,” he said, pointing to government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) contracting by 4.8% in Q1 this year — the only demand segment to show a fall. On the output front, public administration, defence and other services such as education, health and recreation grew 5.8% but remained 5% lower than the pre-pandemic level. “This is a clear indication that the government has been far too cautious in increasing its expenditures to contain the fiscal deficit,” noted M. Govinda Rao, chief economic advisor at Brickwork Ratings. “Manufacturing and construction were the key drivers of the pickup in GVA growth in Q1, whereas on the expenditure side, private consumption and investment powered the turnaround in the GDP performance,” Ms. Nayar said. Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian said growth for the full year is likely to remain around the ‘ballpark’ of 11% as projected by the Economic Survey. India is poised for stronger growth, driven by structural reforms, the government’s push for capital expenditure to enable private investment and a rapid COVID-19 vaccination drive, he said. Spending lagging However, economists were worried about a decline in public capital and revenue spending in July indicated by data released by separately by the Controller General of Accounts. “Despite the lifting of State-wise restrictions, revenue and capital spending contracted by 23% and 28%, respectively, in July 2021,” Ms. Nayar said. The Reserve Bank of India and the International Monetary Fund had revised their growth projections for the year to 9.5%. CARE Ratings revised its GDP growth estimate for the year to 9.1% from 9.2%, following Tuesday’s data, as it expects growth rates in the next three quarters to be progressively lower with the base effect wearing off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/economy-grows-201-in-q1-lags-pre-covid-level/article36216364.ece
01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||‘UNSC resolution addresses key concerns’||“Perhaps, if we had had more time, the results of the vote would have been different,” said Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia during the explanation of vote (EoV), adding that Russia “sees attempts to shift responsibility for the failure of the 20-year-long presence of the United States and its allies in Afghanistan to the Taliban movement and to the states of the region that will have to deal with the effects of this prolonged campaign.” Russia has also cautioned against “freezing Afghan financial assets”, a clause that was not included in the document. China’s complaint China’s U.N. Ambassador Gueng Shang also complained that the resolution was not “balanced” and had been “forcefully pushed” through. Even so, neither country vetoed the resolution. According to sources, another resolution in September, as the situation in Afghanistan becomes clearer and after the Irish Ambassador takes over, the presidency is expected to be debated as well. India is expected to chair the 1988 Sanctions committee that looks at Taliban sanctions next and participate in the decision to extend the mandate of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), where it will also have to balance competing demands from the U.S., the U.K. and France bloc ranged against Russia and China. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s travel plans in September will be watched closely, as he has been invited to attend the SCO summit in Dushanbe, of countries including Russia, China, Pakistan and Central Asian states on September 16-17, as well as the Quad summit in Washington, including the U.S., Australia and Japan, expected to be held on September 26-27. Evacuation ongoing Sources said that a high-level group consisting of External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, NSA Ajit Doval and senior officials set up by Mr. Modi, are now focused on developments in Afghanistan, ensuring the evacuation of stranded Indians and also airlifting Afghan nationals, especially “religious minority groups” from Kabul. “The group has also been monitoring the ground situation in Afghanistan and international reactions,” said a source familiar with the Government of India’s response to the evolving crisis in Afghanistan where the last U.S. aircraft left earlier on Tuesday morning. Calling out terror Representing India at the UNSC, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, highlighted the role of the LeT and the JeM. He said that these outfits should be “called out and condemned”, but didn’t specifically refer to the Haqqani Network, which has been responsible for attacks on the Indian embassy and consulates in Afghanistan in the past. “The adoption of the resolution is a strong signal from the Security Council and the international community on its expectations in respect of Afghanistan,” Mr. Shringla told the media after the resolution was passed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unsc-resolution-addresses-key-concerns/article36216365.ece

Mr. Sidhu, in a statement, said mothers who had lost their children due to the drug menace in the State by the drug mafia were waiting for the report of the Special Task Force (STF) surrounding the drugs trade. In February 2018, the STF filed a status report in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Later, the government filed before the court an opinion-cum-status report. The matter was still in the court. Questioning the government’s “inaction”, Mr. Sidhu said despite the court’s directions, nothing had been done to extradite the 13 drug smugglers, who peddled drugs into Punjab and smuggled drugs to some countries, back to India. Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), at its legislative party meeting held here, accused Mr. Sidhu and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh of running away from public issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-action-to-extradite-drug-smugglers/article36216372.ece

01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Builders trampling on flat buyers’ rights: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday condemned the “dubious dealings" of builders and authorities in metropolitan cities that rob ordinary people of their life savings and dream of owning a home. The court said flat buyers have, on paper, the power to act against such corrupt authorities and venal builders. But in reality, any attempt made by flat buyers, who are often a diverse and unseen lot, end up crushed under the builders’ money power and the legal authority flexed by officials. Ordering the demolition of two unauthorised 40-storey towers of real estate major Supertech Limited at Noida in the outskirts of the Capital, a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah said flat buyers were the ones who suffered the most from these illegal activities. “Flat buyers suffer the impact of the unholy nexus between builders and planners. Their quality of life is affected the most,” Justice Chandrachud wrote in a 140-page judgment pronounced on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/builders-trampling-on-flat-buyers-rights-sc/article36216387.ece
01 September 2021||New Delhi,||Amarinder, Rahul differ over memorial||Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and Punjab Chief Minister Capt (Retd) Amarinder Singh on Tuesday took contradictory positions over the renovated Jalianwala Bagh memorial that was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week. While Mr Gandhi called the inauguration event “an insult to martyrs”, the Punjab Chief Minister said the renovated memorial “looked very nice”. Captain Amarinder’s remarks come in the middle of a turf war with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was appointed by the Gandhis despite his stiff opposition. “Such an insult to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh can only be done by those who do not know the meaning of martyrdom. I am the son of a martyr — I will not tolerate the insult of martyrs at any cost. We are against this indecent cruelty,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted in Hindi. Several Opposition leaders criticised the memorial makeover including the laser show during the inaugural event, and called it “scandalous”. “Insulting our martyrs. Only those who stayed away from the epic freedom struggle can scandalise thus,” CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted. CPI’s D. Raja said, “It’s an irony that the RSS and its offshoots that never participated in the freedom movement are now rewriting history.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amarinder-rahul-differ-over-memorial/article36216360.ece

01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State records normal rainfall in August||Tamil Nadu and Puducherry together have recorded 4% less than the average rainfall for the month of August. However, the Meteorological Department considers it within the range of normal rainfall. While many districts such as Chennai and Tiruchi have managed to get normal rainfall, 11 districts, including Kanniyakumari, Salem and Namakkal, have experienced a shortfall in rain in August. Karur tops the districts that have received excess rain with 53% more than its monthly share. Officials of the Meteorological Department said the weak Southwest Monsoon current was one of the reasons for the dip in rainfall in districts bordering western ghats like the Nilgiris and Kanniyakumari. The State as a whole has recorded 88.9 mm of rainfall in August, which is 4% less than its average of 92.8 mm of rain. During the past three months, Tamil Nadu has registered 275.8 mm of rainfall, which is 27% more than its seasonal average so far of 217.8 mm. The department has predicted scattered rainfall over the State from September 2. A weather system off the Bay of Bengal could impact a slight increase in thunderstorms over parts of Tamil Nadu. Light to moderate rain is likely at few places of the State through this week. Chennai too may receive light rain in some areas during evening or night hours till Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-records-normal-rainfall-in-august/article36216667.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruvottiyur Theradi Metro station will open only in Oct.||Even six months after the inauguration of the phase I extension project of the Metro, one of its stations is yet to finish construction work. In the 9-km stretch, which connects Washermenpet with Wimco Nagar, the Tiruvottiyur Theradi station could not be opened and trains run through it without making a stop. According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the construction is nearing completion, and they expect it to be completed in two months. “The station will be opened by the end of October. We are finishing the construction as soon as we can. The signalling software too will be ready by early October, and the station can start functioning by then,” an official said. Sources said some of the reasons for the delay were land acquisition issues and design changes. “Initially, it was quite a challenge to get the land; then, the design had to be modified because the viaduct height had to be increased to ensure the passage of the chariot during a festival celebrated at a local temple in Tiruvottiyur,” another official said. In this stretch, stations will be located at Washermenpet, Theagaraya College, Tondiarpet, New Washermenpet, Tollgate, Kaladipet, Tiruvottiyur and Wimco Nagar. Officials said the phase I extension had been used quite well by commuters with more than 10,000 people travelling through it on a daily basis. Sources said if last-mile connectivity was introduced, the ridership would improve even further, and more commuters would be keen to travel in this system as the fares had been reduced as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruvottiyur-theradi-metro-station-will-open-only-in-oct/article36216650.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Accessibility in public transport still elusive for disabled persons||While a recent announcement by the Tamil Nadu government to provide free bus travel for the disabled has been a welcome move, for persons with disabilities in the city, commuting by the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses remains an arduous task. For residents like R. Sathish Kumar, who uses a wheelchair, a daily commute to his workplace and back costs Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 by cab or autorickshaw. Lack of ramps in the buses on his route has made it difficult for him to avail the service. “Before the pandemic, I was visiting many places within the city to work. I only took cabs or the Metro trains. While we welcome the government’s move giving us free bus travel, how can we make use of it if the buses are not accessible for us,” he said. A disappointed lot Mr. Sathish, a member of the Disability Rights Alliance, said while the MTC had resumed and introduced new bus routes in suburban routes, covering areas such as Porur and Vandalur, it was disappointing that they were unable to make full use of this. A resident of Thirumalaivayil, S. Rajesh, who has multiple sclerosis, has similar concerns. “I use a walker and the first step in any bus is extremely high. It takes time for me to lift my foot up and then board. In the past, when I’ve gone with my wheelchair, people have had to lift me up into the bus, and I want to avoid bothering the commuters,” he said. Section 41 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, states that the government shall ensure access to all modes of transport that conform with design standards, including retrofitting old modes wherever technically feasible and safe for persons with disabilities and without entailing major structural changes. The government is also expected to take suitable measures to provide facilities for the disabled at bus stops, railway stations and airports. Planning stages “For a while now, we have been appealing to the government to ensure that going forward, all buses procured in the future are accessible and disabled-friendly. The focus should be on inclusivity right from the planning stages with regard to transport and infrastructure — only then will there be compliance with the law,” said Vaishnavi Jayakumar, disability rights activist. She said for the disabled, regular buses with low flooring and a foldable (book leaf) ramp would make a huge difference. “The demand is not for high-end, air conditioned vehicles with these provisions. While bus floors should not be more than 400 mm off the ground, platforms at the bus stops too should be of the same height,” she added. In July 2021, the High Court had restrained the Tamil Nadu government from purchasing buses for public transport unless they are disabled friendly. The MTC is readying a report to be submitted to the High Court, where a case is pending regarding the implementation of access facilities for disabled persons to travel in public buses, giving details of the funds, number of new buses to be allotted for physically challenged persons and the operation of these buses for comfortable boarding and travel. Report being prepared A senior official of the MTC said the High Court had given four weeks to submit the feasibility report and that senior officials were engaged in preparing the report. While the State Transport Department put forth arguments of various operational issues faced by the officials in MTC buses with facilities for the disabled, the High Court made it mandatory to design and create amenities for safe and comfortable travel of persons with disabilities in public transport. The official said initially, 13 buses were readied with ramps in 2019 out of which eight were in operation, but the problem of taking longer to board forced the MTC to stop implementing the facility in a portion of its 3,250-strong fleet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/accessibility-in-public-transport-still-elusive-for-disabled-persons/article36216663.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Integrated land document to be introduced for farmlands||In an effort to help farmers and farmland owners, the Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday said it would introduce an online service to provide an ‘integrated land document’ that would contain details of four related documents — A-register, chitta, field measurement book and adangals . Now, the details of A-register, chitta and field measurement book can be obtained online separately, and e-adangals with the details of land use and crops cultivated could also be obtained online. “To help farmers, the ‘integrated land document’ containing the details of these four documents will be provided online,” Revenue Minister K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran said in the Assembly. The Minister also announced that the government would introduce an online service through which those possessing pattas could apply for surveying and pinpointing the boundaries of their land. So far, they would have to go to the Tahsildar offices or apply through the Common Service Centres for this service. To ease the practical difficulties in land acquisition, the government would set up a State-level authority, Mr. Ramachandran said. It would coordinate all land acquisition units and help in a speedy disbursal of compensation. The Revenue Department would coordinate with other Departments, courts and the Defence Ministry and share the computerised land records to prevent illegal land transactions, he said. Special camps would be held in villages in each revenue division before Pongal in 2022 to help farmers and landowners sort out patta-related issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/integrated-land-document-to-be-introduced-for-farmlands/article36216631.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Bill to repeal Dr. Jayalalithaa University Act passed||The Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on Tuesday passed a Bill to repeal the Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University Act, and another Bill to amend the Annamalai University Act 2013 to convert it from a unitary institution into an affiliating type university, paving the way for merger of the two universities. It also passed a Bill to amend the Bharathidasan University Act. AIADMK legislators, led by deputy leader of the Opposition O. Panneerselvam, walked out of the House and staged a protest outside Kalaivanar Arangam when the Bill to repeal Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University Act was tabled in the Assembly by Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi. Following this the police detained them. When the AIADMK members protested, Leader of the House Duraimurugan said they had already decided to stage a walkout. BJP opposes Bill The BJP, an ally of the AIADMK, too opposed the Bill at the introductory stage. When the Bill was taken up for consideration, BJP floor leader Nainar Nagendran (Tirunelveli), said, “Though the reasons cited for the merging of the universities are valid, it would also result in removing the name of a former Chief Minister and so we are opposing the Bill.” PMK floor leader G.K. Mani (Pennagaram) was not present in the House when the Bill was taken up for consideration. However, Congress floor leader K. Selvaperunthagai (Sriperumbudur) countered Mr. Nagendran: “You are worried that the name of a former Chief Minister has been removed. Will you also oppose the Prime Minister renaming the Khel Ratna award which was originally named after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi?” Speaker M. Appavu intervened to say in a lighter vein: “He just revived the alliance [between the AIADMK and the BJP].” Mr. Nagendran chose not to comment any further. ‘Not intentional’ Replying to the concerns, Mr. Ponmudi said the intention of the government was not to remove the name of the former Chief Minister and pointed out that Fisheries and Music and Fine Arts universities remained in her name. He went on to contend it was the AIADMK government that went about “concealing” the name of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi from the foundation stone of several projects. Following a voice vote, the Speaker said that the Bill was being passed “unanimously”. Mr. Ponmudi said the government had decided to convert the Annamalai University from a unitary type to an affiliating type, by affiliating [arts and science] colleges in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi and Mayiladuthurai districts, and accordingly amend the Annamalai University Act, 2013 (Tamil Nadu Act 20 of 2013) and the Bharathidasan University Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 2 of 1982) suitably and also to repeal the Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University Act, 2021 (Tamil Nadu Act 5 of 2021) for the said purpose. Consequently, Bharathidasan University would no longer be the affiliating university for arts and science colleges in Mayiladuthurai. Earlier this year, the AIADMK government enacted the Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University Act with Villupuram as its headquarters to affiliate institutions in Villupuram, Cuddalore and Kallakurichi districts, which were previously under the jurisdiction of the Vellore-headquartered Thiruvalluvar University. Traffic diversion After walking out of the House, the AIADMK MLAs squatted on the Wallajah Road and shouted slogans against the Bill and the DMK government. The police cordoned off the area and diverted the traffic. Senior police officers requested them to give up the protest, but the members did not relent. As a result, the police arrested them and took them in buses to a nearby hall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bill-to-repeal-dr-jayalalithaa-university-act-passed/article36216642.ece

The court ordered the initiation of criminal action against all those who were operating the unlicensed quarries and also the officials such as the District Revenue Officer, Revenue Divisional Officer, Tahsildar and Village Administrative Officer for being instrumental in allowing such illegality. Justice R. Mahadevan directed the Collector to initiate appropriate action for recovering the loss caused to the public exchequer due to illegal quarrying. Since an Advocate Commissioner appointed by the court had unearthed excessive quarrying even by licensed stone quarry operators in the taluk, the Judge ordered the issuance of show cause notices to them too for the alleged violations pointed out by the Advocate Commissioner. Further, the Regional Transport Officer (RTO) concerned was directed to confiscate all lorries with same registration number including the two trucks that had been identified by the Advocate Commissioner. The Collector was instructed to comply with the series of directions issued by the court and file a compliance report before the court by September 7. The interim orders were passed on a writ petition filed by a quarry licensee who had obtained permission to quarry stones from 1.09 hectares of land at Morattupalayam village in Uthukuli Taluk. He was aggrieved over the stoppage of his quarry operations by government officials on the basis of a complaint lodged by his brother, accusing him of quarrying beyond the licensed area. During the course of hearing, the litigant told the court that many other illegal quarries were functioning in the taluk but the officials had chosen to act only against his quarry. To ascertain the veracity of his claim, the Judge appointed V. Ashok Kumar as an Advocate Commissioner to visit the taluk and submit a report on the number of illegal quarries in the locality. His report revealed that 64 quarries were functioning without licence. It also stated that only 18 of the 24 licensed quarries could be inspected and that all 18 of them had violated the lease conditions in one way or the other and indulged in quarrying stones beyond the permissible limits. The report was supported with photographs of the mines. The Advocate Commissioner also told the court that he happened to see two lorries with the same registration number. “Thus, the report of the Advocate Commissioner has blown the lid off how stone quarrying is being operated without any licence or lease, thereby causing a loss of thousands of crores of rupees to the exchequer besides causing environment loss to the State,” the court observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-tiruppur-collector-to-close-down-64-unlicensed-stone-quarries-in-uthukuli/article36216691.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu’s mineral revenue dipped 24.5%||Tamil Nadu’s mineral revenue declined about 24.5% to Rs. 983.07 crore during 2020-21 from Rs. 1,302.60 crore during 2019-20 as production declined because of COVID-19, according to the policy note on mines and minerals for 2021-22, which was tabled in the Assembly on Tuesday. The note also highlighted the measures to boost revenue, with the government proposing to come up with a sustainable mining policy. It said the process to bring limestone mineral blocks in Ariyalur district to auction was under way, and the government would get a substantial revenue from the upfront payment from successful bidders. Molybdenum mineral resources were estimated at 6.005 million tonnes in Dharmapuri district and 0.699 million tonnes in Krishnagiri district. The royalty rate for molybdenum was awaited from the Ministry of Mines; on its receipt, the blocks would be brought to auction. Among major minerals, lignite production stood at 1,78,67,468 metric tonnes and limestone at 1,87,74,341 metric tonnes during 2020-2021. Beach sand minerals production stood at 7,63,000 metric tonnes, the note said. During 2020-21, 12,390 vehicles were seized and Rs. 11.73 crore was collected in penalty for illicit mining. Besides, 10,680 criminal cases and First Information Reports were registered and 22 cases were booked under the Goondas Act, it added. The government had already issued orders for curtailing illicit mining and quarrying to check the leak of mineral revenue. For effective enforcement, it decided to fix a target of surprise inspections of quarries and mines for the Collectors and other officials, the note said. To prevent excess mining in the leased-out areas and mining of minerals outside the leased boundaries, drone technology was deployed for assessing the quantum of minerals removed to recover the cost of minerals from the lessees and invoke penal provisions against them. The government had already sanctioned Rs. 50 lakh during 2020-21. In the first phase, drone technology was used in Theni district. For this, a memorandum of understanding was executed with the Aero Space Research Center, MIT Campus, Anna University. It was proposed to use the technology to prevent revenue loss and curb illicit mining at all limestone, rough-stone and granite quarries to start with. The condition of a quarry, including the availability of minerals, would be captured at least twice a year, the note said. To restore the abandoned mines and quarries, the government proposed a ‘Green Fund’, for which the lessees would be levied a fraction of the seigniorage fee, in addition to the existing charges. This fund would be maintained by the Collectors.  The process to bring limestone mineral blocks in Ariyalur district to auction is under way, and the government will get a substantial revenue from upfront payment from successful bidders Policy note on mines and minerals||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadus-mineral-revenue-dipped-245/article36216672.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools set to reopen across Tamil Nadu today||Schools across Tamil Nadu will reopen for Classes 9 to 12 on Wednesday. Senior students were last on campus in April this year before schools were shut again on account of the second wave of COVID-19. Minister for School Education Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi inspected Lady Willingdon High School on Tuesday and assessed the safety norms in place. “The Standard Operating Procedures have been issued by both the Revenue and Public Health Departments, and we want to reassure the parents that schools have been asked to strictly implement them. It is not compulsory for students to attend in-person classes,” he said. Mr. Mahesh Poyyamozhi said 95% of the teaching and non-teaching staff had been vaccinated, and the Department of Health was asked to prioritise the rest in vaccination. “Schools can ask teachers who are not vaccinated to come back after getting their shot. Furthermore, we have asked all schools to insist on mask-wearing and make available sanitisers,” he said. With the shift system in place, schools could wind up by 3.30 p.m., and no physical education periods would be held, he said. Inspection by officials Across districts, officials carried out inspections and schools sanitised classrooms in preparation for the reopening. Over 1.7 lakh students of Classes 9-12 are set to return to schools in Coimbatore district. Around 81% of the teaching and non-teaching staff members have taken at least the first dose of vaccine in the district and only 36% of them have been fully vaccinated, according to the officials. In the Nilgiris, Chief Education Officer A. Nasarudeen said residential schools had been given permission to reopen on Wednesday. “We have communicated the protocol to be followed... This includes ensuring vaccination of all staff members and allowing only two children to stay in a room,” he said. Workers delivering provisions and goods to schools would also have to be vaccinated. In Salem, 295 government schools and 317 private schools are ready for reopening. Officials said only very few schools required split batches for classes in rotation for lack of sufficient classrooms. Apart from the arrangements being made for enforcing the protocol, officials in the western region checked the cleanliness of toilets and drinking water supply on the campuses. Tiruchi Chief Educational Officer R. Balamurali said online classes would also continue. “Our immediate priority is to ensure the emotional well-being of the students. They should feel free and enjoy their presence in the school. There will be no hurry in handling the subjects,” he said. Around 94.5% of the high school and higher secondary teachers in Madurai district have been vaccinated so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-set-to-reopen-for-classes-9-12-in-state-today/article36216675.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Only 64 of 98 projects signed at GIM 2015 were taken up’||Six years after agreements were signed at the Global Investors Meet (GIM) in 2015, only 64 of the 98 projects have been taken up and 11 electricity projects, worth Rs. 64,000 crore, were dropped, Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu informed the Assembly on Tuesday. Elaborating on the status of projects for which agreements were signed at the GIMs held in 2015 and 2019 under the AIADMK government, he said they were more of “fanfare” and “did not get translated into action”. Though 98 projects with Rs. 2.42 lakh crore in investments and the potential for creating jobs for over 4.65 lakh people were projected at GIM 2015, only 64 projects had been taken up for commercial production, and only Rs. 1.33 lakh crore in investments had been received, he said. “Only 65.3% of the projects signed at GIM 2015 have been taken up and only 55% of the total investments expected have been received,” Mr. Thennarasu said. Though memoranda of understanding were signed for 15 electricity projects, only two came into operation and two others were in progress. He said, “11 other projects with an expected investment of about Rs. 64,000 crore have been dropped.” As for GIM 2019, of the 304 projects for which memoranda of understanding were signed, only 150 had been taken up. Of the expected investment of about Rs. 3,00,500 crore, only Rs. 80,612 crore had been received, which was a mere 26%, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-64-of-98-projects-signed-at-gim-2015-were-taken-up/article36216673.ece

Velu urged BJP MLA Vanathi Srinivasan to insist that the Centre give preference to Tamils while filing vacancies in its Departments in Tamil Nadu. Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu, too, urged the BJP MLA to help in obtaining clearances from the Centre for various projects. During a debate in the Assembly, when Ms. Srinivasan (Coimbatore-South) urged the government to announce an award named after Andal to women Tamil poets, Mr. Velu intervened and requested the BJP MLA to help Tamils get jobs in Central government Departments. “There are many vacancies in the Railways, airports and the Department of Post in Tamil Nadu. Tamils are not given preference in these jobs. You could help in our qualified youths getting employment in these Departments,” Mr. Velu said. Mr. Thennarasu, too, joined the debate and requested Ms. Srinivasan to help in obtaining clearances from the Centre for various projects. “When the Defence Minister visited Chennai a few days ago, I sought the clearances at the advice of our Chief Minister,” he recalled. The State government was coming up with common testing facilities to boost opportunities in the radio frequency and antenna sectors, and infrastructure was being established in Chennai, Tiruchi and Ulundurpettai, he said. During his reply to the debate on the demand for grants, Mr. Thennarasu said the government had identified electronic manufacturing, semiconductors, FinTech, future mobility, data centres and renewable energy as among the emerging sectors. It was taking steps to develop them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/help-tamils-get-central-govt-jobs-says-minister/article36216635.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Features and standards essential for accessible travel||The Harmonised Guidelines and Space Standards for Barrier Free Built Environment Persons with Disability and elderly persons, which was released by the Ministry of Urban Development in 2016 has specified the features that accessible buses should possess. Apart from having low floors, buses should have handrails and foot flights installed in addition to a hydraulic lift or a pull-out foldable ramp. While the doors of the vehicle should be at least 1,200 mm wide, there should also be enough space inside for wheelchairs, such that they do not hinder passenger movement. Wheelchair stoppers and safety belts need to be installed. Alighting buzzers with visible push buttons are to be installed, and the information should be displayed in Braille and raised numbers for the benefit of the visually impaired. Information signs with the names of all stops should be easily readable. Disability rights activists have been stressing on the need to focus on future procurement rather than retrofitting existing buses with inadequate equipment which might be dangerous. In 2019, a demonstration and trial was held for disabled persons where a bus was retrofitted with an electric lift and a ramp. While participants in the trial had raised concerns about the height of the platform, a wheelchair user also toppled and fell when she tried to use the ramp. Visually impaired persons who attempted to use the ramp also found it challenging. “When we say buses should be accessible, this also means that it should be safe and comfortable for persons with invisible disabilities and senior citizens. All health disabilities should be taken into consideration,” said Smitha Sadasivam, member of the Disability Rights Alliance. She said that sensitivity of the conductors and drivers too was important. “They need to wait not just until we have gotten onto the first step but till we are safely inside or seated. Buses should have earmarked seats right next to the entrance for persons with disabilities, so that they can be seated immediately as well,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/features-and-standards-essential-for-accessible-travel/article36216659.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Truck driver held for slapping traffic police constable in Porur||Personnel from the SRMC police station on Tuesday arrested a truck driver from Mumbai for slapping a traffic police constable who was on duty. According to the police, Mustaq Ahamed, 57, was driving his container truck into the city. At 12.55 p.m. on Monday, traffic police personnel at Porur stopped him since heavy vehicle movement was prohibited in the city during daytime. Mustaq then parked his heavy vehicle by the roadside, disrupting traffic. He picked up a quarrel with the police personnel on duty and brandished a knife before slapping head constable Chandrasekar. The other personnel overpowered him and handed him over to the law and order police. The video of the incident went viral on social media. Following a complaint from Mr. Chandrasekar, the police booked a case against Mustaq under Sections 294b (Uttering vulgar word in public place), 332 (Voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 506(2) (Criminal Intimidation) of the IPC. He was arrested and remanded in judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/truck-driver-held-for-slapping-traffic-police-constable-in-porur/article36216665.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Policy to regulate M-sand business soon||The government will come up with a policy to regulate the manufacturing, quality and price of M-sand, Minister for Mines and Minerals Duraimurugan announced in the Assembly on Tuesday. “To check the quality of M-sand being sold and to monitor its manufacture and price, we will draw up a policy,” he said. Drones would be used to check illegal mining of minerals, he said. A project would be implemented at a cost of Rs. 25 crore to use drones to check whether minerals mined by contractors were in line with the agreement made between the government and the party. Mining of minerals would be prohibited in cultural heritage sites that reflect the rich lives of ancient Tamils, he said. “Mining within 500 metre from these sites will be prohibited,” he said. Attempting to capitalise on the old quarries whose licences have expired, the government has identified 436 unused quarries to hand them over either to Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board or local bodies so that they could be used for storing water, he said. Granite quarry waste lying unused for several years would be used to boost the State revenue, he said. “Rates will be fixed and additional revenue to the government ensured with the sale of granite quarry waste,” he said. Studies would be undertaken by Tamil Nadu Minerals Limited to look into the possibility of manufacturing lithium-iron batteries with high-grade graphite flakes, Mr. Duraimurugan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/policy-to-regulate-m-sand-business-soon/article36216633.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||With nine IMH residents on board, RVIVE Cafe takes off||Aruna (name changed) is happy to work all day. After living on the campus of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for more than a decade, stepping out for work is no small deal for her. Her excitement was palpable as she served customers with baked goodies and hot beverages. For her, being employed meant being independent. She is among nine residents of IMH, who have been brought aboard RVIVE Cafe, a collaborative initiative of the IMH and Hot Breads on the institute’s outpatient premises in Ayanavaram. “Our residents, who have improved with treatment, work at the cafe in two shifts. They love their jobs. For instance, Aruna, who has been with us since 2010, feels independent and wants to save money from her salary to buy jewels,” P. Poorna Chandrika, director of IMH, said. Some of these residents had earlier worked at Winners Bakery and Writer’s Cafe, she said, adding that they were unable to travel during the lockdown. “RVIVE Cafe is an initiative that will help us to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness among the public. This place is known for the Kilpauk mental hospital, but the landscape has changed. IMH has working patients now. This gives us an opportunity to make people see for themselves. Here are stories of positivity and resilience behind the homeless mentally ill patients of IMH,” she said. A differently abled person has also been employed at the cafe’s counter. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, who visited the cafe on Tuesday, said such an initiative helped in addressing stigma, and offered an opportunity for IMH residents. “The ambience is great. The larger goal of having such an inclusive set-up is to enable people to come and see for themselves how persons with mental illness recover and contribute to the society. From institutional care, they can be re-integrated into the society,” he said. He said that by bringing in a brand value and quality, it was a win-win situation for all. “The cafe will be formally launched soon,” he added. Restaurateur M. Mahadevan, founder of Hot Breads, said they had brought nine in-patients and out-patients on board with training. “Once we start on a bigger scale, we can train and take in more persons. We want the initiative to be sustainable and will give back the profit for the welfare of IMH residents,” he said. Hot Breads runs zero-profit community bakeries — Freedom Bakery at Puzhal Prison, Winners Bakery with Chennai Corporation, Give Life Care at the Loyola College and Popcause with the Spastics Society of Tamil Nadu. “We earlier observed how these residents worked at Writer’s Cafe. We are trying to uplift them through RVIVE, a zero-profit cafe-cum-bakery. We will absorb them depending on their capacity both in production and service,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/with-nine-imh-residents-on-board-rvive-cafe-takes-off/article36216655.ece
01 September 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Karnataka told to offset shortfall this month||The Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA), at its meeting held in New Delhi on Tuesday, “requested” Karnataka to make good in September the shortfall in the realisation of Cauvery water by Tamil Nadu. Disclosing this, CWMA Chairman S.K. Haldar, who is also the head of the Central Water Commission, told The Hindu on the phone that the Cauvery catchments had recorded around 25% deficit in rainfall. “The realisation by four reservoirs of Karnataka [Krishnaraja Sagar, Kabini, Hemavathy and Harangi] was less by 23%-24%. Accordingly, there were less water releases,” he said. In view of the Meteorological Department’s rainfall forecast for September, the CWMA told Karnataka to compensate the shortfall, he added. A release issued by the Tamil Nadu government said that as on August 30, the cumulative shortfall since June 1 was 27.86 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft). For the three months, Tamil Nadu should have got 86.38 tmc ft., but it received 57.04 tmc ft. 156 tmc ft Karnataka, according to the release, informed the meeting that its reservoirs should have received 209 tmc ft by now, but they realised only 156 tmc ft. At the beginning of the meeting, Tamil Nadu’s team leader and Additional Chief Secretary (Water Resources) Sandeep Saxena opposed any discussion on the Mekedatu dam project. Both the Mekedatu project and the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link canal scheme had been deferred. The next meeting would take place on September 24. When Tamil Nadu’s representatives wanted Karnataka to release water in accordance with the Supreme Court’s judgment for the ‘Kuruvai’ and ‘Samba’ crops, the latter responded that even a few days ago, 14,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs) had been discharged into the Cauvery, the release pointed out. According to one of the participants, the two principal riparian States were engaged in an argument about the pattern of rainfall during the current southwest monsoon. Asked whether there were heated moments during the discussion that lasted nearly one-and-a-half hours, Mr. Haldar replied that the entire meeting went off “very cordially”. “There was nothing to get heated up.” CWMA’s stipulation Tamil Nadu’s contention was that this year’s monsoon could not be called “deficit” as only the Kabini catchments had experienced a deficit rainfall. The rainfall pattern over the basin had to be viewed in its entirety. Besides, Karnataka’s two major reservoirs — Krishnaraja Sagar and Kabini — were almost full. So the neighbouring State was in a position to meet the CWMA’s stipulation, the State said.  The realisation by four reservoirs of Karnataka [Krishnaraja Sagar, Kabini, Hemavathy and Harangi] was less by 23%-24%. Accordingly, there were less water releases||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cwma-asks-karnataka-to-offset-tn-water-shortfall-this-month/article36216619.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘We can’t prevent transport of mined products to Kerala’||The government cannot prevent the transport of mined products (such as crushed stones, rough stone and M-sand) from Tamil Nadu to Kerala because the Supreme Court has allowed it, Minister for Mines and Water Resources Duraimurugan informed the Assembly on Tuesday. “It is not just from Kanniyakumari. We cannot prevent the transport of mined products from the other districts of Tamil Nadu to Kerala,” he said in reply to Congress member J.G. Prince who alleged that large-scale transport of mined products from Kanniyakumari had wreaked havoc on the eco-sensitive district. The Minister said that just because the district was enriched with dams, forests and hills, one could not prevent the transport of mined products. “But we do not disagree with the argument that it is an eco-sensitive area. That is why we have closed 12 of the 15 quarries in the district, and there is no quarry now.” The Minister agreed that the movement of heavy vehicles between Kanniyakumari and Thiruvananthapuram had damaged the road since it was a single-lane road. “We can restrict load...” Mr. Prince said the big rocky hills (in the Western Ghats) should not be ravaged for quarrying, and stones available underground could be used for the needs of residents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/we-cant-prevent-transport-of-mined-products-to-kerala/article36216644.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Desilt three estuaries of Pulicat lake, say fishermen||Fishermen of the Pulicat lake have urged the State government to take steps to desilt all three estuaries of the large brackish waterbody, two of which are in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. The lake has one mouth at Nawabpetta, a second near Sriharikota and a third in Pazhaverkadu — all these allow entry/exit of sea water from the Bay of Bengal. At present the Tiruvallur district administration is temporarily dredging the bar mouth at a cost of Rs. 18 lakh. Collector Alby John Varghese recently visited the spot and interacted with fishermen where they asked that dredging be done on a continuous basis at the bar mouth. “They also asked that facilities be created for tourists and boating for tourism be allowed. Requests for re-laying of roads, lighting and water supply too were made, which we will ensure are provided,” he said. Community leader Durai Mahendran said they needed a long-term solution to the problem. For the lake’s survival “The depth of the water has decreased due to continuous silting. In some places the depth is as low as 0.8 m. If tidal flow is impeded due to closure of bar mouth, silting will continue, leading to the natural death of the lake,” he said. Aarde Foundation’s founder and architect Xavier Benedict said the estuary kept shifting once in three years, which was why fishermen said the proposed seawall would not be useful. “What is needed is an authority on the lines of the Lake Chilika Authority in Odisha. This is because the lake is spread across two States — Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. It is not a question of the livelihood of fishermen alone but also of the existence of the lake, which is Asia’s second largest brackish waterbody, covering over 712 sq.km.,” he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/desilt-three-estuaries-of-pulicat-lake-say-fishermen/article36216656.ece

Following a meeting with senior officials of the State government, Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi on Tuesday ordered civic officials to remove illegal hoardings, digital banners and placards from the 200 divisions of the city. Officials said the civic body had not permitted hoardings, digital banners or placards, and was enforcing the existing statutory provisions and court orders. The previous major drive to remove hoardings, digital banners and placards was carried out ahead of the onset of the northeast monsoon last year. At least 500 locations were identified during the drive last year, officials said. In March 2020, the Madras High Court struck down the amendment made to the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act to permit hoardings only on Corporation land. The amendment to the Act banned hoardings in private land. Officials said the special leave petition was still pending in the Supreme Court. Some of the narrow streets in each of the 15 zones have reported illegal banners on Tuesday. All such structures would be removed on Wednesday. The permission for old hoardings, according to earlier statutory provisions, had also lapsed, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-corpn-plans-to-regulate-hoardings/article36216677.ece

Alagiri on Tuesday charged that the BJP was “anti-farmer.” He was reacting to remarks made by BJP State president K. Annamalai, and Union Minister of State L. Murugan, against the special resolution adopted in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, seeking the repeal of the three Central farm laws. Mr. Alagiri hailed Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin and welcomed the resolution. The farm laws don’t give guarantees on Minimum Support Price and would affect the livelihood of farmers and pave way for “Adani and Ambani to take over” the procurement process, he alleged. Mr. Alagiri also alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is giving more importance to Sanskrit, than other regional languages, including Tamil. The Congress and other “secular parties” would defeat Mr. Modi’s “autocratic style of functioning”, which is trying to enforce things like one nation, one language, one market, one election, one entrance test, he added. Mr. Alagiri also hit out at Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for criticising Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on the National Monetisation Pipeline plan. “The previous UPA government was not against privatisation. Privatisation was done after debate and consultation. It never tried to privatise the Railways,” he noted. Mr. Alagiri said the Tamil Nadu Congress would undertake a campaign against the National Monetisation Pipeline plan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alagiri-criticises-annamalais-remark-against-farm-laws-resolution/article36216683.ece

Stating that as many as eight MLAs from different parties had contested under the ‘rising sun’ symbol of DMK, the litigant insisted that they should not be allotted separate seating arrangements or time slots to speak during the Assembly sessions and they must be treated only as ruling party members. The petitioner, M. Loganathan, an advocate from Coimbatore, also sought a direction to the State government to not invite those MLAs or other leaders of their parent parties in their capacity as representatives of those parties to the legislature party meetings conducted by the government to discuss important issues.

The residents also want treated sewage released in the Cooum, near Paruthipattu bridge, to be diverted to the stretch downstream of the Paruthipattu check-dam. K. Mugundhan, coordinator, Unpolluted Cooum River Protection Committee, said the released sewage stagnated near the Paruthipattu check-dam, which was built to store freshwater. “The authorities concerned must allow the stagnant sewage mixed water at the check-dam to flow to avoid mosquito breeding. The Avadi Municipal Corporation should consider extending the pipeline to release the treated sewage downstream to maintain it as an unpolluted stretch,” he said. The 72-km long river continues to be a freshwater source for drinking and agriculture needs in Tiruvallur district until it reaches urban limits. Officials of the Water Resources Department said they had written to the Avadi Municipal Corporation to initiate action to stop sewage pollution and construct a compound wall around the Sekkadu dumping yard.

Meanwhile, the Income Tax department officials went to Salem to conduct a search in a residence and office premises of a person involved in the crime.

When they were nearing Karaikudi in two cars, the police inquiry took the occupants by surprise. Initially, they told the police that the cash was intended to be handed over to a person from whom they had purchased an immovable property.

According to the police, the IT officials went to Salem for a check on the residence and other premises belonging to Rajkumar.

01 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||As schools reopen today, doctors urge parents, students not to panic||With schools reopening after one of the longest periods of shutdown, parents are understandably worried about the protection of their children. City paediatrians, however, say there is no need to fear. The best practical solution to deal with the COVID education crisis is to get the children back to classrooms. “When the pandemic wave peaked, the children were kept physically safe. But prolonged isolation is showing increasing impact on mental well-being,” says Dr. S Senthil Kumar, Head of Pediatrics, Meenakshi Mission Hospital. He explains how the digital divide is playing with the nutritional balance as children from well to do families are becoming obese due to excessive screen time and lack of exercise while children from poor families are deprived of their one-square midday meal at school. “We are only looking at the virus and missing the bigger picture,” he adds. Instead of panicking, parents need to have faith in the school managements as they have been instructed to vaccinate their teachers and all other staff and strictly follow COVID-appropriate behaviour. A child is unlikely to pick up infection from an adult in school but some clusters of infection cannot be ruled out, says Dr. Senthil. With the city now reporting less than 20 cases daily, Dr.S. Balasankar, Head-Paediatrics at Government Rajaji Hospital, is confident that children are unlikely to be affected severely as long as precautions of masking up, washing hands and social distancing are followed. It is important to get back to the routine for overall well-being of every child, he says, and understands if there are even a few cases, it will become an issue and the schools would be blamed. “Everything else has opened up and people are out on the roads, in city buses and shops without mask; infection can come from anywhere not just schools,” he points out. Dr. Murugan Jeyaraman, senior paediatrician at Apollo Speciality Hospitals, says, “We have to take our individual and shared responsibilities seriously if we do not want the virus to take our children’s childhoods. If an adult is sick with COVID-19 symptoms at home, he advises to keep the child away from school for at least 10 days as he or she could be an asymptomatic carrier.” “Supervision outside the classrooms like playgrounds, library, labs, washrooms, common eating and parking spaces will help; safety is not just a word but a protocol to be followed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/as-schools-reopen-today-doctors-urge-parents-students-not-to-panic/article36216947.ece

College campuses were cleaned and sanitisation was undertaken over the last week. Principal of Mannar Thirumalai Naicker College B. Manoharan said, “The professors and the other staff of the college have been working on the campus since the second week of August. Most of the faculty have been vaccinated. Cleaning of the campus and the hostel facilities is done regularly. To ensure more safety in the hostel, beds are distanced from each other by 6 feet and there will be a residential warden to oversee things if students fall sick or even show mild symptoms of sickness.” He also said that a vaccination camp had been arranged on the college campus, along with the city Corporation, on Wednesday and a portion of their students who are yet to be vaccinated will be inoculated there. Principal of Thiagarajar College D. Pandiaraja said, “We will start functioning on an experimental basis as we haven’t had classes for a long time. Only 30% of the UG and PG programmes will begin classes on the campus, from Wednesday. As vaccination for the 18+ category began a little later than for those who were 45+, it is not possible to expect all students to be vaccinated by now. Once they are vaccinated, they can start attending the classes. Though there are 400 hostellers in our college, only 35-50 are expected to join us on Wednesday.” The American College Principal M. Davamani Christober said that it would allow only students who had taken both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to start attending classes on the campus. He also said, “Students from second and third year UG courses will be having classes on alternate days. PG students will have classes on all days.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/colleges-get-ready-to-welcome-students-back/article36216946.ece
01 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Resume temple functions and give financial relief, say folk artistes||Folk artiste groups from across the district thronged the Collectorate on Tuesday morning, asking the government to restart temple functions and provide them with some form of financial relief assistance as the COVID-19 pandemic had terribly affected their livelihoods. Folk artistes, who perform arts like karagattam , nayyandi melam , poikkal kuthirai attam , villu pattu and raja rani attam , were among those who came from different places like Usilampatti, Sholavandhan, Elumalai and Thirumangalam. P. Chellaiya from Usilampatti said, “Many of the folk art forms in the State were deteriorating even before the pandemic. Most people in the urban places are not even aware of terminologies like kuravan kurathi attam , Themmangu or komali attam , as they became less popular over time. After the pandemic set in, things got worse and our livelihoods were deeply affected. There is literally no stage for us to perform because of which we are unable to earn any money. All village-level temple functions are stopped. We request the government to restart them.” Many artistes had to take up menial jobs in order to earn their daily bread, he added. President of the Southern Districts Folk Artistes Welfare Association, Madurai, K. Ranjith Kumar, who submitted a petition to the Collector, said, “We want the government to provide financial relief assistance to folk artists, on a regular basis. Those with Folk Artist IDs should be provided free bus passes.” They also requested for an exemption from paying tolls for vehicles they use for travelling while performing across different places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/resume-temple-functions-and-give-financial-relief-say-folk-artistes/article36216939.ece
01 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||An artistic campaign against coronavirus||More than 500 children from the urban slums of Madurai and Kovilpatti brainstormed for months to co-curate an art manual titled “Let Us Face Corona.” The Centre for Education Development Action & Research (CEDAR) brought them together to hone their self-learning capabilities by using alternative pedagogical methods and become active agents for creating awareness of COVID-19. The art manual by, of and for the children was released by Collector S. Aneesh Sekhar here on Tuesday. He said in these stressful times when families had faced losses and uncertainties, to cultivate creativity and gratitude was the need of the hour. He appreciated the efforts of the children in using their artistic talent to campaign against coronavirus. This is the second art manual published by CEDAR during the lockdown. The first one was released in June 2020 when community volunteers and facilitators conducted several programmes and handheld the children in the age group of seven to 16 years to protect their mental well-being, during the past months. Creatively stimulating tools of storytelling, friendly conversations, visual narrations and songs were used to scientifically and rationally explain the dynamics of the viral infection to the children, said Chinnaraj Joseph Jaikumar, CEO and managing trustee of CEDAR. According to him, once the children understand how the virus spreads and what they can do to help and internalise the COVID-appropriate behaviour, they are able to express themselves better through drawings and paintings, short stories and screen plays, cartoons and caricatures, illustrations and puzzles. Their contributions were tweaked, edited and compiled not only for an easy read and understanding among themselves but also empowered their peers and parents with information about healthy coping and navigating anxiety. The manual in Tamil is available free at CEDAR office on Old Natham Road and can soon be downloaded from the websitewww.cedarindia.org||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/an-artistic-campaign-against-coronavirus/article36216943.ece
01 September 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘No compulsion for students to attend classes physically’||With schools in Tamil Nadu set to reopen for students of Classes IX to XII from September 1, the State government has informed the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that there will not be any compulsion for the students to attend classes physically. Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram told a Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and K. Murali Shankar on Tuesday that online classes would continue to be the alternative mode. Students willing to study from home would be allowed to do so with the consent of parents, he said. The Advocate General submitted that the government had passed orders on reopening of classes in schools and colleges. Experts were consulted before the decision was taken. All precautionary measures had been taken, he submitted. He said the standard operating procedures would be followed. The COVID-19 protocol that mandated use of masks and physical distancing would be followed, it was submitted. The court was hearing the public interest litigation petition filed by K. Abdul Vahabudeen of Tirunelveli district. Pointing to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, he said the parents were worried about sending their children to schools. Considering the possibility of the third wave and vulnerability of children, online mode should continue as an alternative way of teaching/learning. Or else clusters would be formed, the petitioner said. He said he was not challenging the government order on reopening of classes, but only wanted the online mode of classes to continue in addition to the physical classes, he said. Taking note of the submissions, the judges directed the State government to file a counter affidavit on its stand that there would not be any compulsion for the students to attend classes physically, and adjourned the case till September 7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-compulsion-for-students-to-attend-classes-physically/article36216936.ece

01 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Will crack down on ganja peddlers in Puducherry: CM||Puducherry Chief Minister N. Rangasamy on Tuesday assured the House to crackdown on ganja peddlers in the Union Territory after legislators cutting across party lines raised the issue of growing sale of ganja. When Independent legislator P. R Siva during a discussion on Budget said the sale of cannabis was rampant in his Thirunallar constituency, several legislators were on their feet demanding stern action against those involved in the illegal trade. BJP legislator A. John Kumar said several schoolchildren have become addicted to ganja in the town. The police are aware of those involved in the trade but refuse to take action against them as they are “hand in-glove” with the peddlers, he alleged. He sought a legislation to provide maximum punishment to carriers of even small quantity of the banned substance. Other members joined issue in chorus demanding action against the culprits. Senior DMK legislator A.M.H Nazeem wanted the government to arrest those involved in ganja trade under the Goondas Act. At this point, the Chief Minister said, “it is a fact that even young children have fallen into the trap of ganja peddlers. We will take stern action against those involved in the business.” Meanwhile, Independent legislator Sivasankaran urged the government to increase GST exemption limit from Rs. 20 lakh to Rs. 40 lakh for businessmen. In several States such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka businessmen with an annual turnover of up to Rs. 40 lakh are exempted from GST payment. But in the Union Territory the limit was Rs. 20 lakh annual turnover, he said urging the government to take up the issue with the Centre. Of the 50,000 traders in the Union Territory, majority were marginal traders. Increase in exemption limit would help them financially during the difficult times [of COVID-19 pandemic], he added. Mr. Nazeem, said the government has prepared the budget with an outlay of Rs. 9,924 crore expecting a revenue collection of Rs. 6,196 crore. In the present economic situation, the targeted revenue was doubtful, he added. The government should have got at least Rs. 1,000 crore more as Central assistance. He also flayed the government for not making any commitment on Statehood or legacy loan waiver. Postpone local body polls Members belonging to BJP, DMK, Congress and Independents demanded postponement of local body polls till anomalies in the delimitation was rectified. They also wanted the polls to be held after the end of COVID-19 pandemic.

01 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||Kerala airports to screen for new virus strain||With the emergence of a new “C.1.2 lineage” of SARS-CoV-2, first detected in some provinces in South Africa in May and now in all South African provinces, the State will make special arrangements at its four international airports for disease surveillance. Travellers coming from countries where the C.1.2 lineage has been reported – South Africa and seven other countries spanning Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania – will have to undergo RT-PCR tests at the airports and go into quarantine, it was decided at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Tuesday. The C.1.2 lineage is in focus now because it possesses mutations within the genome similar to those seen in the Delta variant and some additional mutations also. However, scientists are studying the virus behaviour and whether the mutations are rendering it more infective or resistant to vaccines. The WHO is yet to classify it as a “variant of interest” or “variant of concern.” Mr. Vijayan directed all local bodies to speed up the vaccination process so that all persons above 60 years are vaccinated as early as possible. Only RT-PCR tests Testing will be done using only RT-PCR kits in the districts of Wayanad, Pathanamthitta and Ernakulam, where first dose vaccination has exceeded 80%, and Thiruvananthapuram, Idukki and Kasaragod, which are nearing 80% coverage. The RT-PCR testing will be increased in all districts. Vaccine priority Mr. Vijayan directed that priority be given in vaccine distribution to those districts where vaccination had not been progressing fast. The districts should also get the vaccination statistics from all local bodies. Ward-level figures should be collected so that lockdown may be restricted to wards. Wherever weekly infection population ratio (WIPR) is above 7, entire panchayats are on lockdown now. The Chief Minister called for proper stats on how many persons contracted COVID after getting fully vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kerala-airports-to-screen-for-new-virus-strain/article36216409.ece
01 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||City all set for further expansion||The Tiruchi Corporation limits are poised for expansion again and indications are that about 25 village panchayats situated in the peripheries of the city are to be merged with the urban local body soon. According to sources, village panchayats of Malliyampathu, Maruthandakurichi, Kambarasampettai and Mutharasanallur in Andhanallur panchayat union; Mudikandam, Mekkudi, K.Kallikudi, Thayanur, Nachikurichi, Somarasampettai, Nagamangalam and Punganur in Manikandam union; Panayakurichi, Gundur, Navalpattu, Cholamadevi and Keezhakurichi in Tiruverumbur union; Thalakudi, Madakudi, Appadurai, Esanaikorai and Pudukudi in Lalgudi union; and Madhavaperumal Kovil, Bikshandarkovil and Koothur in Manachanallur are likely to be merged with the corporation. On Tuesday, Collector S.Sivarasu held a meeting with panchayat presidents of the 25 village panchayats that are to be merged with the Corporation. He also met presidents of panchayats that are to be merged with Lalgudi and Musiri, the town panchayats which are to be upgraded as Municipalities in the district. But for a terse communication, officials remained tight-lipped about the deliberations. The latest expansion is expected to be on a much larger scale than the exercise undertaken in 2011, when the Tiruchi Corporation limits was extended by merging Tiruverumbur town panchayat, Pappakurichi, Ellakudi, Keezha Kalkandarkottai and Alathur village panchayats, all located in the eastern periphery of the city, after the delimitation process. The geographical spread of Tiruchi Corporation increased to 167.23 sq km from 146.90 sq km. With the delimitation of local bodies in 2011, the total wards went up to 65 from 60. It is not yet clear on how many new wards will be added to the latest merger. In 2017, Tiruchi Corporation began a survey on identification of urbanised suburbs falling in neighbouring municipal, town panchayats and village panchayat limits. It was carried out based on the direction of the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration. Data on households, profile of villages and town panchayats, distance from Tiruchi city, percentage of agricultural activities, industrial activities and existing basic amenities in the local bodies were among the data collected by the Corporation. As in 2011, the proposal on merger of the panchayats with the Corporation has met with opposition from sections of residents in the villages. Recently, a group of residents from Mutharasanallur, Bikshandarkoil, Malliyampathu and Marthuthandakurichi village panchayats staged a protest in the city against the merger. While some expressed apprehension that they would not be eligible to get work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, a few others pointed out that they would be forced to pay higher levies. However, a former panchayat president of Malliyampathu, who did not want to be identified, claimed that opinion was divided on the issue among the residents of the panchayats as some felt that they would be able to get better amenities under the Corporation. “Some of the village panchayats in the suburbs of the city, especially along Vayalur Road, have witnessed rapid urbanisation and it was no longer justified that they still remain a rural local body,” he observed. He further pointed out that residents in the newly added colonies were seeking better amenities such as better roads and underground drainage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-city-all-set-for-further-expansion/article36216759.ece
01 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Special camps to be held in colleges to inoculate students, teachers||A special drive to vaccinate students, teaching and non-teaching members of colleges and universities will be taken up intensively on Wednesday. The move is aimed at increasing vaccination coverage in educational institutions. However, in some of the colleges, the vaccination camps were held on Tuesday. Citing a report, Collector S. Sivarasu said that nearly 40% to 50% of the students above 18 years of age had already been vaccinated. It had been decided to increase the coverage as the colleges were set to reopen for second and third year undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The special camps would be held at 42 locations. The heads of the institutions had been asked to use the opportunity to vaccinate the students, faculty members and non faculty staff. M. Selvam, Vice-Chancellor, Bharathidasan University, said that seven camps had so far been conducted on the campus to vaccinate teaching and non-teaching members and research scholars. The affiliated colleges had been asked to use the special camps to be held on their campuses to increase the vaccination coverage. Mr. Sivarasu said that as on Tuesday Tiruchi district had a stock of 52,500 vaccine doses. It was replenished frequently. It was expected that the special drive in colleges would evoke good response. ‘Record numbers’ The district had achieved record vaccination coverage with 28,500 people inoculated on Sunday. Out of 22.8 lakh targetted population, over nine lakh people had been vaccinated so far, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/special-camps-to-be-held-in-colleges-to-inoculate-students-teachers/article36217153.ece
01 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Crackdown by Fisheries Dept. on juvenile sardine fishing with banned nets||Sardine ( mathi meen ) fishing has turned risky for fishers indulging in destructive practices along Nagapattinam-Mayiladuthurai coastline. The Fisheries Department, with the support of Marine Enforcement Wing of the police, has tightened the noose around such fishers to prevent netting of juvenile sardine fish. Fishers tend to indulge in indiscriminate netting of the variety that command a huge market in Kerala. The confiscated fish caught adopting prohibitive practices are auctioned by the department. The catches are seized once the inspection teams undertaking mid-sea patrolling find the mesh with gaps lesser than 40 mm, and the size of fish to be lesser than 10 cm, the measurement specified by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Cochin. In a crackdown last month, the department in Mayiladuthurai under the supervision of the district administration took action against operators of five mechanised boats and 73 country crafts for using banned purse seine nets, with gaps lesser than 40 mm in netts and for fitting engines with more than specified horsepower, in violation of Tamil Nadu Marine Fisheries Regulation Act 1983. The Mayiladuthurai administration has formed four inspection committees to monitor the entry and exit points of the sea in keeping with the directives of the State government and the High Court advocating strong controls on the mesh size of nets as well as outright ban on practices such as bull trawling, in which massive nets sweep everything up from the sea floor. Minimum size of fish The minimum legal size of fish is taken note of by the inspection teams to curb the catch of juveniles before they can spawn and replenish the population. The demand from expanding fishmeal plants has also prompted fishers to net juvenile sardines indiscriminately, according to senior officials. The extent of catch of Indian oil sardine ( Sardinella longiceps ), a staple food in Kerala and a mainstay of its fishing industry, plunged to 45,000 tons in 2016 in that State after a record-high catch of 390,000 metric tons in 2012, prompting the ICAR - Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute to undertake a study to determine reasons for decline in sardine fishery along Kerala coast. In a move to protect the resource, the department restricted fishing of juveniles of fishes based on scientific advisory by CMFRI and the Minimum Legal Size (MLS) was introduced for 14 species. For sardine, the MLS was 10 cm. To cater to the demand of consumers in Kerala, fishers in Tamil Nadu fit their country crafts with double engines of high horsepower to reach fishing area faster and harvest larger shoals. Having enforced tighter controls, officials, on their part, are hopeful that the periodic crackdowns would have the desired deterrent effect.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crackdown-by-fisheries-dept-on-juvenile-sardine-fishing-with-banned-nets/article36216755.ece
01 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Six fishermen families ostracised in Mayiladuthurai||Six fishermen families at Keezhamuvarkarai coastal village in Mayiladuthurai district have been allegedly ostracised by the oor panchayat after one of the families embossed its name on a footstep given by them to a local temple some time ago.

01 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Fish market to be demolished in two weeks to make way for new building||The stage is set for demolition of fish, mutton and poultry stalls behind Gandhi Market to pave way for a modern meat market. The existing building is said to have been constructed about 50 years ago. It has separate enclosures for fish, mutton and poultry traders. The meat market receives customers from different parts of the city. There has been a long demand for a modern market replacing the existing building, which is in a dilapidated condition. By taking into account various factors, Tiruchi Corporation has devised a plan to build a modern meat market at a cost of Rs. 13 crore by sourcing funds from the Smart City Mission. After technical verification of tender documents, the civic body chose a contractor recently and has issued work order to start construction. Corporation Commissioner P.M.N. Mujibur Rahuman told The Hindu that the new meat market would be built on 25,000 sq ft at the same spot, where the current market was located. There would be 148 stalls in it. It would have two floors and separate provisions would be made for fish, mutton and chicken traders. An arrangement would be in place for parking 200 two-wheelers. He said there was no cold storage facility in the existing building. The new building would have a cold storage facility for fish traders. Establishing a waste disposal mechanism was also be part of the plan. It would be completed within two years. Mr. Rahuman said fish and meat traders had been asked to shift their trade to temporary areas identified for them. While the fish traders had been asked to move to Diamond jubilee bazaar, poultry and meat traders were allotted space at Tiruchi Corporation’s abattoir. A section of traders had been moved to the temporary locations. The remaining traders had been asked to move with immediate effect. The building would be demolished within two weeks so as to start the construction work as early as possible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fish-market-to-be-demolished-in-two-weeks-to-make-way-for-new-building/article36216763.ece

Ilian Zdrakov Markok was brought to the special camp in August 2019. Authorities learnt of his escape only on Tuesday morning after he was found missing from his room. Police suspect that he escaped late on Sunday. Police sources say Markok apparently used a sharp object to cut open the grille of the window in his room and jumped out. His room was found locked from inside and authorities grew suspicious and opened the screen only to find him missing. The special camp, which is under the control of the Collector, accommodates more than 100 inmates belonging to different nationalities. They are at the camp for their involvement in various cases in the State and facing trial. A majority of them are Sri Lankan Tamils and a few belong to Russia, Nigeria and Bangladesh. The escape of the Bulgarian comes despite the camp being equipped with CCTV units and watch towers. Personnel from Tamil Nadu Special Police maintain vigil in shifts. Commissioner of Police A. Arun, accompanied by senior city police officers, inspected the camp following the incident and conducted inquiry. A manhunt has been launched to apprehend the Bulgarian. Police sources say three special police teams, led by an Inspector of Police, have been constituted to track him. K.K. Nagar police have registered a case.

01 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Runway project: Nathamadipatti residents for adequate compensation||A section of residents belonging to Nathamadipatti in Keezhakurichi panchayat on the city’s outskirts, under the banner of ‘Tiruchi Vimaana Nilaya Virivaakathaal Badhikkapattor Kootaimappu,’ petitioned the district administration on Tuesday for adequate compensation in the wake of proposed arrangements being made for acquisition of lands, house sites and residential localities for airport runway expansion work here. The members of the Kootaimappu led by its coordinator N. Karthikeyan submitted a petition in support of this and other demands to the Collector. The petition, signed by Mr. Karthikeyan, said arrangements were being made to vacate the residential localities including Yagappa Nagar, Susai Nagar, Saveriyar Nagar, Amul Nagar and Gandhi Nagar in Nathamadipatti area for acquisition for the runway expansion work besides lands and house sites. A Special Tahsildar had convened talks with the residents in this regard. The compensation amount as informed by the Special Tahsildar was insufficient. The residents would not be in a position to buy a house, house site or a fertile land in any other place with the compensation amount proposed by the government. Keeping in mind the livelihood of the people and Nathamadipatti’s close proximity with Corporation, adequate compensation as per the market value in Corporation should be provided to the residents. Further, government job should be given to one member of the family and proper road must be laid for Nathamadipatti following the expansion.

Officials said on Tuesday that the special team was led by Assistant Conservator of Forests K. Ganeshram and comprised Udumalpet Forest Range Officer C. Dhanabalan and forest staff from Dhali and Karattur forest sections. With the autopsy revealing that the elephant’s left tusk was cut off after its death, the team is investigating whether the miscreants were from any of the tribal settlements in the ATR. On Sunday evening, the Forest Department staff spotted the carcass of a male elephant near Kattupatti tribal settlement. The Forest Department has also reached out to the residents of Kattupatti, Mavadappu and Kulipatti tribal settlements to generate awareness on wildlife crimes and to assist the officials in nabbing the miscreants. Pellets found Meanwhile, Forest Veterinary Officer from Coimbatore Forest Division A. Sukumar said four pellets were removed from the carcass during the autopsy. “We removed three pellets from the upper part of its right forelimb,” he said. The fourth pellet, which was slightly bigger than the other three, was lodged between the tusker’s right tusk socket and the right eye socket. However, no point of entry or any other internal bleeding was detected during the autopsy, indicating that the pellets were likely present inside the elephant for an extended period of time and might not have been the immediate cause of death, Mr. Sukumar said. A senior Forest Department official said that further details regarding these pellets would be available only after ballistic analysis. The elephant’s cause of death could be ascertained only after the completion of the forensic analysis, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-dept-forms-special-team-to-probe-elephant-death-in-atr-limits/article36216702.ece

Eshwarappa said in Belagavi on Tuesday. He was responding to KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar who said that the BJP government had disrespected the memory of the former Union Minister Suresh Angadi, as it had failed in getting his body to Belagavi from Delhi. “Such leaders don’t know what they are speaking about, they just keep making meaningless statements,’’ he said. He also challenged Mr. Shivakumar’s charge that Belagavi city MLAs are engaged in corruption and are taking up to 25% commission in Smart City works. “Mr. Shivakumar does not understand the Smart City project. He does not know that the works are not decided by legislators. They are planned and executed by officers after consulting all stakeholders. Money is sanctioned only after each work undergoes third party inspection,’’ Mr. Eshwarappa said. “Mr. Shivakumar is talking about corruption because he has been in jail and, of all places, Tihar Jail,’’ Mr. Eshwarappa said. He said that the BJP will win in all three city corporations, Belagavi, Hubballi-Dharwad and Kalaburagi, as people of these cities have been impressed by the performance of the Union and State governments.

Voters in Hubballi-Dharwad are not discussing issues such as religion or caste affiliation of leaders. They are discussing civic issues and others related to development of the twin cities, AAP State president Prathvi Reddy told journalists on Tuesday. He said that the AAP chose its candidates from among the common people and not the rich and powerful. “We have not supported candidates who come from political families. We have created a situation where the educated and social workers don’t shy away from electoral politics. We have built up a party system that encourages common people like autorickshaw drivers to fight polls,’’ he said. He said that national parties were fearful of the rise of the AAP. They are struggling hard to retain their existence, he said. Party State coordinator Shantala Damle said that the AAP is bringing in a new campaign culture. “While other parties seek votes by distributing money and liquor, we are seeking votes by bringing civic issues before the people,” she said.

01 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||50 vaccination centres to function till 9 p.m.||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which has increased its vaccination target to 1 lakh a day has come up with a three-pronged approach to achieve this. It has decided to extend the working hours of select 50 urban primary health centres (UPHCs) till 9 p.m., conduct mega vaccination melas every Wednesday, and hold mega vaccination camps, where around 2,000 people can get vaccinated in a day. Sources told The Hindu that if the response is good, the UPHCs — two in each Assembly Constituency — will operate round-the-clock depending on demand, but will otherwise remain open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta told The Hindu that the weekly mega vaccination mela will be held along the lines of a similar drive conducted last week, where 1.25 lakh people got their shots. Meanwhile, mega vaccination camps, where around 2,000 people can get vaccinated in a day, will be held at Malleswaram playground in West zone, Epidemic Disease Hospital, behind Swami Vivekananda Road Metro Station, in East zone, and Ambedkar Bhavan in Yelahanka New Town in Yelahanka zone from from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. However, working hours may be extended, if there is demand, said Randeep D., BBMP Special Commissioner (Health). According to Mr. Gupta, of the estimated 91 lakh citizens (above 18 years) deemed eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, around 75% have already been vaccinated. The remaining unvaccinated population is an estimated 14 lakh citizens. Circular issued A circular issued by the civic chief on Tuesday stated that all other permanent vaccination centres, apart from the 50 selected centres, will operate from 8 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. If citizens are still in queue after 2.30 p.m., the centre will have to ensure that all of them are vaccinated.

01 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Landowners in Bengaluru question BDA||A public outreach programme held on Tuesday by the Justice A. V. ChandrashekarCommittee on the proposed Shivaram Karanth Layout became a platform for farmers and property owners from 17 villages, who may lose land to the Layout, to question the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA). They raised several objections, key among them were displacement of developed villages to form a layout for housing; delay in executing the project; “inadequate compensation” as per 2008 land rates; and asking revenue site owners to pay for alternate sites. M. Ramesh, a farmer from Ramagondanahalli, submitted documents showing that State government had issued final notification for acquisition of lands in 2018 as per The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition (Rehabilitation and Resettlement) Act, 2013. However, the BDA was now offering them compensation as per 2008 rates. G. Shivaprakash, a farmer, said the compensation did not account for the trees in his land, multiple tubewells he had drilled and the loss of livelihood. Justice Chandrasekhar, who said he had adjudicated several land acquisition cases himself, advised all land losers to file an appeal against BDA on the grounds that compensation was not adequate. Rakesh, a farmer from Vaderahalli, questioned the objectives of BDA forming the Layout. “How fair is it to demolish thousands of houses of farmers and the poor to provide for housing for the upper middle class in our villages?” he asked. The Supreme Court recently ordered that those who have bought revenue sites in these villages will be given priority for sites in the newly developed Layout. K. R. Sudarshan, an ex-serviceman said he invested his life’s savings of nearly Rs. 20 lakh to buy a plot which will now be acquired. “The Supreme Court has said we will get preference for a site in the new layout BDA develops, but we need to pay BDA rates - which is over Rs. 40 lakh. How can I afford that?” he said. BDA Commissioner Rajesh Gowda was not available for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/landowners-in-bengaluru-question-bda/article36216611.ece
01 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC asks for survey of city’s public toilets||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the member-secretary of the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority to conduct a survey to find out the conditions and facilities of public toilets in Bengaluru city and submit a report within four weeks. A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition filed by Letzkit Foundation, which had complained about maintenance of existing toilets and not providing of sufficient number of toilets as required for city’s floating population. The Bench said that the survey should include whether the toilets are cleaned or not and the availability of water facility in the toilets. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), during an earlier hearing in July had presented a survey, conducted by the All India Institute of Local Self Government, a private institute, on the status of toilets and their numbers compared to some other major cities in the country. However, the HC had expressed dissatisfaction that the survey had not conducted the exercise of requirement of ward-wise public toilets for the city though it noticed that the survey had found that number of toilets in city was on lower side when compared to cities like Chennai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. The High Court had also found that there is no centralised data of public toilets with the BBMP for proper planning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-asks-for-survey-of-citys-public-toilets/article36216600.ece
01 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Sewer cleaning should be done only using specified equipment, HC tells State govt.||The High Court of Karnataka has made it clear to the State government that henceforth, scavenging across the State should be done only with the aid and assistance of the equipment specified in the rules framed under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. The court also directed the government to submit details of the equipment provided under the 2013 Act, their availability with the local authorities, and the reason for non-availability as it is mandatory for the local bodies to possess the necessary devices as per the rules. A Division Bench comprising Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the directions on Monday while hearing two separate PIL petitions filed by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority and the All India Central Council of Trade Unions complaining about the non-implementation of the laws prohibiting manual scavenging in Karnataka. “It is made clear that henceforth, there will be no more manual scavenging in the State ignoring the statutory provisions of the Act and rules of 2013,” Bench observed. The 2013 rules list around 40 types of protective gear and devices to be provided to persons engaged in cleaning of sewer/septic tank. They also prescribe 14 types of devices and machines that the local authorities should possess for the same. The court, in its December 2020 order, had found that there was hardly any implementation of the 2013 rules in the State. On the two incidents of death of some persons while manually cleaning manholes in Kalaburagi (in January) and Ramanagaram (in June), the Bench directed that the Deputy Commissioners of both districts should be present before the court during next date of hearing on October 4 for the failure of the local authorities in enforcing the provision of the 2013 Act related to identification and rehabilitation of manual scavengers. The Deputy Commissioners need not appear if they submit a report of compliance on rehabilitation of manual scavengers, the Bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sewer-cleaning-should-be-done-only-using-specified-equipment-hc-tells-state-govt/article36216616.ece
01 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Plan mooted for improving health, education indicators||The State government has decided toformulate a special programme for improving health and educational indicators, particularly among girl children, in the three backward districts of Raichur, Yadgir, and Kalaburagi in the Kalyana Karnataka region. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday chaired areview meeting of various department works and said malnutrition among children was high and learning and education among schoolchildren was low in these three districts when compared to the other districts in the State. For improving the health and education indicators, Mr. Bommai said the Women and Child Development Department officials have been instructed to provide a break-up of funds spent on different schemes in the three districts at the next meeting. A Karnataka High Court-appointed committee, which studied the extent of malnutrition among children and submitted its report in 2012, had favoured providing food to children in anganwadis according to the food habits of the region. Noting the underwhelming performance of some departments, the Chief Minister directed officials to spend the money allocated in the Budget by issuing Government Orders. Funds would be released to departments on a quarterly basis depending on their performance and achievement of targets. He told officials to utilise funds under the Centrally sponsored schemes for providing benefits to the poor. On file clearance, Mr. Bommai said a large number of files were pending for clearance in the Revenue, Education, and Urban Development departments. On pending cases in courts, he told the heads of departments to appoint a deputy secretary or undersecretary as the nodal officer to establish coordination with the legal department to resolve pending cases expeditiously.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/plan-mooted-for-improving-health-education-indicators/article36216623.ece

01 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Phone-tapping case: Senior IPS officer files protest petition before CBI Special Court||Senior IPS officer Bhaskar Rao, on Tuesday, filed a protest petition before the CBI Special Court. He appealed to the court to not accept the Closure Report filed by CBI in the phone-tapping case. A telephonic conversation between Mr. Rao and one Faraz Ahmed, discussing the posting as the Bengaluru Police Commissioner was broadcast on a Kannada news channel, creating a storm in August 2019. A preliminary probe revealed alleged illegal phone tapping by Mr. Kumar’s predecessor Alok Kumar, after which the case was handed over to CBI. The CBI booked two separate cases, one pertaining to Mr. Rao’s case on how the audio was leaked to the media and another pertaining to alleged illegal phone tapping. It had recently filed a closure report in the case pertaining to Mr. Rao, stating that there was no conclusive evidence on the source of the audio tapes, against which Mr. Rao has now filed a protest petition.  ‘Loss of reputation’ Addressing the media, Mr. Rao said that due to the leaked conversation, which was aired by the media, he suffered a loss of reputation and that he was not ready to accept a closure report in the case. He alleged that the Closure Report filed by the CBI has detailed evidence on how the audio tape was leaked. “Even though some of the expert opinion reports are admittedly awaited by the CBI from CFSL, Hyderabad, the hurried manner of filing the Closure Report does not inspire confidence in the eyes of rule of law and is questionable,” he said. However, the report, a copy of which is available with The Hindu, details how the line interception of Faraz Ahmed was legally done, with the approval of then Police Commissioner T. Suneel Kumar and the Home Department. The probe finds Alok Kumar to have got the audio tapes of Mr. Rao’s call with the LI target Faraz Ahmed on August 2, 2019, in a pen drive from a police officer with the technical cell of the Central Crime Branch. ‘Lack of evidence’ The CBI report states that the analysis of the audio tapes submitted by the media house, shows the source of the audio tapes were the LI tapes from City Commissionerate. However, with the journalist refusing to reveal her source, the CBI said they could not find any independent conclusive evidence to prove as to how the audio tapes reached the media house and hence sought to close the probe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/phone-tapping-case-senior-ips-officer-files-protest-petition-before-cbi-special-court/article36216603.ece

01 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Concern over drinking water contamination||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday said that there is no response from the State government to the “serious issue of contamination of drinking water” in Mangaluru due to flow of leachate from a landfill site in Pachchanady. A Division Bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum made these observations after finding that both the State government and the Mangaluru City Corporation have not responded to a report on water analysis submitted by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPBC). The Bench was hearing a PIL petition filed by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority complaining about the failure of the corporation to enforce the provisions of Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 and also, the failure to protect the neighbourhood from the ill-effects of the Pachchanady landfill site. The KSPCB report reveals that ammoniacal nitrogen and iron were found to be beyond the permitted limits in the water samples collected from some of the open wells and storm-water drains due to mixing of leachate overflowing from the Pachchanady landfill, the Bench noted, while expressing concern over contamination of drinking water in the city. Ammoniacal nitrogen is a toxic pollutant often found in landfill leachate and in waste products such as sewage, liquid manure and other liquid organic waste, the KSPCB report stated. Though the KSPCB report stated that all the parameters were found to be within the permissible limit in the Phalguni near Maravoor Dam, it also stated that this could have been because of the dilution of contaminated water due to heavy rain when water samples were collected. The Bench adjourned further hearing till September 13 on a request made by advocates for the city corporation and the State government to respond to the findings in the KSPCB report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/concern-over-drinking-water-contamination/article36216964.ece

Published in The Lancet two days ago, the study has been presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress by the authors. The fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapies were examined both with and without aspirin versus control groups in a combined analysis of more than 18,000 patients without prior CVD from three large clinical trials. FDCs including aspirin cut the risk of heart attacks by 53%, stroke by 51%, and deaths from cardiovascular causes by 49%. About 80% of cardiovascular events occur in individuals without a prior history of such illness, meaning effective preventative strategies including medications in people without CVD is essential, if the majority of heart attacks, strokes and related deaths in the world are to be prevented, said the authors of the study. The study involved investigators from 13 countries, including St John’s Research Institute in Bengaluru, and included participants from 26 countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/combination-therapy-cuts-risk-of-cvd-lancet-study/article36217002.ece

01 September 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||KSRTC daily passes have become attractive||With the recent increase in private bus fares in the twin districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts, daily and monthly passes being issued by the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) on Mangaluru-Udupi and Udupi-Kundapur sectors appear to have become attractive for passengers. The transport corporation has been issuing monthly and daily passes with revised fares since August 2019 that have not further been revised. The daily pass for the Mangaluru-Udupi route is priced Rs. 100 and the Udupi-Kundapur sector Rs. 70 per round trip, while a monthly pass on these sectors is priced Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 1,400, respectively. Passes are valid on all ordinary and express services, while normal fares on these sectors are Rs. 70 and Rs. 50, respectively. Monthly pass-holders can, however, make unlimited journeys, said KSRTC’s Mangaluru Divisional Controller Arun Kumar. However, with the latest fare revision for private buses [which has not been effected for RTC buses for the last about two years], travel on private buses is said to be expensive. For example, the fare on Mangaluru-Udupi sector has reached Rs. 90, while on the Udupi-Kundapur route, it has touched Rs. 65. Joy Carvalho in his social media post said that a round-trip between Udupi and Kundapur becomes cheaper if one buys a daily pass on KSRTC bus priced Rs. 70 as against Rs. 130 on private buses since private operators do not offer daily passes. 30% concession Private bus operators, however, said that they offer 30% concession to daily travellers when they buy pre-paid RFID cards at the rate of 20 round trips which are valid for a month. KSRTC did not increase fares for over two years and is supported fully by the government helping it to cushion losses unlike private operators, said Treasurer of Canara Bus Owners Association Jyoti Prasad Hegde. Private operators and KSRTC are competing in an uneven field, Mr. Hegde said and cited the recent salary disbursement for RTC employees by the government amounting to over Rs. 1,500 crore during COVID-19 lockdown. On the other hand, private operators did not get even a single rupee and had to support their crew on their own, he regretted. Private operators also offer 50% fare concession to students, Yakshagana artistes, specially- abled, among others.

The two were close to each other for the last eight years. A few days ago, Soumyashri Bhandary got engaged to a man and they were to get married in September. Kulal had called Soumyashri Bhandary a couple of days ago to express his anguish over her marriage to another man. As she was riding back home from work, Kulal stopped her and entered into a heated argument, said Sachin, who reported the incident to the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/murder-accused-dies-in-hospital/article36216962.ece
01 September 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Govt. urged to reduce VAT on aviation fuel||The Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) on Tuesday urged the State government to reduce value added tax (VAT) on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to 1% from 28%. In a letter to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, KCCI president Isaac Vas said that with the opening of new airports around Mangaluru International Airport, several concessions were given to different airlines in their respective States thereby ensuring more airline operations and maximum passenger traffic. After relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, air traffic is poised to increase in the coming days and Mangaluru International Airport should not be left behind in such a situation. While ATF is subsidised to 1% VAT in neighbouring Kerala, it is as high as 28% in Mangaluru making it unattractive for new airlines to commence operations. The chamber has been advocating for rationalisation or reduction of VAT on ATF in the State for a long time. Mr. Vas quoted a recent statement by the Civil Aviation Minister that there is a need to reduce VAT/ Sales Tax on ATF to 1% to 4% in all States. The revenues generated through VAT on ATF are an insignificant proportion of the overall finances of a State. The reduction will be more than offset by the positive impact of air connectivity to States through the flow of economic activities, the Minister had stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-urged-to-reduce-vat-on-aviation-fuel/article36216967.ece
01 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||NEP 2020: studies in music, performing arts get a fillip||The New Education Policy 2020 has given a fillip to the field of music and performing arts besides enabling a curriculum framework for academic studies in educational institutions. At a workshop on NEP 2020 organised by Karnataka State Dr. Gangubhai Hangal Music and Performing Arts University, here on Tuesday, Nagesh V. Bettakote, Vice-Chancellor of the varsity, said NEP was a major step forward in providing a course curriculum and an academic framework for students of music and performing arts. He said though classical dance and music was part of the cultural fabric of society, no efforts were made for their systematic propagation and study so far. It was left to the interested students to pursue the art form through the traditional system of learning from gurus which has helped keep the culture alive. Welcoming the NEP he said the direct fallout will be the myriad opportunities. He pointed out that the NEP has made it mandatory to offer courses and electives in music and performing arts at various levels of education and this will be a gamechanger for students. In Karnataka, there are 16,000 schools and 800 colleges where the courses will have to be offered besides in about 25 universities. But none were in a position to create a framework for studies and the onus was on universities. “We have to not only churn out musicians but also scholars who will be the resource persons required to handle the course curriculum in future.” K. Ramakrishnaiah from the Department of Drama, Bangalore University, said directives have been issued to prepare course curriculum for Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi and Kathakali in the field of dance and Hindustani and Carnatic - both vocal and instrumental – in the field of music. Hence the task before the committee was immense, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nep-2020-studies-in-music-performing-arts-get-a-fillip/article36216996.ece
01 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Kaigarika Adalat in Mysuru to resolve pending grievances||Stakeholders from the industrial sector in Mysuru and surrounding regions hope to get their long pending grievances resolved in the Kaigarika Adalat slated to be held in the city during the second week of September. Though the industrial sector in the region has reported a plethora of issues and problems inimical to industrial development, the government was yet to act or resolve them and hence the Kaigarika or Industrial Adalat holds significance. The last such exercise was conducted in 2011 after which the Adalat was fixed twice but only to be postponed or cancelled due to various reasons, according to Suresh Kumar Jain, Secretary, Mysore Industries Association. Some of the key issues that need government intervention for resolution pertain to land allotment pending since many years. Though many investors and industrialists have paid the necessary amount and allotment letter has been issued, the plot per se was yet to be identified or has not been taken possession by the allottees. There are such cases pending since 2013 and this was having a negative bearing on the industrial growth in the region. Similarly, there are about 15 to 20 cases where land has been allotted close to the Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre on the outskirts of Mysuru. But permission for setting up industrial unit is being denied as this will cause disturbance to the rescued wild animals housed in the rehabilitation centre, according to Mr. Jain. Though alternative sites were allotted in such cases, the government was insisting on payment of additional amount in lieu of fresh allotment which was not agreeable to the investors, Mr. Jain added. There are other issues pertaining to taxation and though the industries pay taxes to the tune of lakhs of rupees to the local gram panchayats, not a single paisa is spent on civic amenities. This includes maintenance of roads or providing water. Mr. Jain said a case in point was a cluster of apartments meant for factory employees. It neither has an approach road nor a link road to connect it with the Outer Ring Road. Hence the industries in Mysuru perceive that they are being subjected to double taxation as they remit taxes to the agencies oncerned who levy tariff at commercial rates. A way out of the crux was the notification of industrial township authority mooted almost 40 years ago. This will bring the entire industrial area under the township authority which will be responsible for levying taxes besides ensuring maintenance. Though it has been announced as part of the industrial policy of the State, the township authority in Mysuru is yet to be notified. The venue of the Kaigarika Adalat and the dates are yet to be fixed but would be finalised soon. Gunjan Krishna, Commissioner, Industrial Development, said industries and MSMEs of Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Kodagu, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, Udupi and Mangaluru districts can submit their grievances at the Adalat. The MSME council has also appealed to its members to submit their grievances to www.msmemysuru.com and for details call 9989444654.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kaigarika-adalat-in-mysuru-to-resolve-pending-grievances/article36216999.ece
01 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Arun Singh rules out BJP alliance with any party||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary in charge of Karnataka Arun Singh described the Janata Dal (S) as a “sinking ship” and ruled out an alliance with any political entity in the State. Mr. Singh, who arrived in Mysuru on Monday night ahead of organisational meetings with the elected representatives and office-bearers of Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts, was speaking to reporters after visiting Chamundeshwari temple atop Chamundi Hills on Tuesday. “The JD(S) is sinking and the BJP is growing,” he said when his attention was drawn to the speculation over a possible understanding between the two parties in local body polls. He said the JD(S) was also in power and the people of the State would compare the governance of the JD(S) and the Congress with that of the BJP. “We are far ahead.” He said the BJP did not have any alliance with any party and expressed confidence of securing a majority on its own to form the next government. Mr. Singh said the party was working hard to win each and every seat in the Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts. “When I say we are trying to win each and every seat, where is the question of having an alliance?” he asked. In Old Mysuru region, Mr. Singh claimed that the graph of the BJP was going up gradually. The party has grown by eight or 10 times in number of seats in elections to local bodies in Hassan and Mandya districts. By strengthening the organisation, the party will win the majority of the seats, he said. When asked about Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s government, Mr. Singh said the government was doing fine. “There is peace and development.” Referring to hiccups in Cabinet formation in Karnataka, Mr. Singh said all the Ministers had accepted the portfolios offered to them. Ruling out the possibility of any change in the already allocated portfolios, Mr. Singh said the party was supreme. He asked the Ministers to leave their individual concerns aside for the overall welfare of the State’s people. On the absence of a ministerial berth for Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts, Mr. Singh said the Ministers in charge of the district would act as representatives of the districts. Given large number of districts, it is difficult to provide representations to all districts, he said. When his attention was drawn to the disappointment expressed by former Minister S.A. Ramdas, who was not included in the Cabinet, Mr. Singh said BJP workers contribute to the welfare of society and nation. “There are many workers, who do not receive party ticket even after working hard for it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/arun-singh-rules-out-bjp-alliance-with-any-party/article36216618.ece
01 September 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Traders welcome withdrawal of weekend curfew in Mysuru||The withdrawal of weekend curfew in Mysuru announced by the State government on Monday was welcomed by the trade bodies, which had been vociferously opposing the move on the grounds that COVID-19 pandemic in the district was under control. Non-essential shops and business establishments in Mysuru remained closed on Saturdays and Sundays for the last four weeks, much to the disappointment of traders and merchants, who were already reeling under financial losses arising out of an extended COVID-19 lockdown earlier this year. Welcoming the withdrawal of the weekend curfew, President of Federation of Organisations and Associations of Mysuru Prashant B.S. urged the authorities to consult the representatives of trade body before taking any such decision in future. He also appealed to fellow traders and merchants to ensure that that they run the business following the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) announced by the government relating to wearing of mask, maintaining social distance and use of sanitisers. Mr. Prashant also appealed to the government to review the timings of night curfew by enforcing it from 11 p.m. instead of the current 9 p.m. Shop owners have to starting winding up operations by 8 p.m. to abide by the 9 p.m. timeline. With a lot of business including eateries and restaurants depending on tourists for business, early imposition of night curfew hit them badly, he said. COVID-19 Meanwhile, the seven-day average test positivity rate (TPR) in Mysuru was only a shade above one per cent at 1.01 per cent as per the State COVID-19 War Room report dated August 29. Karnataka’s seven-day average test positivity rate on August 29 stood at 0.70 per cent.  On Monday, Mysuru had reported 73 fresh cases of COVID-19 against 8,549 samples that were tested. While the number of active cases in the district dipped below 1,000 and reached 976, no death due to COVID-19 was reported in the district on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/traders-welcome-withdrawal-of-weekend-curfew-in-mysuru/article36216998.ece

While six persons were arrested on Friday, two more accused have been taken into custody since then. In all, 8 persons have been arrested in connection with the crime which was reported on August 23. More than 400 policemen were deployed to track the accused who had split themselves and travelled to different States to evade arrest. Based on definite clues the nature of which has not been described by the police, and further reinforced by the call detail records, the investigating team nabbed six persons from different parts of the country including Jammu and Kashmir, Kolkata, and Mumbai. It is being speculated that one of the conspirators is a jeweller, and business rivalry led him to hire the accused to commit the crime. A hunt is still on to nab another accused who is on the run.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/progress-in-jewellery-shop-heist-case-probe/article36216994.ece

According to sources in the Tiruppur district police, the accused was arrested by special teams from Karnataka at a relative’s residence in Alathur, near Avinashi, within the limits of Cheyur police station. Following the arrest late on Monday, he was taken to Karnataka on Tuesday morning, sources said. On Saturday, police teams from Karnataka had nabbed five others in connection with the crime. Meanwhile, efforts to arrest one more accused who had allegedly absconded in Tiruppur district are under way, according to sources. In Mysuru, the special teams investigating the case visited the crime spot to rebuild the scene and have taken statements from the accused. Police sources said the gang had come to Chamundi Hills to fell sandalwood tree and smuggle it out to Tamil Nadu, but failed to identify any. They were inebriated by evening and were whiling away their time when they spotted a couple and assaulted them. Though the police will depend on scientific and technical evidence to frame the accused, the statement of the victim will be significant. However, sources said they would not pressure the victim at this juncture, given the trauma she underwent. They will wait till she is in a position to record her statement. Patrolling in deserted areas within the jurisdiction of the City Police Commissionerate has also been intensified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/one-more-accused-in-mysuru-gang-rape-held-near-tiruppur/article36216614.ece

The entire incident was recorded on CCTV in the area. Employees of a hotel in the vicinity and a few passers-by tried to help the passengers, who were trapped in the vehicle, before alerting the Adugodi police. “Eye-witnesses said they saw smoke coming out from the engine and doused it for fear that the car would catch fire. The passengers were trapped inside the mangled vehicle. They had to use force to open the doors and get them out,” said a police source. A crane was used to extricate the car. The passengers were taken to St John's hospital where doctors declared them as brought dead. Five of the deceased were living in paying guest accommodations at Koramangala 5th block: Ishita Biswas, 21, who hails from Maharashtra; Dhanusha M, 29, a dentist from Kerala and Akshay Goyal, 25, from Malappuram; Utsav, 25, from Rohtak from Haryana, who worked in the city as an auditor; and Rohith, 23, a business development officer healing from Hubballi. They were all known to the sixth passenger, Bindu, 28, a close friend of Karunaa Sagar. The Adugodi traffic police have taken up a case against the driver of the car under section 279 ( Rash driving or riding on a public way) and section 304a (causing death by negligence) for further investigations. “We are waiting for the blood sample and medical reports to ascertain whether Karunaa Sagar was driving under the influence of alcohol,” the police officer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hosur-mlas-son-and-six-others-killed-in-car-crash/article36216613.ece
01 September 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||New Alappuzha DCC chief has his task cut out||Newly appointed District Congress Committee (DCC) president B. Babu Prasad, who inherited a Congress party in Alappuzha down and dejected, has his task cut out. Losing one election after another, the Congress has been on a downhill trajectory since the 2016 Assembly polls. The party, which got trounced in the 2020 local body polls and 2021 Assembly elections, remains a disunited force due to infighting and mud-slinging. Two weeks ago, Congress leader and former Alappuzha municipal chairperson Illikkal Kunjumon was expelled from the Congress following allegations that he had tried to defeat the party candidate in the Ambalappuzha Assembly constituency. Close to Chennithala Mr. Prasad, considered close to former Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, has to bring the disparate elements together and instil confidence among workers in a bid to make the party battle-ready. “My job is to revive the party in Alappuzha,” says Mr. Prasad, whose name cropped up to the post of DCC president at the last moment over-riding the name of K.P. Sreekumar. Unlike in other districts, his appointment has not met with vehement opposition at least in the open. “It is a fact that the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) fared poorly by losing eight out of the nine Assembly seats in the 2016 and 2021 polls. When the UDF won 19 of the 20 seats in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress lost the Alappuzha constituency. My priority is to prepare the party for the 2024 general elections. We have to do a lot of work at different levels to make it happen,” he says. Inactive units The Congress party has no functioning units especially at the grassroots level in several places. Some of its strongholds, for instance, the Chengannur Assembly constituency, have turned out to be most tenuous. “We started to lose polls after party units became inactive. It is important to revive units at all levels. In places where we do not have units, I will go and camp there to revive the party,” Mr. Prasad says, while hinting that party units, including DCC, block, and mandalam committees, would be reconstituted soon. As the Congress aims for a comeback in Alappuzha, its primary opponent remains the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front. But the party cannot turn a blind eye towards the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, which is increasing its footprint across the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-alappuzha-dcc-chief-has-his-task-cut-out/article36216897.ece

Only travellers with RT-PCR negative test results and certificates for full vaccination are allowed into the State, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said on Tuesday. “We have intensified monitoring in all border areas... On Sunday, I inspected a special camp set up at Hosur to check vehicles coming to Tamil Nadu. Vehicles plying from Kerala are being stopped and people are asked to produce proof of the RT-PCR negative status or vaccination certificates. Only those carrying these documents are being allowed entry and others are sent back,” he told reporters after opening a ward at ESI Hospital, Ayanavaram. He said that as the caseload was not so high in Karnataka, travellers from there were allowed entry after thermal screening and checking of oxygen saturation level. From two to three lakh persons a day, the State’s daily vaccination coverage has crossed five lakh, he said. “The Collectors have been advised to further increase it. Like daily vaccination camps in all 200 wards of the Greater Chennai Corporation, the Corporations of Madurai, Coimbatore and Tiruchi have been told to conduct additional camps.” With the Union government allocating 1.04 crore doses to Tamil Nadu for September, the daily target would be increased to seven to eight lakh, the Minister said. In July, the Union government had allocated 17 lakh additional doses because of the State’s good performance. Similarly, 23 lakh additional doses were supplied for August, he said, adding: “The Union government had fixed a target of 52 lakh doses for June, 55 lakh for July and 57 lakh for August. Now, the number of doses is being doubled as the Union government has informed that 1.04 crore doses will be supplied. We are planning to vaccinate six to seven lakh persons a day in September.” He said there had been a shortage of Covaxin till August. Of the 1.04 crore doses allotted for September, Covaxin would account for 14,74,100 doses. They would be administered to persons due for their second dose. He inaugurated a 75-bed paediatric COVID-19 intensive care unit at ESI Hospital.

01 September 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Spectre of child labour in plantations||It is suspected that there is a spurt in child labour in the aftermath of the lockdown in cardamom plantations, which employ daily wagers from Tamil Nadu and a sizeable number of migrant labourers. District panchayat president Jiji K. Philip says child labour has turned a major issue and there is no proper intervention to check it. He says children arriving with the workers are also employed on the estates and most of them are aged between 12 to 15. Closure of schools With the closure of schools, children, especially girls, are given work at the plantations. The issue was raised at a district development authority meeting, Mr. Philip says adding that special checking is needed to prevent this. There should be proper registration of age and address of employees with the labour office or with the respective local body to prevent child labour. Children of migrant labourers living in estates are also deployed for work in the plantations. Compared to hotel and construction sectors, children employed in the plantations do not easily come to public notice. This has resulted in a spurt in child labour, especially during the lockdown period, says Mr. Philip. An official with the Child Protection Department says parents often bring children with them considering their safety at home. However, they are not employed in any hazardous works. Checks to continue A checking earlier done at the Kumily checkpost did not find any children brought from across the border. However, the drive will continue at all checkposts to find children arriving at the plantations. Members of the cardamom planters’ bodies were also told to follow the norms. Police checking in the plantations will also be intensified, says the official. Additional District Magistrate Shyju Jacob says no cases of child labour in plantations has come to notice so far. If children are employed, action will be taken, he says adding that checking will be done to prevent child labour, if any.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/spectre-of-child-labour-in-plantations/article36216899.ece

01 September 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Pookode lake gets a fresh lease of life||The Pookode lake, the second largest freshwater lake in the State, has got a fresh lease of life after the restoration work that lasted nearly three months. The lake, a major tourism destination in the district, is under the possession of the State Fisheries Department, and tourism activities at the destination are being operated by the Wayanad District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC). A large part of the 5.172 hectares of the lake had turned into grassland because of soil erosion brought about by uncontrolled construction and farming activities taking place in areas around the lake for the past many decades. The lake was dying mainly due to anthropogenic activities, eutrophication (a process by which waterbodies receive excess nutrients that stimulate excessive plant growth), and accumulation of sediments owing to soil erosion. However, the desilting works and removal of water plants and sediments have given a new lease of life to the lake. “We were able to recover more than 30% of water holding area of the lake,” V. Salim, DTPC Secretary-in-charge, told The Hindu . It took nearly three months to complete the restoration works, he added. The works have been completed at a cost of Rs. 2.25 crore. Nearly 13,000 cubic metres of mud and other sediments were removed from the lake and deposited on the north-west shore, said P.M. Ratheesh Babu, Manager (Administration), DTPC. Springs had formed in the lake and the flow of water to the Thalippuzha, a tributary of the Kabani river, had also increased considerably after the works, he added. The tender procedure for constructing a concrete retaining wall to prevent soil erosion in the area was in the final stage and the work would be completed at cost of Rs. 67.5 lakh, he said. The authorities are planning to execute a project to give a facelift to the tourism destination at a cost of Rs. 6 crore in the coming months. The works such as landscaping, gardening, setting up of a pavement around the lake and a solar buggy ride, and construction of floating dock for boating, open air theatre, toilet complex, baby pool, ticket counter, and first-aid room would be completed under the project. As many as 80 park benches would be mounted on the shores of the lake besides setting up a cafeteria and a cool bar for tourists. The work would be completed in a year, said Mr. Ratheesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pookode-lake-gets-a-fresh-lease-of-life/article36216855.ece

Based on the statements provided by tribal promoters and panchayat members, the boy was allegedly having an affair with a 19-year-old girl and he took the extreme step following differences between them. However, the relatives of the deceased claimed that there was an effort to hide the truth as injury marks were found on his body. Biju, an uncle of the deceased, told The Hindu that bloodstains were found on his shirt and the body was smeared with mud. There were also marks on the legs, which may suggest that the body was dragged, he claimed. He accused the police of not visiting the scene soon enough. The girl was also reportedly yet to be questioned by the police, said Mr. Biju. The police attributed the delay to the “parents of the deceased being in shock”, adding that a full-on inquiry would be conducted soon. Post-mortem result Regarding the post-mortem examination report, the police said that the doctor had confirmed that it was a case of suicide. The body was buried after the postmortem examination. Meanwhile, Sreeram Koyyor, president of Adivasi Dalit Munnetta Samithi, claimed that the fact that the police delayed an investigation in the incident raised suspicions. He called for a proper inquiry into the whole episode.

01 September 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Woman found dead at husband’s house in Kannur||A 26-year-old married woman was found hanging at her husband’s house at Korom in Payyanur on Tuesday. Her family alleged that she had been harassed and tortured by her in-laws. According to the police, Sunisha, 26, had married against the wishes of her family members. Payyanur Circle Inspector Mahesh said that on June 5, the mother of the victim had come with a complaint of domestic violence against her daughter’s husband and his parents. On the next day, though Sunisha and her husband were summoned to the station, she had said that though she had issues with her in-laws, there was no complaint against her husband. As a solution, the station sub inspector had asked Sunisha to stay at her house for a few days. But her parents refused to accept her as she had eloped and married. They wanted her to leave the husband, Mr. Mahesh claimed. Meanwhile, an audio clip of Sunisha alleging domestic violence by her in-laws has surfaced. According to the clip, her husband’s parents used to beat her. The police have registered a case of unnatural death. The police said that the postmortem examination did not reveal any injuries or other marks of assault. The report suggested suicide. However, the police are investigating the exact reason that led to her death. They would consider changing the charges in the wake of the audio clip that has surfaced. Those in distress or having suicidal thoughts may call Disha on the toll-free No: 1056 for counselling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/woman-found-dead-at-husbands-house-in-kannur/article36216857.ece

Health Minister Veena George, who reviewed the progress of the developmental works at the Government Medical College, Ernakulam, and the centre along with Industries Minister P. Rajeeve here on Tuesday, said that steps would be taken to remove legal hurdles for the smooth completion of the construction work. Work on the new building came to a halt in December last year after the government cancelled the contractor’s agreement for delays in executing the work that began in 2018. The contractor had approached the Kerala High Court against the government decision. The Health Minister said that she would consult Mr. Rajeeve to expedite the legal process and start the work without delay. Infrastructure Kerala Ltd, which is implementing the project, had issued work orders to the new contractor. Ms. George said that the functioning of the cancer centre at the medical college hospital will resume by September second week. The cancer centre was shifted to the Ernakulam General Hospital after the Medical College Hospital was turned into a COVID-19 care centre last year. Surgeries were done at the Indira Gandhi Co-operative Hospital. Operation theatres The Minister said that the operation theatres at the hospital will start functioning from September 10 onwards after completing safety tests. The operations theatres were shut four months ago for maintenance work. Surgeries of non-COVID patients had also come to a halt following the situation. On the delay in the construction work on the Rs. 386-crore mother-and-child super speciality block at the hospital, Ms. George said that the works will resume within two days. The differences among contractors over payment issues will be resolved in a week. The target is to start the functioning of the block by November next year. The construction of the sewage treatment plant has to be completed before September 30, she said. Mr. Rajeeve said that the medical college hospital should have speciality wings in trauma care, neurosurgery and urology. The office of the Public Works Department will start functioning at the hospital from next week, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/minister-promises-steps-to-expedite-cancer-centre-work/article36216873.ece

Department sources said that the report had been forwarded to the Vigilance directorate in Thiruvananthapuram through the DySP’s office. Action on the basis of the report will be initiated by the Vigilance directorate. It is learnt that the Vigilance inquiry took into consideration CCTV footage from the Chairperson’s chamber. CCTV recordings are considered to be one of the crucial evidence in the case. Guarding chamber Meanwhile, there was high drama on the Thrikkakara municipal premises on Tuesday afternoon as a group of Opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) councillors assembled to possibly prevent the municipal Chairperson from entering her chamber after the municipal Secretary sealed it on Monday as part of the investigation into the allegations. The notice issued by N.K. Krishnakumar, municipal Secretary, said that the office chamber and the equipment in it, including the camera, CPU and computer hard disk, were part of the evidence being collected by the Vigilance and that no one should enter the chamber. P.C. Manoop, an Independent councillor who is part of the Opposition LDF, said that the opposition councillors had gathered to prevent the Chairperson from entering the office against the order of the Secretary. He alleged that the Chairperson would enter the chamber to tamper with evidence. More than a score of police personnel were deployed on the municipal office premises based on the report that the Chairperson would try to enter the chamber in the afternoon. However, Ms. Thankappan denied the rumours and said she was participating in a meeting in one of the Thrikkakara municipal divisions even as the Opposition was keeping vigil at the municipal office. ‘Clean chit’ The chairperson had said that she was innocent and that a district Congress party inquiry had given her a clean chit on the issue. The party leadership had said that the allegations were politically motivated after it met with the Chairperson and chairpersons of the standing committees in the municipal council. Twenty UDF members in the municipality had, in a written resolution, expressed confidence in the leadership of the Chairperson and extended total support for the present ruling council.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vigilance-submits-report-on-alleged-cash-payment/article36216878.ece

Anilkumar has sought a report on the allegations of corruption and malpractice in the Edappally zonal office of the Kochi Corporation. The Mayor sought the report from the Deputy Secretary of the civic body after complaints of rampant corruption and denial of service to the public came up at the meeting of the cooperation council on Tuesday. Several councillors complained that some of the officials of the civic body were illegally collecting money from the public under the pretext of COVID management facilities. Councillors from both the ruling front and the opposition benches raised the complaint at the council meeting. Issuing a warning to officials, Mr. Anilkumar said no official shall collect money or raise funds for the civic body. On the allegation that some officials were collecting money by stating that the Mayor had instructed them to raise funds, Mr. Anilkumar said he had not issued any such instructions to anyone. A few officials of the Edappally office had been transferred following complaints from the public. Yet more complaints are surfacing against officials. The corrupt officials will face the music and no one shall attempt to protect such officials. If the situation does not improve, the Mayor himself will have to approach the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau for a probe, he said. Waste collection centres Several councillors complained against the resurfacing of waste collection centres in the city. It was after a prolonged campaign that the civic body eliminated the waste collection centres where the municipal waste are dumped before being transported to the waste treatment plant, councillors complained. The councillors wanted to do away with the practice of collecting waste at some city points. Waste collected from the wards shall be directly transported into the lorries that ferry them to the processing yard. More tricycles shall be allotted for the purpose, councillors demanded. The Mayor directed Health Standing Committee chairman T.K. Ashraf to look into the issue.  No official has been authorised to raise funds for the civic body M.

The development assumes significance in the wake of the transfer of more than 25 personnel from the Fort Kochi office in the second week of August following allegations of delay in processing applications and some staff members demanding money for considering land conversion applications. District Collector Jaffar Malik had constituted a squad of Revenue Department officials to scrutinise the more than 3,000 files relating to land conversion applications at the RD office. Sources said that the report had been submitted to the District Collector. The administration has also finalised plans to reshuffle the staff members in more than 160 Revenue Department offices in the district following the allegations against the Fort Kochi office. Staff shortage C.A. Anish, State secretariat member of the Joint Council, said that a suggestion had been submitted to the Revenue Minister to constitute a special cell to look into the land conversion applications and complete the process in a time-bound manner so that the present complaints could be resolved. He said the suggestion was that officials and staff from Revenue Department offices in the district could be deployed in the special cell to speed up the process. He also said that there was a serious shortage of staff in the RD office, where land conversion applications have to be considered in addition to other applications from people in the four taluks under the office. The Fort Kochi office looks into applications from Aluva, Kochi, Kanayannur and Paravoor taluks. T.J. Vinod, MLA, said that a group of MLAs, including P.T. Thomas and Roji John, had sent an appeal to the Revenue Minister to consider relocating the RD office from Fort Kochi to the Kakkanad District Collectorate to make it more accessible to people from different taluks. People from Malayattoor and Ayampuzha and other distant areas have to travel to Fort Kochi now to submit applications, including applications for land conversion. The relocation of the office will help the people access the RD office more easily, said Mr. Vinod. Sub Collector appointed Meanwhile, P.

01 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Aiming to make Kerala animal-friendly||In a novel initiative, Daya Animal Welfare Organisation, recognised by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and active for the past two decades, has put together a technical team for the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme. The team, christened DATTA (Daya Technical Team for ABC), consists of a group of three veterinary surgeons led by consultant surgeon Kishore Janardhanan, and five animal handlers led by master animal handler Ramesh Pulickan, one of the founding members of Daya and trained in animal handling at the National Institute of Animal Welfare. First time The objective is to make Kerala animal friendly and rabies-free. “This is perhaps for the first time that an animal welfare organisation is setting up such a team. We have planned for at least the next 10 years since ABC is a long-drawn process. The initiative goes beyond animal welfare and should be seen as part of the larger public health programme. It will also add to the reputation of Kerala as a tourism destination, as inhumane culling of animals, like the recent episode involving stray dogs in Thrikkakara municipality in Ernakulam district, taints even the global image of the State,” said Ambily Purackal, coordinator and a founding member of Daya. DATTA could probably launch its operation in Thrikkakara since the Kerala High Court has entrusted Daya with the ABC programme of stray dogs in Thrikkakara in a suo motu public interest litigation on animal rights, though a final verdict is awaited. Sterilisations A team led by Mr. Janardhanan has done an inspection of ABC facilities of Kochi Corporation at Brahmapuram where Daya has proposed to conduct the sterilisation surgery of stray dogs from Thrikkakara. An inspection report explaining the sorry state of the road leading to the facility and other shortcomings such as faulty generator and air conditioner, has been submitted to the amicus curiae in the case. “In the long run, we plan to train and share our expertise with other recognised animal welfare organisations across the State,” said Ms. Purackal.

Inspecting the site for the station here on Tuesday, Mr. Raju said the terminal and yard would be completed in different stages. The construction of a 6,000-sq-ft building has already begun at the location and is expected to be completed within a month and a half. On completion, the yard will have a total built-up area of one-and-a-half-million sq ft. Mr. Raju was accompanied by Cooperation Minister V.N. Vasavan and Kottayam MLA Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, among others. The first phase of the terminal and yard is estimated to cost Rs. 94 lakh and Rs. 97 lakh respectively. The cost of the project will be met from the asset development fund of Mr. Radhakrishnan. The renovation of the bus station, after demolishing the 50-year-old building on the 4.8-acre property, had been in limbo since December 2014. The works hit a blockade following a dispute over land excavation and removal of mud from the construction site. Skywalk Meanwhile, a meeting convened by Mr. Raju here on Tuesday entrusted the Kottayam District Collector to hold consultations on cancelling the agreement with Kitco for constructing a skywalk above Seematti Round. Kitco had been unable to complete the project in a time-bound manner and further action can be taken only after the termination of the existing contract. The work on the Rs. 5.18-crore project, which began in February 2016, came to a halt within a few months after the installation of 14 metal pillars, besides the relocation of overhead electric cables and underground pipelines. The disruption in the work was attributed primarily to the delay in clearing the arrears of contractor agencies. The proposed skywalk aims to ease the pedestrian rush at the junction during the peak hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/first-phase-of-rtc-station-to-open-in-jan/article36216912.ece

01 September 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||After elections, churning in Kerala’s political parties||With no elections in the near future, mainstream political parties in Kerala are witnessing an organisational churning as never before in recent times. Perhaps, the political narratives in the State changed with the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M)-led Left Democratic Front breaking the 40-year jinx of power alternating between the Left-led parties and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). Amid the solid backing of the Central leadership, the newly emerged triumvirate comprising the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan and AICC general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal appears to be attempting to take over the reins of the Congress, while Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is keenly focusing on generational transformation, eliminating old guards in the CPI(M) with the beginning of party branch conferences by mid-September. As for the BJP, the central leadership is awaiting an opportunity to shake up the faction-ridden State unit. At present, its national leadership is obsessive about Uttar Pradesh, which is going to the poll early next year. It is still preoccupied with the debacle in West Bengal Assembly election too. A bitter power struggle in the Indian Union Muslim League ( IUML) and its split-away rebel faction of 25 years, Indian National League (INL), has already spilled into the open. The battle for supremacy in the IUML has been happening since 2004-2005. Unsurprisingly, much of the dissension now triggered by the replacement of the presidents of the District Congress Committees has poured out into public space followed by resignations, disciplinary actions and expulsions. However, the mutually-admiring troika has been emboldened to rejig the KPCC eclipsing the Oommen Chandy-Ramesh Chennithala binary that has been balancing the Congress party apparatus in the State for some time. Unlike the Congress, the discord between factions in the CPI(M) owing allegiance to V.S. Achuthanandan earlier and the “Kannur lobby’, as dubbed by the media, does not normally come out of the closet. The ambiguity will clear with the commencement of meetings at the branch, local committee, area committee, and district committee in September and October. Incidentally, the 23rd party Congress of the CPI(M) will be held in Kannur in April 2022. However, a stronger leadership in both the CPI(M) and the Congress is aiming at assuming control of the organisational structure. This will be seen in the changing profile of the leaders in the coming years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/after-elections-churning-in-keralas-political-parties/article36216398.ece
01 September 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Calicut varsity accused of manipulating interview||An applicant has alleged that the interview for the post of Assistant Professor in the Department of Education in the University of Calicut held in January this year was manipulated to appoint those close to the authorities. M.P. Bindu from Kannur had, under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, sought details of the interview, including the marks given to the candidates. The rank list had five names. Though she managed to get an order from the State Information Commissioner directing the university to furnish the information by August 10, the authorities did not oblige. She was told that providing the interview score sheet would pose a threat to the lives of the selection committee members. Ms. Bindu wrote to the Chief Information Commissioner highlighting the university’s response. The reply from the Vice Chancellor’s office on August 20 said that directions had been issued to provide “all the available documents”, as directed by the State Information Commissioner, to Ms. Bindu. The Vice Chancellor’s office claimed that the marks were given “after discussions by all the interview board members” and “based on the opinion of the subject experts”. Ms. Bindu was given 78 marks in the interview, it was informed. Another letter from the recruitment section of the university said on August 25 said that “marks of the appellant can be provided while those of the other candidates is a third party information exempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act” and “an order of the Central Information Commissioner”. Also, “name, educational qualification and experience of the list of candidates called for the interview”, and “name, address and declaration copy of the selectors and experts” cannot be provided. Her index marks, however, have been given as 80.5. Ms. Bindu alleged that if the marks were given after holding discussions, it clearly meant that they were not decided during the interview.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/calicut-varsity-accused-of-manipulating-interview/article36216862.ece

Chandrasekharan, has questioned the “violation of norms” in granting parole to the convicts in the murder of her husband in 2012 She told mediapersons here on Tuesday that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan owed an explanation why he took exceptional interest in granting parole to the convicts in this case. So far, the Chief Minister, who was holding the Home portfolio, had not given a reply when the question was posed by her in the Assembly, Ms. Rema said, adding that the CPI(M) leadership had maintained a good relationship with the convicts. She said that K.C. Ramachandran,a member of the local committee of the CPI(M), who was expelled from the party for his alleged role in the conspiracy, had secured bail for 547 days while another convict, Kirmani Manoj, was out of prison for 547 days. All the convicts, barring the prime accused N.K. Sunil Kumar aka Kodi Suni, had secured parole under extraordinary circumstances. The police authorities and the health department had furnished favourable reports for their parole. For Kodi Suni, it was better for him to remain in prison rather than getting a parole. The government provided him all facilities including a mobile phone, liquor and ganja, Ms. Rema alleged. She said that her party had been raising the issue of relaxing the parole norms for the convicts in the T.P. case for some time. Now, the party would move the court against the irregularities in the parole, she said. Chandrasekharan, a local leader of CPI(M), who had left the party in 2009 to form the (RMP), was brutally murdered on May 4, 2012.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rema-questions-parole-for-tp-murder-convicts/article36216861.ece

This political perspective of Islam is widely misrepresented and misinterpreted in the country and abroad. That’s why the traditional Sunni scholars of Kerala always rejected groups like Salafis and Jamat-e-Islami, which put forth reformist but extremist ideologies,” said Abdul Khadir Musliar in a statement. Rejecting the Taliban and other extremist groups as anti-Islamic, the Musliar said that Taliban and ISIS were the biggest threat to humanity. “Those upholding secular faith should be vigilant against linking Islamic faith to terror groups like Taliban,” he said. Foreign aggression  “Safeguarding the motherland from foreign aggressors, whatever be their faith, is every Muslim’s responsibility. Islamic faith teaches every Muslim to fight foreign aggression and to die for their country. That’s what our grandfathers and great-grandfathers did when they confronted the British,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/taliban-isis-biggest-threat-to-humanity-says-sunni-scholar/article36216853.ece
01 September 2021||MANGALURU/MYSURU,KERALA||Enforcing institutional quarantine norm turns tough||The State government’s directives making institutional quarantine mandatory for people coming from Kerala to Karnataka is fraught with difficulties in implementation in the border districts especially with regard to daily wagers and truckers. While educational institutions or industries are vested with the responsibility of quarantining their students and staff respectively, there is a lack of clarity on dealing with daily wagers. who seek employment in agricultural fields or truck drivers who ferry perishable commodities and commute in both the directions on a daily basis. Dakshina Kannada district administration has been quarantining outstation students and teaching/ non-teaching staff for a week and allowing them to the campus only if they are tested negative for COVID-19. The same measure has now been adopted by the State government in the revised guidelines for surveillance, containment and caution of COVID-19 released on August 30. But in the case of students and those working in educational institutions, who commute daily between Kasaragod district and Dakshina Kannada district, are asked to undergo RT-PCR test once every week. For over several weeks, district administration has made it mandatory for employees returning from short visits to their home towns in Kerala and Maharashtra to undergo one-week quarantine and report to duty only if they are tested negative for COVID-19. District COVID-19 Nodal Officer H. Ashok said the institutions, to a large extent, have been complying with the norms laid down by the State government. In the last one month, nearly 650 students tested positive following week-long quarantine. “We issued notices to three institutions after finding lapses in implementing COVID-19 guidelines and they have now agreed to strictly comply with norms,” said District Health and Family Welfare Officer Kishore Kumar. In Chamarajanagar district, the authorities have been insisting on RT-PCR negative report from anyone entering the district from Kerala or Tamil Nadu even if they are fully vaccinated. But the State government’s new rule on compulsory institutional quarantine if travelling from Kerala is proving to be a challenge. For, there is hardly any movement of industrial workers or students to and from Kerala given the general backwardness of Chamarajanagar. But there is daily movement of nearly 200 to 250 trucks carrying vegetables and other perishables from Moolehole check post in Bandipur which connects to Wayanad. The second entry point is at Chikkanahalla which connects to Gudaluru in Tamil Nadu and Mallapuram and Kozhikode in Kerala where another 300 trucks pass daily and hence institutional quarantine of truck drivers and agricultural workers is perceived to be impractical. “As far as truckers are concerned we insist on RT-PCR negative report whose validity is only for 15 days besides subjecting them to RAT each time they enter. But if they fail to carry the RT-PCR negative report, we turn them back,” said a senior official in the district administration. Though there is movement of agricultural workers in both the directions, the authorities said most tend to stay in camps till the completion of the agricultural season. But in case they enter Chamarajanagar the local authorities insist on RT-PCR negative report even if they are fully vaccinated apart from subjecting them to RAT. The authorities in Kodagu also follow similar norms but said they will seek clarification from the government on institutional quarantine of daily wagers and truckers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/enforcing-institutional-quarantine-norm-turns-tough/article36216403.ece
01 September 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||KAS postings by Nov. 1: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the Public Service Commission (PSC) is gearing up to recommend Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) appointments by November 1. The interview for various KAS posts will be completed in September, said Mr. Vijayan while inaugurating the PSC’s district office here on Tuesday. It is the first PSC district office in the State to have its own building. Mr. Vijayan said his government was committed to providing logistical support to the PSC to strengthen the Civil Services. He called upon the PSC to bring about changes in its syllabi in order to measure the quality and efficiency of candidates. “The syllabi should be modified in such a way as to create a feeling in the minds of the candidates that the government job is not merely a means of livelihood, but rather a public service.” 1,61,361 appointed Mr. Vijayan said that 1,61,361 candidates were given appointments through the PSC in the past five years. He said the government had appointed the Dinesh commission to study and report about the current situation that makes the candidates think that they would get a job if their name appears on the rank list. “At present, rank lists are compiled by including candidates five times the number required for the vacant posts. This is often disappointing for many. This will be looked into by the commission.” Online exam centres Mr. Vijayan said that PSC should have centres to conduct online examinations in all districts. In the Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, Ernakulam, and Kozhikode centres 887 candidates can write the online exams. The centre opened in Palakkad can admit 345 candidates to write the online exam. PSC chairman M.K. Sakeer presided over the function. Speaker M.B. Rajesh inaugurated the working of the PSC district office. Minister for Power K.

He said there would be exceptions in the case of Waqf Board and Devaswom Board institutions because they were associated with respective religions. “But a government hospital should not be equated with Waqaf Board or Devaswom Board,” he said.

01 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Survey finds 2,500 street vendors||As many as 2,500 street vendors were officially identified in a ground-level survey conducted by the Thiruvananthapuram city Corporation in July, as per the instructions of the State government. Officials say that the numbers are set to increase as many might have been missed due to the pandemic and the inability of vendors to function in areas which were under containment zones. Out of the street vendors identified in the survey, more than 600 are existing vendors who were identified in earlier surveys, while 1,800 are new vendors. According to officials of the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM), which handles applications for new street vendors, the recent Government order that only those street vendors who have got licenses from the respective local bodies can conduct business might have made more people to get themselves licensed. The surveyors have also found instances of one person owning and subletting vending carts or food trucks in different places. As per the rules, one person cannot get more than one license. The field-level survey was conducted in mid-July by a team of 40 surveyors, covering all the 100 wards of the Corporation. The increase in new applicants could also be due to the fact that more people have taken up street vending for survival, after losing their livelihood following the COVID-19 pandemic. “Some who were missed out in the survey are still coming forward and applying. The ones who were included in the older lists can easily be included once they apply, while for the new ones, checks have to be carried out. We have six more months before the list is closed and finalised. Around 200 of the vendors who were identified in 2015 have died, while some have left street vending and gone to other businesses,” said an NULM official. The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation had last conducted a comprehensive survey of street vendors in 2015, when the number of vendors was found to be 3,498. Loans The disbursal of the Rs. 20,000 loan for street vendors is also progressing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/survey-finds-2500-street-vendors/article36217142.ece
01 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Over 30,000 cases again||Intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator occupancy and hospitalisations continued to rise even as the State logged 30,203 new on Tuesday when 1,60,152 samples were tested in 24 hours. The test positivity rate (TPR) was 18.86%. The COVID-19 graph in the State had risen from a plateau of 20,000 plus cases daily to a new high of 30,000 to 32,000 cases in the space of one week post Onam, between August 21 and 28. While these are early days, the case graph now seems to be stabilising again at 30,000 to 32,000 cases daily. The current surge in ICU and ventilator occupancy is a reflection of the increase in cases during the August 21-28 period. If the graph again plateaued, the rising trend in ICU and ventilator occupancy would also stabilise, but at a higher baseline than earlier. Capacity augmented The current phase of the pandemic was essentially a wait-and-watch period, when the State’s policies ahead would be guided by the transmission dynamics. A further rise in the case graph could put much pressure on the health system. However, even if the daily cases went up by another 10,000, the State should be able to manage the ICU-ventilator situation as capacity had been increased after the second wave, according to sources. The ICU occupancy went up from 2,312 on Monday to 2,336 on Tuesday, while the number of patients requiring ventilator support went up from 984 to 1,002. 2,18,892 active cases The State’s active case pool rose to 2,18,892, while 20,687 patients recovered on Tuesday. The cumulative fatality now stands at 20,788 with the State adding 115 recent deaths to the list. The number of patients newly admitted to hospitals was 2,698, while the hospitalisations of those with moderate or severe infections rose to 31,707. Among the districts, Malappuram reported the highest number of new cases at 3,576, followed by Ernakulam 2,548, Kollam 3,188, Kozhikode 3,066, Thrissur 2,806, Palakkad 2,672, Thiruvananthapuram 1,980, Kottayam 1,938, Kannur 1,927, Alappuzha 1,833, Pathanamthitta 1251, Wayanad 1,044, Idukki 906, and Kasaragod 468 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/over-30000-cases-again/article36216930.ece

According to the Pothencode police, Prabha, alias Sheeba, of Irinjayam, near Nedumangad, died after her husband, Selvaraj of Mangattukonam, purportedly slit her neck using a knife. The incident occurred along the Mangattukonam road near Sasthavattam junction around 3.30 p.m. The couple had married ten years ago after Selvaraj divorced his first wife. They have two children, aged six and four years. While the family has been residing in Irinjayam for eight months, Prabha used to earn a living by working as a maid in a house in Mangattukonam for the last three years. Selvaraj had apparently gone to his house in Mangattukonam on August 20 following an argument that broke out between the duo. The police said the accused had created a ruckus in the house she worked two days ago. Infuriated This incident could have infuriated Selvaraj and prompted him to murder his wife, an official said. On Tuesday, Selvaraj purportedly waylaid Prabha when she finished her work and covered her mouth with a piece of cloth in an apparent bid to muffle her cries before slitting her neck. He is suspected to have bought a knife for the crime that is believed to be a premeditated attack.

Prasanth, who was expelled from the Congress a day ago, has blamed senior party leader K.C. Venugopal for the internecine strife that has rocked the party State unit. Mr. Prasanth, who unsuccessfully contested the recent Assembly elections from Nedumangad constituency, was removed from the primary membership of the party after he wrote to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi blaming Mr. Venugopal for the party’s electoral defeats in Kerala and other States. Speaking to media persons after formally tendering his resignation on Tuesday, the former Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) secretary said he had ended his three-decade long association with the party. Dismissing claims that he intended to align with the Left Democratic Front (LDF), Mr. Prasanth said he was yet to decide on his future plans. Admitting that he had been a staunch ‘A’ group loyalist, Mr. Prasanth alleged that Mr. Venugopal attempted to form a new group. “Only those who owed allegiance to him were appointed as District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents,” he said. He was also scathing in his criticism of Palode Ravi, who was appointed as the president of Thiruvananthapuram DCC. Accusing Mr. Ravi of working against the party’s interests, Mr. Prasanth said he was rewarded despite contributing towards his defeat in the Nedumangad constituency. He singled out Mr. Ravi for the party’s declining prominence in Nedumangad and other parts of the district. “The Congress had ruled the Nedumangad municipality when he (Mr. Ravi) had represented the constituency. Pothencode grama panchayat had also been a party stronghold for 30 years. Now, the party only has control of Vembayam grama panchayat in the constituency. This too was made possible only with the backing of the Socialist Democratic Party of India (SDPI). The Congress was pushed to the third place in many places, including Karakulam. Mr. Ravi has been responsible for the growing influence of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and communal organisations in the region,” Mr. Prasanth alleged. Even while remaining tight-lipped about his next move, Mr. Prasanth said the LDF returned to power because of good governance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/venugopal-responsible-for-infighting-expelled-leader/article36217131.ece

01 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M), BJP trying to reap political dividend||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appear to wade into the bitter dissension within the Congress over the appointment of District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents. Notably, CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan has welcomed Congress leader A.V. Gopinath’s resignation. Mr. Gopinath is the latest victim of the singular lack of inner-party democracy in the Congress. His endorsement of Mr. Gopinath has triggered speculation that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) might make some broad arrangement for accommodating disgruntled Congress leader and his sizeable cohort of followers in Palakkad. Mr. Gopinath is yet to lay all his cards on the table. He is reportedly open to exploring the possibility of a face-saving deal with the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leadership. KPCC president K. Sudhakaran has reportedly despatched envoys to pacify Mr. Gopinath, first and foremost to pre-empt more copycat mutinies by the rank and file from rocking the party. The BJP has also sought to make hay out of the Congress predicament. BJP State general secretary M.T. Ramesh has signalled that the party would welcome Congress workers who accept the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Factional feud The factional feud in the Congress appears to assume an "undesirable" caste tinge. An unsigned poster near the KPCC headquarters here proclaims that the Congress has kept away the Nadar community from leadership posts. The Nadar community is a crucial demographic in Kerala and has traditionally supported the Congress. The KPCC seems to derive some respite from tit-for-tat exchanges between factional leaders. However, expelled KPCC secretary P.S. Prasanth blamed Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal for the party’s ‘dismal’ situation. The official KPCC leadership appears to close ranks against factionalism that threatens to upend the party's reorganisation bid. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan and Mr. Sudhakaran hint that the party would crack the whip on indiscipline. The party’s internal matters are its own. The party would address the issues raised by UDF partners separately, Mr. Satheesan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-bjp-fishing-in-troubled-cong-waters/article36216408.ece
01 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Inquiry ordered into Attingal incident||State Police Chief Anil Kant has instituted an inquiry into the alleged harassment of an eight-year old girl and her father by a woman police officer who was formerly attached to the Pink Patrol unit under the Thiruvananthapuram Rural Police. Harshita Attalluri, Inspector General of Police, South Zone, has been entrusted with the probe. The order was issued shortly after the complainant, Jayachandran, met Mr. Kant and appealed for a detailed probe into the incident. The inquiry pertains to an incident that occurred at Moonumukku near Attingal on August 27 when woman senior civil police officer (CPO) Rejitha had wrongly accused the father-daughter duo of stealing her mobile phone. While she was subsequently transferred to the Kollam city police and also ordered to undergo a 15-day behavioural training course, the move did not placate the complainant who accused her higher-ups of protecting her. Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights had registered a suo moto case in connection with the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/inquiry-ordered-into-attingal-incident/article36217139.ece

01 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||WCD dept.’s social media drive gets hits||‘Sthreekal Nilkendidathu Nilkanam’ reads a recent post on the Facebook page of the Kerala State Women and Child Development (WCD) Department. Just in case the message is not clear, the post clarifies the space for women that is being referred to – good education, a job they like and financial independence. ‘Ini Venda Vittuveezhcha’ (no more compromises) goes the hashtag campaign. One post goes ‘Kettil Kurungarathu Swapnangal’ (do not let dreams get tangled in the wedding knot), while another underlines that freedom is a woman’s right, not something that is to be allowed in ‘necessary’ quantities. These women-centric messages on the department’s social media accounts have created such a buzz that what was launched as a four-month campaign on women empowerment in December last year is still on. Umpteen conversations The relatable content has started umpteen conversations on social media and elsewhere. When the work on the new-look campaigns began in March last year, the department’s Facebook page had some 2,000 likes, its YouTube channel had about 500 subscribers, and no Instagram presence. The first major content of the campaign was the responsible parenting segment with the slogan ‘Namakku Valaraam, Nannayi Valartham’ (Let us grow up, raise children well too). Ajay Sathyan, creative head (digital), Maitri Advertising Works, says they wanted to be creative with the campaign but not sound sanctimonious. “When it came out, it struck a chord with the people. Two videos with actors Indrajith and Poornima Indrajith also evoked a good response. Then came the women empowerment campaign. Here too, the strategy was to turn on its head the cliches on what women are or how they should behave to get the message across.” WCD Director T.V. Anupama says the campaign started with brainstorming and discussions between the department and the agency. Once the basic concepts were identified, they were converted into creatives posts on social media after approval. Some of the campaigns that have gone viral include those against dowry, domestic violence, abusive relationships, gender equality, body shaming, family planning and sexual harassment. A campaign that generated a lot of conversations was one on the right of women, married or not, to go ahead with a pregnancy or terminate it for reasons allowed by law. The ‘Amma’ campaign in connection with Mothers’ Day was a call to see mothers not as superwomen with unending reserves of love and patience but as an ordinary women who experienced emotions such as love, grief, anger and exhaustion like anyone else. A video by singer Arya Dhayal against gender discrimination also gained a lot of traction on social media. Today, the department’s Facebook page has been liked by more than 85,000 people, has 30,000 followers on Instagram, and its YouTube channel has more than 65,000 subscribers. Besides the extended campaigns, the social media platforms also see messages posted on day-to-day basis. Contemporary issues Ms. Anupama says the department brings out social media posters and videos on contemporary issues as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wcd-dept-campaign-a-hit-on-fb/article36217135.ece

01 September 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Manathakkali holds hope for liver cancer patients||Never underestimate the unassuming manathakkali (Black nightshade), also called sukkuti keerai , growing abundantly in your backyard. Scientists have found that it can treat liver cancer. This discovery by a research team led by Ruby John Anto, senior scientist at the Division of Cancer Research at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram, has received many international patents, including those from the U.S., Canada, Japan and South Korea. The work has been published in the nature group journal Scientific Reports . Dr. Anto and her team, including her student Lekshmi R. Nath, identified a natural compound, uttroside B, present in the leaves of manathakkali ( Solanum nigrum Linn) that has liver-protective properties. Liver cancer, mainly Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), is the third leading cancer worldwide. “Sorafenib and Regorafenib are the only U.S. FDA-approved drugs currently available for the treatment of HCC. But they have limited therapeutic efficacy and serious toxicity/side effects,” says Dr. Anto. The study reveals that uttroside B isolated from manathakkali is more potent than Sorafenib and does not have significant side effects . “It does not kill as many healthy cells as Sorafenib does while attacking the cancer cells.” Used in Ayurveda This medicinal plant has been used in Ayurveda for liver health . In Tamil Nadu, it is used for treating stomach ulcers, piles, and mouth ulcers. In collaboration with L. Ravishankar (CSIR-NIIST, Thiruvananthapuram), who has developed a novel method to isolate the compound from Solanum nigrum leaves, Dr. Ruby’s team is currently evaluating its efficacy against fatty liver, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver cancer caused by food toxins. She is also evaluating the efficacy and pharmacological safety of the compound in volunteers and in patients consuming Solanum nigrum leaves as part of their naturopathy and Ayurveda treatment against liver diseases in collaboration with Reny M.K., Chief Medical Officer, Punarjani Naturopathy Hospital, Wadakkanchery, and Siny J. Shaju, Medical Director, Aswini Theertham Ayurkendra, Kunnamkulam. The preliminary data show promising results, even in patients suffering from chronic liver disease and HCC, says Dr. Anto. The RGCB has been collaborating with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, U.S., for the research, development, and clinical translation of uttroside B. The compound is being manufactured by Chemveda, Hyderabad. The technology is now being developed by the U.S.-based biopharma company QBioMed, for which the RGCB has received licensing revenues. Recently, QBioMed’s uttroside B program received orphan drug designation from the U.S. FDA against HCC, which allows fast track development and approval of the drug.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/manathakkali-holds-hope-for-liver-cancer-patients/article36216923.ece

01 September 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Focus should be on dryland farming to increase foodgrain production’||Pointing out that the productivity of irrigated land in the country is reaching the saturation point, ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture Director V.K. Singh has said that it is time the policymakers must focus on increasing the productivity of dryland. During his first-ever visit to the Agriculture Research Station at Rekulakunta, which has been working extensively on dryland agriculture, on Tuesday, Mr. Singh said that the benefits of research must reach every farmer in the country to ensure judicious use of the available irrigation water. Of the 141 million hectares of estimated crop area in the country, close to 80 million hectare is under dryland farming, which is 52% of the total cultivable land, he said. “There is a need to enlighten the bureaucrats and policymakers about our achievements in the field so that these can be incorporated in planning stage at the national and State levels as there is a vast scope to increase the productivity of dryland agriculture from the current average of 1.2 tonnes per hectare to anywhere close to 2 tonnes,” said Mr. Singh, adding that the productivity of irrigated land is reaching a saturation at 3.2 tonnes per hectare, leaving remote scope for a significant increase beyond this point. New technologies “Around 52% of the land under dryland agriculture is producing 44% of the food grain in the country. With some innovative technologies such as sub-surface drip irrigation and cultivating drought-resistant varieties, it is easy to propel the average production to 2 tonnes per hectares, which would dramatically improve foodgrain production,” Mr. Singh told The Hindu . Citing an example of maize crop, he said a hectare needs only 2.5 lakh litres of water during the crop period. “Anantapur district receives 55 lakh litres per hectare on an average. We need to work on soil mixture retention technologies so that many crops can be grown,” Mr. Singh explained. Even irrigation-intensive districts such as Baghpath in Punjab that find it difficult to get groundwater or irrigation facilities in some pockets are now turning to grow mustard, barley. The dryland agriculture technologies can come in handy for the farmers there, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/focus-should-be-on-dryland-farming-to-increase-foodgrain-production/article36217057.ece

It has termed the 42-page letter of Telangana to the KRMB seeking to stop work on the Hundri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) project, lifeline of Rayalaseema, as an attack on the rights of the region and said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s silence on the matter was perplexing. Party politburo member and former Minister Kalava Srinivasulu at a press conference here on Tuesday announced that the party was charting out an agitation plan for protecting the water rights of Rayalaseema if the State government failed to do so at the two-day meeting in Hyderabad. There is a danger of HNSS project, envisioned by former Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao, getting stalled if the State government was unable to defend its position, he said. “The TDP government had spent Rs. 5,700 crore on the 2,036 km HNSS project during its rule, but after the YSRCP came to power no work has been executed,” he pointed out. At a time when Telangana was constructing the Palamuru-Rangareddy project and Karnataka Chief Minister was bent on increasing the Alamatti dam height, why was Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy keeping quiet, he questioned. “Before the polls, the CM had promised to increase the drawing capacity of the HNSS from the current 3,850 cusecs to 10,000 cusecs by digging a parallel canal and widening the existing one to allow 6,000 cusecs drawal. What happened to the promise?” Mr. Srinivasulu asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/protect-seemas-water-rights-at-krmb-meet-tdp-tells-govt/article36217048.ece

Prakash — were killed when the SUV they were in, jumped onto the footpath and rammed into the compound wall of a bank at Koramangala early Tuesday morning. According to the police, the MLA’s son, Karunaa Sagar (25), who was behind the wheel, lost control of the vehicle on 80ft Road. He was reportedly driving towards Forum Mall Junction when the accident took place around 1.30 a.m. “The SUV hit the wall with such intensity and speed that it was completely mangled. Though it was a five-seater, there were seven people in the car. Our preliminary investigation revealed that rash and negligent driving led to the accident,” said a senior police officer. The officer added that none of the passengers were wearing seat belts, and that airbags did not activate. The entire incident was recorded on CCTV in the area. Employees of a hotel in the vicinity and a few passers-by tried to help the passengers, who were trapped in the vehicle, before alerting the Adugodi police. “Eye-witnesses said they saw smoke coming out from the engine and doused it for fear that the car would catch fire. The passengers were trapped inside the mangled vehicle. They had to use force to open the doors and get them out,” said a police source. A crane was used to extricate the car. The passengers were taken to St John's hospital where doctors declared them as brought dead. Five of the deceased were living in paying guest accommodations at Koramangala 5th block: Ishita Biswas, 21, who hails from Maharashtra; Dhanusha M, 29, a dentist from Kerala and Akshay Goyal, 25, from Malappuram; Utsav, 25, from Rohtak from Haryana, who worked in the city as an auditor; and Rohith, 23, a business development officer healing from Hubballi. They were all known to the sixth passenger, Bindu, 28, a close friend of Karunaa Sagar. The Adugodi traffic police have taken up a case against the driver of the car under section 279 ( Rash driving or riding on a public way) and section 304a (causing death by negligence) for further investigations. “We are waiting for the blood sample and medical reports to ascertain whether Karunaa Sagar was driving under the influence of alcohol,” the police officer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hosur-mlas-son-and-six-others-killed-in-car-crash-in-bengaluru/article36216402.ece

The accused, Singu Venkatesh, who had allegedly undergone training in manufacturing the guns in Chennai, was making them by procuring raw material from Tamil Nadu, West Godavari SP Rahul Dev Sharma said. What led the police to Venkatesh was the murder of a villager at Veerampalem a couple of days ago. Krishna Mohan had shot dead his brother at Veerampalem under the Tadikalapudi police station limits. The accused had said that he bought the gun for Rs. 16,000 from Reddy Krupavaram of Pedavegi mandal. During questioning, Krupavaram confessed that he had procured the weapon from Venkatesh for Rs. 13,000. Based on his confession, the Chintalapudi and Tadikalapudi police raided the house of Venkatesh in Eluru, and seized the weapons, Mr. Sharma told The Hindu . “The police seized 31.5 kg steel balls used as ball bearings in bicycles, some ammunition and tools. We are trying to find out for how long the accused has been doing the illegal business, how many guns he has sold so far, and the details of the buyers,” the SP said, adding that a case under the Arms Act was registered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/man-held-11-hunting-guns-seized/article36216451.ece

01 September 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Long road to closure in Hyderabad’s drug scam||The four-year-old saga of Telugu film industry personalities coming under the scanner of Telangana Prohibition and Excise officials has roots in series of drug seizures in the first week of July 2017. The excise teams spent 20 days and around Rs. 50,000 to penetrate the network of drug suppliers, caught three alleged peddlers in the early hours of July 1, 2017, and seized around 700 blots of LSD and 35 grams of MDMA. The seizures continued. The excise officials and staff had to pose as customers to get a closer look into the drug supply system in Hyderabad. More peddlers were caught. People in the State were shaken up when officials said regular users of the drug included students from prominent schools and colleges, and a prominent film producer. Later, based on information from drug peddlers, call data records (CDR), photos, and other evidence, the Department sent notices to 12 celebrities from the film fraternity to appear before the Excise Department’s Special Investigation Team (SIT). Some of the peddlers dropped names of high-profile clients to whom they had allegedly supplied narcotics and psychotropic substances. After the notices were issued to film personalities in mid July-2017, limelight has shifted to the celebrities. They were questioned from July 19 to August 2. Some of the personalities might undergo drug detox sessions before attending the questioning session. The officials thought through the questions that needed to be asked, when to put on table the photographs, CDR and other evidence gathered. Media personnel waited outside the Prohibition and Excise department office at Nampally during the SIT questioning. However, it still remains an open-ended case. Though several raids were conducted and drugs were seized in later years too, questioning of the film personalities remains to be the last high profile episode at the department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/long-road-to-closure-in-hyderabads-drug-scam/article36216395.ece
01 September 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Flood to Jurala set to fill up Srisailam dam storage||Rains in the local (Telangana) catchment areas as well those in the immediate upstream areas of the Bhima Sub-Basin in Karnataka are set to replenish the storage of Srisailam reservoir at least to some extent as it has fallen below 160 tmc ft against its capacity of 215.8 tmc ft. According to Jurala dam engineers, the inflow into the dam, which was at 25,000 cusecs at 6 a.m. on Tuesday has reached 54,000 cusecs by 6 p.m. and the discharge of flood went up from 16,000 cusecs in the morning to 74,500 cusecs in the evening. The spillway gates were operated after a gap of about three weeks around 2 p.m., when the engineers lifted four crest gates for 1 metre height each to let 16,700 cusecs water into the river from the spillway. Supplementation to the river flow downstream, however, has been going all along except for a few days with power generation. The spillway discharge was increased to 41,500 cusecs from 4 p.m., when six more gates were lifted for the same height, although the inflow remained constant at over 54,000 cusecs. The storage of Srisailam has depleted to below 160 tmc ft due to the constant release of water to river course from power generation and release to various water drawal systems of AP and Telangana. Meanwhile, most of the streams and rivulets in the Godavari Basin were in spate with rains in their catchment areas for the last 3-4 days. However, rains have receded on Tuesday compared to the previous couple of days. According to the Planning Department, a highest of 79.5 mm rainfall was recorded at Kammarpally in Nizamabad district from 8.30 am till 7 p.m. Over 50 mm rain was also recorded at a few places in Jagityal, Bhupalapally, Bhongir, Peddapalli and Adilabad. About 31 mm to 47 mm rain was also recorded at 13 places. All the 28 medium irrigation projects in the Godavari Basin and eight in the Krishna Basin were also either in surplus or near surplus position. The cumulative inflow into the projects was 74,600 cusecs and outflow was 77,060 cusecs and their cumulative storage was 54.38 tmc ft against the capacity of 62.12 tmc ft. On the other hand, all major projects in the Godavari Basin were getting good inflows.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/flood-to-jurala-set-to-fill-up-srisailam-dam-storage/article36216838.ece
01 September 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Not mandatory to attend school: Telangana govt.||State government on Tuesday had to partially amend its earlier decision to reopen all government and private schools from Wednesday, with Telangana High Court passing interim directions in a Public interest litigation (PIL) petition over reopening of schools. Earlier, it was decided to reopen all government and private schools and conduct physical classes for students of all standards unconditionally. With the High Court passing interim directions, the government announced that “no child should be compelled by any school management to physically attend classes if his or her parent was not inclined to send the child to school”. ‘Arbitrary decision’ The interim instructions were passed by a bench of Acting Chief Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao and Justice T. Vinod Kumar after hearing a PIL plea challenging government’s decision to reopen schools. Actually the petitioner, Mandapati Bala Krishna, requested the HC to declare conducting physical classes for students of all pre-primary and primary schools arbitrary and set aside the decision. The bench, however, decided to expand the plea’s scope covering all school-going children. In compliance with the bench’s order, the government left it “open to school managements to have only physical classes, only virtual classes or both”. In the backdrop of reports that school managements were obtaining undertakings from parents to absolve them of any liability in the event of a student contracting coronavirus while in school, the government declared that such undertakings would have no legal sanctity. School Education Secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania, in a memo issued in conformity with HC orders, instructed School Education Director to prepare Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all school managements organising physical classes within a week. These SOPs would be publicised widely through print and electronic media. While all schools were permitted to reopen from Wednesday, all government residential schools with hostel facilities, including those run by Social and Tribal Welfare departments, were barred from reopening for four weeks. The division bench headed by Acting CJ observed that government failed to explain in its memo about safety measures taken in residential schools with hostels. When Advocate General B.S. Prasad requested the bench to lift the restrictions on residential schools, Acting CJ M.S. Ramachandra Rao said the “government waited for so long and can wait four more weeks”. Issuing notices to the government in the PIL petition, the bench directed it to file counter affidavit.  Worrisome issues  COVID-19 virus is still prevalent, has mutated into several variants. Two waves reported, third wave is predicted in September/October. Vaccines are available for 18 plus adults, but they don’t give complete immunity. No vaccine available for children below 18 years of age. Complete vaccination of 18 plus adults not done.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/not-mandatory-to-attend-school-telangana-govt/article36216396.ece

Responding to TDP leaders’ two-day visit to the project-affected areas that began on Tuesday, Mr. Kannababu said TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh should stop the ‘false campaign’ on the Resettlement and Rehabilitation exercise of the Polavaram irrigation project. “The TDP had managed to build 3,110 houses in the R&R colonies during its five-year rule while we have built 47 R&R colonies with 16,000 houses in the past two years. The construction of over 1.02 lakh houses is in progress,” Mr. Kannababu said at a press conference here. On the allegation of delay in meeting the deadlines of the R&R package and project status, Mr. Kannababu said, “The R&R components and the plight of the affected families have never been the priority during the TDP rule.” “The State government has borne a financial burden of Rs. 550 crore towards fulfilling the promise to ensure Rs. 10 lakh compensation to each affected family. It includes the financial package entitled to under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013,” he said. Additional compensation Mr. Kannababu said that Rs. 3.35 lakh additional compensation was being offered by the State government to a non-tribal family and Rs. 3.59 lakh for a tribal family, ensuring that each family got the Rs. 10 lakh compensation.

State Reorganisation Act, 2014, along with the Handri Neeva, Galeru Nagari, Telugu Ganga, Kalvakuruthi and Netampadu projects.

The Dasara festival will be organised from October 7 to 15 this year. Temple authorities estimate that over Rs. 1.34 crore will be required for making necessary arrangements such as tents, queue lines, transportation, lighting and the decoration of the ‘Hamsa Vahanam’. Authorities have already invited tenders for the works costing less than Rs. 10 lakh. Proposals for the remaining works have been sent to the Endowments Commissioner for approval. Authorities are planning to invite tenders in a week’s time and are awaiting clearance of proposals, a senior official said. The work orders for Hamsa Vahanam, a special boat built in the shape of a mythical swan, were issued. It is estimated that the Hamsa vahanam would cost around Rs. 6 lakh. Temple priests take out the Utsav Vigrahams (processional deities) of Goddess Durga and Lord Mallikarjuna Swamy for ‘Nadi Viharam’ (celestial boat ride) on the Krishna on the concluding day of the festivities. Devasthanam authorities are making arrangements for a hassle-free darshan during Dasara festivities. A 1.5 km-long queue line would come up from the Vinayaka temple on Canal Road to the Kanaka Durga temple atop Indrakeeladri. Officials are planning three queue lines — a free darshan line, one Rs. 100-ticket line and a Rs. 300-ticket line — for darshan of the presiding deity. It is estimated that erection of queue lines would cost Rs. 22 lakh, sources said. The Devasthanam is planning to erect tents for the convenience of pilgrims at various locations, which is estimated to cost Rs. 12.50 lakh. Likewise, temporary illumination of the temple precincts, canal road, and ghats would cost around Rs. 25 lakh. The transportation facilities would cost Rs. 8 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dasara-preparations-begin-at-indrakeeladri/article36216453.ece
01 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Power charges ‘adjustment’ decried||Activists of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) staged a protest in front of Vidyut Soudha here on Tuesday in protest against what it termed the State government levying a burden of Rs. 3,669 crore on the people under the garb of charges adjustment. The activists burnt the copies of APERC orders. Addressing the gathering, CPI(M) State secretariat member Ch. Babu Rao said the State government had “surrendered” to the Union government totally. Both the State and Central governments in concert had been burdening the people who were already reeling under the COVID woes. For a mere loan of Rs. 2,500 crore from the Centre, the State government had initiated reforms in the power sector. The adjustment charges were being levied in an attempt to pave the way for private firms in the power sector, he alleged. It was ridiculous that the APERC gave directions to the State government to bridge the gap between power consumed and bills paid between 2014 and 2019 by levying an additional Rs. 1.27 per unit. The burden would be on people for the next 8 months either directly or indirectly. The YSRCP, while in Opposition, opposed the adjustment charges levied by the TDP government. It was surprising that the YSRCP government was following the same path, he said. CPI(M) leaders B. Nageswara Rao, Boyi Satyababu, B. Ramana Rao, K. Durga Rao, T. Praveen and others participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/power-charges-adjustment-decried/article36217193.ece

01 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Schools reopening today, hope for good student turnout floats||With the academic session for schools and colleges set to resume on Wednesday, there seems to be a lack of cohesive agreement between managements and parents on the modalities of reopening. Schools, however, are expecting a good turnout of students. The educational institutions are yet to come to terms with the modalities and some of them want to wait and watch till a clear picture emerges. Should there be a sequential opening of classes or should doors be opened for the entire student community, is the dilemma for most schools. They are also a bit apprehensive about a positive response from majority of parents. Wait and watch Corporate colleges seem to be adopting a wait-and-watch policy as they have not sent any information to the parents on the reopening. Narayana College in Nallakunta has informed parents that classes will not start on September 1 and information in this regard would be conveyed to them two to three days prior to opening of offline classes. Until then, they would continue with online classes. Sanjit Reddy Kaila, a student of DRS International School in Dulapally, says their school will open from September 6 and that they were asked to give consent. “We have decided to opt for online classes for now,” his father, Madhukar Reddy Kaila, said. Similar is the response of Kiran Alekanti, who has decided not to send his daughters Anika and Aditri, students of Delhi Public School, Nacharam, even if the school reopens now. “We are worried about children maintaining physical distancing, given the large number of students that will be converging on campus,” he said.  Ashish Neredi of Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) said schools lacked clarity on reopening till the High Court orders on Tuesday. Other states have opened in a sequential or staggered manner starting with higher classes and that the Telangana government could have adopted such a strategy to infuse confidence among parents. Vaccination status HSPA representatives Ramanjeet and Seema said that the State must ask schools to communicate to parents about the vaccination status of teaching and non-teaching staff and also not to unduly force parents for uniform and books. The association also warned that the government should take strict action against schools that violate the High Court’s orders and it will not go back on filing contempt against such schools. Telangana Residential Schools Managements Association president, Kandala Papi Reddy said that they are expecting good response from parents, particularly in rural areas and small towns. He said schools in Andhra Pradesh, where classes began from August 16, are registering close to 70% attendance. “It is a positive sign and we hope this will enable students to get back into the academic groove,” he said. Primary schools Meanwhile, Telangana State Private Teachers Association (TSPTA) has said that classes for primary schools should be postponed till September 30. Syed Showkat Ali, president of TSPTA, said that opening schools without proper infrastructure in schools will hurt students. Moreover, it was not fair to run classes for certain schools from Wednesday and after a month for social welfare schools, Mr Showkat Ali remarked.  We are worried about children maintaining physical distancing, given the large number of students that will be converging on campus.

01 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP seeks govt’s stance on GO 111 on lake protection||Top TRS leaders had purchased acres of farmland at cheap rates from farmers to build farm houses within the vicinity of Osmansagar and Himayatsagar and it is time the government declared its stance on the contentious GO 111, which has put certain restrictions on the construction activity around them, said Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Tuesday. “Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has promised to remove the GO but did not, and within the lakes’ geographical zone, his kith and kin have built farm houses. But his government has no money to build two-bedroom houses even after the Centre had allocated 70,000 houses to the rural poor. From subsidised rice to vaccine to roads in villages, the funds are coming from the Centre,” he told a public meeting on the fourth day of his ‘Praja Sangrama Yatra’ passing through Chilkur-Moinabad. In fact, the TRS government has no money to even pay salaries to the employees and is into taking away existing jobs, has come out with new schemes like ‘Dalit Bandhu’ only to cheat the people once again, he said. As the meeting was being held in Ranga Reddy district, he accused the government of having neglected the area although it supplies essential commodities to the twin cities from vegetables to fruits and others. Whereas the Centre has allocated Rs. 1,040 crore for construction of roads, toilets and others, he claimed. Mr. Sanjay Kumar made no bones in stating that his present programme is part of the overall effort to defeat the TRS in the next elections and bring the party to power to establish a ‘true democratic and strong government’. “People have to decide if they want Sardar Patel rule or the Nizam’s. You have given opportunities to Congress, Telugu Desam and TRS, give BJP a chance,” he said, amid cheers. National spokesperson Sambit Patra, who joined the ‘yatra’, criticised Mr. Rao and questioned why his son, nephews and even daughter got “good jobs” after Telangan State was formed but the same benefit was denied to the scores of unemployed youth. “I have never come across a Chief Minister who does not go to the Secretariat but confines himself to his farm house. Liquor and sand mafia is ruling State,” he claimed. Senior leader G. Narayan Reddy got many locals admitted into the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-seeks-govts-stance-on-go-111-on-lake-protection/article36216840.ece
01 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Cong. to delay Huzurabad candidature||Congress seems to have delayed the selection of the Huzurabad candidate till there is some clarity on the poll dates and also prolong the selection procedure to buy time before taking a final decision. TPCC working president Mahesh Kumar Goud made this clear when he announced at a press conference on Tuesday that the candidate selection will be done by the AICC after September 10, and the party wants to give every aspirant a chance to contest for the nomination. Application fee of Rs. 5k Those aspiring for the Huzurabad ticket for the bypoll will have to apply from September 1 to 5 at Gandhi Bhavan along with an application fee of Rs. 5,000, which he said was the normal practice in the party.

Sreedhar Babu, MLC T. Jeevan Reddy, former Deputy Chief Minister Damodar Rajanarasimha, former MP Ponnam Prabhakar, Warangal DCC president Nayini Narsimha Reddy and Karimnagar DCC president Kavvampalli Satyanarayana, would personally interview the aspirants on September 6. A report from the team will be sent to the AICC after September 10 and only then the candidate’s name would be announced. Mr. Mahesh Goud accused BJP president Bandi Sanjay of provoking people in the name of Nizam’s property. He reminded that the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1971 itself had abolished the privy purse made to ruling families of the erstwhile princely states after they integrated into India. Similarly, she also introduced the Land Ceiling Act taking away land from landlords. ‘Fooling people’ He said that BJP had ‘fooled’ people with Rs. 15 lakh promise to everyone. Similarly CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao was ‘fooling people’ with Dalit Bandhu promise. TRS, BJP and MIM are working together, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-to-delay-huzurabad-candidature/article36216844.ece

Thrishanth was one among the six persons in a car which was headed from Mominpet to Ravepally after a post-marriage ritual. Newly-wed couple Pravalika and Nawaz Reddy, the groom’s sister Radha, Swetha Reddy and her son Thrishanth were going in the car driven by one Raghavender Reddy. The car reached a road in Marpally where water was overflowing. Vikarabad police said that though the family had asked Raghavender to stop the car, he drove onto the road. The car stalled on the way and got swept away into an adjoining canal. The four-wheeler vehicle hit a tree which shattered the glass of a window. While Nawaz, Radha, and Raghavender escaped, bodies of Pravalika and Swetha Reddy were recovered at a distance. However, Thrishanth was not traced.

01 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||BJP, TRS working together to undermine Congress prospects, says Jagga Reddy||TPCC working president and Sangareddy MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy said that the political entry of Y.S. Sharmila and the ‘provocative’ padayatra of Bandi Sanjay had the blessings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in association with the TRS, was worried about the rising prospects of the Congress. At a press conference here on Tuesday, he alleged that Y.S. Vijayamma, widow of Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, was trying to play an active role to work against the interests of the Congress to help other parties. He argued that BJP wants to split anti-TRS votes and help undermine Congress’ chances. Mr. Reddy lashed out at the ‘provocative’ statements of Mr. Sanjay during his padayatra and said he should ask questions to Mr. Modi on the rising fuel prices and selling stakes in government-owned BSNL and LIC, among others. “This is hitting 85% of Hindus in the country and he talks about safeguarding Hindus, which is ridiculous,” he said. He said that BJP was trying to create communal atmosphere in the State in the name of goddess Bhagyalakshmi and also raking up the properties of the Nizam. “BJP is in power at the Centre and if there is anything illegal, it can confiscate Nizam’s land.

His anti-KCR comments too, are just fake and no one will believe him as he failed to even lodge complaints against KCR’s ‘corruption’ to the Centre,” he added.

01 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||UoH uses flexible organic crystals to develop OPICs||Researchers of the University of Hyderabad (UoH) are claiming a breakthrough in the use of flexible organic crystals to develop organic photonic integrated circuits. Currently, almost all electronic and photonic devices are developed using silicon as a key component. “This will enable us to develop flexible organic waveguides with ease. Recent developments in flexible waveguides prove the versatility of organic crystals as effective light transducers,” say the researchers. Jada Ravi, the final year PhD student in the group of R. Chandrasekar, School of Chemistry, exploited flexible organic crystal waveguides as a substitute to silicon-based waveguides to build organic PICs (OPICs). The researchers used N , N ′-bis( p -tolyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDIPH) and 9,10-bis (phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) supplied by P. Naumov, NY University, Abu Dhabi, as optical elements for OPICs. The study of elastic organic single crystals has emerged as a holy grail in computing research with vast scope for optical and optoelectronic applications. “The UoH team successfully demonstrated the construction of functional OPICs, which deliver excitation-position-dependent mechanism-selective light outputs at various crystal termini. The uniqueness of the fabricated circuit is that all the essential optical elements (waveguide and ring resonator) are obtained from flexible organic crystals,” informed a university press release. The research paper has been published in Advanced Functional Materials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/uoh-uses-flexible-organic-crystals-to-develop-opics/article36217115.ece

Mahender Reddy to reconsider the permission given to Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s yatra as he was “trying to create hatred among different communities through rabble-rousing speeches” in his padayatra. He said it was the responsibility of the State government and Police department to restrict Mr. Sanjay’s utterances in the larger interest of people. “Why is he raking up the issue of Nizam’s properties and that he would go to any extent for Hindus?” Mr. Niranjan said Nizam himself was a person of religious tolerance though he could not contain the excesses of ‘Razakars.’ He said the Nizam provided elephant ‘Hashmi’ for the Bonalu procession of Shri Akkanna Madanna Mahankaali Mandiram showing his tolerance to other religions. People like Raj Bahadur Venkatram Reddy was Kothwal of Hyderabad city and Raja Kishan Prasad and Raja Rao served in the Nizam’s court.

01 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Education, health equally important: HC||Since teaching and non-teaching staff in all government and private schools were not vaccinated cent per cent, there was a likelihood of students contracting COVID through them, Telangana High Court observed on Tuesday. Children who contract COVID-19 at schools would pass on the virus to their family members, some of whom could be senior citizens or have co-morbidity conditions. This would result in serious ramifications, a bench of Acting Chief Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao and Justice T. Vinod Kumar noted while hearing a PIL plea challenging the State government’s decision permitting all schools to conduct physical classes. At the same time, some sections of parents and school managements were insisting for physical classes. Lack of physical classes for months together affecting children’s psychological well-being and non-availability of electronic gadgets to avail online classes were some of the reasons cited by them, the Acting CJ said. “Hence, the court needs to strike a balance among conflicting considerations of all stakeholders,” he remarked. When Advocate General B.S. Prasad, stressing for physical classes, said even UNICEF recommended it, the Acting CJ said that cannot be a valid ground. The bench felt it was important if the government analysed difficulties in maintaining distancing in schools and children wearing masks throughout classes. The bench sought clarification from the AG if the government took any advice from the Experts Advisory Committee constituted by it to tackle COVID-19 on the matter. The bench instructed the government to file a counter affidavit in four weeks with details of how many government and social welfare schools had hostel facility. “Have the District Educational Officers concerned got reports of readiness from schools to conduct physical classes?”, the bench asked. The AG replied the government had wherewithal to monitor conditions of every school in the backdrop of COVID. “Can Hyderabad DEO all alone monitor the large number of schools and thousands studying there?” the bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/education-health-of-students-equally-important-says-hc/article36216823.ece

01 September 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Hit by pandemic, community-based tourism project struggles to stay afloat||The well thought out community-based tourism promotion initiative to turn the scenic environs around the Palair reservoir, situated along the Khammam-Suryapet highway in Kusumanchi mandal, into a tourism hub seems to be fast losing steam. The COVID-19-induced crisis dealt a blow to the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC)’s ambitious plan to develop the picturesque area around the water body abutting the highway into a major recreational centre. The community-based tourism initiative was launched by the DTPC a couple of years ago by roping in a group of local youth trained in operating the boat ride services under the aegis of Palair Gram Panchayat. The boating facility evoked good patronage from visitors in the initial few years prompting the authorities to draw up a grand plan to introduce more amenities at the roadside park and water sports activities in the reservoir. But the pandemic-led lockdowns in the past year-and-a-half disrupted the plan much to the disappointment of the regular visitors as well as water sports enthusiasts. The two tourism boats at the reservoir have been lying unused for the past few weeks, sources said. District Tourism Officer Suman Chakravarthy said that the reservoir area received heavy rains over the past few days bringing the boating services to a halt temporarily due to inclement weather. The tourism promotion plans and related activities in the district are likely to be reviewed by the higher authorities at a meeting slated to be held next week, he told The Hindu , when contacted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hit-by-pandemic-community-based-tourism-project-struggles-to-stay-afloat/article36217119.ece

Sources said that the traffic movement was suspended for sometime between Palair and Narasimhulagudem in Kusumanchi mandal due to waterlogging at a causeway on Tuesday afternoon. In Mudigonda mandal, vehicular movement was affected between Medepalli and Madhapuram villages after a swollen stream inundated a low-level causeway on Tuesday morning. All the 24 automatic gates of the Palair reservoir in Kusumanchi mandal remained open throughout Tuesday due to heavy inflows into the reservoir resulting in discharge of a huge volume of surplus waters downstream. In Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, two control rooms (08744 241950 and 08743 232444) have been set up in Kothagudem and Bhadrachalam respectively to monitor the rain-situation round-the-clock.

The IMD predicted that the coastal areas of South Gujarat and Saurashtra regions are likely to witness heavy rain till next Sunday. The State is witnessing the active wet spell after more than a month as August remained mostly dry, causing a deficit of more than 50% since the beginning of the southwest monsoon in mid June. “We only have three weeks to recover from the monsoon deficit as it hardly rained in August and while June and July saw significant drop in rain days,” an official said. He said Gujarat needs 3-4 spells in September for normal monsoon. So far, 31 of the 33 districts have recorded below normal monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/relief-to-farmers-government-as-rain-lashes-gujarat/article36216754.ece
01 September 2021||GURUGRAM,||Activists raise red flag over draft plan||The draft Regional Plan-2041 for the National Capital Region has dropped or amended several environmental safeguards present in the current plan (Regional Plan-2021) with a possible long-term disastrous implications for the Natural Conservation Zone in the region. The 40th meeting of the National Capital Region Planning Board was held through videoconference on Tuesday, but the draft report could not be approved after the Haryana government sought more time for submitting its comments. Though the draft plan says that the components under Natural Conservation Zones (NCZ) as in RP-2021 shall remain and be continued to be conserved, it categorises these as “forest” and “green cover” areas and makes the conservation of “green cover” optional. New categorisation Demanding that the distinction between the “forests” and the “green cover” be dropped, the environmentalists have expressed apprehensions that large areas of Aravalis not categorised as forest will lose their mandatory conservation status under the new provision. The draft plan, in another major amendment, said that the “0.5% to total area under NCZ is allowed for related compatible development which could be either at one place or at multiple locations, subject to other approvals, Acts of different States...”. This, said environmentalists, could have serious implications as the State governments could use the entire quota of 0.5% in one or few concentrated locations, thus, effectively breaching the limit of 0.5% per plot, that was there earlier. The Regional Plan-2021 allowed regional recreational activities with no construction exceeding 0.5% of the area with the permission of the competent authority. Several important provisions with regards to the forest cover and conservation of monuments, man-made heritage sites and riverbeds have also been dropped making them prone to construction. The RP-2021 said in view of very low existing forest cover (4.02%) in the NCR, more areas be brought under forest to maintain ecological balance, all wastelands be identified and brought under forest cover and added that the total forest cover be 10% of the total area of the region. But this has now been dropped in the new draft plan. Similarly, the mandate to keep waterbodies free from any encroachment/development to allow free flow of water and prevent construction and habitation activities in the flood-prone areas/river beds/banks has been dropped. Lt. Col. (retd.) Sarvadaman Oberoi, an environmentalist, said the Regional Plan-2021 with its restrictions on construction plays a key role in keeping real estate out of the Aravalis of the NCR. He expressed hope that the dilutions proposed in the draft Regional Plan-2041 would be rolled back.

01 September 2021||mumbai,||People have the right to celebrate their festivals: Raj Thackeray||Launching a frontal attack on the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government for not easing restrictions to allow people to celebrate Dahi Handi and other upcoming festivals, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Tuesday alleged that the three ruling parties were “using” the COVID-19 situation to their benefit. Speaking to reporters, the MNS chief also accused the government of “selectively” relaxing COVID-19 rules for some people. “The actions of the Maharashtra government can be summed up in the words of veteran journalist P. Sainath who wrote a book Everybody Loves a Good Drought . The current actions of the State government are like ‘everybody loves a good lockdown’,” the MNS president said after several party workers defied the ban to celebrate the Dahi Handi festival earlier in the day. “BJP ministers can organise Jan Ashirwad Yatras. Sena MLA Bhaskar Jadhav’s son can perform pooja in a temple in Ratnagiri. These incidents mean the State government is conveniently relaxing COVID-19 norms. There are different sets of rules for different people,” he alleged. MNS workers celebrated Dahi Handi festival in Thane and the neighbouring Palghar district, even though celebrations have been banned due to the pandemic. The Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress are partners in the MVA government led by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, the estranged cousin of Raj Thackeray. “Had the Shiv Sena been in opposition, I don’t think it would have acted like this. The three parties are using the COVID-19 situation for their benefit. People have the right to celebrate their festivals,” he said. Mr. Thackeray also alleged that the State government is creating (the bogey of) the first, second and now the third wave of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/people-have-the-right-to-celebrate-their-festivals-raj-thackeray/article36216750.ece

01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||NCRPB defers decision on Regional Plan-2041||The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) on Tuesday deferred its decision on the draft NCR Regional Plan-2041, which proposes high-rise development and five to eight new greenfield townships, sources said. The draft had been sent to the NCR constituent States — Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan — in January and comments from all of them had been received, an official said. However, during Tuesday’s meeting chaired by Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal sought more time for submissions, the official said. The States were then given one month for additional comments, with a special meeting to consider the plan likely to be held in October, the official said. The draft plan, which would take over from the existing Regional Plan-2021, proposes that NCR cities and towns should be “planned with optimum high-rise and high density norms”; the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) norms should be similar to international standards; mixed land-use of residential, commercial and institutional should be allowed “both vertically and horizontally” in the older areas of the NCR; and private land-owners should have the authority to cut or replace trees planted on their land. The draft plan says the elements under the Natural Conservation Zones in the RP-2021 will remain, but there would be a distinction between “forests and green cover” and areas currently categorised as ‘forests’ will continue to be conserved in RP-2041. The meeting was attended by Rajasthan Urban Development and Housing Minister Shanti Kumar Dhariwal, Delhi Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain and U.P. Minister Sidharth Nath Singh, apart from Mr. Puri, Mr. Manohar Lal and HUA Ministry officials. In a statement, the HUA Ministry said the Combined Reciprocal Common Transport Agreement for Stage Carriage and Contract Carriage between Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and U.P. was launched during the meeting. This would enable single-point taxation for all taxis, auto-rickshaws and buses, it said. Web geo-portal A web geo-portal for the NCR covering land use, transport, water, power etc was also launched. “The Draft Regional Plan-2041 was discussed wherein Chairman had a view that DRP-2041 needs to be put in public domain for feedback and comments at the earliest so that the Plan is finalised soon. The chairman asked States to submit their comments which will be taken up in next meeting of NCRPB. The chairman also directed to convene Board Meeting to discuss Draft Regional Plan-2041 exclusively soon,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ncrpb-defers-decision-on-regional-plan-2041/article36216742.ece
01 September 2021||New Delhi,||‘NCR should move towards smart mobility’||The National Capital Region (NCR) should move towards being a “smart connected region” where goods can move smoothly with Delhi, at the centre, being accessible within 30 minutes through superfast trains, the draft Regional Plan-2041 for the National Capital Region States. In addition to zero fatality road corridors, differential parking rates based on time of day and duration, heavy penalties for parking violations and, given the future requirements in this regard, air policing, aerial e-commerce and surveys, parking areas for aerial vehicles like drones at administration offices under governments are also among the recommendations of the draft report. Minimise journey time It is necessary, the report stated, to minimise journey time across NCR and make travel times across the NCR’s limits below 30 minutes by superfast trains and heli-taxies, within 60 minutes by other trains and two to three hours by car. Delhi should, it stated, have 30-minute connectivity through superfast trains with major cities in the NCR. UAVs or drones, helipads and UAV launch and parking areas should be established at all district headquarters by 2026 to meet requirements of future air policing, e-commerce, aerial surveys, it said. In addition to advocating a need to review taxes imposed on commercial passenger vehicles in NCR States by transport, municipal authorities and local bodies in order to encourage a modal shift from private to public mobility, the plan advocated a sub-urban passenger transport being developed as an integrated system with other transit networks to create a seamlessly connected network of networks. Mobility Options App An integrated Mobility Options App should be created for the entire NCR so as to provide all available options across various modes for a given origin and destination. All routes of metros, buses etc. should be digitised and software should support a wide variety of services, the report stated. Delhi, according to the draft report, needed “more streamlined” road management. While all high-rise buildings could explore the creation of helipads, all multispecialty hospitals, trauma centres and multilevel parking facilities across the NCR, the report stated, should be equipped with on-site helipads for 24 hours air ambulance medical emergency services and from the point of view of disaster management. All railway lines, the report stated, should have four tracks by 2030 and six tracks by 2040, 100% electrified, broad gauge and of high speed with the latest safety systems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ncr-should-move-towards-smart-mobility/article36216747.ece
01 September 2021||New Delhi,||Call for green corridors, floating water drones||A draft Regional Plan-2041 for the National Capital Region has made several recommendations towards protecting the environment, including improved monitoring, increasing flow of water in the Yamuna, green corridors along roads and floating water drones to clean rivers among others. The recommendations are on ambient air quality, noise pollution, surface water quality, waste management and forest and biodiversity. Biogas plants The draft report said that for better utilisation of crop residue generated in the NCR, biogas plants for managing crop residue should be adopted. “It is estimated that largescale industrial biogas plants can generate about 5,000 cubic metre of biogas per day and a small family-type biogas plant can generate 1 to 10 cubic metre biogas per day,” the report said. It also said that green corridors or tree barriers should be developed wherever possible along roads to act as a buffer and enable reducing air and noise pollution impacts, especially in residential and institutional areas. “It also directed to ensure that environmental monitoring is being carried out regularly and adequate number of well-equipped laboratory for air, water, noise quality analysis are set up across urban and rural areas,” the report said. The report said that States should take initiatives to change harvesting technology and encourage farmers to use environment-friendly harvesting techniques. Yamuna pollution About reducing pollution in the Yamuna, the report said, “For maintaining requisite environmental flow in the river downstream of barrage at Hathnikund in Haryana and at Okhla in Delhi, States should follow recommendations of 2014 report of Principal Committee under the chairmanship of Secretary Water Resources, GoI, which was also considered by the NGT in 2015, so that there is enough fresh water flowing in the river till Agra for restoration of the river’s ecological functions and can help in preservation and rejuvenation of the Yamuna floodplains in NCT-Delhi, along with adjoining tracts in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. These recommendations may also be followed for Hindon and other rivers, as applicable.” “Use of floating water drones/robot technology should be promoted for cleaning and collecting garbage from rivers and waterbodies. Autonomous drones technology like waste-sharks/ aqua drones which work similar to vacuum cleaners should be adopted for cleaning of rivers/ channels and waterbodies and to help in reducing water pollution,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/call-for-green-corridors-floating-water-drones/article36216744.ece

01 September 2021||Kabul,||After U.S. exit, Taliban celebrate victory||The hardline Islamist Taliban celebrated their total return to power on Tuesday with gunfire and diplomacy, after the last U.S. troops flew out of Afghanistan to end two decades of war. The U.S.’ longest military conflict drew to a close on Monday night when its forces abandoned Kabul airport, where it had overseen a frenzied airlift that saw more than 1,23,000 people flee. Taliban fighters then swept into the airport and fired weapons into the sky across the city in jubilation — an astonishing return after U.S. forces invaded in 2001, weeks after the September 11 attacks, and toppled them for supporting al-Qaeda. “Congratulations to Afghanistan... this victory belongs to us all,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters hours later on the runway of the airport. Mujahid said the Taliban’s victory was a “lesson for other invaders”. Many Afghans are terrified of a repeat of the Taliban’s initial rule from 1996-2001, which was infamous for their treatment of girls and women, as well as a brutal justice system. The Taliban have repeatedly promised a more tolerant brand of rule compared with their first stint in power, and Mujahid continued that theme. “We want to have good relations with the U.S. and the world. We welcome good diplomatic relations with them all,” he said. Mujahid also insisted Taliban security forces would “be gentle and nice”. Aid crisis The Taliban face a daunting challenge of transforming from an insurgent group to a government, in war-ravaged nation dependent on foreign aid. The United Nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe, with food stocks running low because of disruptions caused by conflict as well as a severe drought. Some Afghans appealed to the Islamist movement to keep their promise of a softer rule. Fawzia Koofi, a rights activist who has twice survived assassination attempts, called on the Taliban via Twitter to include all Afghans as they turn to governing the country. “Taliban, hear us out: we must rebuild together!” she wrote. “This land belongs to all of us.” Other activists struggled to find hope amid the gloom. “If I let my thoughts linger on what we have lost, I will lose my mind,” Muska Dastageer, who lectured at the American University of Afghanistan, wrote on Twitter. The withdrawal came just before the August 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden to end the war — one that claimed the lives of more than tens of thousands of Afghans and over 2,400 American service members. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a small number of U.S. citizens remained in the country — “under 200” but likely closer to just 100, and Britain said the number of U.K. nationals inside was in the “low hundreds.” Many thousands of Afghans who had worked with the U.S.-backed government over the years and fear retribution also want to get out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/after-us-exit-taliban-celebrate-victory/article36216343.ece
01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||China opens first road-rail transport link to Indian Ocean||The first shipments on a newly-launched railway line from the Myanmar border to the key commercial hub of Chengdu in western China, that provides China a new road-rail transportation channel to the Indian Ocean, were delivered last week, state media reported on Tuesday. A “test cargo” through what is being called the China-Myanmar New Passage arrived at the Chengdu rail port in Sichuan province on August 27, the official China News Service reported. The transport corridor involves a sea-road-rail link. Goods from Singapore reached Yangon Port, arriving by ship through the Andaman Sea of the northeastern Indian Ocean, and were then transported by road to Lincang on the Chinese side of the Myanmar-China border in Yunnan province. The new railway line that runs from the border town of Lincang to Chengdu, a key trade hub in western China, completes the corridor. “This passage connects the logistics lines of Singapore, Myanmar and China, and is currently the most convenient land and sea channel linking the Indian Ocean with southwest China,” the China News Service said, adding that "the one-way journey saves 20 to 22 days”. China also has plans to develop another port in Kyaukphyu in the Rakhine state, including a proposed railway line from Yunnan directly to the port, but the progress there has been stalled by unrest in Myanmar. Chinese planners have also looked at the Gwadar port in Pakistan as another key outlet to the Indian Ocean that will bypass the Malacca Straits. Gwadar is being developed as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to the far western Xinjiang region, but has been slow to take off amid concerns over security. The costs and logistics through CPEC are also less favourable than the Myanmar route with the opening of the rail transport channel from the Myanmar border right to western China’s biggest commercial hub, Chengdu. Transportation time on the railway line from the Myanmar border to Chengdu takes three days.  The Irrawaddy website that focuses on Myanmar news said the route is “the first to link western China with the Indian Ocean”. The railway line currently ends in Lincang on the Chinese side opposite the Myanmar border trade town of Chin Shwe Haw. Plans are underway to develop Chin Shwe Haw as a “border economic cooperation zone” under the Belt and Road Initiative.  The Irrawaddy said the route goes through Mandalay, Lashio and Hsenwi on the Myanmar side and “is expected to become the lifeblood of international trade for China and Myanmar, while providing a source of income for Myanmar’s military regime”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-opens-first-road-rail-transport-link-to-indian-ocean/article36216340.ece
01 September 2021||Kandahar,||In Pashtun heartland, crowd hails creation of ‘Islamic Emirate’||Thousands of Taliban supporters on Tuesday poured on to the streets of Kandahar, the spiritual birthplace of the Islamist movement, waving flags and shouting “God is greatest”, celebrating the momentous U.S. exit from Afghanistan. A chorus of car horns filled the main square of Afghanistan’s second-biggest city as a joyous crowd hailed the withdrawal of the last American troops after a 20-year war. Volleys of “Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar” (God is greatest) rang out across Shaheedan Square, which was awash with men and boys in traditional clothing, many waving the black-and-white Taliban standard. Kandahar is in Pashtun heartland of the Taliban, where the group was founded and from where it rose to power in 1996. In a video clip from Shaheedan Square, posted on social media, a man named Abdullah said: “Today is the independence day of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. We congratulate all the Muslim brothers and the entire Afghan nation. “We have raised the flag of Prophet Muhammed and we will raise this flag over the entire world.” “We have defeated the superpower! Afghanistan is the graveyard of superpowers!” a few supporters shouted from pick-up trucks. One fighter said: “The Islamic Emirate has now been established in Afghanistan, and there will be no chaos at all after that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/joy-in-taliban-heartland-the-graveyard-of-superpowers/article36216338.ece

01 September 2021||Abu Dhabi,||UAE, Turkey leaders discuss bilateral ties||Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held talks Monday, UAE State media reported, as relations improve between their two countries. The phone call between the two leaders marks the highest-level interaction in years, after a rare visit earlier this month to Ankara by a United Arab Emirates delegation. The two sides have backed opposing sides in the Libyan conflict and sparred on other regional issues. Sheikh Mohammed, UAE’s de facto ruler, and Mr. Erdogan “reviewed the prospects of reinforcing relations between the two nations in a way that serves their common interests and their two peoples”, the official WAM news agency said. “They exchanged views on a number of international and regional issues of interest.” Erdogan has made efforts to reach out to a range of regional rivals, including Egypt, as he tries to break out of a growing diplomatic isolation that has cooled foreign investors in Turkey’s fragile economy. Emirati officials have also made a series of visits to rival countries, including Qatar, after ties between the two Gulf nations were severed for more than three years. Anwar Gargash, a former UAE Minister of State for foreign affairs who now advises the country’s President, said in a tweet that the phone call between Sheikh Mohammed and Mr. Erdogan was “very positive and friendly”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uae-turkey-leaders-discuss-relations/article36216347.ece
01 September 2021||Kabul,||U.S. drone strike wiped out family, says brother||When Ezmarai Ahmadi returned home from work on Sunday evening in Kabul, the usual gaggle of squealing children were waiting to greet him — his sons and daughters, and a slew of nieces and nephews. His brother, Aimal Ahmadi, said Mr. Ezmarai pulled his car into the driveway of a modest house in Kwaja Burga, and handed the keys to his eldest son to park. Youngsters quickly piled into the vehicle. Then, according to Mr. Aimal, a missile came and hit the car, obliterating the lives of 10 people in an instant. The U.S. said on Sunday it had destroyed an explosive-laden vehicle in an air strike, thwarting a bid by the Islamic State to detonate a car bomb at Kabul airport. On Monday, Mr. Aimal said he had lost 10 members of his family in the strike, including his own daughter and five other children. “The rocket came and hit the car full of kids inside our house,” he said. “It killed all of them.” When an AFP journalist visited the scene on Monday, Mr. Aimal was impatiently waiting for other relatives to arrive to help him organise burials for most of his family.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-drone-strike-wiped-out-family-says-brother/article36216348.ece

01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The next step in democratic evolution is overdue||The human body, like a nation, is composed of structures and processes. A bony skeleton holds it together. Processes such as breathing, blood circulation and the formation of new cells give the body life. When vital processes become weak, the body becomes unhealthy even if the frame is strong. And when they cease, overpowered by infection, life ceases, and the bones remain to be buried. Elements of a democracy A democratic nation, or any nation, is also composed of structures — its constitution and laws. What distinguishes democratic nations from authoritarian ones is the liveliness of citizens’ participation in the governance of their nation. In healthy democracies, citizens participate effectively in the shaping of the policies and laws by which they are governed. Democratic constitutions provide elected assemblies for citizens’ representatives to shape new policies and pass laws. Open-minded deliberation in these forums is necessary to meet the requirements of democracy. It is also essential for finding good solutions for systemic problems which must be considered from many perspectives. When these forums become chambers for close-minded partisan politics, they cannot find solutions to the complex, systemic problems that all nations must address in the 21st century: climate change, historical inequities, increasing economic inequalities, and violence brewing with discontents within. The U.S. houses of Congress seem ham-strung by party politics; debates in the Indian Parliament have degenerated into floor battles with missiles; and, citizens of many European democracies are dismayed by the performance of their elected institutions. Constitutions, elections, and assemblies are not all that a democracy needs to function. Though this is what the simplistic U.S. vision of converting nations to democracies — on the heels of its armed interventions in many nations — seems to suggest. Democracies have life from what happens outside the elected chambers and what happens between elections. People who belong to different political factions, practise different religions, and have different histories within the history of their nation, must listen to each other, and learn to live democratically together every day of their lives. Therefore, what healthy democracies need most of all are processes of democratic deliberations among citizens themselves. Widening fissures Sadly, the cracks in the Indian nation dividing ‘people like us’ from ‘people not like us’, are widening in institutions at the top as well as in relationships on the ground. Majoritarian electoral systems of democracy will harden these divisions in India, as they are in the United States. Therefore, stronger processes are urgently required for democratic discourses amongst citizens themselves to bind the national fabric before it frays further. The media, which used to provide space for diverse perspectives to be heard, is divided along partisan lines. And social media, touted as a saviour of democracy by enabling citizens to freely listen to many points of view, has turned out to be a hardener of divisions. Smart algorithms have created echo chambers of people who like each other, and who do not listen to those in other chambers, and lob hate bombs at each other across the walls. Discussions of India’s chronic problems that cry for new solutions have descended into debates about whether the origins of the problems were in the times of the National Democratic Alliance or the times of the United Progressive Alliance. It seems that in any discussion about what ails the country, whether in Parliament, the media, or social gatherings, one must be seen to either support the political dispensation in power, or its opposition. There is little room for thoughtful, non-partisan deliberations among citizens. Taking a new step It is time for the next step in the evolution of democratic institutions. Kalypso Nicolaidis of the School of Transnational Governance, European University Institute, says, “Consent of the governed is about more than periodic elections or referenda. The process of deepening the reach of democracy remains the same as it has been for the last 200 years: a struggle to expand the franchise. This time around, it is a franchise that does not necessarily express itself through the right to vote in periodic elections, but rather through widespread inclusion in the political process in all its forms.” A civil society movement, Citizens for Europe, has proposed a solution: a European Citizens’ Assembly — a permanent transnational forum for citizens’ participation and deliberation. Words of caution though. Citizens for Europe explains the drawbacks of purely online methods, which civil society groups in Europe have tried, viz. , “the risk of accentuating ideological cleavages and excluding groups affected by the digital divide”. Online forums must be supplemented by real meetings. On the other hand, merely putting people together into a room does not create conditions for thoughtful deliberation. Elected assemblies everywhere are cleaved along partisan lines. James Madison, a framer of the U.S. Constitution, had anticipated this. He wrote in Federalist paper No.55, “Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.” It is not just the quality of the people in the room that matters. Citizens’ meetings, online or offline, must be properly designed and professionally facilitated to enable all points-of-view to be listened to for new insights to emerge. I return to the analogy of the human body. The human body is a complex system composed of many complex organs and processes — the heart, the brain, the liver, digestion, respiration, self-healing, etc. Breathing is a very simple process — it is the first one that a baby learns as soon as it emerges from its mother’s womb. Yet, we forget how to breathe well as we grow up. Yoga teaches us that learning to breathe well can tone up all the complex systems of the body and mind. The missing dialogues Human societies are also complex systems, composed of many formal institutions, and many processes of interactions among people. Listening like breathing is a basic process. We have forgotten how to listen well, especially to “People Not Like Us”. In schools we are taught how to speak well and win elocution contests and debates. There are no lessons in how to listen well, and no prizes for the best listeners. We listen only to “what” others say; we do not listen to understand “why” they believe what they do. Often, we stop listening even while another is speaking, mentally preparing our ripostes to win a debate. Dialogues to understand are not debates to win. They are explorations of complex issues by combining the knowledge of diverse people. Monocultures of thought can be as sterile as monocultures in Nature. Diversity in the composition of the participants is essential for ensuring that complex issues are fully understood and new insights can emerge. However, diversity of opinions can create cacophonies unless the deliberations are managed well. The time has come to learn to listen well, not just speak well; and to conduct dialogues, not debates. The assemblies Emperors Ashoka and Akbar conducted centuries ago in India provide some role models. Technologies of democratic deliberation have advanced since the times of the Athenians, Ashoka, and Akbar, as James Fishkin explains in When the People Speak: Deliberative Democracy and Public Consultation . The soft power of India, the world’s most richly diverse nation perhaps, will increase when it returns from the presently darkening elected authoritarianism to lead in the evolution of institutions for citizens’ participation in democratic governance.

01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s time to build BRICS better||The 13th BRICS summit is set to be held on September 9 in digital format under India’s chairmanship. This plurilateral grouping comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa is chaired by turn. India held the chair in 2012 and 2016 too. The preparatory meeting of Foreign Ministers in June and dialogue at the BRICS Academic Forum in early August offered an important opportunity to present an objective assessment of the grouping’s record amid differing views of believers and sceptics. The importance of BRICS is self-evident: it represents 42% of the world’s population, 30% of the land area, 24% of global GDP and 16% of international trade. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, noting that BRICS was 15 years old, recently portrayed it as a young adult, equipped with “thoughts shaped and a worldview concretised, and with a growing sense of responsibilities.” Others tend to view it as caught up in angst and confusion typical of a teenager. Still, member states have been carrying BRICS forward in an era of complex geopolitics. They have bravely continued holding dozens of meetings and summits, even as China’s aggression in eastern Ladakh last year brought India-China relations to their lowest point in several decades. There is also the reality of the strained relations of China and Russia with the West, and of serious internal challenges preoccupying both Brazil and South Africa. On the other hand, a potential bond emerged due to the battle against COVID-19. In this backdrop, does BRICS truly matter? Four priorities Launched by a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2006 and riding on the political synergy created by regular summits since 2009, BRIC turned itself into BRICS in 2010, with the entry of South Africa. The grouping has gone through a reasonably productive journey. It strove to serve as a bridge between the Global North and Global South. It developed a common perspective on a wide range of global and regional issues; established the New Development Bank; created a financial stability net in the form of Contingency Reserve Arrangement; and is on the verge of setting up a Vaccine Research and Development Virtual Center. What are its immediate goals now? As the current chair, India has outlined four priorities. The first is to pursue reform of multilateral institutions ranging from the United Nations, World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to the World Trade Organization and now even the World Health Organization. This is not a new goal. BRICS has had very little success so far, although strengthening multilateralism serves as a strong bond as well as a beacon. Reform needs global consensus which is hardly feasible in the current climate of strategic contestation between the U.S. and China and the devastation caused by COVID-19 to health, lives and livelihoods. Nevertheless, Indian officials rightly remind us that BRICS emerged from the desire to challenge dominance (by the U.S.) in the early years of the century, and it remains committed to the goal of counter-dominance (by China) now. Mr. Jaishankar observed that the “counter-dominance instinct and principled commitment to multipolarity in all forms” is “written into the DNA of BRICS.” The second is the resolve to combat terrorism. Terrorism is an international phenomenon affecting Europe, Africa, Asia and other parts of the world. Tragic developments concerning Afghanistan have helped to focus attention sharply on this overarching theme, stressing the need to bridge the gap between rhetoric and action. China, for example, feels little hesitation in supporting clear-cut denunciations of terrorist groups, even as its backing of Pakistan, which is heavily enmeshed with a host of international terrorist groups, remains steadfast. In this context, BRICS is attempting to pragmatically shape its counter-terrorism strategy by crafting the BRICS Counter Terrorism Action Plan containing specific measures to fight radicalisation, terrorist financing and misuse of the Internet by terrorist groups. This plan is expected to be a key deliverable at the forthcoming summit and may hopefully bring some change. Promoting technological and digital solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals and expanding people-to-people cooperation are the other two BRICS priorities. Digital tools have helped a world adversely hit by the pandemic, and India has been in the forefront of using new technological tools to improve governance. But enhancing people-to-people cooperation will have to wait for international travel to revive. Interactions through digital means are a poor substitute. Among other concerns, BRICS has been busy deepening trade and investment ties among its member states. The difficulty stems from China’s centrality and dominance of intra-BRICS trade flows. How to create a better internal balance remains a challenge, reinforced by the urgent need for diversification and strengthening of regional value chains, all exposed during the pandemic. Policymakers have been encouraging an increase in intra-BRICS cooperation in diverse areas like agriculture, disaster resilience, digital health, traditional medicine and customs cooperation. Takeaways The idea of BRICS – a common pursuit of shared interests by the five emerging economies from four continents – is fundamentally sound and relevant. The governments have invested huge political capital in pushing the BRICS experiment forward, and its institutionalisation has created its own momentum. The five-power combine has succeeded, albeit up to a point. But it now confronts multiple challenges: China’s economic rise has created a serious imbalance within BRICS; Beijing’s aggressive policy, especially against India, puts BRICS solidarity under exceptional strain; and BRICS countries have not done enough to assist the Global South to win their optimal support for their agenda. It is necessary for leaders, officials and academics of this grouping to undertake serious soul-searching and find a way out of the present predicament. A parting thought: BRICS negotiators need to master the art of brevity and tight drafting. When they do so, they will realise that unduly lengthy communiqués are an index to the grouping’s weakness, not strength.

01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Making out a case for propping up the middle class||Nobel laureate (2017) Richard H. Thaler segregates the population into “Econs” and “Humans”. Short for ‘Homo Economicus’, ‘Econs’ seldom defy economic assumptions of rationality and are flawless decision makers — akin to a preprogrammed machine. But they exist in economic literature only figuratively and are conspicuous by their absence in real life. In contrast, a vast majority of people fall under the category of ‘Humans’. They rarely behave rationally and are, thus, credulously susceptible to a wide variety of behavioural biases in their decisions. Planners and issues What is true for the vast populace is equally applicable to policy planners. Their education, professional training, varied experiences and grass-roots connect notwithstanding, they remain ‘Humans’ than ‘Econs’. Even when their decisions have far-reaching consequences, they are scarcely immune to the ‘present bias’ and entrust greater weight to the payoffs that are closer to the present time, thus favouring ‘instant ambitions’ over ‘enduring economic gains’. Similarly, they could be amenable to ‘overconfidence’, ‘optimism’ and ‘framing effects’ and get swayed by the way information is presented to them. Their thought processes may also be hinged on the ‘confirmation bias’ tempting them to search, interpret, and recall information which support or validate their predisposition. Even as they mean no malice, they might be manoeuvred by ‘group reinforcement’ and ‘inter-group opposition’. Cognitive distortion such as ‘availability heuristic’ may, concurrently impel them to believe that what comes to mind more easily is likely to be a far more accurate reflection of reality. What gives them further confidence is the ‘illusion of control’ leading to overestimating their ability to control events or to take mid-course correction if the designed policy fails to deliver the desired result. The ‘present bias’ Let us examine these phenomena in the context of handling the economic impact of COVID-19 and policies to revive the economy. The stimulus packages announced so far to mitigate the impact of the novel coronavirus and to revive the economy have included the poorest sections of the society, and the major thrust has been on the supply side. This reflects the penchant for procrastinating the immediate cost activities and preproperating the immediate reward activities. In the process, the middle class has simply been left to fend for itself. This is juxtaposed with the obvious policy option of directing attention to long-lasting benefits focusing on the larger picture rather than being reactive to instantaneous ambitions. This simply vindicates Richard Thaler’s view that ‘humans’ tend to be myopic and Ted O’Donoghue and Matthew Rabin’s proposition that decisions invariably suffer from the ‘present bias’. A segment with influence Many studies, notably, a decade-old Asian Development Bank study covering 72 countries on ‘The Role of the Middle-Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show?’ (ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245, January 2011;https://bit.ly/3t59Eom)established that the middle class fosters innovation. Their “values also encourage the accumulation of human capital (via education) and savings (that can then be used for productive investment in the economy)”. Ubiquitously, “policies that factor in the welfare of the middle-class and nurture their growth may be more effective in [the] long-term”. These findings confirm what Nobel Prize winners (2019) Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo have been arguing: that the middle class has a constructive influence on the economy and society. Closer home, it may be recalled that a 20-time increase in the middle class during the post-reform period had laid a strong foundation for high economic growth. Even as of now, the middle class constitutes close to a fourth of the population but accounts for a four-fifths of the taxpayers’ base. Censoriously, it accounts for three-fourths of the total consumer spending leading to the demand for consumer durables. The pandemic’s impact Going by a Pew Research Center report, that the middle class in the country shrunk by a third or over 32 million following the first wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic, their numbers may have further withered subsequent to the second wave, which was all the more devastating. During the past year or so, rural as well as urban unemployment rates have been high. At 8.13% on August 30, 2021, it is still quite high to impact the middle class adversely. Further, out of the total non-farm jobs losses since January 2021, the middle class comprising salaried employees and entrepreneurs has been as high as 13.7 million. Only in July, 3.2 million salaried people lost their jobs. Rising petrol and diesel prices, and edible oil and retail inflation hovering at 32.5% and 5.6%, respectively, have been further eroding their disposable income. Explicably, a hike in food prices reduces consumers’ income which could have been spent elsewhere to generate demand and thus boost the economy. The plight of the middle class can be understood by the fact that they are selling their family silver and gold jewellery to pay hospital bills, school fees and shop rent, particularly during the last four months, which may lead to further suppression of demand. In Thaler’s taxonomy, ‘Econs’ are only imaginary; the populace as a whole, irrespective of their position in the society, are only ‘humans’. So are the middle class. Herbert A Simon, yet another Nobel laureate (1978), in his theory of ‘bounded rationality’, argues that individuals with their limited attention span do not follow complete rationality. The temperament of their brain limits their ability to recognise pertinent stimuli and get vacillated by the excessive information presented by the media, publicity, or propaganda. Despite their deteriorating condition, the middle class have neither been reactive nor have found a collective voice. Concurrently, they have become quite risk averse, which is evident from the fact that bank deposits have increased by 11.4% in 2020-21, even though interest rates have declined as their inclination to spend has subsided. This further leads to a fall in the demand. The verity is also substantiated by Reserve Bank of India’s consumer confidence index. For July 2021, the index stood at 48.6 points which is just about record low. A shrinking middle class never augurs well for the economy anywhere in the world. They need to be propped up to bring dynamism in the economy, and thus rapidly revive growth by enthusing, among other things, consumer confidence and positive sentiments.

01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Making the Paralympics count||August 30 was a big day for India at the Paralympics. The country won five medals, including two gold, bettering the Rio 2016 contingent’s haul in just a day. Indians with disabilities, like all Indians, are proud of these achievements. This presents an opportune moment to reflect on how we can make the Paralympics truly count for India. The Paralympics is a unique opportunity to empower the disabled. It offers everyone the chance to watch disabled bodies in action and to find commonality with them in the shared desire for national success. Sustained media attention ensures that athletes with disabilities capture the public imagination in an unprecedented way. Discourse around the disabled In India, persons with disabilities find it extraordinarily difficult to live a life of equal productivity and dignity as their able-bodied counterparts. The discourse around their status as Divyang — persons with divine bodies — fuels their alienation. Instead of viewing the disabled as ordinary individuals who require additional support to meet their unique needs, this language places them on a different pedestal and presents them as being endowed with supernatural powers. Rather than engaging with them in meaningful, constructive ways, many people either make a person’s disability their focal point, stripping away their multi-layered identity, or ignore their additional challenges altogether. Stereotypes and unfounded biases about the disabled’s incompetence, inability to make informed choices and asexuality, among others, are still alive and kicking. It is no surprise, then, that engaging in recreational activities like sports is rarely on the minds of disabled people. Even those disabled persons who wish to undertake such activities face formidable obstacles. Mainstream schools, parks, colleges and swimming pools do not provide a conducive environment for them. Arguments about complications and causing inconvenience to others are commonly made to deny access. As a blind person myself, I remember being turned down by a swimming pool in Delhi when I approached them with a wish to pursue swimming classes. The reason? They had received complaints from female swimmers about unsolicited contact in the pool and felt that having a blind person in the pool could get them into trouble. One doesn’t have to be a Paralympian to enjoy the benefits of sports. Recreational sports can help build identity, confidence and a healthy relationship with one’s own body. This is what many disabled people miss out on. Disabled people with more ambitious sporting aspirations often enter into exploitative coaching relationships and navigate a complicated and unfriendly sports governance framework. This state of affairs is particularly troubling as Section 30 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, requires appropriate governments and sporting authorities to take measures to improve access to meaningful sporting opportunities for the disabled. These include redesigning infrastructural facilities and providing multisensory essentials and features in all sporting activities to make them more accessible. For India, the success in these Paralympics will be truly meaningful only if it prompts introspection and reorientation. At the systemic level, this has to cover governance reforms in the Paralympic Committee of India. The Committee is now headed by a medal-winning former Paralympian, Deepa Malik. The Union Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs brought parity to the cash rewards structure for medal-winning Paralympians placing them on equal footing with their able-bodied counterparts at the Olympics. These are steps in the right direction. An opportunity for everyone To deliver the value of sport more inclusively, satellite television providers and sports broadcasters must take steps that enable the disabled to watch and participate in sporting activities. Further, pictures of the Paralympics in electronic media and on social media must be accompanied by image descriptions for the visually challenged. At the individual level, everyone can view athletes with disabilities in a holistic sense while also acknowledging their additional challenges and striving to create more opportunities for the disabled people in our lives so they can participate in all walks of life. It is easy to admire the courage of our para-athletes from afar. It is much harder to use these Games as an opportunity to do our bit to change things, to ensure that we are regularly surrounded by such competent and driven disabled people who are given the additional support they need to thrive. With intent, resolve and action, we can make the Paralympics count for India not just on the medal table but in the everyday.

01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Managing natural resources||Just about 50 km from Meghalaya’s capital Shillong is Umdohbyrthih village. It was once known for its rocky terrains, streams, springs and verdant valleys. In recent years, however, its forest cover and natural resources have rapidly deteriorated. Accessibility to knowledge Many villages are facing a similar crisis. The State, known to have spots designated as the ‘wettest places’ on earth, is now facing a severe water crisis. Natural resource management becomes critical in this context. This is not a new concept, especially in Meghalaya where traditional practices on sustainable use of natural resources have been passed down from one generation to another. This indigenous knowledge began to slowly fade, however, owing to population growth, the quest for unsustainable developmental activities and indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources, among other factors. Another roadblock to natural resource management was of knowledge inaccessibility among rural communities. When free access to information on an issue is not made available to communities, they begin to rely on external agencies for solving their local problems. The government wanted to see if, when provided with correct knowledge, solutions to problems can be devised and even implemented by community members themselves, with proper facilitation support. Reactivating the community’s connection to natural resources and enabling them to tackle the resource crisis became a priority for the State. We got an opportunity to do this through the World Bank-supported Meghalaya Community-Led Landscape Management Project. We set up a cross-functional team with diverse expertise. The team worked with many facilitators and empowered them with digital infrastructure. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme became the main scheme channelising resources to impact poor households so that there was systematic convergence of all line departments such as agriculture, horticulture, soil and water conservation. The programme leverages technology and the youth population. Leveraging technology, more than 2,000 village community facilitators have already been trained and are working towards climate change reversal. These facilitators take informed action pertaining to their environment. The idea is to bring at least 14,000-18,000 community facilitators (three from each village) to the fore. This has been made possible with the help of digital applications like Participant Digital Attestation. This app allows community cadres to record their attendance by scanning QR codes. It provides them content, training sessions and digital certification. These tools help create a free flow of knowledge without hierarchy and empower communities to overcome knowledge barriers. To build autonomy, we use simple tools. They have been designed keeping in mind many things: creating community agency, building the capacities of all persons in the programme, and ensuring frequent interactions among them. Technology empowers us with real-time data, which in turn results in better programme governance, transparency and accountability. Communities are now able to articulate the complexities of their problems through a scientific lens and create their own natural resource management plans. A one-stop centre To carry forward this momentum, we are launching a Centre of Excellence in Meghalaya, a one-stop centre for natural resources management. Its mandate is to build leadership capabilities to enable close cooperation among departments, democratise access to knowledge, and continue with research and development on every aspect of natural resource management. Through our work, we intend to empower thousands of village community facilitators.

01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Pyrrhic victory||Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan was the first world leader who wholeheartedly welcomed the Taliban’s capture of Kabul on August 15 — before its fall, Pakistan had maintained that it had little leverage on the Taliban to force them to accept a ceasefire and that it backed a political solution in Afghanistan. However, on August 16, he said Afghans have “broken the shackles of slavery”, leaving little doubt on where Pakistan stands on the Taliban’s return. This is hardly surprising. Pakistan not only played a central role in the Taliban’s rise to power in the 1990s but was also one of the three countries to have had formal diplomatic ties with them. Pakistan continued to support the Taliban even after they were driven out of power by the U.S. in 2001. Its strategic calculus was that a stable Afghanistan backed by the U.S. and India would harm its core interests. It hosted the Taliban leadership in Quetta, Balochistan, and allowed their militants to regroup and resume insurgency in Afghanistan. In that sense, the Taliban’s capture of Kabul can be seen as the success of a long-term strategy Pakistan’s military establishment had adopted. But it is too early to begin celebrations. The geopolitical implications of the Taliban’s victory are still unclear. But, irrespective of what kind of a government they will establish, the resurgence of a Sunni radical jihadist group could embolden similar outfits elsewhere. Pakistan has a problem with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the ideological twin of the Taliban, that has carried out deadly attacks inside Pakistan. Also, the August 26 Kabul blasts are a warning of what is awaiting Afghanistan. The country is still chaotic and lawless where groups such as the Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K), the IS affiliate that has claimed responsibility for the blasts, would seek to flourish. Without order, the country could fall into a multi-directional, civil war between the Taliban, the IS-K, and the remnants of the old regime. The question is whether Pakistan, overwhelmed by the Taliban’s success, sees the possible dangers the triumph of hardline Islamism now poses. Religious extremism and militancy can help one country tactically but will be counterproductive in the long term. When the U.S. backed the Mujahideen in the 1980s, it might never have imagined that the Taliban would rise from the Mujahideen and host the al Qaeda that would carry out the deadliest attack on America since the Second World War. Similarly, a chaotic Afghanistan ruled by extremist Islamists is as much a geopolitical victory as a security and strategic challenge to Pakistan. During the insurgency, Pakistan refused to use its leverage over the Taliban for peace. It should do so at least now because a stable Afghanistan which treats its people with dignity and does not provide safe havens to transnational terrorist organisations is in the best interests of all regional powers, including Pakistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/pyrrhic-victory/article36216323.ece
01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||For the record||In a megapolis teeming with skyscrapers, Novak Djokovic wants to be the tallest of them all. History beckons the Serbian tennis legend at the US Open currently progressing in New York. At present, Djokovic has drawn level with the other members of tennis royalty from the men’s side: Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. The ‘Big Three’ have won 20 Grand Slams each and Djokovic has a chance to move ahead and perhaps stay there unchallenged. His acclaimed and relatively older rivals have skipped their annual tryst with the Flushing Meadows, formally called the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Federer is recuperating from a knee surgery while Nadal is coping with a foot injury and it leaves the field marginally clear for the 34-year-old Djokovic, who is also chasing a calendar year Grand Slam after having won the Australian and French Opens besides the iconic Wimbledon. If Djokovic could lord over a year, he would become the first man to do that since the great Rod Laver’s clean sweep back in 1969. Among women, Steffi Graff was the last to achieve this feat in 1988. However, a record-busting quest is never easy. Djokovic is acutely conscious of that after having blown a chance to pocket a Golden Slam as he crashed out of the recent Tokyo Olympics, failing to even win a bronze. Federer and Nadal’s contrasting styles, much akin to lyrical poetry and magnetic prose, may have colonised fans’ hearts but Djokovic has shown that unerring consistency has an enduring charm. The Serb has often roared back into contention, covering the court, closing out the angles and digging into vast reserves of physical and mental strength. Off the turf, he may not be the ideal hero, expressing reservations against COVID-19 vaccines, but on court, despite the odd petulant bouts reserved for his racquet, Djokovic has reigned. There is also the need to make amends at the US Open as last year he accidentally struck a line judge while taking a swipe at the ball and was suspended. Austrian Dominic Thiem won the championship then but he is missing now due to a wrist injury. Among the other young turks, Alexander Zverev, who defeated Djokovic at the Tokyo Olympic semifinals, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas get another opportunity to show their mettle. Meanwhile the women’s section will miss an injured Serena Williams and in a fluid set-up, Australian Ashleigh Barty holds the edge. Defending champion Naomi Osaka is on a comeback trail after she stepped aside citing mental issues during the French Open. Osaka has struggled on her return and lost in the third round of the Tokyo Olympics. She will draw attention just like a history-chasing Djokovic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/for-the-record/article36216324.ece
01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Mrs. Gandhi calls for halt to bandhs||The Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi to-day deprecated bandhs and stressed the need for eradicating violence and maintaining communal harmony at a series of meetings with leaders of youth organisations, political parties and the INTUC here [Calcutta, Aug. 31]. She told a six-member deputation of the State INTUC led by its President Mr. Kali Mukherji that the bandhs tended to paralyse national economy and cripple the State administration. At this juncture it had also the effect of hampering relief to the millions of Bangla Desh refugees and flood-stricken people. She gave the assurance that the Union Labour Minister, Mr. R.K. Khadilkar was looking into the grievances of labour and they would be remedied early. Mrs. Gandhi arrived here from Cooch-Behar by an I.A.F. plane after visiting two refugee camps there and making an aerial survey of the flood-stricken areas of North Bengal.

01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Core sector logs 9.4% growth||Output from India’s eight core sectors grew by 9.4% in July from a year earlier, a marginal uptick from June’s 9.3% pace. Crude oil was the sole sector to register a decline, with output shrinking 3.2%, official data showed. Cement production expanded the fastest in July, surging 21.8%, while fertilizer output clocked the slowest pace of growth at 0.5%. Production of natural gas grew by 18.9%, that of coal rose 18.7%, while steel and electricity saw output expand by 9.3% and 9%, respectively. CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis attributed the 9.4% growth in the core sector, which accounts for a little over 40% of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) to a combination of two factors — the base effect from last July, when output contracted 7.6%, and some affirmative action by the government on infrastructure spending. “Sequentially, the core sector output recorded a broad-based 5.4% rise in July 2021, reflecting the further unlocking, especially across the southern States,” observed Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA. “Compared to July 2019, the overall core index rose by 1.1%, led by a double-digit increase in coal output, whereas refinery products and crude oil trailed their pre-COVID performance,” she wrote in a note on the data release. However, the overall Index of Eight Core industries in the first four months of 2021-22 remained below the pre-pandemic level, 1.5% lower than the April-July 2019 period. While Mr. Sabnavis expects the IIP to register 12%-14% growth in July, Ms. Nayar reckons the expansion would be in a 13%-15% range. The Office of Economic Adviser in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade also revised the provisional indices for recent months. “Final growth rate of Index of Eight Core Industries for April 2021 is revised to 62.6% from its provisional level 56.1%,” the DPIIT economic adviser’s office said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/core-sector-logs-94-growth/article36216310.ece
01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Maruti sees chip shortage cutting Sept. output by 60%||Maruti Suzuki on Tuesday said it expects production in September to slump to about 40% of the normal level as a result of a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted the supply of electronic components. “Owing to a supply constraint of electronic components due to the semiconductor shortage situation, the company is expecting an adverse impact on vehicle production in the month of September in both Haryana and its contract manufacturing company, Suzuki Motor Gujarat Pvt. Ltd. (SMG) in Gujarat,” India’s largest carmaker said in a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges. “Though the situation is quite dynamic, it is currently estimated that the total vehicle production volume across both locations could be around 40% of normal production,” it added. In August too, the company had announced that SMG’s production would be partially impacted during the month due to issues related to the semiconductor shortage. Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a worldwide shortage of semiconductors that have become an integral part of the contemporary automobile. Electronic components are used widely in cars, from engine management systems to improve fuel efficiency to assisted emergency braking. As per Maruti’s data, the company produced a total of 1,70,719 vehicles in July, including 1,05,345 passenger vehicles and 2,342 light commercial vehicles. Total sales during the month, including exports, was 1,62,462 units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/maruti-sees-chip-shortage-cutting-sept-output-by-60/article36216313.ece

01 September 2021||Chennai,||An exemplary speed merchant bids adieu||Many summers ago, a domestic match was in progress at Bengaluru’s M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. Javagal Srinath, one of India’s greatest ever fast bowlers, dropped in and he was then donning a freshly minted ICC match referee avatar. He sauntered towards the assembled press corps and gushed about a fellow purveyor of speed. The name was Dale Steyn but those were early days for the South African spearhead. Yet Srinath was convinced: “Steyn has an excellent action, smooth, and superb control. He is the one to watch out for.” This wasn’t just the ‘Fast Bowlers Club’ on overdrive, this was a genuine observation. Since that day in 2006, Steyn, despite those odd injury-enforced-breaks, showed that he was one of the finest exponents of scorching pace allied with intelligence. High on grace But time flies, limbs tire and the greatest have to step aside. At 38, with an enviable record to boot — 439 Test wickets, 196 ODI scalps and 64 victims in Twenty20Is, Steyn bid goodbye to his glorious career on Tuesday. “Today I officially retire from the game I love the most. Bitter sweet but grateful,” he mentioned in a note high on grace. The last mentioned being his innate trait even if on the field he was a much-feared opponent. Steyn could scythe through batting line-ups, hustling the batsmen, rushing them into mistakes while stumps cart-wheeled, slips exulted and pads got ruffled. There was Allan Donald in the past and Steyn was perhaps his natural successor with a smooth run-up yielding to a fine load-up and precision release. His duels with leading batsmen was one for the cricketing gods. There was one against Sachin Tendulkar during the 2011 Cape Town Test. This was a high-octane battle between Steyn’s fire and Tendulkar’s ice. Steyn did all that he could, probing, looking for flaws and the maestro countered everything adroitly. Tendulkar scored a ton but that passage of play between him and the South African ace was riveting. Years later, the Steyn-AB de Villiers battles in the Indian Premier League held an allure. Steyn emerged second best but de Villiers wouldn’t say a negative word about his South African compatriot. Such was the respect Steyn had within the Proteas dressing room. He quit Tests two years ago to extend his limited-overs career but with COVID-19 affecting schedules, a fitting swansong never happened. Steyn will be missed even if batsmen heave a sigh of relief.  Go well, great man. You were fire, one of the best the game has seen Virender Sehwag   Great player, great man, amazing memories! U picker a good song to sign off my bud. Legend forever! A.B. de Villiers   Legend! No greater fast bowler in all conditions! See you in the bush for a beer soon, boet!

01 September 2021||TOKYO,||High jumper Mariyappan shines with a silver||T. Mariyappan and Sharad Kumar won a silver and bronze respectively in the men’s high jump T63 event and shooter Singhraj Adana fetched a bronze in the men’s 10m air pistol SH1 event as India’s tally at the Paralympics touched an unprecedented 10 medals here on Tuesday. India has so far won two gold, five silver and three bronze medals in the ongoing Games. Mariyappan cleared 1.86m while American gold winner Sam Grewe, who finished behind the Indian in the T42 category at Rio, succeeded in soaring above 1.88m in his third attempt. Sharad took bronze with an effort of 1.83. Varun finishes seventh The third Indian in fray, and 2016 Rio Paralympics bronze-winner, Varun Singh Bhati ended seventh out of nine competitors after he failed to clear the 1.77m mark. The T63/F63 classification is for athletes with single through knee or above knee limb deficiency competing with a prosthesis where minimum impairment criteria for lower limb deficiency are met. The T42 classification is for athletes with a leg deficiency, leg length difference, impaired muscle power or impaired passive range of movement in the legs. The athletes compete in a standing position. Earlier, Singhraj Adana shot a total of 216.8 to finish the P1 men’s 10m air pistol SH1 event in third place after qualifying for the eight-man final as the sixth best shooter. However, Manish Narwal, who topped the qualifications with 575, finished in the seventh place in the final. The other Indian in the event, Deepender Singh, finished 10th. Hovering around the top three, Adana dropped out of contention with his poor 19th shot but managed to get back in the reckoning with his 20th attempt as China’s Xiaolong Lou got 8.6. China dominated the finals with defending champion Chao Yang (237.9 — Paralympic record) and Huang Xing (237.5) winning gold and silver respectively. In the women’s category, Rubina Francis finished seventh in the final. As the pistol is held with one hand only, athletes in SH1 category have an impairment affecting one arm and/or the legs, for example resulting from amputations or spinal cord injuries. P1 is a classification for the men’s 10 air pistol competition. Shooters either compete in a seated or standing position as defined in the rules. Rakesh misses out The Indian challenge in compound men’s Open archery ended after Rakesh Kumar lost to former World champion Xinliang Ai of China 143-145 in the quarterfinals. Rakesh had bounced back to best Marian Marecak of Slovakia 111-108 in the previous round. The Indian women’s table tennis team of Bhavina Patel and Sonal Patel was outclassed 2-0 by China in the Class 4-5 quarterfinals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/high-jumper-mariyappan-shines-with-a-silver/article36216415.ece
01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Handing over the baton to the future through the present||It is possible that we are approaching a transitional phase in Indian cricket, with some stars preparing to make way for a new generation. Not immediately, and perhaps not for a while after the England tour, but it is best to be prepared. The feeder lines are clear and unclogged, as they have been for some time, and that has been one of India’s strengths. The average age of the team that played the Headingley Test is just 30, so any discussion over succession might appear premature. But given the amount of cricket they play, both international and domestic, today’s players tend to give up Test cricket earlier than those of a previous generation did. Longevity Rahul Dravid was 39 when he announced his retirement, Sachin Tendulkar 40, Anil Kumble 38. Can the modern player last as long despite a better physical regimen? There is too the temptation of lucrative media offers besides business and family commitments. Few players voluntarily make a clean break. Following the tour of Australia, Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman retired in 2012, next year Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar did so, and the men who constituted one of the finest batting line-ups in the history of the game were gone. Crucially, as they were finishing, they welcomed into the squad the new kids on the block: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Ishant Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara. That is how the baton is passed on. Some of these replacements were planned for, others came as pleasant surprises. It has always been thus, and will continue to be. There are no guarantees in sport; even Don Bradman was dropped after his first Test. This generational overlapping is important. You can trace a direct line from Kapil Dev to Javagal Srinath to Zaheer Khan to Ishant Sharma. Kapil was around when Srinath made his debut, Zaheer bowled alongside Srinath and Ishant had Zaheer to look up to when he made his debut. Such patterns might look inevitable, but they are a tribute to the right selection at the right time, and an awareness of baton-passing. Virat Kohli is only 32 and has already played more Tests than Dravid had at that age besides T20 by the bucketful. He is the fulcrum around which the Indian team will revolve for some time. In the next five or six years, he will play midwife as a new generation steps out. Much like Dhoni did, and Sourav Ganguly before him, backing some players on instinct and record while other choices fall into the basket marked ‘what-might-have-been.’ Roll of the dice Selection to the highest level is based on potential and performance; players make it on one of these grounds. When Kumble or Tendulkar were first picked, there was no way of knowing they would be the greats they became. Kumble was 19, Tendulkar 16, and selectors staked their reputation on these two. For every inspired choice, there are many who seem equally worthy but fail at the highest level for one of these reasons: temperament, fatal technical flaw, wrong timing. Sometimes a strong mind can overcome a flaw, sometimes a player chosen at the wrong time can be lost forever. Some never discover what the right time could be as their First Class careers overlap with the international careers of more established and successful players. Once the middle-order during the Tendulkar period was in place, there was no vacancy there. Each batter played over 100 Tests, and many like Amol Mujumdar (who made 260 on his First Class debut) who might have played in another era simply didn’t get a look-in. In the years when India had world-class spinners who would have easily walked into any other international team, many were held back. Rajinder Goel and Padmakar Shivalkar are the best examples; they were kept out by the presence of Bishan Bedi. But there was V.V. Kumar too, a classical leg-spinner up against Bhagwat Chandrasekhar. Later Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, who between them had over 1,000 Test wickets, ended the aspirations of many. On knife-edge Careers also depend on how the team performs. Victory lends a hand to those on the brink of dropping out, pulling them towards safety. In the current team, Pujara redeemed himself with a knock of 91 in the last Test; the focus is now on Ajinkya Rahane. Ishant Sharma may be rested for the third Test. Among the reserves is Wriddhman Saha, who at 36 is the oldest. Players have two more Tests to make things work for them — both as a team and individually. The series is balanced on a knife-edge, as are some careers too. Contradictory as it sounds, looking ahead is a continuing process in sport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/handing-over-the-baton-to-the-future-through-the-present/article36216315.ece
01 September 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Commendable feat by Kerala varsities||Raseena Iqbal takes some time to measure her opponent, who seems to be in a hurry. C.K. Krishna’s tactic of all-out attack doesn’t quite work, though, on this rainy Thursday afternoon at the St. Thomas College Indoor Stadium in Thrissur. Raseena’s superior technique wins her the gold in the 60kg category. The bout — between the boxers representing Thrissur’s Vimala College and Kozhikode’s Government College of Physical Education — has turned out to be one of the highlights of the Calicut University women’s boxing championship. It is late into the night when the competitions are finally over. The following day, the men’s championship would get underway. When it finished on Saturday, with Christ College (Irinjalakuda) emerging as the overall champion, it marked the end of the sporting calendar of Calicut University. The overall title in the women’s event has not been decided, with Vimala (Raseena’s college) lodging a protest after being declared as the runner-up to the host, St. Thomas. No mean effort All the 75 events, in disciplines ranging from athletics to volleyball, have been completed. Not a mean effort in these trying times of the pandemic. And Calicut is not the only university in Kerala that has conducted a large number of championships this academic year. MG and Kerala too have done rather well; for them, only the swimming competitions remain. “We were determined to conduct all the events and are delighted that we could do it,” says V.P. Sakeer Hussain, director, Department of Physical Education, Calicut University. “That became possible because the physical education teachers, of all the nearly 400 colleges affiliated to the university, supported our decision.” Grace marks The university’s decision ensured that the students would get their grace marks, which would come in handy while applying for higher education or jobs. “We didn’t want the students to suffer and that is why we decided to conduct all the events, though there would be no all-India championship for the academic year,” says Jayarajan David, who heads Kerala University’s Physical Education department. The universities conducted the events following the COVID-19 guidelines. “Only those who reported negative after COVID-19 tests were allowed to compete,” says Binu George Varghese, director of Physical Education, MG University. Kannur University has a few more events to complete, but its Physical Education director K.P. Manoj is hopeful of doing it by the end of the month. “We have conducted 40 events so far and only 18 remain,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/commendable-feat-by-kerala-varsities/article36216889.ece

01 September 2021||New York,||Zverev and Pliskova begin quest for a maiden Grand Slam with facile wins||German Alexander Zverev got his bid for a maiden Major off to a smooth start by beating American Sam Querrey 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in the first round of the U.S. Open on Tuesday. Querrey kept the match close through the first two sets but was stymied by unforced errors as the 2020 runner-up and Olympic champion Zverev kept his game comparatively clean and fired off 25 winners. Similarly in the women’s section, World No. 4 Karolina Pliskova fired off eight aces to defeat American wild card Caty McNally 6-3, 6-4 in the first round as she bids for an elusive Major. Meanwhile on Monday, former World No. 1 Andy Murray went down fighting in the first round of the US Open as third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas triumphed in a near five-hour contest. As fans returned in numbers to Flushing Meadows for the first time in two years, they were treated to quality tennis at Arthur Ashe Stadium where Tsitsipas won 2-6, 7-6(7), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, even as Murray fumed over what he saw as the Greek’s stalling tactics. “I lost respect for him,” Murray said after Tsitsipas took a bathroom break and a medical time-out that broke the Scot’s momentum. Medvedev advances Second seed Daniil Medvedev beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-4, 6-3 6-1 in the final match of the day and the Russian was relieved it did not go the distance after watching many players struggle physically. “I’m happy that I didn’t stay out here for five hours,” Medvedev said. Fans stayed well beyond midnight hoping to be entertained by Nick Kyrgios but the only fireworks the Australian provided were arguments with the chair umpire over towels while slumping to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 loss to Roberto Bautista Agut. Two-time champion Naomi Osaka kicked off her title defence with a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Czech Marie Bouzkova and she was happy to have the crowd back. Sabalenka survives Second seed Aryna Sabalenka was given a scare when Nina Stojanovic took the match to a third set but the Belarusian dominated the decider to advance 6-4, 6-7(4), 6-0. American Coco Gauff surrendered the opening set but rallied to beat Magda Linette 5-7 6-3 6-4, while three-time runner-up Victoria Azarenka trailed 4-1 before winning 11 straight games to outclass Tereza Martincova 6-4, 6-0. Marin Cilic, the 2014 champion, retired injured from his first-round match with Philipp Kohlschreiber with the contest locked at two sets each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tsitsipas-breaks-murrays-rhythm/article36216417.ece
01 September 2021||HYDERABAD,||Golconda Masters Telangana Open to tee off tomorrow||The seventh edition of Golconda Masters Telangana Open golf championship, organised by Hyderabad Golf Association and the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), will be held at the picturesque Golconda golf course from September 2 to 5, according to tournament director Sampath Chari. Mr. Chari informed media on Tuesday that the event, sponsored by Vooty Golf County and Haldi Golf County in partnership with Telangana Tourism, would see 129 golfers, including six amateurs, in action. “The course is in excellent shape offering differing kinds of challenges to the golfers with the ball not running much. The fact that the golfers can collect world-ranking points from this meet itself should be a huge motivation,” said Mr. Chari. Defending champion Udayan Mane, fresh from his recent Tokyo Olympics experience, would be one of the strongest contenders along with PGTI Order of Merit leader Karandeep Kochhar, Rashid Khan, Khalin Joshi, Viraj Madappa and Aman Raj. Former champions The field also includes former champions Harendra Gupta and Chikkarangappa besides the Bangladeshi duo of Md. Zamal Hossain Mollah and Badal Hossain. The local challenge will come from Haider Hussain, Mohd Azhar, Venkkat Gautham, Rupinder Singh Gill and Sanjay Kumar Singh.  Mane said he couldn’t have asked for a better course and setting to start the season which also includes about 10 premier events in the next three months. Top three Kochhar rated the course as one of the top three in the country and that it was great to see so kids playing the sport on the greens here. C. Dayakar Reddy, HGA president, and Mr. K.S.

01 September 2021||DHAKA (Bangladesh),||Bangladesh begins as the favourite against a weakened New Zealand||Captain Mahmudullah warned his Bangladesh side that it can't be complacent against a weakened New Zealand going into their five-match Twenty20 series starting on Wednesday. New Zealand has picked none of its Twenty20 World Cup squad for its first tour of Bangladesh since 2013. Tom Latham is the stand-in captain and Glenn Pocknall the stand-in coach. Even so, Mahmudullah said on Tuesday the New Zealanders can't be underestimated. “New Zealand is without their first-choice players but they are a well organised and an extremely disciplined side,” Mahmudullah said. "They are a team which does a lot of homework about condition and opponents. From what I have seen, they always try to execute their plan well.” Bangladesh is heavily favoured to finally beat New Zealand for the first time in the format. The home side won't veer far from its strategy against the Australians on the same spinning paradise pitches at Shere Bangla National Stadium. Shakib Al Hasan and Nasum Ahmed should extract suffocating spin, and the middle order batting will be bolstered by the return from injury of Mushfiqur Rahim. New Zealand has only three players with more than 10 T20s — Latham, Colin de Grandhomme and Scott Kuggeleijn — and three more who could make their international debut. They all have a chance to impress as injury replacements for the coming T20 World Cup. Rough ride Latham admitted he's expecting a rough ride, but they remained hopeful. "We know things won’t be easy over here, looking at the Australia series,” Latham said. "This is a slightly younger group. There's a bit of experience here, so will try to lean on those guys as much as possible. Most of the guys have played T20s for New Zealand but probably not as much as they would like to. We have to enjoy ourselves out there, and stick to a brand of cricket that we believe can be successful in these conditions. Our goal is to win the series.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bangladesh-begins-as-the-favourite-against-a-weakened-new-zealand/article36216714.ece
01 September 2021||Mysuru,||‘I love being cut off from the world’||Commander Abhilash Tomy, 42, a retired Indian naval officer was the first Indian to circumnavigate non-stop the World solo without any stops in 2013. He shared his experience with The Hindu during the National sailing championships recently. Excerpts:  What inspired you to take up the around the world solo expedition? I was fascinated by the “Around Alone” race in which a French lady was the champion. I was very impressed and wanted to emulate her and sail alone when I grew up. I joined the Navy sailing team and was sent to Mumbai for six months training in 2008. I was chosen as the service back-up for Dilip Doade’s solo circumnavigation and gained valuable experience in 2009-10. Later the Navy offered me a chance to circumnavigate the world solo without stops in 2013. Tell us about your circumnavigation experience I undertook the expedition from Mumbai (called Sagar Parikrama 2) on November 1, 2012 and returned to the city on March 31, 2013, completing a voyage of 23,100 nautical miles without any stops. The then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, gave a ceremonial reception at the Gateway of India on April 6, 2013. I was the first Indian, second Asian and 79th person to accomplish this feat. Your experience competing in the 2018 Golden Globe race I raced solo in a 10m/32 feet boat with no modern equipment for support. It was a very challenging race. It started and ended in France. I improved my position after 10/15 days and after 82 days was in third position. The last 15 days were the most difficult, as I experienced bad weather, storms and had a bad accident near Australia and my boat was damaged. I had a fall and broke my spine. I was rescued in a multinational rescue effort. I was operated upon and rejoined duty after six months after passing the military medicals for flying / sailing. In January this year, I took early retirement to prepare for the 2022 race. Why this race again? I love sailing. I like to be cut off from the world and it has given me more individuality. Spiritually I am involved with nature and the sea and it leads to a great feeling within me.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-love-being-cut-off-from-the-world/article36216592.ece
01 September 2021||MUMBAI,||BCCI seeks bids for new franchises||More than eight months after approving the addition of two new franchises into the Indian Premier League (IPL) fold, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Tuesday released an Invitation to Tender (ITT) for prospective owners to enter the auction. While announcing its decision on behalf of the IPL Governing Council, BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement: “The detailed terms and conditions governing the submission and evaluation of bids including eligibility requirements, process for submissions of bids, proposed new teams’ rights, and obligations, etc. are contained in the ITT.” The ITT can be purchased till October 5, on payment of Rs. 10 lakh, excluding taxes. It will be followed by an online closed-bidding process.  The Hindu understands that the base price for each of the two new teams is set at Rs. 1,500 crore and any entity — either a corporate or a consortium — is required to have valuation worth Rs. 3,000 crore to be eligible for bidding. In 2010, when the BCCI had expanded IPL into a 10-team affair ahead of the 2011 edition, the owners of Kochi and Pune franchises had agreed to shell out Rs. 1,530 crore and Rs. 1700 crore, approximately. Unlike in 2010, when more than a dozen venues were made available for the interested bidders, the BCCI is likely to restrict the venues list to Ahmedabad, Kochi, Guwahati, Lucknow, Pune and Dehradun. Maximum of two bids An interested bidder is likely to be presented with an option to submit a maximum of two bids — either for the same or different cities, unlike in the past when there was no cap on submitting bids. On December 24 last year, the BCCI AGM had passed the proposal to add two new teams and had asked the IPL Governing Council to work out the nitty-gritty. With Tuesday’s development, it appears that IPL 2022 will be played in a format similar to 2011, with a total of 74 games. Each team is set to face five teams on home-and-away basis while competing against the remaining four teams once during the league stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bcci-seeks-bids-for-new-franchises/article36216420.ece
01 September 2021||London,||England prepared to take on world-class Ashwin, says Root||Skipper Joe Root, who led England to a series-levelling win at the Headingley, expects an Indian backlash in the penultimate Test and said it was ready for all combinations, including facing the “world-class” R. Ashwin at the Oval. India had grabbed a 1-0 lead in the five-match series after beating England by 151 runs at Lord’s but England came back to level the series with an innings win in the third Test. “A world-class team like India, led by Virat (Kohli) I expect nothing less than a response and we’d be naive to think otherwise,” Root said during a virtual press-conference. “That’s why I think it’s really important that we don’t get too comfortable, we don’t think that we’ve achieved anything at this point, we’ve just got ourselves back to level playing.” Trusting Ravindra Jadeja’s batting ability more than Ashwin, India skipper Kohli had ignored the ace off-spinner for the first three Tests, but heading into the Oval Test from Thursday, the call for his inclusion has once again gained voice.  “His record speaks for itself, he’s a world-class player. We’ve seen him score runs and take wickets against us, we know what he’s capable of in the Test arena,” Root said when asked if he’s surprised that Ashwin did not play the first three Tests. “We will be making sure that we’re prepared for the challenges that he poses coming into this Test, along with other combinations that they might throw at us,” Root said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-prepared-to-take-on-world-class-ashwin-says-root/article36216423.ece
01 September 2021||CHENNAI,||Wet weather affected my chances: Mariyappan||India’s T. Mariyappan and Sharad Kumar, the silver and bronze medallists in men’s high jump, said that the slow to heavy drizzle made their task quite difficult to perform. “At the start, there was a mild drizzle, so we were able to jump without much difficulty. “But after 1.80m, there was mild to heavy rain and my socks got wet which made my take-off and jump difficult,” said Mariyappan in virtual press conference. “I could have jumped 1.90m had there been no rain.” Dangerous “It was a dangerous situation to perform under rainy conditions,” remarked Sharad. On winning silver, defending champion Mariyappan said he felt happy and sad at the same time. “I was upset because I wanted gold but happy that I could win gold (at Rio) and silver now,” he said.  The 26-year-old further said not being a flag-bearer (he had come in contact with a COVID-19 victim on arrival at Tokyo) was also upsetting, but added that he was determined to do well. “I was in quarantine and had to train in isolation.” Fate  “I was confident of Mariyappan winning gold as he was clearing 2m during training. Fate had other plans,” said Mariyappan’s coach Satyanarayana. Sharad said he had a knee injury on the eve of the final. “I cried the whole night as I had damaged my meniscus but my parents, my brother, and friends kept me motivated,” he said, adding getting a bronze under the circumstances was great. Sharad thanked the Paralympics Council of India (PCI) and Satyanarayana for the help in getting all the documentation done when he was training in Ukraine prior to the event. Gurcharan Singh, Indian chef-de-mission, also spoke at the conference organised by PCI and Eurosport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wet-weather-affected-my-chances-mariyappan/article36216421.ece

01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sheikh holds on to lead||Mohammed Sheikh was unable to capture the magic of the first round, yet stayed in the lead with a cumulative score of 32 points after two rounds of the Champions league in the Indian online carrom challenge organised by the All India Carrom Federation (AICF). After a spectacular performance in the opening round when he had three points thanks to an universal slam and a white slam, Mohammed Sheikh compiled a score of 29 points in clearing the eight boards in the second round, and had a white slam to show. Abdul Rahman (33) followed one point behind the leader, while Riyaz Akbar Ali (47), Mohd. Ghufran (48), Mohd. Arif (50), K.

01 September 2021||KOLKATA,||Sangeeta qualifies||Vinesh Phogat met with disappointment, while her cousin Sangeeta Phogat sprung a surprise in the selection trials for the World wrestling championships, to be held in Oslo (Norway) from October 2 to 10, in Delhi on Tuesday. Vinesh won her first bout against Anju in the 55kg weight class. However, the ace wrestler withdrew after feeling unwell.

Yash got past seasoned Amit Dhankar, while Baliyan beat World championships medallist Narsingh Yadav. Since there was only one wrestler in 63kg and 82kg of Greco Roman, 92kg of freestyle and 76kg of women’s styles, the selection committee decided to hold the trials in these weight categories next week, said a WFI release.  Selected wrestlers: Men: Freestyle: 57kg-Shubham, 61kg-Ravinder, 65kg-Rohit, 70kg-Sushil, 74kg-Yash Tushir, 79kg-Gourav Baliyan, 86kg-Sandeep Mann, 97kg-Satyawart Kadian, 125kg-Anirudh Kumar.

01 September 2021||MUMBAI,||Jaffer, Nayak & Avasthi star in Mumbai’s big win||Armaan Jaffer’s hundred, his 122-run partnership with Sujit Nayak and Mohit Avasthi’s lethal spell helped Mumbai take an unassailable lead in the three-match series against Oman with a 231-run drubbing in the second one-day match in Muscat on Tuesday. Thanks to Jaffer’s 122 (114b, 11x4, 3x6) and big-hitter Nayak’s unbeaten 73 (70b, 6x4), Mumbai scored 300 for eight in its allotted 50 overs. Avasthi’s (4/31) ferocious opening spell set the tone as Oman folded up for a paltry 69 in the 23rd over to hand Mumbai its first one-sided win of the preparatory tour. All four of Avasthi’s wickets were picked in his first four overs, turning the game into a no-contest. With fellow pacer Deepak Shetty (2/9) and left-arm spinner Dhrumil Matkar (3/21) also chipping in, only two Oman batsmen — Shoaib Khan (10) and Mohammad Nadeem (35) — reached double figures.  The scores: Mumbai 300/8 in 50 overs (Armaan Jaffer 122, Sujit Nayak 73 n.o., Chinmay Sutar 37, Mohammad Nadeem 4/67) bt Oman 69 in 22.5 overs (Mohammad Nadeem 35, Mohit Avasthi 4/31, Dhrumil Matkar 3/21) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jaffer-nayak-avasthi-star-in-mumbais-big-win/article36216972.ece
01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Personal equation with God||For most of us, generally, God is the omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent Supreme Force that the scriptures refer to as Brahman. But it is also accepted that it is impossible to describe the nature of Brahman fully. Yet, from the lives of Sivan Adiyars chronicled in the Periyapuranam, it is possible for the common man to understand that God can be realised as personal experience through the path of bhakti they exemplify, pointed out Sri Sa Saravanan in a discourse. The uniqueness of bhakti is that they are able to forge a kind of one-to-one equation with God. To them He is very much in their midst and, if only one is sensitive, one can experience His boundless grace, kindness and benevolence towards all beings in creation. For instance, Kannappan Nayanar approaches God with a kind of wild devotion in keeping with his life experience as a hunter. Karaikal Ammaiyar could make the Lord listen to her wishes. Her request is that she should be a witness to His cosmic dance. When Thirunavukkarasar is tortured, he appeals to God to save His name by coming to his rescue. Through Sundarar's hymns one can see God in a new light and understand Him better, for herein God is shown to come down to the human level. We can be sure of His promise to rid us of all our chronic faults. All of us are born again and again in this world to experience the fruits of our acts good and bad. God is shown as one who pardons the faults. But Sundarar also shows that just because we know God pardons our faults and puts up with our weaknesses, which are an endless list, there is no justification on our part to continue with wrong acts knowingly. He rightly says then that we are overlooking the disrepute that such an act will bring to Him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/personal-equation-with-god/article36216375.ece

01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Breaking an addiction||At a vipassana course I took years ago, I learnt the difference between making an assumption and gaining true knowledge. When we read something in a book, we assume it’s true; but we can only become knowledgeable through experience. So, even though I write on wellness and was aware of the term biodiversity, I only understood its real impact after visiting author, activist and environmentalist Vandana Shiva’s biodiversity conservation farm, Navdanya, on the outskirts of Dehradun in Uttarakhand. Spread across 52 acres, this land was earlier a sugarcane and eucalyptus plantation. Today, these commercial crops have been replaced with a heaving abundance of trees, shrubs, creepers, grasses, and herbs. There are approximately 72 species of birds, 5,000 varieties of crops (paddy, wheat, pulses, oil seeds, vegetables, millets) and 78 types of herbs within the farm, not to mention worms, beetles, butterflies, lizards, spiders, and toads, all playing their roles in this diverse landscape. In just an acre-long patch, there are 650 indigenous varieties of paddy. Even around the residential huts (made with cobwebs, cow dung, straw and clay), mango trees, heavy with fruit, are clustered with other plants so that every inch of land is covered with green. Lessons in biodiversity In today’s controlled, sanitised and concretised environment, this wilderness is not just comforting but will also be relevant in the post-pandemic world. While there are many such farms across the country, Navdanya is special because it also has an Earth University, which is an endeavour to educate both farmers and novices like me. As scientists including Shiva have observed, new infectious diseases such as Covid-19, Zika or Ebola have emerged after businesses invaded forests to grow global commodities. An institution such this helps us understand why we need to go back to our roots. Just walking around the farm is educational. I learnt that camphor, neem, turmeric and papaya help in natural pest control. Planting radish helps put nitrogen (essential for plant growth) back into the soil, whereas over-planting the potato depletes the land of this mineral. Paddy is surrounded by a border ofragi(which is taller) to help prevent cross-pollination. And the seeds of the paddy (the farm has about 750 indigenous paddy seeds in the seed bank) are preserved from the very centre of the field, where there is least cross-pollination. Shiva says that 70%-80% of pollinators (such as bees) have disappeared in areas where pesticides are used. “Food is central as we all eat and because industrial food is the biggest damager to our health, our planet, the current system of GMOs and agrochemicals is really putting our farmers on edge. Over 4,00,000 farmers have committed suicide since 1995,” she says. Breaking old habits “Most of the habits we have today are habits of addiction — we didn’t grow into them, they were forced upon us.” She gives the example of edible oils: “In 1998, we were forced to import genetically-modified soya even though we were the world’s biggest producer of oil seeds then, with the richest diversity and maximum production.” Today, she says, we import 70% of our edible oil needs because of active lobbies. I also learnt that the word ‘consumption’ was initially used for people who had been consumed by tuberculosis. The addiction of buying new things is certainly consuming the modern world, but now that shopping is quite literally at our fingertips, will we be happy with less stuff? I notice the silver rings on Shiva’s fingers, which are all gifted, mostly by indigenous communities. She’s never felt the need to change or upgrade them. The new luxury Strangely enough, I felt very content at the farm — open for stays for all — even though my phone was tucked away most of the time and my simple room was devoid of the ‘luxuries’ such as a geyser (hot water available from a common tap in the patio). We were cleaning up after meals, filling our bottles when we needed them, and we were eating together in the canteen. Surrounded by nature, with the engaging company of people, eating nutritious food (millets, indigenous rice, freshly-harvested vegetables, local beans and lentils) breathing clean air, listening to the sounds of birds and insects, I didn’t need new things, an internet connection or room service. Could it be that we try to replace nature and community with shopping and smartphones? Perhaps we need to change our definition of luxury. On my drive back home, I looked at the sugarcane fields with new eyes. What was once idyllic now seems barren and industrial without the diverse profusion of plants. I think of what Shiva said moments before we left: “Everyone talks about frontline workers but farmers are care workers because they provide healthcare when they do good farming.” And good farming isn’t about single species or the culture of agrochemicals. It is about multiple varieties of plants, animals and microbes working together to create a healthy ecosystem. If you can’t relate to what I’m saying then maybe you need the experience.

01 September 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Haryana Cong. leaders seek probe into Karnal incident||Haryana Congress leaders on Tuesday met Governor Bandaru Dattatreya here, seeking a judicial inquiry into the lathicharge on a group of farmers in Karnal on August 28. The farmers were protesting against the visit of Chief Minister Manohar Lal and other BJP leaders. Congress MLAs, led by Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, submitted a memorandum to the Governor, stating that the lathicharge against the farmers in Karnal was a “planned” act. They demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident by a sitting judge of the High Court or a retired judge. Plea to Governor “We also requested the Governor not to give his assent to the new Land Acquisition Bill passed in the monsoon session and, instead, send it back to the Assembly for reconsideration under Article 200 of the Constitution. This Bill is anti-farmer and undemocratic. The Bill was passed hurriedly without a detailed discussion in the House,” said Mr. Hooda. Separately, a delegation of Congress leaders led by Haryana in-charge Vivek Bansal met the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in New Delhi on the lathicharge incident. Mr. Bansal was accompanied by Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Kumari Selja; Congress Working Committee’s special invitee member and MP Deepender Singh Hooda; MLA and former leader of the Haryana Congress Legislature Party Kiran Choudhry. Mr. Bansal said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was using the slogan “ atmanirbhar [self-reliant]” on one hand, but the government was resorting to “lathi-charges” on the farmers who had actually made the country self-reliant. “Farmers have been agitating on the streets for the last nine months, but the government is not listening to them. At the behest of the BJP government, atrocities are being committed continuously on them. In Karnal, farmers were brutally lathi-charged and many were hurt,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-cong-leaders-seek-probe-into-karnal-incident/article36216724.ece
01 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hate sloganeering case: Hindu Raksha Dal chief surrenders||Hindu Raksha Dal chief Bhupinder Tomar alias Pinki Chaudhary — who was accused of raising anti-Muslim inflammatory slogans at a rally in Jantar Mantar on August 8 — surrendered before the police on Saturday afternoon. Raising slogans, Mr. Chaudhary reached Mandir Marg police station along with his supporters on Saturday. A senior officer said Mr. Chaudhary was present outside the police station and was arrested at 2.30 p.m. On Monday, Mr. Chaudhary had released a video wherein he had mentioned that he would surrender on Tuesday. “I am still firm on my point. Neither I nor any worker of my organisation did anything wrong at Jantar Mantar. I respect the court. I will surrender myself tomorrow [August 31] at 12 p.m. at Connaught Place police station and will cooperate with the police during the probe. I never run from arrest. It is the right of every person to go to court and I did the same. All the allegations against me are false and baseless. My life has been devoted to Hinduism and Hindutva. As long as I breathe, I will continue to do the work of religion,” he had said in the video. Earlier, eight persons were arrested in connection with the case. The arrested persons include Uttam Upadhyay — who can be seen raising the slogans in a video that went viral — Supreme Court lawyer and former Delhi BJP Spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay, Save India Foundation’s Preet Singh alias Sundar Pal, Hindu Force’s Deepak Singh, Hindu Raksha Dal’s Deepak Kumar, Sudarshan Vahini’s Vinod Sharma, Vinit Bajpai, and Sushil Tiwari. The police had registered a case after a video showing anti-Muslim slogans being raised during the protest was widely circulated on social media. Earlier, Mr. Chaudhary had sought anticipatory bail but the Delhi High Court on Friday refused to grant him interim protection from arrest, after which raids were being conducted to arrest him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hate-sloganeering-case-hindu-raksha-dal-chief-surrenders/article36216733.ece
01 September 2021||New Delhi,||HC to hear plea against Asthana appointment today||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday posted the hearing on a petition challenging the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner and an intervention application filed in the matter by an NGO for Wednesday. On August 25, the Supreme Court had asked the HC to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment of the senior IPS officer as Commissioner. The Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), which filed the impleadment application, argued that the petition before the HC, filed by Sadre Alam, was a “copy-paste” of its plea before the Supreme Court. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for CPIL, said: “We have filed an intervention on behalf of CPIL. The petition is a copy-paste. The court may list it tomorrow or whenever. See the kind of abuse of process of law that is done.” The NGO stated that it got to know about the filing of Mr. Alam’s petition before the High Court from media reports and “was surprised to see some of the paragraphs of the instant writ petition as quoted by media, as the same appeared to be copy-pasted from the applicant’s writ petition filed before the Supreme Court prior in time.” The NGO claimed that the precise purpose of filing the petition by Mr Alam “seems to be only to defeat public interest by scuttling the genuine, bona fide and well -researched and deliberated PIL filed by the applicant (NGO) before the Supreme Court.” The petition filed by Mr. Alam has contended that the 1984-batch IPS officer, serving as the Director General of Border Security Force, was appointed Delhi Police Commissioner on July 27, just four days before his superannuation on July 31. He argued that the decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Appointments Committee of Cabinet in appointing Mr. Asthana for the post was “completely illegal on multiple grounds”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-to-hear-plea-against-asthana-appointment-today/article36216728.ece

01 September 2021||New Delhi,||Centre defends decision to regulate digital news media||The Centre on Tuesday defended before the Delhi High Court its decision to regulate news and current affairs content on digital media under the new Information Technology (IT) Rules saying that there have been past incidents of disinformation on digital media leading to disturbance of public order. The Centre’s affidavit came in response to a bunch of petitions filed by several online news portals such as The Wire , The News Minute , Quint Digital Media Ltd. , Foundation for Independent Journalism, and the Press Trust Of India over its attempt to regulate digital news media. “The consequences of fake and misleading audio-visual news on digital media has in the recent past led to deaths of innocent people on false pretexts such as in the case of rumours of child lifters, loss of lives of innocent migrant workers during the pandemic induced lockdown, risk of social strife and communal tensions in the society due to sensationalist reportage of religious congregations in the context of the pandemic, etc.," the affidavit said. The affidavit, jointly filed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, said the risk of false or misleading information is greater over the Internet as the same can be spread rapidly within society. It stated that “individuals or groups can use digital media with very low barriers of entry or regulation to disseminate false, sensationalist or misleading news online, which can then be rapidly transmitted among the people”. Code of ethics The ministries also stressed that “news portals/websites even of organisations having newspapers or TV news channels will be covered under the IT Rules, 2021”. The petitioners had challenged the IT Rules 2021 claiming that it seeks to regulate online news portals by imposing sweeping government oversight and a vaguely worded ‘Code of Ethics’. The pleas argued that the IT Rules will “usher in an era of surveillance and fear, thereby resulting in self-censorship, which results in abridgment/ violation of Fundamental Rights as enshrined under Part III of the Constitution of India”. The Centre, however, defended the IT Rules saying it “only empower the audience to bring to the notice of the publishers such content which may be violative of the Code of Ethics”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/centre-defends-decision-to-regulate-digital-news-media/article36216727.ece

Among the citizens’ groups, the members of Aravalli Bachao, Citizens for Clean Air and NCR Waste Matters Citizens Action and Awareness Group were present and spoke at the public hearing. The members of the Aravalli Bachao group demanded that the public hearing be declared null and void as it was in violation of the rules since the copy of the Environmental Impact Assessment report was not made public 30 days before the hearing as required by the law. Aravallis Bacho Citizens’ Group, in an eight-point objection to the project argued that site for the proposed plant was a wildlife-rich zone and was in the eco-sensitive Aravali belt which sustains life in the National Capital Region. It said that the site was close to Mangar Bani, the NCR’s last remaining patch of original Aravali native forest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/citizens-groups-object-to-waste-to-energy-plant/article36216729.ece

On account of excess usages of chemical fertilizers, humans are exposed to the harmful chemicals through the ecosystem, which eventually affects their health, in this backdrop for scientific use of fertilizers, IIT Ropar and MIT has collaborated under the project “Accurate Optical Sensing for Efficient Fertilizer Use and Increased Yield in Small Farms.” Dr. Rajeev Ram of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and Dr. Rajesh Kumar, an assistant professor of Biomedical Engineering at IIT-Ropar, are working on portable optical sensors. “The research will explore the potential for spectroscopic ‘fingerprinting’ of the nitrogen uptake to better guide management of fertilizer use in field crops that are economically important,” said Dr. Rajesh Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/iit-mit-to-develop-portable-sensors/article36216722.ece

01 September 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi Police has failed to protect women: AAP||Citing the alleged rape and murder of a 21-year-old woman in Sangam Vihar, AAP on Tuesday said the Delhi Police failed completely in protecting women. It asked the Central government to transfer the Delhi Police to the Delhi government if they cannot run it properly. “The kind of security that has been deployed in Delhi makes it evident that the Central government is incapable of running the Delhi Police. Every other day unfortunately we get to hear about an incident of rape or murder in Delhi. Such incidents have heightened the sense of fear in the mind of every woman living in the Capital,” AAP MLA Rakhi Birla said. She said the recent Sangam Vihar rape case portrays the “unbothered attitude” of the BJP and the Central government towards the women in Delhi. ‘Least interested’ She alleged that the Delhi Police is “least interested” in providing a secured space to women. “I want to ask Amit Shah that if the Delhi Police is under his control, law and order of the Capital is under his control, then why are these incidents happening every other day?...,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/police-have-failed-to-keep-women-safe/article36216730.ece

01 September 2021||September 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Is fashion’s future orange?||An earthy colour palette (think mint, peach, sage green and indigo) and breezy silhouettes aren’t the only highlights of designer Anita Dongre’s Spring-Summer 21 lineup. ‘Sounds of the Forest’, which dropped recently, is literally derived from the forest — using wood-based cellulosic fibres courtesy a collaboration with Tencel. Since its launch in the 1990s, the Austrian textile speciality brand (under The Lenzing Group) has come a long way. This year, it partnered with Red Carpet Green Dress, an organisation that pushes designers to focus on sustainable textile innovations and custom-made gowns for the Oscars. It found its way into pret with designers like Australia’s Kit Willow and Rajesh Pratap Singh closer home. And courtesy its light-weight nature, it also featured in swimwear collections by design houses such as Mara Hoffman and The Summer House in India. Now, after experiments with indigo and viscose, The Lenzing Group has partnered with Italy’s Orange Fiber to create the first-ever Tencel-branded lyocell fibre made from orange peels. The company, which has collaborated with Salvatore Ferragamo and H&M in the past, taps into the 7,00,000 tonnes of ‘pastazzo’ (by-product of the country’s citrus processing industry) produced every year. International news reports claim that the orange fibre can be dyed, coloured and printed on, to create any look. In addition, thanks to nanotechnology, the material supposedly contains essential oils and vitamin C, is lightweight and absorbs moisture. Having said that, we’re yet to learn if the vitamins are passed on to the wearer. Avinash Mane, Commercial Head, Lenzing AG, takes us through India’s growing sustainable fashion market, why research is serious business at the brand, and how orange is the next best thing in fashion.  Why did you decide to experiment with citrus fibres?   We’re always working on innovative ways to recycle sustainable raw materials to craft fabrics. Examples include Refibra [made from upcycling cotton scraps] and Ecovero [viscose natural fibers]. We came across Orange Fibre in early 2021 and were keen to put citrus waste to use. It can be used in combination with wood pulp [sourced from Europe, South Africa, Germany]. At present, the new material is under trial and we’re working towards making yarn out of it. We aim to have a collaborative collection out by the end of this year featuring limited-edition western wear.  What challenges did you face?   Orange pulp has different characteristics when compared to wood’s cellulose content. Creating the right combination to ensure it can be dyed perfectly was an area we had to work on technically. Since we are in the sampling and development stage, there are some additional manufacturing costs. When we enter commercial production, the cost will be on par with our other speciality fabrics, such as the Tencel modal indigo.  Recent brand tie-ups.   The sustainability factor is high in both the domestic and international markets. In Europe and the UK, brands such as H&M, Marks & Spencer, Superdry, and Primark are gradually moving out of viscose and experimenting with natural fabrics. Outfits such as Patagonia, LuluLemon, and Levis in the US have also switched from viscose to Ecovero. Uniqlo, the Japanese casual wear retailer, is looking to make the shift. And in India, the likes of Levis, Spykar, and Mufti are now adopting Tencel Denim. Soon, home decor and furniture majors such as Bed Bath & Beyond and Macy’s will announce collections crafted in eco fabrics.  Is the Indian consumer willing to shell out more for sustainable fashion?   About five years ago, there was a huge resistance to cost escalation, but buyers are willing to pay today. Approximately 60% of India’s population is below 40 years, are tech savvy with high disposable incomes, and are more aware of what goes into the creation of their apparel.  What’s next?    A newTencel Lyocell plant will be established in Thailand by the end of this year. Collabs with Indian designers and high-end labels are also in the works, as are experiments with new materials such as hemp waste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/is-fashions-future-orange/article36216881.ece
