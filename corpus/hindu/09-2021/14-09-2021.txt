14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC to pass interim orders in Pegasus case||The Supreme Court on Monday decided to pass interim orders after the government refused to respond, through a “detailed” affidavit, to allegations that it used Israeli-based Pegasus software to spy on citizens. The government said such an affidavit in the top court would be too public and compromise national security. The petitioners demanded that either the Cabinet Secretary file an affidavit or the court itself form a committee, led by a sitting judge, to probe the snooping controversy. A Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said there cannot be any “beating around the bush” on the issue. The CJI said the court had given the government a fair opportunity to file a detailed affidavit in order to get a clear idea of its stand in the Pegasus case. “We thought the government would file a counter-affidavit… Now we will pass our interim orders,” he remarked. However, after reserving orders, the court told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the government, that he could mention the case if there were any second thoughts in the next few days before the pronouncement of the order. Unbelievable, says Sibal Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for senior journalists N. Ram and Sashi Kumar, said the government’s refusal to file a detailed affidavit was “unbelievable”. Mr. Mehta reasoned that a public discourse on whether a particular software was used or not would alert terrorists. He urged the court to allow the government to form a committee of “domain experts” who would look into the allegations of snooping orchestrated against citizens, including journalists, activists, Ministers, and parliamentarians, among others. He assured the court that the committee members would have “no relationship” with the government, and would place their report before the Supreme Court. “The committee report will have to withstand the Supreme Court’s judicial scrutiny… I am not averse to an enquiry. The government takes individuals’ plea of violation of their privacy seriously,” Mr. Mehta said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-to-pass-interim-orders-in-pegasus-case/article36444540.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||India, U.S. to tie up on green energy||The United States is to collaborate with India to work towards installing 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. “We look forward to partnering with India in bringing finance, technology and other elements needed to achieve it,” said John Kerry, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, on Monday. Currently India’s installed power capacity is projected to be 476 GW by 2021-22, and is expected to rise to at least 817 GW by 2030. Mr. Kerry is on an official visit to India from September 12-14, and is meeting Ministers and industrialists to “raise global climate ambition and speed India’s clean energy transition,” according to a communique from the U.S. State Department. Mr. Kerry was speaking at a public function following a bilateral meeting with Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, at the launch of the Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue (CAFMD). This was one of the main tracks of the U.S.-India Agenda 2030 Partnership that President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced at the Leaders Summit on Climate in April 2021. Mr. Kerry said Monday’s dialogue would serve as a “powerful avenue” for U.S.-India collaboration, and would be based on three pillars.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-us-to-tie-up-on-green-energy/article36444538.ece

Goutham Reddy on Monday said the CID had detected irregularities that caused a loss of Rs. 121 crore to the government-owned company during the Telugu Desam Party regime, and booked cases against 18 persons, including the prime accused Vemuri Harikrishna Prasad, who was inducted into the board of directors after he was made to step down as the MD of a software firm. Addressing mediapersons here, Mr. Reddy alleged that Mr. Prasad, who headed the APSFL tenders committee, and the others had colluded with some private companies in the supply of signal meters, cables and other equipment and payments were made without the bills being submitted. There were massive irregularities in tenders worth Rs. 321 crore invited by the APSFL. The CID registered an FIR against the accused on September 9, 2021. Two of them had relations with some people in Naravaripalle (in Chittoor district), Mr. Reddy said, suggesting possible links to TDP leaders. He said Mr. Prasad’s company had bagged tenders in July-August 2015 due to the cooperation extended by the then government. Rules were violated blatantly and tender deadlines were extended to favour the said company. he alleged. Mr. Reddy said three companies, including the one led by Mr. Prasad, formed a partnership and submitted bids. It was ensured that his firm won the bids, he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/during-tdp-regime-apsfl-lost-rs-121-crore/article36444483.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||IITs put off JEE (Advanced) registrations||Twelve days after the last session of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE-Main) was held, results are yet to be declared, forcing the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) to once again postpone registrations for their entrance test JEE (Advanced), which were due to begin on Monday. The top 2.5 lakh ranked students from JEE (Main) are eligible to write JEE (Advanced), which is scheduled to be held on October 3. “The results will be declared tomorrow or latest by Wednesday,” said Higher Education Secretary Amit Khare, who did not comment on the reasons for the delay. Senior officials at the National Testing Agency and the Education Ministry insisted that it was not related to the Central Bureau of Investigation’s ongoing probe into an alleged cheating scandal at a JEE-Main examination centre in Sonipat, Haryana. One senior official said COVID-19 infection among key personnel contributed to the delay. The JEE (Main) is not just an entrance test for admission to the National Institutes of Technology and other central and State engineering colleges, but is also used as the eligibility test for IIT aspirants. This year, four sessions of JEE (Main) were held, with students allowed to attempt the exam as often as they liked, with their best score to be used for ranking purposes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/iits-put-off-jee-advanced-registrations/article36444542.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Inflation dips marginally to 5.3% in Aug.||India’s retail inflation cooled to 5.3% in August from 5.6% in July, thanks to food price inflation falling to 3.11% from nearly 4% in July, and the effect of a high base last August. This marks the second month of marginal moderation in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), keeping retail inflation below the central bank’s upper tolerance threshold of 6% after hitting 6.3% in May and June this year. The Reserve Bank of India is expected to continue with its accommodative monetary policy stance, with the headline inflation number edging lower. However, economists warned that inflationary risks persist. These could dampen the fervour for festive spending as inflation in health (7.8%), transport and communication (10.2%), fuel and light (almost 13%), remains high. They attributed the downward movement in inflation largely to the base effect — CPI inflation was at 6.7% in August 2020, with the Consumer Food Price Index rising 9.05%. The pace of price rise in protein sources and oils remained a concern.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/inflation-dips-marginally-to-53-in-aug/article36444543.ece
14 September 2021||Bengaluru,||How and why these tigers in Odisha changed their stripes||More than half a century ago, when the tribals of Similipal in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha reported sightings of “black tigers” — their stripes almost fused together in patches threatening to obliterate parts of their burnished orange coats — nobody believed them at first. But an estimated 37% of Panthera tigris in the Similipal Tiger Reserve (in eastern India) are pseudomelanistic, characterised by wide, merged stripes. This is the result of a rare mutation in one gene, Transmembrane Aminopeptidase Q or Taqpep, recessively inherited variants of which are responsible for the marks in domestic cats and king cheetahs. What’s more, the mutation is rarely seen in tigers outside Similipal. Genetic basis The discovery of the genetic basis for the physical characteristics or phenotype in the wild is a culmination of years of research by a team of scientists led by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS). “Our results indicate that Taqpep p.H454Y is likely absent or extremely rare outside of Similipal,” said the authors in their paper published in the peer-reviewed journal PNAS on September 14. Uma Ramakrishnan, molecular ecologist and professor at NCBS, likened it to watching evolution in action. “You can imagine it in bacteria or the SARS-CoV-2, but in tigers?” Two factors are probably driving this change in appearance caused by the rare Taqpep p.H454Y: a founder bottleneck effect when a small subset of a large population, in this case tigers, establishes a new population, and the resulting genetic drift, where chance, more than natural selection, changes how common or rare genetic variants are. With shrinking habitats, the tiger population becomes increasingly isolated. This causes inbreeding, resulting in a lack of genetic variation, making them prone to extinction. Of the 12 unique individual tigers studied, four were found to be pseudo-melanistic. Vinay Sagar, a PhD student in Dr. Ramakrishan’s lab and the lead author of the paper said, “That 37% of tigers are showing a particular phenotype may not be very high. But coupled with the phenotype’s absence from everywhere else, this makes it a relatively high percentage.” To gather information on wild tigers, researchers collected samples of their faecal matter, shed hair from scratch marks in the ground, and saliva from lick marks on a prey’s body suspected to be killed by a tiger. The DNA extracted from these samples, as well as two skins of tigers that had been seized, were compared with samples of five captive pseudo-melanistic tigers in the Nandankanan Biological Park, Bhubaneswar, and the Arignar Anna Zoological Park, Chennai. The findings of this study offers a nuanced view of India’s tiger conservation efforts. For the endangered animal to survive and thrive in the wild, there needs to be more genetic variation. “The population at Similipal Tiger Reserve is small and potentially disconnected from other populations. It is likely that related individuals are mating with each other. That is why the driver of this evolutionary change is likely. But given the small population size, yes, Similipal tigers are undergoing inbreeding,” Mr. Vinay added. In the paper, researchers said simulations suggest that one migrant tiger per generation would most likely result in the loss of the melanistic mutation from Similipal. “Regardless of how the frequency of this mutation changes in the future, genetic rescue should benefit the population by increasing heterozygosity and decreasing the probability of inbreeding depression. Careful consideration would be required when selecting the immigrant,” the paper stated. For Dr. Ramakrisnhan and her team, what began as a curiosity driven investigation — “What is the genetic basis of pseudo-melanism?” — has given them insight into the evolutionary trajectory of a small and isolated population of an endangered species, and solved a long standing mystery of why these tigers look the way they do.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/how-and-why-these-tigers-in-odisha-changed-their-stripes/article36444583.ece

Just days ago, the apex court had ruled that the State government cannot postpone local body polls and it is for the Election Commission to decide. State Election Commissioner U.P.S. Madan said the court had specified that the State’s COVID-19 guidelines did not apply for the bypolls and the decision on conducting them should be taken soon. The bypolls were stayed on July 9 on the State’s request, pointing to the COVID-19 threat. The SEC had sought a report on the COVID-19 situation from the Collectors of Dhule, Nandurbar, Washim, Akola, Nagpur and Palghar districts and found that the pandemic situation was under control. Regular polls for Palghar zilla parishad and panchayat samiti will be held the same day, and counting will be on October 6. Political row The decision to hold the byelections has led to a political row in the State as an all-party meeting had decided not to go ahead with the poll programme owing to the verdict by the top court scrapping political reservation of OBCs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bypolls-to-local-body-seats-on-oct-5/article36445050.ece

Immediately after he was sworn in by Governor Acharya Devvrat, Mr. Patel took charge at the Chief Minister’s Office and held a meeting with the top bureaucrats to review the flood situation in Jamnagar and Rajkot in the Saurashtra region. The Chief Minister directed the officials to ensure that people living in the low-lying areas are shifted to safer locations. Earlier Union Home Minister Amit Shah and his Cabinet colleagues Mansukh Mandaviya, N.S. Tomar, Pralhad Joshi, Parshottam Rupala and Bhupender Yadav attended the swearing-in ceremony, which lasted only a few minutes as only the Chief Minister took the oath of office and secrecy. The Chief Ministers of Goa, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana were also present. There will be another function to administer the oath to the Cabinet members after the names are decided by the party. According to sources, Mr. Shah, Mr. Patel and other leaders will decide the names to be included in the Cabinet, as many senior leaders and members of the outgoing Cabinet are likely to be dropped to bring in new faces and infuse dynamism in the administration. Deputy CM There is yet no clarity on the continuation of the post of Deputy Chief Minister. “We don’t know yet whether there will be a new Deputy Chief Minister or just Cabinet Ministers,” a party leader said. There is also no clarity on whether Nitin Patel, the outgoing Deputy Chief Minister, will be a part of the new Cabinet. On Monday, he broke down before mediapersons after he was overlooked but subsequently stated that he had no issues with the party and that he was a disciplined worker of the BJP. He also denied reports that he was unhappy with the top leadership’s decision to pick Mr. Bhupendra Patel, a first-time legislator and protege of Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, as the successor to Vijay Rupani. In the Cabinet, the party is likely to give larger representation to legislators from Saurashtra and north Gujarat, where the BJP expects to improve its prospects in the next Assembly election. The State BJP’s parliamentary board is likely to meet on Tuesday to finalise the names for the new Cabinet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhupendra-patel-takes-over-as-gujarat-cm/article36444334.ece
14 September 2021||CHENNAI,||Booster shots not required now: study||An expert review published in medical journal, The Lancet, has recommended that booster doses for the general population are not appropriate at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, weighing in on the global debate that calls for caution in administering booster doses. An international group of scientists, including those at the World Health Organisation and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration agency, concluded that even for the Delta variant, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID is so high that at this stage that boosters would not be appropriate and not required. The review summarises the currently available evidence from studies published in peer-reviewed journals and pre-print servers. “The message that boosting might soon be needed, if not justified by robust data and analysis, could adversely affect confidence in vaccines and undermine messaging about the value of primary vaccination,” the paper states. Further, it goes on to explain: There could be risks if boosters are widely introduced too soon, or too frequently, especially with vaccines that can have immune-mediated side-effects. If unnecessary boosting causes significant adverse reactions, there could be implications for vaccine acceptance that go beyond COVID-19 vaccines. A consistent finding from the observational studies is that vaccines remain highly effective against severe disease, including that from all the main viral variants, a release states. Averaging the results reported from the observational studies, vaccination had 95% efficacy against severe disease both from the Delta variant and from the Alpha variant, and over 80% efficacy at protecting against any infection from these variants, the release adds. The authors note that even if antibody levels in vaccinated individuals wane, it did not necessarily mean reduction in the efficacy of vaccines against severe disease. This could be because protection against severe disease is mediated not only by antibody responses, but also by long-lived memory responses and cell-mediated immunity. The ability of vaccines to elicit an antibody response against current variants indicates that these variants have not yet evolved to the point at which they are likely to escape the memory immune response induced by the vaccines. Even if new variants that can escape the current vaccines do evolve, they are most likely to do so from strains that have already become widely prevalent, and it makes sense to use boosters that have been specifically made to attack potential new variants. “The limited supply of these vaccines will save the most lives if made available to people who are at appreciable risk of serious disease and have not yet received any vaccine. Even if some gain can ultimately be obtained from boosting, it will not outweigh the benefits of providing initial protection to the unvaccinated. If vaccines are deployed where they would do the most good, they could hasten the end of the pandemic by inhibiting further evolution of variants,” says lead author Ana-Maria Henao-Restrepo of the WHO. “Although the idea of further reducing the number of COVID-19 cases by enhancing immunity in vaccinated people is appealing, any decision to do so should be evidence-based and consider the benefits and risks for individuals and society. These high-stakes decisions should be based on robust evidence and international scientific discussion,” added Soumya Swaminathan, WHO Chief Scientist, and co author.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/booster-shots-not-required-now-study/article36444479.ece
14 September 2021||Srinagar,||Huge turnout at policeman’s funeral||Farooq Khan, Adviser to J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, on Monday described the large participation of people at a police officer’s funeral in the Valley as a sign of the “changing times”, and said “people will teach the self-styled mujahids a lesson soon”. Hundreds of residents participated in the funeral of sub-inspector Arshid Ashraf Mir, who was shot dead by a militant near the Khanyar police station in Srinagar on Sunday. Mir was buried at his native place at Kalmona in Handwara of north Kashmir on Sunday evening. “The situation is changing. People’s participation is an indication that people will now teach a lesson to these cowards, who themselves call self-styled mujahids . These cowards will beg for their mercy,” Mr. Khan, a former police officer, said. Kashmir has witnessed growing attacks on police patrols this year, with five policemen killed in four hit-and-run cases in Srinagar. Apni Party president Syed Mohammd Altaf Bukhari said the violence in all its manifestations has severely impacted peace, progress and good governance in J&K. “The impact of armed violence negatively influences development, peace and good governance, often by creating a climate of impunity, corruption and by undermining public institutions,” he said. Mr. Buhkari appealed to the youth to shun the path of violence and contribute in the promotion of peace and stability in the region. “The young police officer, who was yet to be confirmed, was killed in cold blood. The incident didn’t inflict miseries to his family alone but added to the already agonising situation in Kashmir,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/huge-turnout-at-policemans-funeral/article36444315.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. curbs funding for 10 climate change, child labour NGOs||Five years after it cancelled the registration of international non-governmental organisation (NGO) Greenpeace to receive foreign funds, the government has moved to restrict the funding for a group of 10 American, Australian and European NGOs dealing with environmental, climate change and child labour issues. An internal Reserve Bank of India note, dated July 1, 2021, which was sent to all banks, said the government had specified a number of foreign entities to be placed on the “Prior Reference Category” (PRC list) using the stringent Foreign Contribution Regulation Act 2010, which was tightened in September 2020, making both banks and chartered accountants accountable for any unauthorised funds that come through. The NGOs are the European Climate Foundation; the U.S.-based Omidyar Network International, Humanity United and Stardust Foundation; the Australia-based Walk Free Foundation and Minderoo Foundation; the U.K.-based Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, Freedom Fund and Laudes Foundation, and the U.K./ UAE-based Legatum Fund. They add to the more than 80 international voluntary agencies now on the PRC list of the government. “The RBI has instructed that any fund flow from the (specified) donor agencies to any NGO/Voluntary organisation/ persons in India should be brought to the Ministry of Home Affairs so that the funds are allowed to be credited to the recipients only after clearance/ prior permission from the MHA’s Foreigners Division of the FCRA wing,” the notice sent out recently by a private bank to its branches, which The Hindu obtained a copy of, said. The RBI did not respond to a request for a comment, but officials confirmed informally that the note had been sent out, in line with previous such circulars sent to banks warning them of NGOs banned or suspended from acquiring or disbursing foreign funds. Significantly all the NGOs on the latest list work on climate change and environmental projects and/or child rights and slavery projects, subjects where the government has been sensitive to international criticism. Focus on coal When asked why so many environmental NGOs are on the list, given the government’s stated international commitments on fighting climate change, an official said that despite India’s record in complying with the Paris agreement, “global pressures are intensifying on India to raise the Nationally Determined Contributions”. “In order to create noise in the media, several pro-climate NGOs are focusing on advocacy against coal, which is considered a violation of FCRA provisions,” the official added. In 2017, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had also objected strongly to the International Labour Organisation’s Global Slavery Index, “questioning the credibility of data” which had ranked India 53rd of 167 countries where “modern slavery” was prevalent, and as the country with highest number of people in forced labour, according to a reply in Parliament. The index is part of the Australian Walk Free Foundation’s annual survey that is used by other NGOs working in the field. Both the Walk Free Foundation, and its founding agency Minderoo Foundation did not respond to emails from The Hindu requesting a response. The MHA too declined to comment on the PCR listing, which is not made public, although the government has released numbers of NGOs under the scanner of security agencies. According to the MHA responses in Parliament, between 2016 a and 2020, the government cancelled the FCRA licences of more than 6,600 NGOs and suspended those of about 264. A U.K.-based NGO Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) has now taken the government to court for suspending its FCRA licence, and won temporary relief in the Delhi High Court in, allowing it to access 25% of its funds, A final order is expected in October.

(AETL) has said its systemic enzyme and probiotic supplements — ImmunoSEB and ProbioSEB CSC3 — have passed the randomised controlled clinical trials in terms of efficacy to resolve post-COVID-19 fatigue symptoms. “With an aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the health supplements, ImmunoSEB [systemic enzyme complex] and ProbioSEB CSC3 [probiotic complex] in patients suffering from COVID-19 induced fatigue, a randomised, multi-centric, double blind and placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 200 patients suffering from post COVID-19 fatigue symptoms,” said Dr. Abhijit K. Rathi, Principal Scientist, AETL. “The randomised clinical trial was conducted on 200 patients who did not have an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by a negative COVID-19 test, with a complaint of post COVID-19 fatigue,” he stated. Patients were required to have a positive COVID-19 test at any time in the past and the trial was conducted across three centres in India — Swasthya Hospital, Bhopal; Samvedna Hospital, Varanasi; and Chirayu Medical College & Hospital, Bhopal — by investigators for 14 days. “According to the clinical research paper published by the Switzerland-based Medicines journal on August 30, 2021, the treatment efficacy was compared using the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFQ-11) for 14 days. The supplemental treatment resulted in resolution of fatigue in a greater percentage in patients,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supplements-for-covid-fatigue-pass-clinical-trials/article36444346.ece
14 September 2021||Kolkata,||BJP, Left candidates file papers in Bhabanipur||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Priyanka Tibrewal and Left Front candidate Srijib Biswas on Monday filed their nominations for the Bhabanipur Assembly byelection in West Bengal. Mr. Biswas is contesting on CPI(M) ticket. The two candidates are up against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who filed her papers on September 10. The Chief Minister also took part in the campaign and spoke to voters in the Ekbalpur area. Ms. Tibrewal was accompanied by Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Suvendu Adhikari and BJP Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh. Mr. Adhikari, who contested against the Chief Minister in Nandigram and defeated her by a margin of 1,956 votes, urged the voters to elect Ms. Tibrewal. Later in the day, the BJP wrote to the Election Commission of India demanding free and fair elections to the Samserganj, Jangipur and Bhabanipur Assembly seats. It sought deployment of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) at all polling booths. It urged the ECI to transfer officers posted for more than three years, and said no officer of the State government should be employed on polling duty since the employees’ union had openly pledged its support to Ms. Banerjee. In the 2021 Assembly election, Trinamool candidate Sovandeb Chattopadhyay won the seat by a margin of nearly 27,000 votes. He resigned paving the way for Ms. Banerjee to contest the byelection. Ms. Banerjee represented the constituency in 2011 and 2016. During the day, the Calcutta High Court heard a public interest litigation petition challenging the byelection. A Division Bench led by Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal asked why the petition was filed long after the ECI’s announcement. The matter will come up for hearing again on September 20. The bypolls to the three seats are scheduled to be held on September 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-left-candidates-file-papers-in-bhabanipur/article36444319.ece
14 September 2021||New Delhi,||Congress eyes Rajya Sabha seats in Maharashtra, T.N.||The Congress will have to choose from several hopefuls for a Rajya Sabha seat from Maharashtra and another from Tamil Nadu that ally DMK had promised them, though the latter has so far not officially conveyed whether they will concede the seat now or in June 2022, when five Upper House seats from the State go to the polls out of 20 countrywide. The vacancy in Maharashtra arose on the Congress’s Rajeev Satav’s death, and his wife is among the claimants for the secure seat. Five Rajya Sabha seats will got to the polls on October 4 — two from Tamil Nadu and one each from Maharashtra, West Bengal and Assam. In Tamil Nadu, the two seats fell vacant following the resignation of AIADMK MPs K.P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam, after being elected to the Assembly. For Mr. Vaithilingam’s seat, only an 11-month tenure is left. During the seat-sharing discussions ahead of the last Assembly election between the DMK and the Congress, a tentative agreement was reached between the two on a Rajya Sabha seat. A section of the Congress is hopeful that Chief Minister M.K. Stalin will push for senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, considering the latter’s warm relationship with the late M. Karunanidhi. Mr. Azad retired on February 15 last after serving 28 years in the House. Sources in both the DMK and the Congress said that in case the DMK concedes the seat to the Congress, it won’t dictate terms and will go with whoever the Congress chooses. “It is unlikely they will press for Mr. Azad’s nomination if the Congress is not on board with it. They usually believe in writing a blank cheque,” a senior DMK leader said. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has been pushing for a generational change in the party’s Upper House team and is said to favour Praveen Chakravarty, chairperson of the Data Analytics department of the party, for the Tamil Nadu seat. Mr. Chakravarty, a Tamil, has been a critical member of Mr. Gandhi’s team and also close to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Former IAS officer S. Sasikanth Senthil, who quit the civil services last year citing a “totalitarian attack on the country” and joined the Congress in November, is also in the list of contenders.  Tamil Nadu State Congress president K.S. Alagiri is also hoping that he will be awarded for delivering victory in both the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections where he did not seek ticket for himself.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-eyes-rajya-sabha-seats-in-maharashtra-tn/article36444331.ece
14 September 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. questions CONCOR divestment||The Congress on Monday questioned the Central government’s proposal to reduce its stake in the Container Corporation of India (CONCOR), a public sector undertaking (PSU) under the Indian Railways, saying that the PSU had been consistently earning profits in the past 10 years. At a press conference at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) headquarters, party spokesperson Gourav Vallabh charged the Railways with changing the terms of leasing its land to CONCOR in a way that would put the company at a financial disadvantage and eventually affect its market value. “The Modi government has given its nod to sell 30.8% out of its 54.8% holding in CONCOR and management control to strategic buyers. CONCOR has over 60 Inland Container Depots and 24 are situated on railway land,” Mr. Vallabh told reporters. He pointed out that the company had earned a net profit of Rs. 503 crore. “Once decided for disinvestment, why the government is considering changing land licensing fees (LLF) from the existing 6% to 2%-3% and lease period from 5 years to 35 years? It is of more significance when Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone says ‘acquiring CONCOR will be a breeze’,” he stated. “How can the Railway land acquired from farmers at concessional rates be handed over to a private party for commercial use in a backdoor arrangement,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-questions-concor-divestment/article36444480.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Post-poll violence: Bengal govt. says NHRC panel biased||The West Bengal government on Monday accused a committee appointed by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to look into “post-poll violence” in the State of “apparent bias”. The accusation was made by the State in the Supreme Court during the hearing of its appeal challenging a five-judge Bench judgment of the Calcutta High Court transferring the investigation of the cases, involving murder and rape, to the CBI. The High Court, on August 19, had directed the State to immediately pay compensation to the victims of the crime. The High Court’s judgment was based on the findings of the NHRC committee on July 12. West Bengal argued that the members of the committee were either “members of the Bharatiya Janata Party or were closely associated” with it. It named two members, Atif Rasheed and Rajulben L. Desai, in this regard. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for West Bengal, orally referred to another member, Rajiv Jain, during the hearing though the State’s petition did not refer to him. “Can you imagine these people have been appointed to collect the data? Is this a BJP investigation committee,” Mr. Sibal asked the court. But the Bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Aniruddha Bose asked whether a person’s political past could be treated as conclusive proof of bias. The court scheduled the case for further hearing on September 20. “The inclusion of the aforesaid members in the committee indeed gave rise to a reasonable likelihood of bias and vitiated the independence of the entire committee, especially given their admitted leadership position within the committee and their rank when compared to others,” the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/post-poll-violence-bengal-govt-says-nhrc-panel-biased/article36444312.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Zail Singh’s grandson joins BJP, says fulfilled grandfather’s wish||Inderjeet Singh, grandson of former President Giani Zail Singh, joined the BJP on Monday in the presence of Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri. Welcoming him, BJP general secretary and Punjab unit in charge Dushyant Gautam said this showed that the party held a special place in the hearts of the people of Punjab. After joining the BJP at the party’s headquarters in New Delhi, Mr. Inderjeet Singh said he had “fulfilled” his grandfather’s wishes. “The Congress did not behave properly with my grandfather. I campaigned for the BJP during the Madan Lal Khurana days in Delhi. My grandfather wanted me to join the BJP. He had introduced me to late Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani,” he said. Mr. Singh hails from the Ramgarhia Sikh community, which comes under the OBC category. The community has a substantial presence in the Doaba and Majha belts of Punjab. The BJP has parted ways with one its oldest allies, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), after the latter walked out of the NDA over the three contentious farm laws The SAD has been part of the protests asking for the repeal of the three laws. Mr. Singh’s entry is an attempt to broadbase the party’s appeal among Sikhs in the State especially those on the margins of the community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/zail-singhs-grandson-joins-bjp-says-fulfilled-grandfathers-wish/article36444330.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC tells govt. to keep tax regime ‘simple’||The Supreme Court has advised the government to keep the tax regime “convenient and simple” to ensure maximum compliance. Payment of tax by both individual and corporate required planning. There was no room for presumption, a Bench of Justices S.K. Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy of the court observed in a recent judgment. “The tax an individual or a corporate is required to pay is a matter of planning for a taxpayer and the government should endeavour to keep it convenient and simple to achieve maximisation of compliance,” Justice Roy, who authored the judgment, said. The court quoted 18th century economist Adam Smith’s seminal work, The Wealth of Nations , “the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person”. The Supreme Court said that in a taxation regime, nothing should be left to be implied about, the contours should be clearly defined. “Just as the government does not wish for avoidance of tax equally, it is the responsibility of the regime to design a tax system for which a subject can budget and plan. If proper balance is achieved between these, unnecessary litigation can be avoided without compromising on generation of revenue,” Justice Roy noted in the September 9 verdict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-tells-govt-to-keep-tax-regime-simple/article36444344.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC calls for reforms in grounds for divorce||The Supreme Court on Monday said the legislature has so far been reluctant to introduce “irretrievable breakdown of marriage” as a ground for divorce because marriage is considered “sacramental” and is supposed to be an “eternal union of two people” under the Hindu law. “Society at large does not accept divorce, given the heightened importance of marriage as a social institution in India. Or at least, it is far more difficult for women to retain social acceptance after divorce. This coupled with law’s failure to guarantee financial security to women in the event of a breakdown of marriage is stated to be the reason for the legislature’s reluctance to introduce irretrievable breakdown as a ground for divorce,” a Bench of Justices S.K. Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy observed in a judgment. The court also noted that repeated allegations and litigation against a spouse amount to cruelty which is a ground for divorce. The judgment came in a case in which the wife left on the wedding day itself. The court said that she had gone on to initiate complaints and allegations against her estranged spouse. “This conduct shows disintegration of marital unity and thus disintegration of the marriage. In fact, there was no initial integration itself which would allow disintegration afterwards,” the court said. The court dissolved the marriage on both the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of marriage and cruelty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-calls-for-reforms-in-grounds-for-divorce/article36444527.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Be compassionate in issuing COVID death certificates: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday said the government should consider certifying COVID-19 as a reason for death in case of patients who chose to take their own lives. A Bench led by Justice M.R. Shah urged the government, while perusing the new guidelines issued by the Health Ministry which has simplified the process of issuing death certificates for the pandemic patients, to be compassionate. The guidelines exclude deaths caused by poisoning, suicide, homicide and accident even if the deceased was positive. The court also sought details of the implementation of the guidelines by the States. It asked the government about the formation of a grievance redressal mechanism in connection with the policy and also how the government was going to deal with death certificates which had already been issued to families of COVID patients. Earlier judgement In a judgment in June, the court had directed that death certificates of patients should show the “exact cause of death”. The court had reasoned that by not issuing the correct/accurate death certificates mentioning the correct cause of death, that is COVID-19, even the other citizens would be misled and the correct figure of deaths would not be known. On Monday, the court also asked about compliance by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to its June 30 judgment on framing uniform guidelines for payment of ex gratia to the families of COVID patients who had died. The court had pulled up the NDMA for “failing to perform its duty” to recommend ex gratia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/be-compassionate-in-issuing-covid-death-certificates-sc/article36444343.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Braving all odds for a trek to Siachen||A team of eight persons with disabilities created a new world record for the “largest number of people with disabilities” to scale the world’s highest battlefield, Siachen Glacier, by scaling up to the Kumar Post at an altitude of 15,632 ft. The team with disabilities was trained and led by CLAW Global, a team of Special Forces veterans who had left the service due to disabilities. “The expedition team climbed a total distance of 60 km atop the spine of the Siachen Glacier over a period of five days from September 7 to finally reach Kumar Post on September 11,” said Major Arun Prakash Ambathy (retd) of CLAW Global. The expedition was actively supported throughout by the Army, he said. Stating that the team ascended 4,000 ft gradually while scaling the Glacier, Major Ambathy said the route involved crossing several deep crevasses, icy glacial water streams, hard-ice stretches and undulating rocky moraines. “This not only tested the physical endurance and mental stamina, but also the ice-craft skills of the participants, in use of ice axe, crampons, ladder crossing and rope skills,” he said. On the challenges faced by the team, Major Ambathy said the extremely rough, rocky and undulating terrain along the moraines of the glacier made the climb particularly challenging for the visually impaired and the leg amputees. “They displayed phenomenal grit despite the challenges,” he said adding that the participants with hand amputation had to constantly work on their balance, managing the rope and work on adaptations for emergency rescue procedures. This is the land world record expedition part of “Operation Blue Freedom Triple World Records” being undertaken by CLAW Global. CLAW Global was set up in January 2019 by Major Vivek Jacob (retd), a Para Special Forces officer, who had to hang up his boots following a combat skydive injury after 14 years of service in the Army, with the aim of teaching life skills to adventurers and people with disabilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/braving-all-odds-for-a-trek-to-siachen/article36444340.ece
14 September 2021||Lucknow,||Adityanath makes abba jaan jibe again||In a double-edged statement, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said that prior to his government’s formation in 2017, the ration meant for the poor would get “digested” by those who utter abba jaan . This led to a reaction on social media with several users condemning his words and accusing him of making communal references. In several parts of the country, Muslims use the phrase abba jaan to refer to their fathers or as an endearment. However, in the recent context in the State’s politics, it also appears to be an attack on Mr. Adityanath’s rival and president of the Samajwadi Party (SP), Akhilesh Yadav, and his father, Mulayam Singh Yadav. At an official function in Kushinagar on Sunday, Mr. Adityanath, while taking a swipe at the alleged “appeasement” by previous governments, said that now the BJP did not look at anyone’s face before providing them benefits such as toilets or foodgrains. “Are you getting ration? Did you get this ration prior to 2017? Back then, those who say abba jaan would digest all the ration. Kushinagar’s ration will end up in Nepal and Bangladesh. If today anyone tries to swallow the ration of the poor, that person will land in jail,” he said. The SP ruled Uttar Pradesh from 2012 to 2017. Recently, in an interview to a television channel, when asked about the work done in the State since 2017, Mr. Adityanath took a swipe at Mr. Yadav’s father and referred to the firing on ‘kar sevaks’ in 1990 under his tenure. “His abba jaan would say he would not allow even a bird to fly [around the mosque enclosure],” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adityanath-makes-abba-jaan-jibe-again/article36444306.ece
14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||India, U.S. to tie up on green energy||Mr. Kerry said Monday’s dialogue would serve as a “powerful avenue” for U.S.-India collaboration, and would be based on three pillars. One would be a “climate action pillar” which would have joint proposals looking at ways in emissions could be reduced in the next decade. The second pillar would be setting out a roadmap to achieving the 450GW in transportation, buildings and industry. The final pillar, or the ''Finance Pillar” would involve collaborating on attracting finance to deploy 450 GW of renewable energy and demonstrate at scale clean energy technologies. Six banks in the U.S., Mr. Kerry said, have already committed to “investing” $4.5 trillion in the next decade towards clean energy. Following his meeting, Mr. Yadav tweeted: “CAFMD will provide both countries an opportunity to renew collaborations on climate change while addressing financing aspects and deliver climate finances primarily as grants and concessional finance as envisaged under the Paris Agreement.” A key mission of Mr. Kerry is to build global support for ‘Net Zero’, or carbon neutrality, which is when more carbon is sucked out from the atmosphere or prevented from being emitted than what a country emits and is critical to ensuring that the planet doesn’t heat up an additional half a degree by 2100. “We have to reach a net zero global standard by 2050. This is not a matter of politics or ideology but one of arithmetic and physics,” said Mr. Kerry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-us-to-tie-up-on-green-energy/article36444310.ece
14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||SC to pass interim orders in Pegasus case||“It has to be gone into, it must be gone into… It is the feeling of the government that such an issue cannot be placed on affidavit. It has to be gone through by a committee. It concerns national security,” Mr. Mehta said. The government could not afford to “sensationalise” such an “important” issue, he stated. He objected to assertions by petitioners that the “government is denying protection to its own citizens” or is “assaulting democracy”. Concern about privacy Justice Kant said the court was equally concerned about national security, but it cannot turn a deaf ear to concerns about privacy raised by citizens. “We just wanted you to clarify whether their privacy was violated or not. Whether surveillance, if done at all, was after lawful permission. Was the interception done by any agency unlawfully? Should the government not be concerned if any “outside agency” had violated our citizens’ privacy?” Justice Kant asked the law officer. “We are not interested in matters concerning national security. Our only concern, in the face of allegations made by petitioners about use of some software against citizens, is knowing whether any government agency has used any method of interception other than in accordance with law,” Chief Justice Ramana told Mr. Mehta. At one point, the CJI questioned the practicality behind the government’s insistence on refusing to discuss the Pegasus allegations in open court, saying that even if an expert committee was formed, its work and the report would eventually become public. Mr. Sibal referred to a 2019 parliamentary response of the government taking note of the use of Pegasus. “Why did they not take action against the use of Pegasus… because they were using it. The government is committed to protecting the rights of citizens, including their privacy,” he submitted. He urged the court to have the allegations investigated by a sitting judge. Senior advocate Shyam Divan, for a petitioner, said the Cabinet Secretary should have filed a detailed affidavit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pegasus-case-sc-to-pass-interim-orders/article36444313.ece

The final results and the all-India ranking was expected to be released by September 10, in time for the JEE (Advanced) registrations to begin the next day. As the JEE (Main) results were delayed, JEE (Advanced) registrations were initially postponed to September 13. Faced with further delays, a Monday evening notice to candidates on the JEE (Advanced) website simply asked them to “keep visiting for updates on registration”.

14 September 2021||Srinagar,||6 Chinese grenades recovered in Srinagar||Panic gripped the outskirts of Srinagar on Monday morning when a CRPF patrol spotted and seized a bag full of hand grenades placed on the national highway. “During a routine road opening exercise along National Highway 44, troopers recovered six Chinese grenades from a sandbag, which was placed on the divider of the road. The alertness of the troops averted an incident on the busy highway,” CRPF spokesman Abhiram said. Due to the rush on the highway, the grenades were not defused on the spot. “They were handed over to the police for disposal,” he stated. The grenades were placed at a location in the Bemina area where the CRPF would deploy its quick reaction team during the day, officials said. Security was heightened on the highway. The grenades’ recovery comes two days after militants executed twin attacks in the capital. A grenade attack was carried out on a police picket in Chanapora on September 11 and a policeman was shot dead the next day in Khanyar area. An anti-militancy operation entered the second day on Monday in the Pir Panjal valley’s Rajouri district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/6-chinese-grenades-recovered-in-srinagar/article36444317.ece
14 September 2021||Kolkata,||Bengal Speaker issues summons to CBI, ED||Speaker of West Bengal Assembly Biman Banerjee on Monday issued summons to officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to appear in the State Assembly on September 22. The officers have been summoned to explain why the Speaker was not informed when the agencies filed chargesheets against elected representatives of the State Assembly. Recently the Central investigation agencies had filed chargesheets against Ministers Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee and Trinamool Congress MLA Madan Mitra in the Narada sting videos case. The CBI had arrested four political heavyweights, including the two Ministers, the TMC MLA and former TMC Minister Sovan Chatterjee in the Narada case in May 2021. The accused were granted bail by the Calcutta High Court. Meanwhile, CBI officials on Monday questioned State Industry Minister Partha Chatterjee in connection with chit fund case involving the I-Core group. Three members of the CBI met the Minister at his office. Along with Narada sting tapes the CBI and ED are also probing the chit fund case in the State. Speaking to journalists later, Mr. Chatterjee said that he tried to answer the questions of the CBI to best of his knowledge. The CBI had sent summons to Mr. Chatterjee to appear before the agency, but the Minister wrote back suggesting that the officers can come to his residence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengal-speaker-issues-summons-to-cbi-ed/article36444320.ece
14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Inflation dips marginally to 5.3% in August||These could dampen the fervour for festive spending as inflation in health (7.8%), transport and communication (10.2%), fuel and light (almost 13%), remains high. They attributed the downward movement in inflation largely to the base effect — CPI inflation was at 6.7% in August 2020, with the Consumer Food Price Index rising 9.05%. The pace of price rise in protein sources and oils remained a concern, even though overall food and beverages inflation stood at 3.8% this August. After moderating last month, oils and fats inflation zoomed to 33%, while inflation in eggs, meat and fish and pulses hit 16.3%, 9.2% and 8.8%, respectively, as per the National Statistical Office (NSO). “On the whole, the comfort level from the lower CPI inflation is not commensurate with the level of decline. For the next two months, inflation will trend downwards as the base effect will provide this support,” said CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis, adding that the dip in food inflation was “more due to the fall in vegetable inflation which has moved to -11.7%”.  “Inflation for clothing and footwear firmed up to 6.8% in August 2021, which may be a signal of a demand recovery,” said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar, estimating that core-CPI inflation eased to 5.5% in August 2021 from 5.7% in July.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/inflation-dips-marginally-to-53-in-august/article36444324.ece

A large number of local BJP leaders and legislators, including Rajya Sabha member and former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, was present at the event. Union Minister and estranged uncle of Mr. Chirag Paswan, Pashupati Kumar Paras, was also present.  Mr. Bablu’s statement fuelled speculation about a possible reunion in the family and in the party. “Everyone who has been keenly following politics in Bihar must be aware that LJP means Ram Vilas Paswan, and now it’s Chirag Paswan, with whom his caste vote bank can easily be identified with, instead of Mr. Paras and other party MPs.

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Test for disciple Janaka||The main postulate of the Advaita philosophy is the belief that liberation is automatic in the process of establishing oneself firmly and instinctively with the self. Self knowledge confers the perception that the self is not the jiva. The self is not in the category of any object, person or place in the world that can be described and perceived in normal terms. It has to be recognised as already abiding in all beings. The unique quality of the text Ashtavakra Gita is the manner in which the Advaita stance is unfolded by the preceptor Ashtavakra to the disciple Janaka, pointed out Sri R. Rajagopala Sarma in a discourse. Herein both are knowers of the Absolute Self, but they represent different ashrams, that is, the preceptor is a sanyasi who has renounced the world and Janaka, in spite of his realised state, is a king who actively participates in the conduct of his kingdom Mithila. As a preceptor, Ashtavakra knows the level of realisation attained by Janaka. Yet to make the world understand the exceptional quality of Janaka’s spiritual attainment, he poses very sharp questions meant to test the disciple. Are you not a Vairagya Sampanna, one who has renounced the world? Are you not already poised with the knowledge of the Advaita standpoint that the Self is Supreme and without a second, Ekameva Advitiyam? Then why are you still holding on to kingship and getting involved in worldly matters such as accumulation of wealth, state administration, law and order, etc, even if it is for the sake of protecting the kingdom? Does this not show clearly that you are still deluded by the pulls of the world? Janaka’s reply reinforces the fact that atma jnana is not the sole prerogative of sanyasa ashrama and that many of our forebears have continued to remain in the world of senses with a renunciate’s frame of mind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/test-for-disciple-janaka/article36444341.ece

Mr. Khurshid, along with national spokesperson Supriya Shrinate, was in Agra to hold meetings with local leaders regarding the party’s election manifesto. “Some of the important issues that we have come across include the poor state of farmers, lack of employment and the crumbling health infrastructure that has been exposed during the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/priyanka-to-be-face-of-cong-in-up-khurshid/article36444327.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi building collapse kills 2||Two minor boys died and an elderly man is undergoing treatment after a triple-storey building collapsed in north Delhi’s Sabzi Mandi on Monday morning. Rescue operation was under way at the time of filing the report and a few labourers were feared trapped in the building. Delhi Fire Service chief Atul Garg informed that they received a call at 11.50 a.m., after which seven fire tenders were pressed into service. Given the impact of the collapse and fearing people trapped under the debris, National Disaster Response Force, District Disaster Management Authority, Delhi Civil Defence and Central Industrial Security Force also reached with district police and fire department. The deceased children have been identified as brothers Soumya (12) and Prashant (7), residents of Roshanara Road, and the injured has been identified as Ramji Das Aneja (60), a resident of Malka Ganj and owner of a paan shop. FIR registered Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Anto Alphonse — who was at the spot till the rescue operation was under way — said that an FIR under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings ) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered to investigate the incident. On the ground floor of the building were two shops – one selling dairy products including milk, cheese and sweets, and another, a paan and currency notes exchange shop. The three floors above the shop were rooms of three houses behind the lane. Locals said the shop on the ground floor was sold by the owner to another shopkeeper in the lane about a month ago and the new owner had begun repair and renovation about three days ago. Labourers working inside the shop were feared trapped under the debris. An eyewitness, who identified himself as Amit Chaudhary and runs a footwear shop close to the building, said he was at his shop when the incident happened. “Right outside the milk shop, a rickshaw was standing and two boys were sitting inside. Their parents had gone to a grocery shop. They were just crossing the area and stopped on the way. Labourers were working inside the shop. Suddenly, the entire building collapsed and Ram uncle, who was about to step out of his shop, also got stuck under the debris. He was the first person who was rescued. He was severely injured and rushed to the hospital,” he said. The two children were found hours after, around 2 p.m., he said. They were rushed to the hospital, where they were later declared dead. Late by seconds The injured Mr. Aneja’s nephew Sandeep – who had come to pick a few belongings from the debris – said he had met his uncle who told him that he was getting ready to leave the shop when the incident occurred. “He got late by a few seconds, he told me. He was just leaving for market to buy some articles,” Mr. Sandeep said. Mr. Aneja had lost his wife to COVID-19 three months ago and his son over a year ago to dengue. He takes care of his daughter-in-law and grandson,” Mr. Sandeep said. Himantica Aneja, a resident of the collapsed building, said her family had been asking the new owner of the shop to stop using the drilling machine. “We kept asking him to consult an expert but he kept dodging us and said that it’s alright. The incident has happened because of his negligence,” she said. Praveen, a resident of the area, said that most buildings in the locality are nearly 100 years old and do not have concrete iron roofs and foundation. “This area is historic but the buildings are now dilapidated. They demand attention of officials,” he said. Police said that the shop’s owner has not been found yet but his family is being questioned. ‘Was not dangerous’ Meanwhile, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation had carried out a survey of dangerous buildings before monsoon, but had found the aforementioned building not dangerous. “However, the said property was not identified as dangerous as it was apparently not found in dangerous condition during the survey,” a North body statement stated. However, a thorough survey of the areas will be conducted again in the next 48 hours especially, of the buildings which have been already identified as dangerous. Those buildings which are found at imminent risk after the survey will be vacated by the corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-building-collapse-kills-2/article36444328.ece

The Supreme Court Bench led, by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, passed the judgment in the face of two contradicting judgments of Gujarat and Madras High Courts on the validity of Rule 89(5) of the Central Goods and Service Tax Rules, 2017. Rule 89(5) provides a formula for the refund of ITC, in “a case of refund on account of inverted duty structure”. The Bench said though the formula suffers from “inequities”, it did not deserve to be struck down. “We strongly urge the GST Council to reconsider the formula and take a policy decision ,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-upholds-refund-of-unutilised-itc/article36444528.ece

14 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||New Police Commissionerates for Avadi & Tambaram, says CM||The Tamil Nadu government will set up separate Police Commissionerates in Avadi and Tambaram besides setting up a State Cyber Crime Investigation Centre in the city to aid the police in cracking challenging crimes committed through the internet, Chief Minister M.K.

14 September 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Can Stalin succeed where AIADMK failed?||The DMK regime hopes to succeed where the AIADMK failed. In getting a Bill passed to dispense with the use of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) as the sole gateway for admission to undergraduate medical courses in Tamil Nadu, the M.K. Stalin-led government has largely gone by the content of Bills enacted by the regime of his predecessor, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, in 2017. The AIADMK regime had passed two Bills, one each for undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses, but the President withheld assent. In other words, the Centre rejected the attempt to exempt the State from the rigours of NEET. What makes the present regime think a similar legislative effort will succeed? After all, both the 2017 and the present-day Bills provide for using the qualifying examination — the Higher Secondary exam — as the sole basis for admission, and both provide for ‘normalisation’ of marks obtained by students belonging to different Boards. There is a slice of history that favours the DMK government. In 2005, the Jayalalithaa regime had sought to do away with the Common Entrance Test for professional courses through a government order. It was struck down by the Madras High Court. Thereafter, a Bill was passed in the State Assembly for the same purpose. The High Court struck down the law too, holding that exemption from the entrance test only for students from the State Board was invalid. Thereafter, the DMK, which returned to power in 2006, passed a fresh law to abolish the entrance test and admit students from all streams on the basis of marks obtained in the qualifying examination. It provided for normalisation of the marks given by other Boards so that a common merit list can be prepared. Significantly, the Act received the President’s assent and came into effect on March 7, 2007. The Madras High Court upheld the Act, and the abolition became complete. Can the DMK repeat this success by getting the President’s assent? It is an uphill task. Unlike in 2007, when the DMK was part of the UPA regime at the Centre, it has no leverage with the Union government now. Further, the Modi government appears to be in no mood to grant exemption from NEET to any one State. In any case, it has to explain the exemption to the Supreme Court, which has taken a rigid position that only NEET can ensure standards in medical education. The only new element in the 2021 Bill is that it draws inspiration from the report of the Justice A.K. Rajan Committee on the socio-economic impact of NEET. Much of its reasoning is found in the preamble to the Bill and in its Statement of Objects and Reasons: that NEET is not an equitable mode of admission, that it favours the elite and the rich, and that its continuance would adversely affect the State’s healthcare system due to inadequate number of willing doctors for its rural areas, with the poor being unable to join the courses. While these may be persuasive points to argue the case against NEET, they may not make much legal difference when it comes to the President ratifying a law that conflicts with the medical admission system and is contrary to the Supreme Court’s position on NEET. Mr. Stalin needs two things that may prove elusive: political backing from the Centre and judicial support.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/can-stalin-succeed-where-aiadmk-failed/article36444651.ece

14 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Book exploring Adyar’s history released||Amazing Adyar , a book compiling select articles written by historian and author K.R.A. Narasiah, was released at an event recently. The articles were written by him between 2013 and 2020, and published in the neighbourhood newspaper Adyar Times . The 400-page book, published by the Palaniappa Brothers, is divided into three parts — the great institutions of Adyar, the social service organisations and the personalities who lived and live in the locality. Launching the book, N. Ram, Director, The Hindu  Publishing Group (THG), said the origins of the book were very interesting, and they take one back to a very good tradition of local journalism. He said he was struck by the comprehensiveness of the book and that the author had not missed any details. He recalled various institutions and personalities, including S. Balasubramanian, former editor, Ananda Vikatan; agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan; and historian and scholar Iravatham Mahadevan. Historian V. Sriram, who received the first copy of the book, said historian S. Muthiah had the highest opinion of Mr. Narasiah, and the two of them collaborated on a coffee table book on the 125 years of the Madras Port Trust. On the topic of the book, he recalled that Mr. Muthiah would say that every locality had a history, a story to be told and documented, and that this book covered a huge gap as far as Adyar was concerned. He said so much effort had gone into the documentation of Adyar as a neighbourhood. Responding, Mr. Narasiah narrated how he was inducted into this project by S.P. Ambrose, a former civil servant and founder of Adyar Times . He said how it was easy to write about some of the great men and women of Adyar since he had met and interacted with some of them closely. S. Janakan, managing editor, Adyar Times , welcomed the gathering and Swathi, editor, conducted the proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/book-exploring-adyars-history-released/article36444657.ece

Although the announcement was made in March last year by the AIADMK government, it had not tabled a Bill to give effect to the announcement. The Bill was introduced by Minister Duraimurugan (also holding legislature portfolio) in the House in line with the announcement made in this regard by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin earlier during this session. On March 24 last year, the then Chief Minister announced that the the lump sum allowance payable to the family of an MLA would be enhanced from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh. He announced that the pension payable to former MLAs and former MLCs would be enhanced from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 25,000. The family pension payable to the legal heir of the deceased MLAs and MLCs would be enhanced from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 12,500, the Chief Minister had announced: “The above monetary benefits will be given with effect from April 1, 2020.” The sitting and former members of the Legislative Assembly and former members of the Legislative Council, while travelling along with spouse or companion in any air conditioned bus by any transport corporation owned by the State Government, a sleeper facility shall be provided to such members and a seating facility shall be provided to the spouse or companion in that bus, he had announced. Responding to the Leader of the House Duraimurugan, who expressed the desire of the MLAs, the Chief Minister said the MLAs themselves could decide on spending the Constituency Development Fund. As for the demand for a hike in the salary of MLAs, Mr. Duraimurugan said it was not advisable at a time when the country was experiencing a pandemic. “It can be raised again,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pension-to-former-mlas-mlcs-increased/article36444673.ece

Sivagnanam made the observations in an interim order passed on a writ petition filed by Henri Tiphagne, executive director of People’s Watch, a human rights organisation based in Madurai. The litigant had complained of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) not having taken any serious action and having closed the inquiry in October 2018 itself. NHRC report After perusing the NHRC’s report filed in a sealed cover, the judges said the commission had recommended enhancement of compensation to the families of the deceased as well as those who had suffered injuries. However, since the report was not made public to avoid possible influence on CBI probe and might not have been forwarded to the State government too, the recommendations were not implemented, they added. Directing the Registry to share copies of NHRC report with Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan, Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram and the writ petitioner, the Bench said: “The State government should consider a realistic quantum of compensation… The State government is requested to play the real parental role in providing counselling and psychiatric assistance to the members of the bereaved families, if necessary.” It went on to state that “the State government must be seen to be with the families of the victims and not an adversary, despite whatever may have happened.” Since the NHRC had reported that a plea by Mr. Tiphagne to reopen the inquiry was under its consideration, the Bench called for the status of such re-inquiry within four weeks. In its counter, the NHRC said it had closed the inquiry into the issue since the government, had on its own, paid a compensation of Rs. 20 lakh each to the bereaved families. It further pointed out that the CBI as well as a Commission of Inquiry appointed by the State government had begun probing the incident. Denying that it had not condemned the incident at all, the NHRC said, it’s action in having taken suo motu cognisance of the incident on the very next day itself amounted to condemning the incident in strong terms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cbi-must-probe-reasons-for-thoothukudi-firing-hc/article36444681.ece
14 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Conditional waiver of jewel loans||The DMK government, which had earlier put on hold the implementation of the jewel loan scheme announced by the AIADMK regime, citing various irregularities, on Monday announced the waiving of loans for under five sovereigns of mortgaged gold, subject to certain criteria. Preliminary estimates suggest that the State exchequer will incur an expenditure of about Rs. 6,000 crore towards waiving of the loans. “The government feels that only the eligible poor and downtrodden should benefit from the waiving of jewel loans. So in a few cases, among those who have obtained jewel loans for below five sovereigns of gold, it is felt that there is no need to waive them,” Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said in a suo motu statement in the Assembly. Detailed operational guidelines in this regard will be issued by the Cooperation Department in a day or two. For instance, in case of those who have benefitted from the waiving of farm loans in 2021, if members of the same family have obtained jewel loans, either from one or more cooperative units in a district or from such units in multiple districts; and for those who have obtained multiple jewel loans for gold above five sovereigns or those who have misused the Antyodaya Anna Yojana cards or those who used it to obtain loans, “it will not be possible to waive such loans,” he said. The waiving of loans for under five sovereigns of gold was among the promises made in the DMK’s Assembly election manifesto, he said. Mr. Stalin’s announcement follows a detailed analysis of jewel loans taken across the State over the past month. Malicious intent “It was found that loans were obtained in a few districts soon after the announcement was made in the election manifesto, with a malicious intention to wrongfully benefit from the scheme. This government will initiate action against societies involved in these irregularities,” Mr. Stalin said. Steps will also be taken to ensure that these cooperative units function in a transparent and efficient manner to benefit poor farmers and the middle class, he said. Mr. Stalin said cooperative units were monitored properly with end-to-end computerisation and core-banking facilities to provide services efficiently. He recalled Cooperation Minister I. Periyasamy’s statement in the House that farm loans to the tune of Rs. 2,749.10 crore, obtained by 2,42,783 people, were “wrongfully” waived during the erstwhile AIADMK regime. Mr. Periyasamy had said that several irregularities were also found in waiving jewel loans, and the State government would make a decision on the issue after thoroughly scrutinising all jewel loans.  The waiving of loans for under five sovereigns of gold was among the promises made in the DMK’s Assembly election manifesto M.K.

14 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||How the normalisation of marks works||The Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021, adopted by the Assembly on Monday, seeks to provide admissions to undergraduate medical programmes to students based on their marks in the qualifying exam [Class XII] through “normalisation” methods. How will the marks obtained by students from different Boards of education be normalised? Marks obtained by them in the relevant subjects in the qualifying exams conducted by various Boards will be equated with the marks obtained by them in the same subjects in the qualifying examination conducted by the State Board through the method of normalisation. Under the method of normalisation, the highest marks obtained by students from various Boards, in each subject, is equated with the highest marks obtained by students of the State Board in that subject, and the relative marks obtained by others in the subject is determined accordingly. For instance, if the highest mark secured by a student of the State Board in physics is 100 and the highest mark secured by a student of any other Board in the same subject is 96, “both the highest marks will be considered equal to 100,” according to the Bill passed in the House. “If a student of the other Board secures 80 marks in physics, when the top mark in physics in the same board is 96, the 80 marks will be considered to be equal to 83.33 marks (100X80/96 = 83.33%),” it said. This was the formula that was followed prior to 2017 after the abolition of entrance tests to professional courses in Tamil Nadu. After the normalisation of marks in the relevant subjects in the qualifying examination, the qualified students will be merged into a common merit list. “In cases where more than one student has got the same marks in the merit list, the inter-se merit among such students will be determined in such manner as may be prescribed by the rules made under this Act,” it said. The appropriate authority will prepare the rank list for admitting students to the government seats, and allot students through centralised counselling. Admissions to government seats will be made following the rule of reservation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/how-the-normalisation-of-marks-works/article36444646.ece

Annadurai on September 15, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin announced in the Assembly on Monday. During his reply to the debate on the demand for grants for the Police Department, Mr. Stalin said the government would take steps to commute the sentence of 700 life convicts and grant them premature release on humanitarian grounds, as a gesture of goodwill.

14 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rule 110 statements by AIADMK govt. were for publicity, says Minister||Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Monday termed most of the suo motu announcements made under Rule110 in the Legsilative Assembly by the AIADMK Chief Ministers in the past 10 years were against fiscal prudence and were more for publicity than for any real outcome. Presenting a status of announcements made by the Chief Ministers from 2011-12 to 2020-21, Mr. Rajan said 1,704 announcements made involving projects at an estimated cost Rs. 3.27 lakh crore. “Out of this, 1,167 announcements have been implemented at a cost of Rs. 87,405 crore. Remaining 537 announcements involving an estimated cost of Rs. 2.40 lakh crore are pending. Only orders have been issued and work remains incomplete in respect of most of these pending announcements,” he said. “Out of 537 pending announcements, 26 announcements at an estimated cost of Rs. 5,470 crore have been made on the floor of the Legislative Assembly under Rule 110 without taking into account the feasibility of their implementation. These announcements have subsequently been dropped,” Mr. Rajan pointed out. He said 19 out of these 26 dropped announcements were made between 2011-12 and 2016-17. Pending announcements “Out of the 537 pending announcements, orders were not issued for 20 announcements involving an estimated cost of Rs. 9,741 crore. Orders or instructions have been issued in respect of 491 out of 537 pending announcements. However, funds were not released and work not started in respect of 143 announcements, though necessary orders were issued allocating Rs. 76,619 crore funds,” the Finance Minister said. In respect of 511 pending announcements with an estimated cost Rs. 2,34,282 crore (excluding 26 dropped announcements), only Rs. 45,251 crore had been released, which amounts to 19% of the estimated cost. “A total of 348 announcements with an estimated cost of Rs. 1,47,922 crore are pending for which orders/instructions have been issued but the required funds were not fully released.

14 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Delay in submission of papers resulted in non-settlement of dues, says CAG||Delay in submission of the completion report for railway bridge works resulted in non-settlement of dues amounting to Rs. 120.63 crore to the State Highways Department, according to a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India for the year ending 31 March, 2019 that was tabled in the Assembly. According to the report for the revenue and economic sectors placed in the House, the delay in reimbursement of claims in respect of 89 completed railway bridge works resulted in the blocking of State funds amounting to Rs. 120.63 crore. About Rs. 101.87 crore towards completed works and Rs. 18.76 crore towards incomplete works were not settled. The report said that in the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, shortcomings in the maintenance of financial statements and the release of excess grants of Rs. 178.18 crore during 2016-17 to 2018-19 continued despite the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) indicating inadequate compliance and absence of corrective measures for more than 10 years. The available funds were also not utilised by the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University to achieve its objectives. There was a shortfall of 6% to 12% during 2016-17 to 2018-19 in admission of students in the constituent colleges, a shortage of laboratory equipment, vacancies in faculty posts and inadequate student-faculty ratio, which hindered the imparting of quality education to students, it pointed out. “Machinery purchased for research were lying unused for want of adequate power supply. Delay in completion of research projects, including publication of papers, led to non-achievement of envisaged objectives. The patents were not filed properly and no system was in place to ensure collection of royalty,” the CAG said. Non-publication of the results of research projects deprived the farming community of the benefits of the research. “There were gaps in implementation of extension activities, including training, and machinery procured for extension activities remained unutilised, leading to non-achievement of the envisaged objectives,” it added. As for State excise, the audit noticed violations of licence conditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delay-in-submission-of-papers-resulted-in-non-settlement-of-dues-says-cag/article36444674.ece
14 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Pantry to be opened on every floor of RGGGH||A pantry has been set up on every floor of tower 1 and 2 of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) to help patients’ attendants have their meals in hygienic conditions. With an in-patient strength of nearly 3,400, each patient is accompanied by at least one or two attendants at the hospital. These attendants usually have their meals sitting on the floor near wards. In a move to change this, the authorities have created dining spaces for them on every floor of the two tower blocks, and will soon expand to other buildings as well. “Attendants sit on the floor in different areas of the blocks to have their meals, and often leave food waste behind. This makes cleaning and garbage collection difficult. Dumping of food particles can lead to pest and rodent menace. So to ensure that they have an earmarked space for dining and to maintain cleanliness, we have set up pantries on each of the six floors of tower 1 and tower 2. We have set up pantries in the waiting halls of both the blocks,” E. Theranirajan, Dean of the hospital, said. The pantries would be inaugurated by patient attendants on Wednesday. Such facilities will come up in other blocks, including super speciality, nephrology, urology, cardiology-cardio thoracic waiting halls and neurology waiting halls, he said. The pantries will be open from 7.30 a.m. to 10 a.m. for breakfast, noon to 2 p.m. for lunch and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. for dinner. Besides seats, drinking water and hand wash facilities have been provided. Garbage bins have been placed to dump the wet waste. “We have posted supervisors to open the pantries at the specified timings, and another staff for refilling drinking water,” Dr. Theranirajan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pantry-to-be-opened-on-every-floor-of-rgggh/article36444667.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu passed the order while disposing of a PIL petition filed by advocate B. Ramkumar Adityan of Thoothukudi. The litigant said the safety of air passengers could not be ensured if they did not understand the safety instructions. Recorded voices  He said the airlines could use recorded voices in multiple languages to educate passengers about the safety measures that they must follow while flying. It might not cost much to utilise such recorded voices but such a move would go a long way in saving lives, the litigant said. He said the flight safety instruction cards must be printed in all languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.

14 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Heavy rain forecast in Western Ghats||Rainfall activity over the State may be largely restricted to a few districts, particularly those along the Western Ghats for the next few days as the southwest monsoon becomes vigorous in other States. The India Meteorological Department has forecast that heavy rains may occur at one or two places over the Nilgiris, Coimbatore, Theni and Dindigul districts for two days and thunderstorms are set to continue for two or three days. On Tuesday, Western Ghats and adjoining places such as Salem, Namakkal, Kallakurichi and north coastal parts may receive light to moderate rain. Some delta districts may get rains on Wednesday. Officials said there may be a slight increase in rainfall from Thursday as weather models indicate scattered rainfall over the State and Puducherry. On Monday, a few weather stations, including Valparai and Udhagamandalam, received mild rains till 5.30 p.m. No impact The deep depression over the north coastal Odisha would not have any direct impact over the State and dry weather may prevail over several districts until the system weakens. However, the districts along Western Ghats would continue to rain for two or three days as the weather system would draw up moisture. Some other parts of the State have a chance of rainfall due to convective activity triggered by strong southwesterlies, said the officials. Light rain may occur in some areas of Chennai too till Wednesday. The department predicts partly cloudy sky and a maximum temperature of 34 degree Celsius. On Monday, Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded slightly above normal temperature of 35.1 degree Celsius and 35.3 degree Celsius.

Stalin in the Assembly on Monday. He announced that an online complaint filing mechanism would be created, besides launching a mobile-based application for people to register grievances with the police. Experts will be hired to deal with offences involving banks, employment and other online crimes, he said.

Stalin, who made 14 announcements in connection with the 100th death anniversary of national poet Subramania Bharathi, said that his ideas were relevant even to this day. “His ideas live beyond his time. He is still relevant today.

Recalling former Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai’s words that Bharathi’s path was not just to drive away the British but to eradicate all evils that plagued the country in order to create a new society, Mr. Stalin said Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) bought the poet’s house in Ettayapuram, and converted it into a memorial.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bharathis-ideas-live-beyond-his-time/article36444658.ece

While six patients received transcatheter valve implants during the workshop, one of them had a condition called corrected transposition of the great arteries, in which the two ventricles in the heart are reversed. K. Sivakumar, head of paediatric cardiology, said the condition resulted in the tricuspid valve of the heart facing high systemic ventricular pressure. “This made the precise position of the implant very challenging,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/complex-heart-therapy-performed/article36444661.ece

Stalin on Monday said the party would continue its fight to abolish NEET till the end, and bring back education to the State list. “The DMK government has started the legal fight to abolish NEET. We will continue to fight till the end, on all forums, including the Assembly, Parliament, courts and the public forum, along with our [political] partners who are focused on ensuring social justice,” he wrote to party cadre, ahead of the DMK ‘ Mupperum vizha - 2021’ on September 15, which will be held via video conferencing. Mr. Stalin said the ‘ Mupperum vizha’ would focus on highlighting the achievements of the DMK government and thank the party cadre for ensuring the party a big victory in the Assembly election. He said despite a difficult financial situation, a lot of announcements had been made across departments. TNCC president K.S. Alagiri lauded Mr. Stalin for getting the Bill to “dispense” with NEET passed in the Assembly. He said the DMK government must move quickly to get the assent of the President to the Bill and get it enacted into a law. He accused the AIADMK of being anti-people, as the erstwhile regime remained silent for two years on the fact that the NEET Bill, passed in the Assembly, was not granted assent by the President. State BJP president K. Annamalai said the DMK was fooling the people on the issue of NEET. According to him, NEET was to protect social justice, provide opportunities to poor students and prevent the sale of medical seats by colleges. He said NEET was brought in by the Congress-DMK alliance and the law was enacted when a DMK MP was the Union Minister of State for Health.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-fight-till-the-end-to-abolish-neet/article36444799.ece

It has also ordered that similar time limit be fixed for removing portraits of political or communal leaders from the dashboards failing which the officials should remove the portraits, kept facing outside to exert influence, and fine the vehicle owners. Justices N. Kirubakaran (since retired) and B. Pugalendhi also ordered the conduct of random vehicle checks to remove dazzling and excessively bright motor vehicle lights that do not comply with the rules, and obstruct the view of motorists travelling on the opposite side. The vehicle owners must also be given two months’ time to fix their vehicle number plates in accordance with rules. Further, the National Highways Authority of India was directed to ensure that all highways were well lit. The directions were issued while disposing of a writ petition which complained of law students using lawyers’ stickers on their vehicles. Sharing the petitioner’s concerns, the judges said many vehicles with political party flags, portraits of leaders, advocate and press stickers were said to be involved in criminal activities. “The purpose of having party flags or designation boards or portraits of party/communal leaders or advocate/press stickers is only to keep away the police away,” the Bench said. Writing the judgment, Justice Kirubakaran said: “It has become an order of the day in Tamil Nadu that almost 50% of the vehicles either have party flags or designation boards or portraits of party/communal leaders or advocate/press stickers. This menace has to be addressed failing which the criminal activities will continue to be committed by the above modus operandi.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/remove-dark-film-from-car-windows/article36444682.ece

Subramanian has sought 50 lakh additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines every week for Tamil Nadu from the Union Health Ministry. This will enable the State government to vaccinate all eligible population by October 31, besides administering the second dose. Mr. Subramanian wrote to Union Minister for Health Mansukh L. Mandaviya on Monday stating that the State government vaccinated a record 28.91 lakh eligible persons during the mega camp on Sunday.

14 September 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore Corpn. engages NGO to improve revenue mobilisation||To improve revenue collection, accounting practices and look at ways it can widen its tax net, the Coimbatore Corporation has engaged Bengaluru-based Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy. Corporation Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said the first aspect that Janaagraha would be working on was improving revenue collection. One of the ways identified for doing so was to make the tax collection exercise as a competition among bill collectors. This was a practice followed in a few urban local bodies in other States and perhaps in Chennai. Janaagraha sources said by motivating bill collectors, equipping them with point of sale machines and even giving them uniforms, the Corporation would encourage to them to collect tax and reward the highest tax collectors. For this the Corporation should also improve its data collection system and look at maintaining bill collector-wise data. The second aspect was bettering the way the civic body maintained its accounting system. Mr. Sunkara said the civic body adopted a complicated system of maintaining its books, which needed to be improved within the rules the State Government prescribed. The supervising officers should be able to easily trace where how much money the civic body had spent, he said and added that Janaagraha would suggest ways for the improvement. The third aspect that the non-government organisation would be working on was on the legal and political framework that civic bodies like the Coimbatore Corporation functioned. Though the Coimbatore Corporation would not be able to change the framework as it fell within the State Government’s prerogative, it would nevertheless share its observations and suggestions, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corpn-engages-ngo-to-improve-revenue-mobilisation/article36444711.ece

The farmers demanded that the Government give up the move to shift the certification office that had served farmers in the Nilgiris, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode and a few other districts for over 50 years. The farmers said that by shifting the office to Chennai, the Government would be forcing the farmers to travel to Chennai to have their seed-related or crop-related grievances redressed. The move would also affect over 800 employees. It would only be appropriate if the Government gave up the move because the office would continue to be a part of agriculture-related establishments in Coimbatore, starting with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. The farmers submitted a petition to the district administration, to be forwarded to the Chief Minister and Agriculture Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-oppose-move-to-shift-seed-certification-office/article36444691.ece
14 September 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Masakalipalayam Corporation school goes digital||Coimbatore Corporation Middle School in Masakalipalayam has gone digital with Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara launching the ‘My School Diary’ mobile application on Monday. Developed by the My School Diary company and customised and given free of cost to the school as a part of its CSR activity, the application will help students attend online classes, submit homework and avail leave. It will help the teachers conduct classes, give instructions to students, correct homework and test papers, record attendance, etc., and the school heads to supervise all academic activity, says the school teacher P. Sakthivel. The app also helps the parents monitor their children’s attendance. The exercise to develop a customised application for the school started in 2020 and resumed in 2021 because of the COVID-19 lockdown, says company Director R. Prem Kumar. The application, which comes in English and Tamil on android and iOS platforms, makes teachers’ task easier, as it spares them from repetitive tasks such as recording marks in various registers. It also helps teachers/school heads issue circulars to students who continue to learn from home and hand out assignments, says Mr. Sakthivel. As each student submits homework or test papers, the ‘My School Diary’ app saves the same in a cloud sparing the teachers of the need to save these in their mobile phones or computers. This was a memory-consuming process and the teachers were forced to delete corrected home works and assignments every now and then to free up memory, he adds. Mr. Kumar says as the data gets saved in cloud, the teachers can recall the records anytime during an academic year. This is true of the mobile application that the company had sold to schools in several parts of the country as well, he says. The Corporation school has installed the application in the mobile phones of over 80% of its 500-odd students and has also trained the parents, Mr. Sakthivel says. At the launch, the Commissioner asked teachers to use the app extensively and provide a feedback for the civic body to roll it out for other Corporation schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/masakalipalayam-corporation-school-goes-digital/article36444701.ece

Speaking to mediapersons in Tiruppur, he highlightedthe death of Dhanush (19) from Salem districthours before appearing for NEET on Sunday and urged all students to not take the extreme step. “At the same time, the Central government must understand the feelings of students,” he said. Responding to the remarks made by Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami accusing the DMK government of not providing a clear reply whether the examination would be held this year, Mr. Balakrishnan alleged that Mr. Palaniswami was attempting to abdicate responsibility as he did not ensure exemption from NEET during his tenure as the Chief Minister. Mr. Balakrishnan expressed hope that the State government would ensure the exemption from NEET next year. Criticising the National Monetisation Pipeline of the Central government, Mr. Balakrishnan alleged that the project would lead to the shutdown of several government sectors and that ordinary citizens would be adversely impacted by this privatisation push. The Central and State governments must prevent the closing down of the Ford plant in Chennai to prevent job losses. Work to establish an ESI Hospital in Tiruppur must be expedited, he urged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-adamant-on-continuing-with-neet/article36444692.ece

14 September 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||Synagogue street in Kochi to get a facelift||The historic street at Jew Town in Mattancherry, Kochi, leading to the 450-year-old Paradesi Synagogue will shortly be paved using cobble stones, while a duct is being readied at the centre of the road to carry power cables and other utilities. The work is being done as part of the Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) project to upgrade roads and drains at Mattancherry and Fort Kochi heritage towns. The agency decided to include the street that ends at the synagogue in the purview of works in Jew Town following demands from heritage enthusiasts, sources said. “Semi-polished cobble stones will be laid on the street for tourists and others who walk to the synagogue, while polished cobble stones will be laid on one side for wheelchair access. Polished stones on the entire stretch could result in visitors slipping and falling during rainy weather. It was decided to ready a duct through the centre of the street which is flanked on either side by heritage buildings. Trenching the sides of the lane for duct or drain work could affect their structural stability,” they added. Heeding to demand from local residents and traders, CSML will install cast iron street lights in keeping with the town’s heritage status. The rest of the roads in Jew Town will be black-topped once work on drains is completed. They will be topped using dense bituminous macadam (DBM) by the end of September, it is learnt. Welcoming CSML scooping out the street’s surface to lay cobble stones, Thaha Ibrahim, a close aide of the iconic Jew Sarah Cohen who lived at her house beside the lane until her death in 2019, said it would help retain the level, preventing rainwater from entering houses and shops in the vicinity. “Remnants of roof tiles that could date back to over 400 years were discovered when the centre of the stretch was trenched by around two feet. The tiles follow a pattern that was in use in West Asia and will have many stories to narrate,” he said. Meanwhile, CSML has promised that all road and drain work in Fort Kochi, barring construction of half-a-dozen smart roads, would be completed by the year-end. “We are unable to re-tender pending work to upgrade K.B. Jacob Road and a few other roads into smart roads, since the contracting firm has procured an order from the Kerala High Court permitting it time till October,” sources in CSML said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/synagogue-street-in-kochi-to-get-a-facelift/article36444485.ece

14 September 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||GRH performs high precision radiation||Doctors at Government Rajaji Hospital have successfully treated a youth who reported with a benign but inoperable brain tumour with pencil-precision radiation that has same efficacy as surgery and spares the normal tissues around from getting affected. The procedure - High Precision Stereotactic Radiotherapy (HPSR) - was performed on a 24-year-old youth from Ramanathapuram in six sittings. He was discharged on Saturday with no other complication. The treatment using linear accelerator true beam machine was given for the first time in any government hospital in Tamil Nadu, according to the GRH Dean A Rathinavel. The state-of-the-art equipment costing Rs. 22 crore was installed last September. GRH is one of the nine centres in the State to have this equipment. Explaining the procedure, radiation oncology head P. K. Baskaran said that the patient had a history of epileptic seizures. He was on anti-epileptic medication for the last 15 years at different hospitals in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. Recently, when the frequency of his fits increased, he came to GRH last month and was diagnosed with Arteriovenous malformation. “Though the growth was benign, it was critically positioned below the brain (in right parieto occipital area) and performing conventional surgery in the delicate area could have increased the risk of permanent neurological damage,” Dr. Baskar told The Hindu.  Though surgery is the primary modality for tumours, in critical cases depending on the location, radiation is used for necrosis of the tissue, he explained and added, the normal radiotherapy would have taken 45 days because of the small dose of radiation given to minimise the impact on surrounding tissues. With HPSR, the patient was spared from hospitalisation, number of sittings and side-effects. Action was taken at the right time or the tumor could have progressed into malignancy, he said. The patient will be under six months observation for a number of seizure episodes, which the doctors say will drastically reduce or permanently go away. In the last one year at GRH Regional Cancer Centre, Balarengapuram, the high-end conformal radiation has been done on 1,200 patients with breast, cervix, oesophagus, lungs and other cancers free of cost under the Chief Minister's Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme, the Dean said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/grh-performs-high-precision-radiation/article36445021.ece
14 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Payment of fine under e-challan system made easy||Tamil Nadu Police have brought in a major change in collection of fine from traffic rules violators by including digital wallets and anywhere payment method wherein the fine can be paid anywhere in the State under e-challan payment system . When e-challan was introduced two years ago, the payment was only through debit or credit card, and through e-service centres. However, people found it difficult to pay the fine through the limited options of payment. It had to be done immediately through the hand-held devices with the police officers or through e-service centres. “The problem was that the payment through hand-held devices was limited to 24 hours on issuing the e-challan. Thereafter, even the same officer cannot accept the money from the violator on whom he had imposed the fine ,” a traffic police official said. “When we analysed the lower realisation of fine over a period, we found that there were a lot of hitches in making the payment,” Commissioner of Police Prem Anand Sinha said. People were hesitant to pay the fine at e-service centres as they first had to find one and also pay a stipulated commission. After Madurai City Police Commissioner flagged the issue, the State police have introduced additional means of payment and opened the system across the State. “Now, people have an array of choices like debit card, credit card, Internet banking, and other modes like GPay, PayTM, PhonePe to make their payment,” Mr. Sinha said. People can pay the fine imposed by any district or city police anywhere in the State. “It is mutually beneficial as people will be able to pay the fine without much difficulty and our men will be able to collect the pending fine at the earliest,” Mr. Sinha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/payment-of-fine-under-e-challan-system-made-easy/article36445026.ece
14 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||A job is all this man needs||B. Byrosh Khan, a 34-year old differently abled man, submitted a petition at the Collectorate here on Monday, seeking any form of temporary employment from the government, as he was struggling to take care of his three-year old daughter, along with his wife, during the pandemic. He said, “I have had no job for the past five years. The pandemic has made things worse. I do not even have money to buy milk and food for my daughter on a day-to-day basis. I am completely dependent on my elder brother for my finances. As I am a B.Com. degree holder, along with Diploma in Computer Applications, I request the government to provide me with some form of employment opportunity, with a minimal salary. I have been been coming to the Collectorate on for the past three Mondays, hoping to hand over my petition directly to the Collector, but my efforts were in vain.” Mr. Khan became 75% disabled due to polio at a very young age. After finishing school and college studies, with the support of his parents, friends, and elder brother, he worked as a computer operator with a medical agency for about two years since 2009. “Later I was employed on a contract-basis as a data entry operator with the Corporation till 2015. After that, I could not find any job. There is no opportunity to do any business also, as I do not have the finances for it. No bank comes forward to provide us with loans, as they assume we will never pay them back. I feel like a burden to my own family and the society,” he said. He added that they were mostly dependent on free groceries provided by volunteers in their area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-job-is-all-this-man-needs/article36445017.ece
14 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Tamil is a language of Gods, says court||‘Tamil is not only one of the earliest ancient languages of the world, but also a language of the Gods,’ the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed. It has directed the State government to constitute a committee comprising Tamil scholars, devotees and believers of God to identify and consolidate the important and ancient Tamil hymns composed by Saints like Nayanmars and Alwars, Arunagirinathar, Pattinathar and other Siddhars. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran (since retired) and B. Pugalendhi observed that the committee formed should make consultations with experts and all other stakeholders connected with temples and file a report to the government. The State government shall take decision regarding the date from which ‘kudamuzhukku’ would be conducted in Tamil or equal importance is given to Tamil along with Sanskrit. The court said that the committee should be reconstituted periodically so that if any other worthy hymns are found, they could also be recited along with other verses which are recited at the time of performing ‘kudamuzhukku.’ The court observed that the issue of using Tamil hymns/verses is a long pending demand by the devotees as well as Tamil enthusiasts. Even the policy makers who have been ruling the State from the year 1967 onwards are also interested in making use of Tamil in all the fields. The temples play an important role in the spiritual spheres. It is a place to get peace of mind. The places of worship are meant for spreading peace and love, the judges said. However, in our country, it is made to believe that Sanskrit alone is God's language and no other language is equivalent. No doubt, Sanskrit is an ancient language with enormous ancient literature. The belief is spread in such a way that only if the Sanskrit vedas are recited, the Gods will listen to the prayers of the devotees, the judges said. The court said that every language spoken by the people is God's language. Man cannot create a language. Languages have existed for centuries together and passed on from one generation to another. There can only be improvement in the existing language and there cannot be any creation of language. The court disposed of the petition filed by D. Ponnusamy of Chennai. The petitioner had sought a direction to the authorities concerned to conduct the consecration ceremony of the Kalyana Pasupatheeswarar Temple in Karur by chanting verses in Tamil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-tamil-is-an-ancient-language-and-a-language-of-the-gods/article36444779.ece

K. Muthupandi, the State vice-president of Themmangu Folk Artistes Welfare Association, who led the protest, said, “Folk art forms such as ‘karagattam,’ ‘themmangu,’ ‘Naiyandi Melam,’ ‘oyilattam’ and many other traditional art forms have gone down over time. We have no stages to perform and are unemployed round the year during the pandemic. As a result of unemployment, even leading folk artistes in a village are losing their respect in the society. We want the government to take steps to help us and our families.” Age factor They asked the government to provide a special COVID-19 relief assistance to folk artistes and decrease the age for pension provided to them from 60 to 50 for men and 45 for women. “As we cross the age of 45, most of us are not invited to perform for functions. If the pension is provided early, it would help us. We also want a free bus pass for travelling across the state, as we cannot even afford to pay for bus tickets,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/folk-artistes-from-across-madurai-district-seek-covid-19-assistance/article36445024.ece
14 September 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Establish NIMHANS-like institutions in all zones’||In order to address mental health issues, a Central health institution like NIMHANS must be established in each zone of the country, observed the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. “It is shocking to note that India is the most depressed country in the world,” observed the court taking cognisance of a WHO report. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran (since retired) and B. Pugalendhi observed that for a country like India with a population of 136 crore having 47 mental health hospitals was not enough. There was an acute shortage of psychiatrists and child psychiatrists. There was a need for every medical college to have a Department of Psychiatry, the judges said. The court said efforts should be made to have a psychiatrist at every taluk-level headquarters hospital. Under Section 21(4) of the Mental Health Care Act, 2017, there was a provision for insurance coverage for mental illnesses, but it was not known to the general public. The court said Karnataka had devised digital monitoring mechanisms to oversee District Mental Health Programme and the implementation of the Mental Healthcare Act. The Karnataka Mental Health Management System (e-Manas) was developed with provisions for registering mental health establishments and mental health professionals. The Central government and the State governments had to follow Karnataka’s e-Manas. When WHO stated that India was the most depressed country in the world, it was the duty of the Central government along with all the State governments to have a comprehensive coordinate action plan, the court said. The court said the patients had to be rehabilitated properly and to identify new patients there should be a periodical medical survey. There must be coordination between the State and Central governments to give proper mental health care to the masses, the court said and disposed of the petition filed by K.R. Raja of Madurai. The petitioner had sought a direction to provide mental health care facilities in the central prisons in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/establish-nimhans-like-institutions-in-all-zones/article36444802.ece

Pugalendhi said the State government could constitute a committee comprising officials of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation, ADGP Civil Supplies CID, Commissioner of Civil Supplies and Registrar of Cooperative Societies.

Earlier, the court had sought a response from the State government on the functioning of the public distribution system after it was informed that the rice distributed through PDS was not consumable by humans. Senior counsel Kathirvelu, representing a petitioner accused of illegally transporting PDS rice, told the court that ration cardholders got the rice from the ration shops and sold them.

Velankanni has hotels and lodges caterng to pilgrims of diverse economic background. While large hotels where over 100 people are employed have had to downsize, small lodges are having to down their shutters. Speaking toThe Hindu, Juliet Arpudharaj, president, Velankanni Lodge Owners Association, said all businesses depending upon the church for survival have taken a severe hit. “The peak season is May, when children have summer holidays, and in September, during the annual feast. Even small lodges used to earn in lakhs on those 14 days, but it has all come to a standstill," she said. The owners are unable to borrow from anyone else because the entire town is debt-ridden. In ordinary times, the two-km radius around the church would be lined with small street vendors selling snacks, rosaries and souvenirs and puffed rice. While most vendors had not returned to the streets in over 18 months, some were hoping to sell during the feast season. “With the church also closed, people only drive up to it, pray outside the gates and go back. We were allowed to open after September 11, but there is no use now,” a hotel owner said. Because of being locked up for so long, generators, air-conditioning systems and other appliances need repair. Maintenance work too is needed, the owners said. Office-bearers of Velankanni Lodge Owners Association wrote letters to the State government and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking help last year. “We wrote to them seeking financial assistance for repair of our appliances but got no response. So this time around, we did not write to anybody,” Ms. Arpudharaj said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hotels-lodges-restaurants-bear-brunt-of-covid-19-norms-in-velankanni/article36444777.ece
14 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Vice-President stresses on need for removal of caste barriers||Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Monday stressed on the need to remove “artificially” created caste barriers and gender discrimination from Indian society. Inaugurating the Puducherry Technological University following the upgradation of Pondicherry Engineering College, the Vice-President said institutions should play a role in removing “the artificial barriers in the name of caste, gender and social discrimination.” Stressing on the need for innovation, Mr. Naidu said nations had developed because of their focus on cutting edge technologies. Institutions should encourage students to innovate and increase interface with industries for better outcome, he added. Even after several years of Independence, 23% of the people were living below the poverty line and 20% were illiterates. The country should focus on literacy programmes, he added. Pointing to the initiatives of the Centre to develop the start-up sector, the Vice-President said there had been encouraging response from the youth with a large number of women taking leadership role. The innovation of youngsters was visible during the pandemic with many people developing ventilators and other medical equipment, he said. New Heights “India today is scaling new heights in the fields of entrepreneurship and innovation. Today, we have the world’s largest start-up ecosystem. Data from the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade suggests that we have over 50,000 start-ups spread across 623 districts in the country,” he said. In the year 2020-21 itself, over 16,000 start-ups were recognised. With the government opening up the space sector for private players, more than 40 tech start-ups were working in the field of satellites, launch vehicles and other space-based applications, Mr Naidu said. “It is a matter of great joy that leadership teams of 45% start-ups have a woman entrepreneur. This is a healthy trend which will inspire more women to become entrepreneurs,” he said. He also urged institutions to encourage students to focus on research so as to address contemporary issues such as climate change. Even developed countries such as the United States were confronting the problem of flood and forest fire, he added. Mr. Naidu also called upon State governments to frame school syllabus to impart knowledge about local heroes who contributed towards nation building. “Institutions should focus on research and out-of-the-box ideas. Innovation is important for the progress of the country and for making people more happy,” he said. On the upgradation of PEC into a university, Mr.Naidu said the college had already created a name in the education sector. The conversion of the college to a university would help in collaborating with other institutions and industries. Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, Chief Minister N. Rangasamy, Speaker R.

This preference for solar plants and solar energy among institutions and people was a very good and welcome sign. Referring to the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, he said it cautioned about the rise in global temperature exceeding 1.5 degrees celsius. “Climate change is not a futuristic phenomenon and we are already experiencing it. The next few years are going to be very crucial for our collective action to mitigate climate change,” he said. Noting that India was endowed with vast solar potential, the Vice-President said the National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) had assessed the country’s solar potential to be about 748 GW, assuming 3% of the wasteland area to be covered by solar PV modules. This was a great opportunity waiting to be explored to provide reliable electricity to our remote areas, to reduce carbon emissions and to achieve energy security. India now had more than 40 GW of installed solar capacity thanks to sustained efforts by the government and private players. The country was ranked fifth globally in solar power capacity and was fast becoming the global leader in ‘energy transition’. “The country is now well placed to meet its committed renewable energy targets at the Paris Climate Conference by 2030,” he said. Mr. Naidu also advocated the need to reduce dependency on imported solar components and to achieve self-reliance in solar modules and solar cells. “We have to quickly ramp up production by easing the setting up of manufacturing plants, publicising the subsidy programmes by the government and encouraging small players. States must take an active lead in this regard,” he said. He also called upon universities to take up research work and projects on renewable energy. “My advice to educational institutions is to encourage students to take up final year projects and internships in the field of renewable energy and material sciences. This will not only improve their employment prospects but will also help in promoting innovations and improvements in the domestic solar industry.” Lt. Governor Tamilsai Soundararajan, Chief Minister N. Rangasamy and Speaker R. Selvam were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/green-energies-offer-viable-alternative-venkaiah-naidu/article36445104.ece

In a complaint to the Lt Governor and Chief Secretary, general secretary of HRCPS R. Muruganadham said the Health Department had replied to an RTI application that the government had incurred a loss of Rs. 45.31 lakh due to purchase of surplus medicine and equipment in 2019-20. The medicine and equipment had become outdated, he said. The actual loss was much higher than what the department had mentioned. No action was initiated other than barring the two local firms from supplying to the department for three years, he said. The Lt.

The works are expected to be completed in two months. The pristine Yercaud lake is one of the major tourist attractions in the hill station. The lake is spread over 12 acre and about 56 boats are operated in the lake for tourists. The boathouse services that were suspended following the lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic resumed only recently. As the lake maintenance works were affected due to the pandemic, about 50% of the lake got covered with water hyacinth, officials said. According to the boathouse operators, a contract has now been awarded for two months for an estimated cost Rs. 15 lakh to remove the water hyacinth from the lake and the works began at the end of August.

14 September 2021||SIVAGANGA,TAMIL NADU||MP wants counselling for students||Providing counselling to students prior to taking up competitive examinations would not only clear their apprehensions, but also prevent them from taking any extreme steps, said Congress MP Karti Chidambaram on Monday. Speaking to reporters here, he said while the Tamil Nadu government had tabled a Bill in the Assembly to dispense with NEET for UG medical admissions, the government should make counselling mandatory for the students taking any competitive examinations through trained counsellors. The government should simultaneously explore the possibilities through legal means to keep the NEET out and admit students through the plus-two marks as a qualification for higher education. Asked to comment on the mega vaccination campaign held across the State on Sunday, he said that while the government had better infrastructure to cover more number of people with the vaccine, the Centre should supply the vials without any delay. Thanking the Chief Minister M.K. Stalin for sanctioning a law college and Agricultural College in Karaikudi, Mr Karti said that he would represent to the government for bringing more such educational institutions to Sivaganga district. The government has just taken over the reins. The first Assembly session of the new government had come to a close only on Monday. The representations from the elected representatives would be given due importance by the CM, his cabinet colleagues and senior officials. To another query, he said that the people should be guarded against the covid-19 pandemic and the mega vaccination campaign should be a continuous process till all eligible persons had taken both the doses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-wants-counselling-for-students-taking-up-competitive-exams/article36444816.ece

The demand to save the profit-making petrol and diesel retailing unit serving the public at Pattukottai was raised at a gate demonstration organised by the union here. The demonstrators charged the officials with messing up with the functioning of the petrol retailing unit to help private bunk owners in the region. The petrol/diesel bunk operated by Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation at Pattukottai is among the three such public services offered by the corporation. The other two function at Mandarakuppam and at Tirupattur. The demonstrators, led by State general secretary, Nagarajan raised slogans urging TNCSC to move the paddy procured at direct purchase centres during the coming samba and thaladi seasons in order to ensure distribution of quality rice to the public through the public distribution system. ‘Transfer officials’ Urging the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation to transfer officials who had served in a zone for more than three years, they called upon the corporation not to make the field employees scapegoat for the mistakes that were not committed by them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/call-to-save-tncsc-fuel-retail-station-at-pattukottai/article36444783.ece

A separate burial ground exists for the Adi Dravidar community on Peravurani-Mudachikadu Road. The relatives of the deceased carry the body from the Adi Dravidar dwelling area at Veeriyankottai to the burial ground by crossing the irrigation channel to avoid a circuitous route to the burial ground. Carrying the body, accompanied by beating of drums and other customary practices, becomes difficult during farming season as the flow in the channel remains high throughout the period. On Monday, the body of Mahalingam, 50, of Adi Dravidar Street, Veeriyankottai, was carried in hip-deep water by his relatives and friends to reach the Mudachikadu Road burial ground, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-for-minor-bridge-surfaces-again/article36444784.ece
14 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||Bid to destroy communal amity, says Satheesan||Political sparring over Pala Bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt’s controversial sermon on ‘narcotic jihad’ intensified on Monday. In an open letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan expressed deep worry over what he termed as a well-entrenched “covert and overt” bid to destroy communal amity in Kerala. Without directly referring to the prelate’s speech about an active Islamist plot to entrap Catholic and non-Muslim youth with addictive narcotic drugs, Mr. Satheesan demanded a police investigation into the “attempt to stoke up communal enmity.” He noted that divisive rhetoric centred on the controversy dominated social media and warned the events could take a darker turn if left unchecked. Probe specific concerns In the same breath, Mr. Satheesan said the police should also probe the specific concerns raised by social leaders. Mr. Satheesan was more plain-spoken at a function organised by the Sunni Yuvajana Sangham at Tharoor. He said the Sangh Parivar was hell-bent on creating communal discord in Kerala. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] was strangely silent on the subject. “The CPI(M) had a hidden agenda,” he said. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had ominously misrepresented the bishop’s speech to foment communal division. Goa Governor P. Sreedharan Pillai had overstepped his constitutional bounds by adding fuel to the fire, Mr. Sudhakaran alleged. Mr. Sudhakaran said the BJP’s newfound love for Christians was a farce. He said the government should shun its “dangerous silence” and call an all-party meeting to discuss the issue. Mr. Vijayan should also urgently convene a conference of social and spiritual leaders across the religious spectrum. (Mr. Vijayan had debunked the narcotic jihad theory last week and reminded spiritual leaders of their civic obligation to preserve communal harmony. The CPI(M), CPI, and the Indian National League had echoed a similar view.) Withdraw comment The Popular Front of India (PFI) urged Mr. Kallarangatt to withdraw his controversial statement, which apparently had been aimed at destroying the harmony among different communities. Addressing media persons in Kottayam on Monday, A. Abdul Sathar, State general secretary of the PFI, said the State Home Department should initiate stern action against the bishop if he was not ready to withdraw the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bid-to-destroy-communal-amity-says-satheesan/article36444491.ece

The petitioners, led by state president of Tamil Vivasaayigal Sangam, O.A. Narayanasamy, submitted a petition seeking the crop loss compensation. They said 40% of the farmers, who had suffered huge loss in the flood in 2020, were yet to get the crop loss compensation of Rs. 4,000 an acre despite repeated appeals from the affected agriculturists. Besides disbursing the compensation, the crop insurance benefits should also be given to the farmers who had insured their crops, they petitioners said. A group of villagers from Puthupatti near Srivaikundam submitted a petition seeking regular employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme instead of asking a section of the villagers to go for the MNREGP works in other villages. Seeking community certificates for their children, members of Rajakula Vathiriyar Women Welfare Association, led by its secretary Malini, submitted a petition. Similar petition was submitted by Cholakula Vathiri Men’s Association also who sought issue of community certificate in the name of ‘Vathiyar’ instead of giving it as ‘Devendrakula Velaalar’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thoothukudi-farmers-seek-compensation-for-crop-loss/article36445161.ece

14 September 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Petitions for and against Sterlite unit submitted at Collectorate||Tension prevailed near the Collectorate premises here on Monday after supporters and opponents of Sterlite Copper submitted petitions in the Collectore seeking reopening and permanent closure of the copper smelter unit. As the Sterlite Copper smelter unit on the SIPCOT Industrial Complex premises remains closed since May 2018 following violent protest and police firing in which 13 persons were killed, petitions in support of permanent closure of the factory and seeking reopening of the unit are being submitted to the Collector by various groups. On Monday, fisherwomen from Beach Road and Lions Town and the residents of Sorispuram, Ayyanadaippu and Meelavittaan submitted petition seeking reopening of Sterlite Copper. In the petitions submitted separately, the women said the Sterlite Copper was liberally supporting the fishermen by giving free fishnets, iceboxes and scholarships for the children of fishermen. Since the factory had been sealed, the fishermen and their children were unable to get the assistances from Sterlite Copper. Hence, it should opened at the earliest considering the wellbeing of the fishermen, the fisherwomen said. The petitioners from Sorispuram, Ayyanadaippu and Meelavittaan said the factory that provided direct and indirect employment to a few hundred youths from their hamlets remained closed and hence the youths were rendered jobless for the past three years. Moreover, the villages that witnessed a lot of development with the assistances from Sterlite Copper had been affected badly. Hence, the Collector should ensure the early reopening of the copper smelter, they said. Meanwhile, a group of Naam Thamizhar Katchi cadre, led by Thoothukudi central district secretary V. Velraj, who came to the Collectorate staged a demonstration demanding the permanent closure of Sterlite Copper and dropped a petition with this demand. They said the DMK president and Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, who gave a poll promise of permanent closure of the copper smelter, should fulfil his promise by passing a resolution in the State Legislative Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/petitions-for-and-against-sterlite-unit-submitted-at-collectorate/article36444810.ece
14 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||BDU directed to pay salary of guest lecturers for August||Bharathidasan University (BDU) has reportedly been directed by the Higher Education Department to release salary for the month of August for over 600 guest lecturers. The university has received oral instructions in this regard and has been assured that an official order will be issued shortly specifying the government’s commitment to meet the financial requirements of the newly converted government colleges that were earlier constituent units of State Universities. Of all the State universities, BDU had the highest number of 10 constituent units that were converted into government arts and science colleges in two phases over the last few years. The university, however, continued to meet the salary expenses of the guest lecturers till March this year, and had stopped releasing salary from the start of this financial year. The guest lecturers and about 90 non-teaching staff in the newly converted 10 government arts and science colleges have not been paid their salaries for five months. The guest lecturers have, nevertheless, been discharging their duties even while staging protests demanding the settlement of their pending salary dues. The BDU has just resumed paying salaries for guest lecturers of the university departments who were also not paid for a few months, sources said. Meanwhile, the Joint Action Committee of Teachers’ Associations and Staff Welfare Associations of Bharathidasan University has begun a protest by raising slogans to invite the attention of the government to the precarious financial situation of the varsity. According to the representatives of JAC, the government has not yet reimbursed Rs. 54 crore to the university towards the salary and other expenditure incurred for the constituent units after their conversion into government arts and science colleges. After the conversion, the fee levied for the students go to the government exchequer, and it is unreasonable for the government to pressurise the university to keep paying the guest faculty, they said. Unless the government releases block grants or settles at least a portion of the Rs. 54 crore, the university will not be in a position to pay the salaries for its own staff. The series of protests will be marked by wearing of black badges by the university employees on Tuesday and Wednesday, sit-in strike on Thursday and Friday, and hunger strike by representatives of teaching and non-teaching welfare associations on September 2, followed by hunger strike by all members of the associations on September 21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bdu-directed-to-pay-salary-of-guest-lecturers-for-august/article36444782.ece
14 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Pay us the minimum wage of Rs. 650 daily, say women construction workers||Women construction labourers participating in a State-level conference organised by Tamil Nadu AITUC Construction Workers Union here recently have urged the government to fix their retirement age at 50 years. The conference also appealed to the State government to ensure that the labourers are provided with the minimum wage of Rs. 650 daily in accordance with a GO issued as per the Minimum Wages Act. Resolutions to this effect were unanimously adopted at the meet that was attended by around 400 women construction labourers from across the State. Health issues One of the resolutions said the women labourers were involved in tough physical labour even while taking care of their families and experiencing gynaecological and other health-related issues. Owing to these factors, many of them were unable to carry on with construction work at a young age itself. Several workers above the age of 40 and 45 were being ‘ignored’ for construction work. Hence, the State government should make suitable changes in rules relating to construction labourers welfare and fix the retirement age of registered women construction labourers as 50 years and provide them with pension once they attained the age. Women labourers were being provided with daily wages ranging between Rs. 200 and Rs. 400, another resolution said while urging the State government to take steps to ensure that they were provided with a minimum wage of Rs. 650 daily as per a government order issued earlier. Fifteen resolutions were adopted during the conference that was presided by AITUC national secretary Vahida Nizam. The meet deliberated problems confronted by women construction labourers and the action plan for resolving them. Another resolution said there were lakhs of women labourers involved in construction activities in Tamil Nadu who joined as sithaal and retired in that category. The State government should identify eligible labourers and enhance their vocational skills by imparting them training in masonry, electrical works, plumbing, crane operation and carpentry along with stipend through the Tamil Nadu Construction Workers Welfare Board. The State government should come out with a separate scheme in this regard, which would not only help in honing the skills of women but also help in raising their standard of living. Yet another resolution said the labourers were involved in the nation’s development from their young age and, hence, it was essential to ensure their social security in their old age. Hence, the State government should ensure that they were provided with a minimum pension of Rs. 6,000. Legal rights The meet also discussed the need to establish the legal rights of women construction labourers and announced the formation of a 76-member State committee and a 17-member State organising committee. Among those who attended the conference were K. Ravi, general secretary, Tamil Nadu AITUC Construction Workers Union.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pay-us-the-minimum-wage-of-rs-650-daily-say-women-construction-workers/article36444788.ece
14 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Invite suggestions from public on remodelling of bus stand: activists||A group of activists have urged the district and civic authorities to make changes in the design of the remodelled Chathiram Bus Stand in the city. In a joint representation to the Collector, T. Ramakrishnan, founder MGR Nalpani Mandram, P. Ayyarappan, district president, Road Users Welfare Association, and T.Raja, coordinator, Tiruchi Welfare Organisations and City Development Activists, have demanded that the design be made public to invite suggestions on the required modifications. The bus stand has been taken up for redevelopment under the Smart City Mission project at an estimated cost of Rs. 17.40 crore. The rebuilt complex also houses shops and parking area. The project is nearing completion and the bus stand is expected to be opened soon. The activists contend that the bus bays appear to be more suitable for operation of mofussil buses rather than town buses. “The remodelled bus stand has shortcomings. The design should be made public to invite suggestions from stake holders including bus drivers and passengers. It is better to hold a public hearing to hear suggestions and rectify the flaws before the bus stand is reopened,” the activists said. The activists also suggest that the district authorities get the consent of the Central Institute of Road Transport as it is a centrally funded project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/invite-suggestions-from-public-on-remodelling-of-bus-stand-activists/article36444792.ece

14 September 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Civic body’s night shelter at MGMGH reopens with new look||The night shelter at Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) has reopened after being locked up for over a year due to COVID-19. The shelter has been renovated with new cots and mattresses, a fresh coat of paint among other facilities. The civic body charges Rs. 10 per person per night to stay at the facility. A night shelter was set up at on the hospital campus to provide accommodation for attendants or visitors of patients admitted to the hospital. The facility has been reopened as all departments at the Tiruchi GH are fully operational. The night shelter, maintained by the Tiruchi Corporation, has two dormitories - one for men and one for women. The men's dormitory has 14 bunker cots, with 28 beds, while the women’s has 10 cots with 20 beds. The rooms come with attached restrooms. While the civic body had not charged any money for the night shelter earlier, they have decided to charge Rs. 10 per night per person. “We have done so, so that the users will attach value and be responsible while using it. At the free night shelters, the people do not maintain the facilities well. Now that they have to pay, they will use it sensibly,” the person in charge of the facility said. For a person to be allowed to stay at the night shelter, they require their Aadhaar card and a proof that their relative has been admitted to the hospital. Meanwhile, official sources at the hospital said that the attendants and visitors were not making use of the facility. “They choose to sleep on the pavement outside the hospital or sit outside the ward, but are not willing to use these facilities. More awareness is needed,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-bodys-night-shelter-at-mgmgh-reopens-with-new-look/article36444797.ece

14 September 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||DMK govt. has destructive mindset: BJP||BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi on Monday accused the DMK of having a “destructive mindset” and trying to set a “negative narrative” against the Central government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Speaking to reporters after participating in a State-level party office bearers meeting here, Mr. Ravi alleged that Tamil Nadu was slowly moving towards the "danger zone" after the DMK came to power. The BJP would oppose the DMK government's decision to release 700 criminals and “terrorists” and termed it as a "dangerous decision". The State government should not allow the land in Tamil Nadu for anti-national activities, he further said. Although the Central government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had allocated various development projects worth Rs. 6 lakh crore to Tamil Nadu, yet the DMK government was acting against the Centre and Mr. Modi, he said and added that it only showed that the DMK was "biased". He also accused the DMK of trying to set a negative narrative on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act by saying that it was “anti-Muslim” when the Prime Minister had categorically stated that it was not against Indian Muslims. The BJP would take up the issue of encroachment of temple properties in Tamil Nadu. The party would contest the upcoming local body polls, he said. The BJP, he said, would organise ‘Seva Samarpan Abhiyan’ from September 17 to October 7 by holding district exhibitions and health camps. The campaign starts on September 17 as it happened to be the birthday of Mr. Modi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-govt-has-destructive-mindset-bjp/article36444781.ece
14 September 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Villagers stage sit-in protest against stone quarrying||Residents of Soochikulam under Iurkkanthurai village panchayat in the district staged a sit-in protest on Monday in protest against the continued functioning of stone quarries close to their village. The agitation that started around 9.30 a.m. was withdrawn in the afternoon after Valliyoor Assistant Superintendent of Police Samay Singh Meena and revenue officials held talks with the villagers and assured them that their demands would be fulfilled within five days. Following increased complaints of illegal mining of minerals, especially quarrying of stones in Radhapuram taluk, that were often taken to Kanniyakumari and Kerala, where demand for granite stones is very high, Collector V. Vishnu recently inspected a few spots in this region along with Cheranmahadevi Sub-Collector V. Sivakrishamurthy. Subsequently, Mr. Vishnu chaired a meeting and instructed revenue, police and mining department officials to toughen surveillance on illegal mining while marking only two routes via check-posts at Kavalkinaru and Anjugramam to take minerals to Kanniyakumari or Kerala. Mineral-laden vehicles that use other than these two routes would be seized and cases registered against the drivers and the owners of the vehicles, he warned. Whenever sand or stone-laden vehicles cross these check-posts, the policemen or officials deployed there would check permit details so that it could not be used again for transporting illegally quarried sand and minerals. Anjugramam and Kavalkinaru check-posts were strengthened with CCTV cameras. Mr. Sivakrishnamurthy, along with 30 officials, raided 19 quarries in Radhapuram taluk, mostly in and around Irukkanthurai and Koodankulam, in the first week of August. The raids that lasted for more than nine hours were conducted at stockyards and the routes being used to transport the quarried minerals. A group of residents from Soochikulam under Irukkanthurai panchayat met Mr. Sivakrishamurthy and appealed to him to ban quarrying as the explosives being used in the quarries were causing cracks in their houses besides affecting farming operations. “The explosion also affects children, pregnant women, senior citizens and patients living in 13 villages around Irukkanthurai. Since the quarries are still functioning, we decided to stage a road roko near our villages and come to the Collectorate,” said Suresh of Soochikulam. Though the protesting villagers had originally planned to lay siege to the Collectorate, the police stopped them, citing COVID-19 restrictions. When the villagers were getting ready to assemble at Irukkanthurai to start their agitation, the authorities also thwarted their plan, forcing the villagers of Soochikulam to start the sit-in protest in their hamlet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villagers-stage-sit-in-protest-against-continued-functioning-of-stone-quarries/article36444813.ece
14 September 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Women seek regular work under MGNREGS||Seeking regular employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the wages fixed by the government, a group of women workers from Singikulam near Kalakkad submitted a petition in the Collectorate on Monday. The villagers said they, who were hired under the MGNREGS to work on an average of 8 hours every day, were given Rs. 200 a day against the prescribed wages of Rs. 224 by the government. When the labourers questioned about giving reduced wages, they were not given employment under the MGNREGS. “We’ve been hired only 18 days since April last as we questioned the officials about wages cut. The loss of job and wages hit our families hard. Hence, the Collector should instruct the officials concerned to give us employment under the MGNREGS regularly and the right wages fixed by the government,” the petitioner women said. ‘Open DPC’ State vice-president of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam P. Perumbadaiyar submitted a petition seeking opening of direct purchase centre for paddy at Thirukkurungudi as the crop cultivated on over 500 acres in this region was ready for harvest. He said the farmers of this region, who had raised ‘kar’ season paddy on over 500 acres, were about to start the harvest of the crop. Since the paddy direct procurement centre, which was functioning at Thiruppaarkadal Temple common feast hall, was yet to be opened, the paddy growers would have to be forced to sell the paddy to private traders or the brokers.  ‘Remove iron cage’ A group of persons affiliated to Confederation of Tirunelveli District Social Justice Movements submitted a petition seeking the removal of the iron cage erected around the state of E.V. Ramasamy Periyar near Palayamkottai bus stand before September 17, his birth anniversary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/women-seek-regular-work-under-mgnregs/article36444811.ece

In a petition submitted in the Collectorate on Monday, T. Babu Selvan, president of Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary School Headmasters’ Association’s Tirunelveli chapter, said the headmasters of all higher secondary schools had been given intimation through the District Educational Officer about involving them in the rural civic polls to be held in mid-October. Since the heads of the higher secondary schools had already been burdened with teaching, administrative and official works, they should be exempted from being involved in the local body elections. Moreover, the part-time sanitary workers of government higher secondary schools, who are being given the consolidated salary of Rs. 4,000, were not given the salary since April 2020. Hence, the salary arrears should be given to them immediately, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/exempt-headmasters-from-civic-poll-duty/article36445162.ece

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||T.N. Assembly passes Bill against NEET||"It [NEET] festers inequality as it favours the rich and the more privileged class of society, who are able to afford special coaching apart from pursuing Class XII. It virtually barricades the underprivileged social groups from medical and dental education," the Bill contended. It argued that NEET was against the equality clause enshrined in the Constitution. Declining strength After the UG course, students from the affluent class do not serve in rural areas, and often pursue postgraduate courses abroad, it said, adding that the number of serving doctors in the State was declining. It also termed ‘spurious’ the suggestion that NEET improved the standard of medical education. "The standard of medical education is maintained during the UG course by following the syllabus and curriculum prescribed by the National Medical Commission and through exams conducted by the university before awarding the degree. Students who are not able to pass the university exams are not awarded degrees. Therefore, it is not during the admission stage that the standard of medical education is maintained," the Bill argued. The Bill said its aim was to ensure social justice, uphold equality and equal opportunity, protect all vulnerable student communities from discrimination and bring them into the mainstream of medical and dental education and, in turn, ensure robust public healthcare across Tamil Nadu, particularly in the rural areas. Committee’s report The government’s decision followed a report from a high-level committee, headed by the retired High Court judge, Justice A.K. Rajan, which said NEET had "clearly undermined" the diverse societal representation in MBBS and higher medical studies, favouring mainly the affluent segment of society, while thwarting the dream of the underprivileged social groups to pursue medical education. The panel concluded that if NEET continued for a few more years, the healthcare system of Tamil Nadu would be "very badly affected, and there may not be enough doctors" to be posted at Primary Health Centres or government hospitals, and the rural and urban poor may not be able to join the medical courses. It was in favour of immediate steps to eliminate NEET from being used in admission to medical programmes "at all levels". ‘Not equitable’ It further contended that NEET was not a fair or equitable method of admission, since it ‘favoured’ the rich and elite sections of society. The most affected groups were the students of Tamil medium; students having a rural background; those from government schools; those whose parental income was less than Rs. 2.5 lakh per annum; and socially disadvantaged groups like the Most Backward Classes (MBCs), the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and the Scheduled Tribes (STs). Based on the report, the State government decided that admission to undergraduate courses in medicine, dentistry, Indian medicine and homoeopathy in the State shall be made only based on the marks obtained in the qualifying examination (Plus-Two).  After the UG course, students from the affluent class do not serve in rural areas, and often pursue postgraduate courses abroad, the Bill said, adding that the number of serving doctors in the State was declining||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-assembly-passes-bill-against-neet/article36444648.ece

14 September 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Dissuade depression victims from taking the extreme step’||The Dharwad Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (DIMHANS) organised a legal education programme on the occasion of World Suicide Prevention Day in Dharwad on Monday. Principal District and Sessions Judge Umesh Adiga expressed concern over the rise in instances of people ending their lives due to stress in the face of modern lifestyle and rapid changes in society. He urged the media to report on suicides responsibly. “Deaths by suicide are increasing year after year. But instead of glorifying deaths by suicide, media and society should instil courage and confidence among youth to face the challenge bravely,” he said. He also spoke against media trial and said that prejudicial judgments before the actual trial in courts on several issues tend to discourage people and make them mentally weak. “Such persons are slipping into depression and ending their lives,” he said. A collective effort is needed to stop such trends and sensitise victims of depression and dissuade them from taking the ultimate step, the judge said. “Education in the real sense is developing character and making students physically and mentally strong. It also about teaching moral values and culture. However, moral values seem to have vanished from syllabus and this is making children mentally weak,” he said. He felt that negative thinking that is prevalent among some youth is also contributing to rising death rate among youth. “They should develop positive thinking by reading good books and hearing motivational speeches,” he said, also suggesting meditation, physical exercise and yoga for overcoming stress. Parents should monitor the behaviour of their wards and if there are any changes, children should be counselled, he said. DIMHANS director Mahesh Desai said the institute was holding a series of programmes for people of all age groups to prevent suicide. He expressed concern that stress and loneliness induced by COVID may force some to take the extreme step. DIMHANS is planning holding motivational talks to help the public, he said. Laboratory DIMHANS tested over six lakh samples of throat and nose swabs. Very soon, a genetic research laboratory too will come up, he said. Srinivas Kosagi spoke of the general scenario about suicide in India. He said that on an average, 381 people end their lives every day. In 2019, as many as 1.39 lakh people committed suicide in India, of which 90,000 were in the 18-45 age group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dissuade-depression-victims-from-taking-the-extreme-step/article36444854.ece
14 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||19.51% candidates clear TET||Nearly 20% of candidates who sat for the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET), to be eligible to apply for teaching posts in primary schools across the State, cleared the competitive examination. This is a huge jump from last year, where only 3.93% of the candidates were eligible for recruitment. Of the 2.31 lakh candidates, a total of 45,074 (19.51%) cleared the TET, the results of which were announced on Monday. Around 18,960 candidates passed paper one, while 26,114 successfully cleared paper two. Candidates who have cleared paper one are eligible to teach Classes I to V, while those who have cleared paper two can apply for teaching posts for Classes VI to VIII. ‘Lenient manner’ The test was conducted on August 22 in seven languages. Sources in the Department of Public Instruction said that a larger percentage of candidates cleared the test this year as the paper was set in a “lenient manner”. “We had shown leniency as we needed to recruit teachers in government schools which will be possible only if there is an adequate number of eligible candidates,” said an official. Sources also added that many candidates who had failed in the previous years reappeared for the test as the TET certificate is now valid for a lifetime. Until this year, those who cleared the TET were eligible to teach in primary schools only for seven years, after which they had to give the test again. Basavaraj Gurikar, vice-president, All India Teachers’ Federation, attributed the rise in the number of candidates who cleared the TET to the lockdown which, he felt, gave people more time to prepare. “Teachers took the test seriously and all credit should go to their hard work,” he said. The results of 21 candidates have been kept under hold as they did not follow the exam-related instructions. The results of these candidates will be released after verification in accordance with the norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/1951-candidates-clear-tet/article36444587.ece
14 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Congress leaders arrive at Vidhana Soudha on bullock cart||As the legislature session began on Monday, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar and other Congress leaders rode a bullock cart to the Vidhana Soudha as a symbolic protest against the BJP government’s failure to control rise in prices of petrol and diesel. Mr. Siddaramaiah told reporters that the BJP was “lying” about the cause of rise in fuel prices, blaming it on crude oil prices in the international market. He said the party would raise the issue during the session as well. He urged the State government to reduce the tax on petrol and diesel. “Everyone has to compare the excise duty on petrol and diesel during the Manmohan Singh-led government and now. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai should speak the truth about the excise duty on fuel and let people know,” he said. The BJP dismissed the protest as a ‘gimmick’. Former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said the Congress is bound to sit in the Opposition next term too. Responding to this, Mr. Siddaramaiah sought to remind the BJP that even former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had come on a bullock cart in 1973 in protest against fuel price hike. Meanwhile, Karnataka Pradesh Youth Congress president Raksha Ramaiah said that youth Congress workers will observe National Unemployment Day on September 17. After taking part in the bullock cart rally, Mr. Ramaiah told reporters that unemployment had risen manifold after the BJP government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power because of its “lopsided policies”. “There’s no respite from price rise as people are grappling with inflation at least for the last two years. The Centre is collecting taxes and levying cess on petrol and diesel which has directly resulted in increase in prices of essential commodities. Economic slow down and the outbreak of pandemic since last year has resulted in loss of jobs across the country,” he said. He added that youth Congress will start a social media campaign and tag their comments seeking employment to the Prime Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-leaders-arrive-at-vidhana-soudha-on-bullock-cart/article36444613.ece
14 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hindi Divas protests planned across State||Several Kannada organisations have planned Statewide protests, including picketing in front of all banks, to protest the imposition of Hindi on the occasion of Hindi Divas on Tuesday. While protests on Hindi Divas were organised earlier too, this may be the first time Statewide protests have been organised, which can be attributed to “a growing uneasiness over centralisation tendency by the incumbent regime”, said senior Kannada activist Arum Javagal. Organisations have decided to observe it as a ‘Black Day’ and have organised protests in Belagavi and Bengaluru. The Karnataka Rakshana Vedike has decided to picket banks across the State and organise a protest on Twitter. “This year, we have selected to oppose Hindi imposition at banks, an issue we have been fighting against for many years now,” said T.A. Narayana Gowda, president, KRV. Activists from the organisation plan to picket thousands of nationalised and rural banks all across the State and petition branch managers to provide services in Kannada. They said they would also petition all MLAs and MPs demanding that they raise the issue in Assembly and Parliament. Recruitment exams The Union government had called off banking recruitment exams to nationalised banks after several language activists including Kannadigas opposed the fact that the exams were to be held only in Hindi and English. A committee formed to look into the issue is yet to submit a report. After the issue was raised in Parliament, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in 2019 that rural bank recruitment exams can be written in all 22 languages including Kannada, and not just in Hindi and English. However, Kannada activists are not happy with this reform “Rural banking recruitment was done at the State level in local languages earlier. The UPA government centralised recruitment in 2012, holding exams only in Hindi and English. After years of protests Ms. Sitharaman while continuing with centralised recruitment said exams can be written in any of the 22 languages. But prelims continue to be only in Hindi and English. The system still filters out people who are proficient only in their languages. Moreover, it doesn’t make sense for someone who has given his exam in Punjabi to be posted in a rural bank in Karnataka or vice-versa,” explained Arun Javagal, organising secretary, KRV. This has had a big impact on banking services in the State. “Not a week goes by in Mandya without an incident of farmers and businessmen fighting with bank employees over the language issue. Many bank employees haven’t made an effort to learn Kannada and worse even insist that customers speak in Hindi or English,” alleged Rajendra Prasad, businessman and Kannada poet from Mandya. Recent merger The situation seems to have deteriorated after the recent merger of nationalised banks. “Unlike earlier, all printed materials in banks are now centralised and are in Hindi and English. As banks need to submit quarterly reports on Hindi implementation and top posts are occupied by Hindi speakers, services in Kannada has taken a hit,” said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hindi-divas-protests-planned-across-state/article36444628.ece
14 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP set to crack down on illegal buildings||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is close to completing the first phase of its survey to identify buildings that have been constructed without any approval or in violation of the approved plans and by-laws across the city. However, this was only after the High Court of Karnataka pulled up the civic body, which is the authority that sanctions building plan approvals, for the increase in the number of illegal constructions. The BBMP is likely to submit a report to the HC within a fortnight. Through the survey, the civic body aims to ascertain if there has been any violation during construction. It is said to be in the final stages of completion. Senior officials told The Hindu , on condition of anonymity, that the civic body’s Town Planning Department approved over 8,300 building plans between January 2020 and May 2021 across all the eight zones. In November 2019, the HC directed the BBMP to not only identify illegal constructions, but also submit a plan of action for their removal or demolition in a phased manner. “The case came up for hearing last week. The court has granted our request for 15 days to submit a report,” an official said. Once this survey is completed, the civic body will take up a survey of buildings constructed in 2019-20. “This will be a continuous activity. The survey will help us identify not just illegal constructions, but also those that have encroached upon government property,” the official added. After the exercise is completed, notices will be issued to owners of illegal buildings that have been constructed without a sanctioned plan or those that are in violation of the building by-laws, and demolition of the same will be taken up. “In some zones, tenders have also been floated to fix the agencies to take up demolition of the identified illegal buildings,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-set-to-crack-down-on-illegal-buildings/article36444589.ece

Trilok Chandra, who confirmed this to The Hindu on Monday, said the sample has been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. “There is no need to panic as the person has not reported with any severe symptoms so far. However, we need to be alert,” the Commissioner said. The patient, a lab technician at Wenlock District Hospital in Mangaluru, self-reported on suspicion that he may have contracted the infection. Sources said he had a travel history to Goa and had been in contact with a person who returned from Kerala. The Commissioner said a detailed advisory on precautions (against Nipah Virus) was already issued after the first confirmed case of Nipah virus was reported in Kerala. “Advanced surveillance measures are in place in all border districts. People coming from Kerala will be kept under surveillance,” he said. ‘Monitor symptoms’ “We have asked the district officials to monitor arrivals for symptoms such as fever, headache, vomiting, dizziness, disorientation and convulsions, and anyone with these symptoms should seek immediate medical care,” he added.

The recent elections to the civic body threw up a fractured mandate. The regional party has decided to “wait and watch” the moves of the Congress and BJP, both of whom are wooing it. The JD(S) Legislature Party meeting, chaired by H.D. Kumaraswamy, deferred taking a decision since the notification for the election to the post of Mayor was a week away, party spokesperson T.A. Sharavana said. “It was decided that there was no hurry. It was also felt that both national parties were using the regional party. We will wait and watch,” he added. While the JD(S), which won four seats, has sought the Mayor’s post for one term and two standing committees, the BJP and Congress are learnt to have offered the Deputy Mayor’s post. Earlier, Mr. Kumaraswamy told reporters that though senior Congress leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge had approached the party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda, it appears that local Congress leaders were not in favour of the alliance. “Local leaders want to portray JD(S) as a ‘B’ team of BJP. On the other hand, BJP has also been trying to woo us for an alliance,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/alliance-in-kcc-jds-defers-decision/article36444610.ece

CCTV camera footage from the main door of the stadium showed four armed assailants wearing helmets and caps walking out of the gate, after hacking the victim to death in the referees’ room where he had taken refuge. “We are also scanning the CCTV camera footage from in and around the area to identify the assailants and are talking to eyewitness,” said a police officer, who suspect old rivalry as the motive. The murder has also created a fear psychosis among residents and has also caused embarrassment to the police who had recently carried out raids on the houses of anti-social elements and habitual offenders. The assailants chased the victim Aravind, a rowdy-sheeter from Bharathi Nagar, from a nearby BBMP ground into the football stadium. Minutes before a match was about to begin, Aravind ran onto the pitch, jumped the stand gallery and locked himself in one of the referees’ rooms. The assailants gave chase despite the presence of spectators and players, broke open the door of the room, and hacked him to death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/murder-of-rowdy-sheeter-cctv-footage-shows-assailants-walking-out-of-stadium-after-crime/article36444590.ece

14 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC puts rider on INC list of nursing institutes||The High Court of Karnataka has held that the Indian Nursing Council (INC) cannot publish only the list of nursing institutes inspected by it in the State of Karnataka without publishing the list of nursing institutes recognised by the State government. The court also directed the INC to publish on its website the order of the apex court restoring a single-judge Bench’s order in July 2017 declaring that the INC had no authority to grant recognition to the institutes imparting nursing courses and telling it not to publish any material on the website indicating that institutes would have to get recognition from the INC. Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar issued the directions while disposing of petitions filed by the Karnataka State Association of the Management of Nursing and Allied Health Science Institutions, Bengaluru. The INC shall be at liberty to web-host the list of institutions inspected by it together with the list of institutes recognised by the State government, but not as an independent list of institutes inspected by it. The petitioner association had sought a direction to the INC to remove from its website a list depicting as “recognised institutions by the Karnataka State Nursing Council” for the year 2019-20 and 2020-21, contending that this list was misleading. The INC’s list also gives an impression, contrary to the Supreme Court’s order, that institutes are required to get recognition from it, the petitioner contended, pointing out that the INC’s list was misleading the public as it did not contain the institutes that were recognised by the State government through the Karnataka State Nursing Council. The court said that the INC would have to upload both the lists. It noted that though the INC had the power to inspect the institutions with regard to infrastructure and teaching faculty, it had no power to grant recognition in view of the earlier orders of the courts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-puts-rider-on-inc-list-of-nursing-institutes/article36444597.ece

Kundar, a member of the National Commission for Women, has said that the Centre is considering raising the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21. Speaking at a review meeting in Chikkamagaluru on Monday, Ms. Kundar said such a move would be helpful for women as it would encourage them to take up higher studies and also take care of their health. There has been an increase in child marriages in Chikkamagaluru in the last two years, warranting stern action. She said there was a need for awareness campaigns at gram panchayats. “The Telangana State has initiated a system allowing gram panchayats to issue marriage certificates.

14 September 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||NEP opposed||Kimmane Ratnakar, former Education Minister, has opposed the implementation of the New Education Policy (NEP) in Karnataka, stating that it would promote the privatization of the education sector on a large scale. Speaking at a press conference in Shivamogga on Monday, Mr. Ratnakar said the government had not discussed the impacts of the NEP with experts. Nor was it debated in the legislature. “The policy was framed by a committee with representatives of the Sangh Parivar. The State government is in a hurry to implement it without making necessary preparations,” he said. The policy intended to take away jobs and posed a threat to cultural diversity. “There is a threat of private players taking over the education sector. The poor people will lose opportunities,” he said. To a question on his contesting in the Assembly election for the Thirthahalli constituency, Mr. Ratnakar said the party high-command would decide on the candidate during the elections. “I have been with the Congress for many years and will remain in the party,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nep-opposed/article36445054.ece

14 September 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||New generation understands Gandhian values better, says Prasanna||Theatre person Prasanna on Monday said that walking the path of Mahatma Gandhi does not mean dressing up like the Mahatma, but by following the principles enunciated by him. He was interacting with students of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial College in Udupi on the sidelines of Pavithra Vastra Abhiyan, an initiative to promote handloom clothes and organic products through Charaka women’s Multipurpose Cooperative Society, Heggodu. Mr. Prasanna said that one has to take an oath to live a simple life to imbibe the Gandhian philosophy in oneself; it is a gradual process. He said that it is heartening to note that the new generation is understanding better as to what is it to become a real Gandhian in life. The real issue in contemporary society, Mr. Prasanna said, is the disconnect between the old school of thoughts and modern ideas. Indians should study the traditional knowledge stream and never forget their roots, he stressed. He regretted that the politicians and policymakers are making attempts to build an economy based on machines. However, if machines continue to rule people’s minds, culture will lose its originality, he said and added that languages, folk and rustic skills too will not remain the same. Advocating a centrist way of life, Mr. Prasanna said that such a way will bring tradition and modern philosophy together solving most of today’s problems. Pavithra Vastra Abhiyan, he said, is aimed at attracting the younger generation towards organic products and handloom as synthetic dress is not good for health too. The exhibition will be on till September 16 on MGM College premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-generation-understands-gandhian-values-better-says-prasanna/article36445040.ece

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||How and why these tigers in Odisha changed their stripes||The findings of this study offers a nuanced view of India’s tiger conservation efforts. For the endangered animal to survive and thrive in the wild, there needs to be more genetic variation. “The population at Similipal Tiger Reserve is small and potentially disconnected from other populations. It is likely that related individuals are mating with each other. That is why the driver of this evolutionary change is likely. But given the small population size, yes, Similipal tigers are undergoing inbreeding,” Mr. Vinay added. In the paper, researchers said simulations suggest that one migrant tiger per generation would most likely result in the loss of the melanistic mutation from Similipal. “Regardless of how the frequency of this mutation changes in the future, genetic rescue should benefit the population by increasing heterozygosity and decreasing the probability of inbreeding depression. Careful consideration would be required when selecting the immigrant,” the paper stated. For Dr. Ramakrishnan and her team, what began as a curiosity driven investigation — “What is the genetic basis of pseudo-melanism?” — has given them insight into the evolutionary trajectory of a small and isolated population of an endangered species, and solved a long standing mystery of why these tigers look the way they do.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/how-and-why-these-tigers-in-odisha-changed-their-stripes/article36444595.ece

14 September 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Steps to rid Alappuzha MCH of controversies||Amidst a string of controversies involving Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Alappuzha, Health Minister Veena George chaired a high-level meeting on the Medical College campus on Monday. Last week, the MCH authorities wrongly notified the family of a man from Bharanikavu, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital with COVID-19, that he had died. It also handed over the body of a person who died of COVID-19 to another family. Following the goof-ups, the Health Minister directed Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Asha Thomas to conduct an inquiry. Speaking to reporters after the meeting attended by people’s representatives, MCH and Health Department officials, Ms. George said that necessary action would be taken after receiving the probe report. The Minister said a mechanism would be put in place to inform COVID-19 deaths at the MCH to the next of kin without delay. On September 10, a person named Ramanan, 72, of Krishnapuram, succumbed to COVID-19 at the MCH. The hospital authorities intimated his relatives about his death, but also incorrectly informed the family of a person from Bharanikavu, undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at the ICU, with the same name. Mix-up The relatives of Ramanan from Bharanikavu reached the hospital on Saturday morning to receive the body and cremate it, only to find that he is alive. The MCH authorities had mistakenly handed over Ramanan’s body to another family. According to sources, both Ramanan and Kumaran, the latter from Cherthala, died at the MCH on September 10. Kumaran’s family was wrongly given the body of Ramanan. When Ramanan’s relatives reached the hospital to receive the body, it was nowhere to be seen. After being informed about the mix-up, the relatives of Kumaran brought Ramanan’s body back to the MCH on Friday night and returned with Kumaran’s body. Ramanan’s body was later handed over to his relatives. Last month, the MCH authorities failed to inform relatives about the death of two patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-to-rid-alappuzha-mch-of-controversies/article36445004.ece

14 September 2021||Kalpetta,KERALA||Fall in prices of crops puts farmers in a fix||Sharp fall in prices, poor demand for short-term crops and various diseases affecting major crops have put farmers in Wayanad district, a major coffee and spices growing region in the State, in a fix. Only a few weeks remain to start ginger harvest but the produce has no demand in the market owing to uncertainties after the pandemic. The spot price of ginger in Wayanad market on Monday was Rs. 500 a bag (60 kg) as against Rs. 1,800 a bag during the corresponding period last year. The price had touched Rs. 10,000 a bag three years ago. The price of ‘nendran’ variety of plantain in the market was Rs. 13 a kg on Monday. It was Rs. 28 a kg last year. Most of the ginger plantations, especially in the low-lying areas of the district, are under the threat of fungal and bacterial wilt diseases owing to the sporadic rain. “I planted ginger on an acre of leased land around six months ago. But I am forced to take a premature harvest owing to the spread of the fungal disease, locally called Mahali,” Gopi Kochanikkal, a small-scale farmer at Kallur, said. Low shelf life He had spent close to Rs. 5 lakh for the cultivation and was not sure whether he could recoup even a fraction of his investment. Most of the traders refused to procure the produce citing the low shelf life of immature ginger rhizomes, he added. Trading sources said there was no demand for the produce in the major markets of neighbouring States after the outbreak of the pandemic. Though the government had fixed the minimum support price (MSP) for 16 farmers produce a few years ago, crops such as ginger and yam were not included on the list. Though the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam and Horticorp are the agencies for procuring plantain, they were collecting only a limited quantity from a farmer at a time, that too only from farmers who had registered with those agencies. The State government had announced MSP for coffee a year ago but the agencies were yet to start procurement, sources said.

As many as 74 Kudumbashree members of 17 construction groups, each group comprising four to six members, are working in the sector now. The Mission had provided 53 days’ training for members on all aspects of construction work with the support of the Wayanad Social Service, an NGO in the district, and Rural Self-Employment Training Institute here two years ago. “Now, our group is able to undertake all works related to the construction sector, including electrification, painting and plumbing, without outsourcing workers, except for works like concreting roofs,” says A. Veena of the Sree Deepam construction unit at Panamaram in the district. ‘We do not expect a huge profit from the venture, except our daily wages,” says Ms. Veena. Other constructions The groups are also undertaking construction works of cattle sheds, wells, and concrete roads under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, apart from house construction works. “Now, we are planning to upgrade the units as micro contracting agencies to undertake construction works of government departments,” says P. Sajitha, district coordinator, Kudumbashree Mission. Recently, the government had issued an order to permit the agencies to undertake the construction works of civic bodies, the Public Works Department and the Kerala Water Authority below Rs. 2 lakh, Ms. Sajitha adds.

Rajeeve said here on Monday that the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (KINFRA) would help boost the development of industries in north Kerala. He was speaking after laying the foundation stone of the administration-cum-facilitation block being constructed at the upcoming KINFRA Velliyampara, Mattannur, at a cost of Rs. 1.5 crore. Kannur and Kasaragod districts were the most promising areas for industrial development in Kerala. With the commencement of the administration block, Mattannur would become the main hub of KINFRA’s operations in north Kerala, he said. Mr. Rajeeve said north Kerala had more land to start industrial ventures. Infrastructures, including the Kannur airport, the freight port at Azheekal, and the waterway would attract industrialists. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, more than 3,200 small businesses had been registered within 100 days. A law would be enacted soon to promote industries in the State, he said. The government’s position was “maximum investment and maximum employment”. Despite the scarcity of land, population density and environmental issues, Kerala’s peaceful climate and skilled people attracted industrialists, he said. “The motto of the government is responsible investment and responsible industry,” he said. The KINFRA Industrial Park will be set up on 128 acres in Velliyampara. K.K. Shailaja, MLA, presided over the function. V. Sivadasan, MP, was the chief guest. Facilitation centres Mr. Rajeeve, who attended a Meet the Minister programme during the day, said facilitation centres would be set up at the taluk level to help new entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs should be able to get help from here on matters including registration. In Kasaragod In Kasaragod district, Mr. Rajeeve inaugurated a high-tech coir defibering unit at Puthukkai in Kanhangad. He said that the unit was part of the government’s 100-day plan. He said only 18% of the coir available in the State was currently used for industrial purposes. Of this, only 35% was tuned into value-added products. High-tech coir defibering units are being set up with the aim of raising this to 45%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mattannur-to-be-hub-of-kinfras-operations-in-north-kerala-rajeeve/article36444918.ece
14 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||‘Littoral States should unearth common maritime history’||It will be a great step in unearthing a common maritime history of the Indian subcontinent, if south Indian and littoral States from Gujarat to West Bengal joined hands to promote archaeological studies of the early historic period (5th century BC to 5th century AD), said P.J. Cherian, director, PAMA Institute for the Advancement of Transdisciplinary Archaeological Sciences, a non-profit research organisation which is spearheading the Pattanam excavations. This is because the host of port sites of this phase, from Barygaza (Baruch) in Gujarat to Tamralipti (Tamluk) in Bengal, hold the key to understanding how Muciri Pattinam (which foreigners referred to as Muziris) emerged as the first emporium of the Indian Ocean, having contacts from Gibraltar to south China, 18 centuries before Vasco da Gama’s landing on the Kerala coast. Such collaborative effort and conservation of the archaeological, genetic and philological evidence emerging from the coastal belt of the Indian subcontinent may even provide alternative historical readings that could challenge the dominant colonial historiography, he added. His comments come against the backdrop of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s recent statement that the Porunai river (Thamirabarani) civilization is 3,200 years old, after carbon dating analysis of rice with soil, found in a burial urn at Sivakalai in Thoothukudi district of Tamil Nadu, by Miami-based Beta Analytic Testing Laboratory, yielded the date of 1155 BC. Hinting that it was the government’s task to scientifically prove that the history of the Indian subcontinent should begin from the Tamil landscape, Mr. Stalin had said archaeological excavations would be carried out in other States and countries in search of Tamil roots, beginning with the ancient port of Muziris (now known as Pattanam), located in the suburbs of Ernakulam. Welcoming Mr. Stalin’s efforts, Mr. Cherian said studying ancient sites in isolation was a colonial legacy. “The colonialists wouldn’t have been interested in establishing the ancient links of Tamilakam or the Indian subcontinent at large. For a set of people who honestly believed that Vasco da Gama discovered India in 1498, the evidence from Muciri Pattinam, Korkai, Puhar, Arikamedu, or Alagamkulam that ancient Tamils travelled across three continents in the Sangham Age, would be embarrassing or a non-exciting piece of information. Archaeological evidence unearthed now, along with genetic and linguistic evidence, have the subversive potential to undo the colonial accretions of historical wrongs. It would thus be the responsibility of enlightened Indian States to critically identify the origins of fragmented or myopic versions of the past,” he said. “In fact the artefacts, the radio carbon dates etc., from ancient Tamil sites require comparative analysis with their contemporary sites, to understand their broader contexts of technology, interfaces, creative skills, and language, or in one word ancient Tamil’s material culture. The Accelerator Mass Spectrometry [AMS] dates from Porunai, Keeladi, Korkai, and Adichanallur corroborates with the cultural sequence of Pattanam [Muziris]. The early dates of Porunai civilisation is close to 1000 BC, commensurate with the first traces of human settlement at Pattanam,” Mr. Cherian observed. As many as 11 seasons of excavation have been undertaken at Pattanam since 2006, the last two seasons by PAMA research institute and the earlier nine seasons by the Kerala Council of Historical Research (KCHR). The exponentially huge material data unearthed so far revealed that Pattanam, a coastal village in Ernakulam, could be a site as important as Mohenjo Daro to humanity, he said. The exact details of the collaboration can be spelled after discussion with different agencies. “ The [State] governments could well adopt Pattanam as a cultural pilgrimage centre of the 21st century,” Mr. Cherian said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/littoral-states-should-unearth-common-maritime-history/article36444942.ece
14 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Work begins on Rs. 166-cr. sewage treatment plant at Fort Kochi||Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) began work on the Rs. 166-crore vacuum sewer network and treatment plant at Fort Kochi on Monday, after over 18 months of teething troubles in kick-starting work owing to opposition from a section of residents. The work began with the help of the district administration, amid a security blanket provided by the police. Soil test and work on the compound wall began on Monday. The 6.50 million litres per day (MLD) Vacuum Sewer Network System (collecting system) and Plant (treatment plant), which will be established in a 45-cent plot near the Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital, will treat sewage from wards 1 to 5 of the Kochi Corporation, covering an area of 2.7 sq.km. The proposed sewage treatment system will cover an estimated 41,835 people from 9,280 households. The contracting firm will be in charge of the plant’s operation and maintenance for a five-year period. Innovative technology Once implemented, it will be the largest suction/vacuum-based sewer technology project in India, and one among the largest in the world. “Being a low-lying coastal area having a high water table and a relatively flat topography, a conventional gravity-based system will need excavation to deep depths and a higher number of sewage pumping stations. This might not be feasible to execute. The upcoming project, when completed, will be able to completely free roadside stormwater drains in the project area of sewage and sullage,” said CSML Chief Executive Officer Shanavas S. It will not only improve the aesthetics of the area but also lead to a cleaner and safer environment (considerably lessening air and water pollution). The benefits will include the rejuvenation and transformation of the Kalvathy canal, he added. Vacuum sewer lines The project comprises a total of 80.87 km of vacuum sewer lines and an additional 46.4 km of gravity riders for linking house connections to vacuum collection chambers/sumps. A vacuum station will ‘suck’ the sewage for onward delivery to the sewage treatment plant (STP). Owing to paucity of space, the STP will be in a multiple-storey structure. The space above the adjoining canal too will be used by constructing a stilted structure. An advanced aeration-based technology has been proposed for the STP. Vacuum sewer transports sewage from its source to the treatment plant. It maintains a partial vacuum, with an air pressure below atmospheric pressure inside the pipe network and the vacuum station collection vessel. Valves open and reseal automatically when the system is used, so differential pressure can be maintained without expending much energy for pumping, CSML sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-begins-on-rs-166-cr-sewage-treatment-plant-at-fort-kochi/article36444948.ece
14 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Rubber production gets a boost as prices rebound||The positive trend in the price level, sufficient rain, disruptions in imports and increasing acreage under the crop are expected to provide a big boost to natural rubber production in the country this season. Production is expected, with the help of these factors, to reach a record level of 8 lakh tonnes during the current season. Great expectations While the price of natural rubber ruled in the range of Rs. 115 to Rs. 180 during the last year, the prices are ruling higher this year. The price level has ranged between Rs. 170 and Rs. 175 so far this year, adding fuel to expectations from farmers, who had earlier abandoned at least a portion of their rubber trees without tapping them. K. N. Raghavan, executive director of the Rubber Board, said that the board had adopted vast areas of rubber plantations that had been not tapped in the wake of falling price levels by the farmers. The board adopted 4,000 hectares in 2019. The acreage under adoption went up to 14,000 hectares in 2020, and now, 30,000 hectares have been brought under tapping during 2021 through the Rubber Board initiative. The best of the natural rubber tapping season is between August and February. The season starts with the end of the rainy season and peaks during the dry season. The October-February period is considered a peak season, during which the bulk of the natural rubber is tapped. Domestic market Dr. Raghavan said that there had also been increasing demand in the domestic market for natural rubber. The disruption in the import of rubber from other countries with a shortage of containers in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis had also added to the increased demand for domestic rubber. He said that there was higher demand for latex in the domestic market. Natural rubber production in the country stood at 7.15 lakh tonnes during last year despite the adverse conditions. Farmers were expecting an increase in prices in the coming months. Farmers have also installed rain guards in nearly 4 lakh hectares this season against less than 3 lakh hectares last year. The rain guard installations for the tapped trees is one of the indications of the farmer optimism about higher prices in the near future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rubber-production-gets-a-boost-as-prices-rebound/article36444956.ece

This and many other Chinese nets that still proudly adorn tourism brochures about Kochi would still have been operational, if Kerala Tourism’s Rs. 2.44-crore long-overdue project to help renovate the nets using lengthy teak and Kalasanthi wood logs had materialised. “I began pulling the cantilever nets in 1965. Inadequate government support and sea erosion due to dredging of the shipping channel resulted in the number of nets dwindling from 25 to eight during the past three decades. Much of the delay in kick-starting renovation work could have been avoided if Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organisation (KITCO), the implementing agency to whom the Kerala Tourism handed over half the project cost, had been proactive in sourcing lengthy teak logs [which constitute the cantilever frame of the nets] from the Forest Department,” Kunjappan said. Many of the iconic nets withered away or were dismantled, since net operators found it tough to procure teak wood on their own to replace the worn-out logs. In addition, the tough grind involved in six people having to pull the nets simultaneously, be it rain or shine, has resulted in it becoming difficult to get workers, he added. Franklin, a worker who earned a living for decades pulling the nets, pointed to how people like him fell on hard times owing to high operational cost and dwindling fish catch. He pointed to termites and the elements destroying many of the over a dozen Kalasanthi logs that were unloaded at the Vasco Da Gama Square over three years ago. “They could have been used to form ‘hinges’ which supported the massive teak logs, if the logs had been made available in time,” he said. Over 10 families are dependent on income from each net. A senior Kerala Tourism official said the project that was set in motion in 2014 was caught in red tape and many avoidable delays in implementation. He confided that Fort Kochi would lose its value as a pristine heritage locale and go the Kovalam way in less than a decade, if the nets were not conserved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chinese-fishing-net-operators-fall-on-hard-times-decry-apathy/article36444940.ece

The police had found that the 19 guns seized were mostly single-barrel ones, except for three which were double-barrel, and were procured illegally on forged licences. One of the guns was found to have been procured from Pathankot in Punjab as per an entry in a seized document, while the origin of the other weapons remains to be identified. The police will have to take the accused outside the State, including Kashmir, to collect evidence. As of now, no more accused remains to be arrested, though probe will be conducted to ascertain whether similar incidents have taken place elsewhere. Efforts are on to track down those who helped forge arm licences. The arrest of personnel of the same firm on similar grounds in Thiruvananthapuram earlier this week led to the arrests here. The firm used to offer security service to multiple banks, the police said. Both the accused and the firm that engaged them were booked under relevant provisions of the Arms Act.

14 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kitex Group denies charges of fund misuse||A group of MLAs who met District Collector Jafar Malik here on Monday alleged that Kitex Group was using its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to achieve political ends. Kitex Group, headed by Sabu M. Jacob, is using its CSR funds for political purposes, alleged P.T. Thomas, MLA. Twenty20 Kizhakkambalam governs Kizhakkambalam panchayat and is headed by Mr. Jacob. He said CSR fund utilisation should be above political considerations, according to rules governing fund utilisation. However, Mr. Jacob ridiculed the charge, saying that Kitex Garments was a listed company, which adhered to the listing norms of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The accounts, both company and CSR funds, are statutorily audited, he said and claimed that those who made the allegations were not aware of the rules governing listed companies. He also said that 13 inspections had been conducted on the factory premises recently to find out if the company violated regulations, but no notice had been served on it. The group of MLAs included Eldose Kunnappillil and P.V. Sreenijin. The meeting with the Collector was also attended by officials of Factories and Boilers, Agriculture, Industries, Health and Labour departments as well as the Pollution Control Board. Mr. Thomas alleged that the accounts submitted by the company to the Provident Fund, Employees State Insurance, Labour and Factories and Boilers departments on the actual number of employees varied widely. The MLA said the claim that Kizhakkambalam panchayat had saved Rs. 13 crore during the last financial year was ridiculous. Mr. Jacob asked why the MLAs were silent on the alleged pollution of the Kadambrayar by the group of companies. He said water samples were collected from the 15-km segment of a tributary of the river from near the Kitex company area but no pollution had been detected. Kitex Group had been in the news recently after it announced that it was withdrawing from investing Rs. 3,500 crore in the State. The Telangana government had then invited Mr. Jacob to the State where the group has firmed up plans to invest Rs. 1,000 crore in the Kakatiya Textiles Park in Warangal district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kitex-group-denies-charges-of-csr-fund-misuse/article36444958.ece
14 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Eviction of families from Old Station land sought||Even as the Railways have sought speedy eviction of 23 families from a portion of the 40-acre Old Railway Station located behind the Kerala High Court, the Kochi Corporation and others say that the State government would have to chip in with funds and land to rehabilitate them. This comes in the wake of the demand by NGOs and others to make optimal use of the vast prime land in the city as a hub for short-distance trains, in order to decongest Ernakulam Junction and Town railway stations. Railway sources said the Railway Board was yet to take a call on making use of the land, mainly due to uncertainty over evicting/rehabilitating the families which encroached on the land many decades ago. Citing a High Court order of 1995, Ernakulam MLA, T.J. Vinod, said it was the Kochi Corporation’s responsibility to rehabilitate them. “Their houses were allotted building numbers by the civic body. They also have possession certificates. I recently submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister in this regard,” he said. Mayor M. Anil Kumar said they could be rehabilitated only with the help of the State government, since the civic agency did not have land or funds for the purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/eviction-of-families-from-old-station-land-sought/article36444944.ece

Two categories of people are being interrogated in connection with the case in which six accused have been arrested so far and who now remain in judicial custody. “People suspected of being financially involved and made substantial transfers to the accounts of gang members make up one set. Those who were either consumers of drugs or retailers engaged by the gang or both are also being identified and interrogated,” said officials associated with the probe. However, the probe team has not yet been able to arrest anyone from Chennai from where the drug was found to be smuggled into the State. Though they got hold of many phone numbers, they were either found to be switched off or led to totally unrelated people. Though the team had taken two of the accused to places in Chennai and Puducherry where they had stayed to procure the drug, it didn’t lead to any big breakthrough.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/quizzing-of-suspects-on-in-drug-seizure-case/article36444951.ece

They may be high in demand among those looking for cheap transportation. This is the premise on which Project Pink Riders has been designed. For the Kudumbashree community development societies (CDSs) of the Kozhikode Corporation, known for their innovative projects, Project Pink Riders is like killing two birds with one stone. All that one needs are a few bicycles, and there begins a mission that caters for the environment-conscious, health-conscious, budget-conscious, and the safety-conscious alike. The project is the first-of-its-kind initiative in the State. Designed by the National Urban Livelihood Mission wing of the Kozhikode Corporation, the project primarily aims at setting up rent-a-bicycle units under the Kudumbashree as a means of providing sustainable employment to the urban poor women. The target people are those who come to Kozhikode city from afar, including tourists, who could take bicycles on rent from the units. “Cycling is the cheapest means of transportation. At a time when fuel prices are soaring, it has almost become the need of the hour,” said T.K. Prakashan, Kudumbashree project officer, Kozhikode Corporation. On the other hand, the cycle parks form part of the corporation’s efforts to promote Green City culture. “Cycling is a very good exercise. There is no pollution too. We plan to encourage cycling among women,” Mr. Prakashan said. The project also aims at ensuring the safety of women travellers. Bicycles are considered safer compared to other means of transportation. The cycle parks will be set up on a pilot basis at three major tourist locations in Kozhikode city—beach, Sarovaram Biopark, and Mananchira. The corporation will identify appropriate locations for the parks and ready the required infrastructure. It includes sheds to keep cycles, drinking water availability, toilets, and cafeteria. The cost of the project is Rs. 20 lakh, of which the corporation has set aside Rs. 2.5 lakh, and the rest will be collected through sponsorship and loans. The Kudumbashree Mission will find appropriate candidates to form entrepreneur groups to manage the cycle parks. The project will be executed in coordination with other Kudumbashree projects such as She Lodge and Janakeeya Hotel. In the initial stage, each group will get 10 cycles. Members of the groups will be trained in cycle maintenance too. Mr. Prakashan said the project would be implemented in two months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kudumbashree-to-embark-on-a-pedal-powered-mission/article36444914.ece
14 September 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Errors in data bank hold up land conversion in Kozhikode||Land conversion in Kozhikode city has been in a standstill for the past four months due to mistakes in the data bank published by the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation. Thousands of applications to verify whether a certain piece of land came under the data bank, are pending at the Krishi Bhavan in Puthiyara due to this reason. Corporation Councillor from Kommeri ward, Kavitha Arun, had recently brought the issue before the Corporation Council in the form of a submission. She said that there were a lot of mistakes in the data bank including survey numbers. Several strips of land that needed to be in the data bank had not been included, nor had those that did not have a place in the data bank been excluded. A certificate from the local Krishi Bhavan that the land is not included in the data bank for wetland and paddy fields has to be obtained before filing an application for land conversion at the office of the Revenue Divisional Officer. The Krishi Bhavan at Puthiyara is in charge of this certification in 11 villages (55 wards) under the Kozhikode Corporation. The Krishi Bhavan used to issue the certificates until late April 2021 based on the draft of the data bank. However, the order of the Deputy Director (Agriculture) to use the published data bank in place of the draft has landed the officials at Krishi Bhavan in the soup as they found several mistakes in the published version. Hence, the Krishi Bhavan has stopped issuing certificates altogether much to the dismay of several people who are waiting for these certificates for land conversion and bank loans. The Agriculture Officer, in a letter, has requested the Mayor to correct the data bank as early as possible. “This problem is prevalent only in the wards that come under Puthiyara Krishi Bhavan, and not in those wards that were attached to the corporation, under Elathur, Beypore, and Cheruvannur zones”, Ms. Arun said. Ramesh Kumar, executive engineer of the corporation, said that it was a problem that occurred during data entry for the data bank. “We have over 2,000 applications requesting that some land be removed from the data bank. This has been completed. Now, only the additions are pending”, Mr. Kumar said. The corporation has appointed two new data entry operators for this purpose and discussions are in progress with the Agriculture Office for clarifications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/errors-in-data-bank-hold-up-land-conversion-in-kozhikode/article36444929.ece

Sources said the DGCA and the AAI would still have to make some assessments even though the report mentioned that the table-top runway surface characteristics were satisfactory. The AAI had managed to fulfil International Civil Aviation Organisation and DGCA certification requirements at the airport for certain critical areas such as Runway End Safety Area (RESA), runway lights, and approach lights. Besides, major airlines such as Air India, Emirates and Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines), which had earlier secured no-objection certificate for operating wide-body aircraft, would also have to make their assessment in connection with safety risk and sticking to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), the sources said. The operation of wide-body aircraft has remained suspended after the Air India Express flight crash on August 7, 2020 that killed 21 people and injured more than 75 passengers. In its 281-page report, the AAIB said the probable cause of the accident was the non-adherence to SOP by the Pilot Flying (PF) who had continued an unstabilised approach and landed beyond the touchdown zone, half way down the runway, in spite of ‘Go Around’ call by Pilot Monitoring (PM).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-begin-to-resume-big-aircraft-in-karipur/article36444962.ece

Functionaries of the Kerala Unaided College Principals Council said here recently that the number of students in final-year degree and PG classes would be around 250 to 300 in any college with an average number of courses. This would go up again if the colleges have more courses. There will be around 50 to 60 students in each class for courses such as B.A. English and B.Com. At least some colleges don’t have the facilities to keep them in classes while adhering to physical distancing norms, the principals claimed. Minister for Higher Education R. Bindu had convened a meeting on September 10 to discuss the reopening of colleges. ‘Overburden’ Varghese Mathew, president of the council, said that the move to start a shift system would overburden the teachers as their working hours would go up. Those handling subjects such as Hindi and Malayalam would be forced to attend both morning and afternoon sessions one after the other. The existing time table would be have to be overhauled, which was practically not viable in the middle of the academic year. The Principals’ council also suggested that the situation in colleges should be reviewed after a week, Mr. Mathew said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-urged-to-ensure-physical-distancing-in-states-colleges/article36444932.ece

Mohamed Riyas to introduce some changes in the plan for national highway widening in Vadakara Municipality to reduce wastage of land and avoid traffic congestion in the town. One of the most important suggestions is not to fill the land required for six-laning of the national highway (embankment), and instead put up pillars (viaduct) supporting the road, thus leaving the space below vacant to accommodate service roads and parking areas. “Implementing this method in only the 2.30 kilometres from the Fire Station Junction to Karimpanapalam can create 16.19 acres of parking space,” their report said. It added that this method could save 8,25,300 cubic metres of soil required to fill land. Ten-storey building Another major suggestion is to convert the new bus stand into a ten-storey building, which could be a complex through which vehicles from service roads could enter the highway, and also accommodate parking. The report also includes the problems that the six-lane national highway could create in Vadakara town, as well as its benefits. The panel has pointed out that the situation could be positively and creatively used for the wholesome development of the town aiming to convert it into a smart city by 2030. The panel (reviewers) consists of 50 people, mostly retired professionals who have worked in different parts of India and abroad. Some have worked in Japan and the UAE while some have worked with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the National Highways Authority. They studied the existing plan and forwarded the suggestions to the minister through the municipality. Meanwhile, the municipality, with the help of UL Cyber Park in Kozhikode, has developed a GIS-based intelligent property management system that would help design a far-sighted underground utility network across the town before the NH widening, as it would be more difficult afterwards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/experts-moot-changes-in-vadakara-nh-widening-plan/article36444915.ece

Owners of commercial vehicles in the district say illegible number plates are indicating the use of such vehicles for violation of road rules. A truck driver from the city who was recently fined for overloading said the altered or misplaced number plate was one of the tricks adopted by inter-State drivers to evade surveillance cameras. “Speed-limit violation and hit-and-run incidents can never be tracked in the case of such vehicles,” he said. The usual trickery is to use illegible fonts for number plates in small size in a crowded form. There are also drivers who cover a major portion of the number plate using large rear crash guards. Misleading alphabets and numbers are also common in such vehicles’ number plates. According to Road Accident Action Forum leaders, a pedestrian or driver will never be able to read properly such number plates in the case of any road accident or road rule violations. There are also occasions when such vehicles are used for smuggling banned products and narcotic substances, they point out. In some of the recent incidents, there were also attempts to evade the police using fake number plates. Both Kerala and other States’ registration numbers were used for printing fake number plates and displaying them in an insignificant way to smuggle ganja and foreign liquor. Apart from this, some of the violators were found using official stickers of various organisations to bypass flash inspections. ‘Action taken’ Meanwhile, officials attached to the Motor Vehicles Department and highway patrol squads claimed that they had already fined several Kerala and non-Kerala vehicles for using unclear number plates or their poor display. All local squads had been asked to intercept such vehicles and check documents thoroughly for permitting further journey, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/illegal-number-plates-on-trucks-go-unchecked/article36444928.ece

The webinar was inaugurated on Saturday by noted historian M.R.Raghava Warrier, who hailed MGS for launching a new age in Kerala history by anchoring history writing on inscriptions and other archaeological documents. Another historian, Kesavan Veluthat, recalled that MGS had brought a paradigm shift in Kerala historiography through his system-based approach. Historian and vice chairman of the Kerala Higher Education Council, Rajan Gurukkal, shared his experience how MGS corrected him right from the beginning of his research aspirations by making him understand through hands-on training. MGS, in his response, emphasised the need for historians to have an independent perspective and that there was no final word in history. “What we have is only unending interpretations. However, such interpretations should not be a product of misinterpretation of data, misrecognition of concepts, or born out of sectarian interests”, he said. T.B. Venugopala Panikkar, K.P. Ammukutty, Dinesan Vadakkiniyil, C.J. George, and Mahesh Mangalatt spoke on the occasion. The second webinar was on the topic “Historian's craft and Kerala’s pasts”.

Road near S.M. Street. Officials said the findings would be submitted to the Regional Director of the department. There were initial reports that a short-circuit had led to the fire breakout. However, a few had raised suspicion about the incident. Some of the nearby buildings were also inspected as part of the audit. The Regional Director would forward the audit report to the district administration for follow-up action. Fire and Rescue Services officials said a similar fire audit would be carried out covering maximum number of commercial buildings on the street in the coming days. The list of those who violate safety requirements would be submitted to the district administration for stringent action, they said. In the earlier audits, many buildings had been found functioning with outdated firefighting equipment and security measures on the street. There were also reports that building owners were misusing the space provided for fire escape to arrange storage space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fire-safety-audit-held-in-footwear-godown/article36444936.ece

A release from Health Minister Veena George’s office said that the lab results of 17 more samples were made available on Monday. Five of them were tested at the National Institute of Virology lab at Pune and others at the special lab facility set up at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. Another release quoting the Minister said that 115 samples were tested in six days at the special lab facility. Twenty-five others were sent to the NIV lab at Pune. Ms. George said that this avoided the delay in sending the samples to Pune. The lab at the MCH was set up on September 6, two days after a fresh Nipah case was reported in Kozhikode. It was a joint venture of NIV’s Pune and Alappuzha units as well the MCH. The lab has point-of-testing and RT-PCR testing facilities. Twelve staff members, including four experts from NIV, Pune, and two from Alappuzha were in the team, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/17-more-contacts-test-negative-for-nipah/article36444934.ece

Fathima Thahiliya from her post for “grave indiscipline”. IUML national president K.M. Kader Mohideen said in a press statement that Ms. Thahiliya was removed from her post as per the recommendation of the party’s State committee. Ms. Thahiliya had violated the party discipline by publicly criticising the party and its leadership for the recent action against the State leaders of the Haritha, the women’s wing of the MSF. ‘Denied justice’ Ms. Thahiliya had said that former Haritha State general secretary T. Najma Thabsheera and president Mufeeda Thesni had been denied justice by the party. Ms. Thahiliya was found to have played a silent but solid role in the complaint of sexual harassment against MSF State leaders given by Ms. Thabsheera and nine others to the State Women’s Commission. Ms. Thabsheera and team refused to withdraw the complaint in spite of having been asked to do so by the IUML leadership because of the support they got from a section led by Ms. Thahiliya. The IUML first suspended the Haritha State committee and asked for an explanation from the MSF leaders. As the standoff between the Haritha and the MSF leaders continued, the IUML dismissed the Haritha State committee and reconstituted it. Ms. Thahiliya had criticised the party for the way it reconstituted the Haritha State committee. IUML State general secretary P.M.A. Salam said here on Monday that indiscipline would not be tolerated at any cost. Meanwhile, the newly constituted State committee of the Haritha met the leaders of the IUML and the Vanitha League here on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/iuml-sacks-national-vice-president-of-msf/article36444969.ece

Stilt walking by three brothers is a regular sight for the people of Cheloor, but not certainly for those from outside. For the local people, the sight of the siblings Anshad, Binshad, and Rabih Ali moving fast along the village paths on their 10-foot-long stilts continues to evoke curiosity in spite of their presence for months. The children of traditional Kalarippayattu expert Aboobacker and Mariyumma, the trio learned stilt walking from childhood. It took several years for them to perfect the art. They walk about 2 km without a break on stilts almost every day. Although they started with smaller stilts, they could increase the length of the stilts up to 10 feet through rigorous training. “Although it looks easy and curious for an onlooker, walking on stilts is not easy. It took us many months to learn and perfect this style of walking,” the trio said. They said they were continuing their efforts to increase the size of the stilts. They dedicate their holidays, weekends and mornings for training. The trio had captured attention first when they walked on stilts during a cultural procession held as part of the State School Arts Festival in Malappuram a few years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stilt-walking-is-no-tall-order-for-this-sibling-trio-from-malappuram/article36444922.ece

The city zoo and the children’s park will not open for the time being. Although the COVID-19 casegraph in the State has come down a bit, in the interests of animal safety, authorities will monitor the situation for two more weeks before taking a decision on reopening the zoo. The zoo and the museum were closed to the public on April 23, 2021 in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19. 25 persons On reopening, 25 persons will be allowed at a time at the Napier Museum and the Natural History Museum, and 20 at the Sree Chitra Art Gallery. Distancing will also be observed at the ticketing counters. Twenty-five persons will be given tickets, and only after a break of half-an-hour will the next 25 tickets be issued. Thermal scanners will be used to screen visitors, and sanitisers will be made available. Masks are compulsory. Staff at the ticketing counter will also be provided with face shields and gloves. People visiting the Botanical Garden will have to wear masks and walk in one direction. The ‘watch and ward’ staff on the premises have been trained in ensuring physical distancing. Vaccination of employees has been taken up after including the department on the priority list. Three homoeo camps for COVID-19 prevention have also been conducted. Nevertheless, those coming in direct contact with visitors will be asked to remain vigilant. Other employees will have to maintain physical distancing, zoo authorities said. If there is crowding in any area of the museums, visitors will be directed to other areas and allowed to return to the displays once the crowding has been controlled. There will be no change in the timings of the facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/museum-set-to-reopen-today/article36445146.ece

Though the team entrusted with the responsibility of identifying suitable land for the project had identified various private plots in different parts of the city, the prices quoted by the owners made it unviable for the Corporation. “The Corporation has decided to identify puramboke land or government-owned unused land within the Corporation limit, which can be used for constructing flats under the LIFE project. We will write to the village officers for information on such land,” said an official handling the LIFE project in the Corporation. The civic body had initially formed a search committee to identify land for constructing flats under the LIFE project. Outskirts The team had identified several pieces of land mostly in the outskirts of the city, close to the borders of the Corporation area. After the Corporation issued a call for suitable plots for construction of flats, many had also responded from different parts of the city. But a majority of them turned back as the rates offered by the civic body were much lower compared to the market rates. The civic body has been requesting the State government for more flexibility in the fixing of the rates, but there has been no response so far. The Fisheries Department had in 2019 issued such an order for some of its housing projects, enabling the acquisition of land at rates close to the market rates. Some of the lands which were identified with affordable prices were later found unsuitable, due to their location and slanted geography. The construction of a flat under the LIFE project is currently progressing in Poonkulam. The keys are expected to be handed over to the beneficiaries in the coming months. The land at Poonkulam was bought some years back using funds from the Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan. At Mannammoola The civic body is also making yet another attempt to construct flat complexes for landless and homeless SC families at an 1.72 acre plot of land at Mannammoola, which is now being occupied by a few families under the leadership of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Ambedkar Democratic Party of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/life-flats-corpn-scouts-for-puramboke-land/article36445152.ece
14 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSERC to hold online hearing tomorrow||The Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) will hold an online hearing on the draft KSERC (Terms and Conditions for Determination of Tariff) Regulations, 2021, on Wednesday. While the Commission is pushing for certain changes in the terms and conditions, the draft has drawn criticism, especially from the power sector unions, for its alleged pro-privatisation drift and the inclusion of clauses that are reportedly harmful to the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). The KSEB too is likely to formally convey its objections to the draft proposals at the hearing. The draft says that the retail supply tariff for each category of consumers of the different distribution business/ licensees in will be determined by the Commission ‘separately.’ Under the existing 2018 regulations, the retail supply tariffs are uniform. Another proposal is that the the Commission can allow the distribution licensee (the KSEB, for example) to sell surplus electricity to consumers instead of selling it in the open market. Open access consumers (industries) can purchase it at power exchange prices. The above proposals and a clause on ‘Average Power Purchase Cost’ (APPC) have drawn flak on the grounds that they could cripple the KSEB financially. APPC, as per the draft, is the rate at which the distribution licensee (KSEB) shall purchase excess energy injected into the power system by a renewable energy ‘prosumer.’ But critics point out that the APPC, which reportedly seeks to replace the current mechanism of ‘Average Pooled Cost of Power Purchase,’ will hurt the KSEB finances as it does not include the cost of KSEB’s own generation. Cross subsidy system KSEB unions fear that the decision to determine the retail tariffs of the different licencees ‘separately’ will hurt the present cross subsidy system and enable — once the proposed amendments to the Electricity Act get passed — private players in power distribution to ‘cherry-pick’ high-end consumers. The clause on surplus power sales, it is alleged, will, in effect, prevent the KSEB from earning some additional revenue after meeting the supply obligations to its consumers. The CITU-backed officers' and workers unions of the KSEB and the INTUC had come out against the draft saying that it supports the privatisation policies of the Central government. The online hearing will begin at 10.30 a.m.  The KSEB is likely to formally convey its objections to the draft proposals||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/draft-proposals-kserc-to-hold-hearing-tomorrow/article36444999.ece

The Russian House in Thiruvananthapuram organised a seminar to mark the 80th anniversary of the start of the siege, which refers to the German blockade of the Soviet city during the war. Destroyed Only the Russians truly understand how badly the siege destroyed the beautiful city, Yulya Orlyova, a doctor from St. Petersburg, said on Sunday. “'My grandmother, who had lost her father during the siege, used to tell us how her family had struggled in the days of winter without water, food, heating system and electricity. She is still alive. She was a child when the blockade began. She still remembers those days. My grandfather lost his brother,”' she said. Alexei Tarasov, vice-consul at the Consulate General of the Russian Federation, Chennai, inaugurated the seminar. The war had come quickly to Leningrad, he said. “'The 900 long days of hunger, cold, bombing, fierce fighting cannot be compared with any other horrifying incident in the history of humankind. Nearly one million people died during the Siege,” he said. Diary of Tania Ratheesh C. Nair, Honorary Consul, said the contents of the diary kept by 11-year-old Tania Savicheva captured the helplessness of the people. An entry in it read, “'The Savichevs are dead. Everyone is dead. Tania is all alone.” Kavitha Nair, Assistant Director, Russian House, welcomed the gathering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/siege-of-leningrad-remembered/article36445000.ece
14 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Kanam faces ‘flak’ for remarks about national leadership||Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary Kanam Rajendran reportedly faced inner-party dissension for purportedly criticising general secretary D. Raja in his public comments. Mr. Raja had appeared to second CPI leader Annie Raja’s controversial statement that the Kerala Police were patently misogynist and controlled by an “RSS gang.” The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party had interpreted the remark as a direct attack on Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who held the Home portfolio. Pressed about the matter last week, Mr. Rajendran pointed to the party mandate that national leaders should not comment on regional issues without keeping the State leadership in the loop. He also stated that party code applied to all members equally. The incident triggered speculation that CPI veteran K.E. Ismail had taken strong exception to Mr. Rajendran’s words and complained to the national leadership. Mr. Rajendran rejected the media speculation as mere conjecture. Poll campaign The CPI also critically examined its Assembly election campaign and flagged several flaws for future rectification. The campaign machinery failed the party in Idukki. The CPI’s campaign involving national leaders lacked lustre due to poor organisation. The CPI’s term limitation for MLAs saw several former legislators staying off the campaign trail. The vacuum was pronounced in Nattika, Mannarkkad and Peerumade. The CPI failed to resolve issues of hill farmers with local revenue and forest officials, prompting many Left Democratic Front (LDF) votes to gravitate to the United Democratic Front (UDF). The CPI review report also reportedly repudiated the Communist Party of India (Marxist) assessment that the Kerala Congress (M) inclusion had electorally benefited the LDF. The KC(M) defection did not cause any increase in the LDF’s vote share. Moreover, a sizeable section of LDF workers could not reconcile with Mr. Mani’s inclusion in the LDF and sided with Mani C. Kappan. The CPI also purportedly concluded that Congress candidate in Kundara, P.C. Vishnunath, endeared more to voters than his LDF rival and CPI(M) leader J. Mercykutty. The party flagged extensive scale erosion of LDF votes in Kottarakara, despite Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal’s win. The CPI had reviewed the report over the past week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kanam-faces-flak-for-remarks-about-national-leadership/article36444973.ece
14 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Actor Rizabawa passes away||Rarely has a Malayalam actor come to be identified for a single role he did early in his career as much as Rizabawa did as John Honai, the menacing villain from In Harihar Nagar that came out in 1990. So much so that when he passed away on Monday afternoon at the age of 55, the first reference almost everyone made was to John Honai, despite the more than hundred films and television serials Rizabawa acted in since. The actor was under treatment at a private hospital in Ernakulam for kidney-related ailments. He was under ventilator support for the past few days. Early start Rizabawa began acting during his school days, following in the footsteps of his father, Ismail, who was active in the theatre circuit. After a few years on the stage, Rizabawa made his silver screen debut in 1984 with Vishupakshi , which was never released. Six years later, he landed the male lead role of Pappan in Dr. Pasupathy , directed by Shaji Kailas. However, actor Innocent stole the limelight with the title role of a veterinary quack. Things took a turn with Siddique-Lal’s In Harihar Nagar that released the same year, which made Rizabawa a familiar face for the Malayali audience. Accompanied by S. Balakrishnan’s catchy background score that was played every time John Honai appeared on the screen, Rizabawa stole the show with his chilling villainy in the comic caper. Since then, he has acted in more than 120 films, in character roles as well as that of the antagonist. However, none of these perhaps managed to catch the eye quite like John Honai did, although the actor did put up commendable performances. His popular films include Aanaval Mothiram , Kabooliwala , Aniyan Bava Chettan Bava , Pokkiri Raja , Georgekutty C/o Georgekutty , Vismayathumbathu , Nerariyan CBI , Cover Story , Hallo , Paradesi and Bandhukkal Shathrukkal . He was last seen on the big screen in the Mammootty-starrer One , released earlier this year. He also acted in several television serials. Dubbing works Rizabawa put his voice to good use as a dubbing artiste as well. He secured the State Film Award for the best dubbing artiste for Karmayogi starring Indrajith Sukumaran in the lead, lending his voice for Thalaivasal Vijay. Condoling his death, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that Rizabawa had found a place in the hearts of Malayalis through some notable characters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/actor-rizabawa-passes-away/article36444975.ece

A woman from Kollam had submitted a request at the Kottayam district office of the PSC for removal of name from the rank list of another person, who had a similar name, initials and date of birth. She had used the other person’s register number too for the purpose. According to a press release from the PSC, this application was attested by a gazetted officer and a notary. The PSC had also taken further steps based on this. However, after the fraudulent action came to light, a meeting of the Commission held on Monday decided to issue an appointment advice to the person who actually secured the rank.

Thiruvananthapuram Fast Track Special Judge R. Jayakrishnan pronounced the verdict against Sreekumaran Nair of Karipur near Malayinkeezhu who was found guilty of the crime committed against a minor girl who had travelled in his autorickshaw. He was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10000 under Section 354 (assault to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), five years’ imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25000 under Section 8 (sexual assault of minor) of POCSO, and two years’ imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10000 under Section 12 (sexual harassment of minor) of POCSO. A default of the fines would lead to additional imprisonment of three months, six months and three months respectively. The sentences will run concurrently and the victim will receive the compensation. The case pertained to an incident that occurred in the city on August 3, 2017 when the victim was 16-years-old. According to the prosecution led by special public prosecutor Vijay Mohan R., the autorickshaw driver sexually harassed the victim when she was travelling in his vehicle from Narmada in Kowdiar to go to her tuition centre at Jawahar Nagar. Sreekumaran Nair, who held her hand and tried to kiss her, later flashed at her when she got out of the autorickshaw. 11 witnesses The court examined 11 witnesses and 15 exhibits during the course of the trial. The case had been investigated by the then Museum Circle Inspector K.S. Prasanth and Cantonment Circle Inspector M. Prasad, who had officiated as in-charge of Museum Circle Inspector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/auto-driver-gets-10-years-ri-for-harassing-minor-girl/article36445149.ece

He was speaking on the Navakeralam action plan at the Aardram State executive committee meeting here on Monday. He said that apart from the current palliative care services, the Health Department needed to create facilities for geriatric health care. All State health facilities should engage groups of healthcare workers to regularly visit the elderly within their jurisdiction and take care of their special needs. Mr. Vijayan said that the government will consider making available, essential drugs for rare and serious diseases at subsidised costs in the State. Health check-ups Annual health check-ups should be conducted for all in the State for detecting non communicable diseases early. Those who do not come forward voluntarily for health check-ups should be persuaded to do so through special campaigns. Rather than allow people to avoid health check-ups, efforts should be to participate the maximum number of people in all health initiatives, he added. Local bodies should conduct campaigns on their own to encourage people for early detection. Lab and tele medicine facilities should be increased and accent should also be given on the early detection of cancer, Mr. Vijayan, said. He directed that community health centres be strengthened and that the Health Department join hands with the State Council for Science and Technology for initiating research studies in the context of new and emerging diseases in the State. The work on the elimination of TB, Malaria and Filariasis should be strengthened.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pay-special-attention-to-the-care-of-the-elderly-cm/article36445141.ece

14 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Steps on to reform Forest dept.: Minister||Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran has pledged efforts to reform the Forest Department in tune with the present times. Speaking at a convocation ceremony of forest officers at the Forest Training Institute in Arippa on Monday, Mr. Saseendran said various activities being undertaken by the department would be strengthened with modern technology. Stressing on the role of forest officials, he said the welfare of mankind should be considered tantamount to the protection of wildlife and forests. Efforts will be made to enable the forest force to work for the progress of forest-dependent communities. Caution Claiming that the State was far ahead of others in terms of wildlife conservation, the Minister raised caution about the increasing prevalence of man-animal conflict. An efficient mechanism must be evolved to mitigate such conflicts by maintaining the delicate ecological balance.

14 September 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||An ode to a diehard fan||Those who pass by Sankarankulangara Junction in Thrissur city cannot miss a makeshift shrine under a banyan tree. Among gods of all religions, one can find the photo of a smiling Mammootty too. This is the place where Mammootty Subran, an ardent fan of actor Mammootty, spent his day and night, except for the working hours. At the peak of his obsession for the actor, Subramanyan, a headload worker, changed his name to Mammootty Subran. And, when the diehard admirer passed away two days ago, the star took the lead in paying tributes. Numbers tell a tale Subran watched Mammootty’s Amaram 96 times at Ragam Theatre, Thrissur, until the theatre management stopped him from watching it again. “The film was shown for 101 days in the theatre and the management stopped me when I went on the 97th day,” Subran used to tell his friends. He watched Valsalyam 36 times and Vadakkan Veeragatha 26 times. He had watched each and every movie of Mammootty. But his favourite was Amaram . “That opening scene of Mammootty with a child in his hand is unforgettable,” he used to say. Subran, who was not a member of any fans’ associations of the actor, was, however, close to him. He proudly showed his friends photos in which Mammootty was riding pillion on his scooter. A dream unfulfilled Subran, who took a lot of lottery tickets, had a dream. “If I win the lottery, I will make a movie. The story will be about a father and his three sons. I will play the father’s role and my sons will be Mammootty, Mohanlal and Suresh Gopi,” he used to say. He died without fulfilling his dream. Though Subran, who complained of chest pain and collapsed, was rushed to hospital, his life could not be saved. Mammootty, who called V. Athira, Punkunnam division councillor, to inquire about Subran’s death wrote an emotional note on Facebook: “Subran, whom I have known for many years, passed away. The demise of Subran, who changed his name to Mammootty Subran in his love towards me, is painful. Tributes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ode-to-a-mammootty-fan/article36444920.ece

14 September 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||T.N. Assembly passes Bill against NEET||The Tamil Nadu Assembly on Monday passed a Bill seeking to ‘dispense’ with the requirement for candidates to qualify in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to undergraduate medical courses in the State. The Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021 further sought to provide admission to these courses on the basis of the marks obtained in the qualifying examination [Class XII marks in Tamil Nadu] through “normalisation methods”, as was done before 2017. [Two similar legislation passed in the Assembly during the erstwhile AIADMK regime did not receive the Presidential assent.] The Bill, moved by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, contended that admission to medical courses was traceable to entry 25 of List III, Schedule VII of the Constitution, and the State was “competent to regulate” the same for the underprivileged social groups. While the principal Opposition party, the AIADMK, extended its support to the State government in passing the Bill, BJP members staged a walkout. “It [NEET] festers inequality as it favours the rich and the more privileged class of society, who are able to afford special coaching apart from pursuing Class XII. It virtually barricades the underprivileged social groups from medical and dental education,” the Bill contended. It argued that NEET was against the equality clause enshrined in the Constitution. After the UG course, students from the affluent class do not serve in rural areas, and often pursue postgraduate courses abroad, it said, adding that the number of serving doctors in the State was declining. It also termed ‘spurious’ the suggestion that NEET improved the standard of medical education. “The standard of medical education is maintained during the UG course by following the syllabus and curriculum prescribed by the National Medical Commission and through exams conducted by the university before awarding the degree. Students who are not able to pass the university exams are not awarded degrees. Therefore, it is not during the admission stage that the standard of medical education is maintained,” the Bill argued. The Bill said its aim was to ensure social justice, uphold equality and equal opportunity, protect all vulnerable student communities from discrimination and bring them into the mainstream of medical and dental education and, in turn, ensure robust public healthcare across Tamil Nadu, particularly in the rural areas. The government’s decision followed a report from a high-level committee, headed by the retired High Court judge, Justice A.K. Rajan, which said NEET had “clearly undermined” the diverse societal representation in MBBS and higher medical studies, favouring mainly the affluent segment of society, while thwarting the dream of the underprivileged social groups to pursue medical education. The panel concluded that if NEET continued for a few more years, the healthcare system of Tamil Nadu would be “very badly affected, and there may not be enough doctors” to be posted at Primary Health Centres or government hospitals, and the rural and urban poor may not be able to join the medical courses. It was in favour of immediate steps to eliminate NEET from being used in admission to medical programmes “at all levels”. It further contended that NEET was not a fair or equitable method of admission, since it ‘favoured’ the rich and elite sections of society. The most affected groups were the students of Tamil medium; students having a rural background; those from government schools; those whose parental income was less than Rs. 2.5 lakh per annum; and socially disadvantaged groups like the Most Backward Classes (MBCs), the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and the Scheduled Tribes (STs). Based on the report, the State government decided that admission to undergraduate courses in medicine, dentistry, Indian medicine and homoeopathy in the State shall be made only based on the marks obtained in the qualifying examination (Plus-Two).  “It [NEET] festers inequality as it favours the rich and the more privileged class of society, who are able to afford special coaching apart from pursuing Class XII.

Announcing this at a review meeting with the Department of Skill Development and Training (SDT) on Monday, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy asked the officials to start the works for the skill university proposed in Visakhapatnam immediately. “The training and teaching in these colleges will help the students hone their skills in coding, languages, robotics and IoT. The State government is planning to strengthen the work from home concept in villages by providing internet facilities,” said the Chief Minister. He said that a synergy would be maintained between the skill development colleges and the work-from-home concept, which would result in better employment opportunities with good salaries for the youth. “The courses designed to hone skills should be revolutionary and the classrooms in skill development colleges should be innovative,” he said. ‘Upgrade syllabus’ The Chief Minister asked the officials to tailor the ITIs to the industry requirements and upgrade the syllabus. “The officials must explore the ways to forge tie-ups between every ITI in the State and prestigious institutions such as National Academy of Construction. Focus should be on training and developing skills of school dropouts. The data pertaining to the youth who have undergone skill development training should be given to the new industries. The officials must ensure that 75% of jobs are provided to locals,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Pointing out that there was a need to hone skills such as maintenance and repair of equipment of drinking water plants, motors, solar power units and equipment used for sewage treatment plants, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy asked the officials to prepare a plan to provide skilled human resources for maintenance of the new medical colleges and hospitals. Steps should be taken to improve the proficiency of students in English language. The Chief Minister instructed the officials to initiate measures to set up one ITI college in each Assembly constituency and focus on basic facilities in private ITI colleges and to obtain certification for those on the standards of government. “The officials must ensure adequate staff in government ITIs and examine the status of teaching staff in government polytechnics and engineering colleges,” he said. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the District Collectors should take steps to ensure apprenticeship facility was provided to trained youth.

14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC rejects Telangana’s plea on idol immersion in Hussainsagar||Observing that it “cannot permit pollution of water”, Telangana High Court on Monday turned down the State government’s plea to allow immersion of Ganesh idols made of Plaster of Paris (PoP) in Hussainsagar for “this year”. A bench of Acting Chief Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao and Justice T. Vinod Kumar rejected an interlocutory application filed by GHMC Commissioner seeking modification of the bench’s order on the matter four days ago. Last Thursday, the bench had passed a slew of directions, including ban on immersion of PoP Ganesh idols in Hussainsagar and other lakes. GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar, who filed the application, stated that it “would take considerable time and huge expenditure” to enforce the bench’s directions. “It is a time consuming process” and required a “policy decision of the State government” to implement the instructions. When Special Government Pleader Harender Prashad requested the bench to modify its earlier order, Acting CJ told him that the government had time from July 2020 to this July to create infrastructure for immersion of idols without causing any pollution. “It is the duty of bureaucracy to anticipate problems, find solutions and implement them,” he observed. He reminded the SGP that in three earlier counter affidavits, the GHMC had expressed its preparedness for the event stating that baby ponds were created for immersion of idols. “Now, you come to the court stating those ponds were not big enough and adequate in number for immersion of idols,” he said. Height of idols The bench noted that GHMC did not explain then idols of what height could be immersed in such baby ponds. “You gave an impression that all idols can be immersed in them...It is a little bit misleading….you did not place before court all relevant facts,” the Acting CJ said. Referring to GHMC’s request to modify order over ban on immersion of idols from Tank Bund side, the bench sought to know how much public money was spent on recent innovation of Tank Bund. The bench said money was spent on erecting vintage lamps, laying new tiles and developing gardens on Tank Bund. The bench disagreed with the SGP’s contention that National Green Tribunal did not completely ban usage of PoP idols. It told the SGP that after the NGT order, Central Pollution Control Board had issued guidelines declaring that PoP idols were not ideal for usage and that they cause environmental pollution.

14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Reopen IT firms, urges Telangana Health Dept.||Officials of the State Health department have urged the managements of IT companies in Hyderabad to call employees back to their respective offices, which have been shut since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in March last year. The IT employees have been working from home since then. A similar request by the State IT department to resume work from office in the fourth week of July had met with fears and concerns related to safety on the part of the employees. Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao on Monday requested the managements to resume work from office, stating that the employees and their family members are 100% vaccinated and that the daily COVID caseload is on the decline. “Apart from your employees, livelihoods to lakhs of people are dependent on the IT companies, such as food vendors. The State’s economy improves if our livelihoods improve. The Health department requests the managements concerned to reopen offices,” said Dr Srinivasa Rao. A representation was sent to the State IT department as well as the companies. In July, employees of the companies in Hyderabad had expressed reservations about returning to offices, saying that they do not feel safe and fear passing on the infection to their family members. Many opined that reopening the offices and schools might pave the way for the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, while asking who will take care of their children staying back at home since schools had not reopened then. Dr Srinivasa Rao said that there have been no clusters or outbreak of COVID cases in the three months after the most recent lockdown was lifted in the State. The number of tests in a day ranged from 60,000 to 1 lakh, and positivity rate stood at 0.4%. It has been around 10 days that schools, colleges, and other educational institutions were reopened in the State. The turnout of students is 45% in government schools abd around 25% in private schools. “Our health staff has screened 1.15 lakh people and only 55 students have tested positive. There have been no cluster of cases in schools, and we have not yet come across a school where more than five cases were reported,” the senior health officer said.  Livelihoods to lakhs of people are dependent on the IT companies. The State’s economy improves if our livelihoods improve. G.

Mr. Kannababu said Rs. 23.30 crore compensation had been disbursed to the families of the farmers who ended their lives due to agrarian distress, while the same had been denied by the previous TDP government. “A total of 32 farmers committed suicide in 2021 which is far less compared to the figures during the TDP regime (2014-19). The farmers’ distress has been addressed with various initiatives over the past two years, leading to a sharp fall in suicides,” said Mr. Kannababu. “The government has enrolled 1.2 crore farmers in the e-crop system, assuring them every entitlement, including procurement of harvest and insurance coverage,” he said. Mr. Kannababu said crop loans worth Rs. 1.48 lakh crore would be given to farmers, including tenant farmers, in the agriculture year 2021-22. Crop insurance was being offered free of cost while the TDP government charged 2-5% for food and commercial crops. Responding to the TDP’s allegations, the Minister said, “I was born in an agricultural family and have witnessed the toil and sweat of farmers. I do not find any reason to prove my association with farming and knowledge of farmers’ issues.” Agri markets Mr. Kannababu said Rs. 212 crore had been earmarked for renovating agriculture markets under Nadu-Nedu. An exclusive online marketing system would soon be introduced to ensure better prices for farmers. “The construction of 81 agriculture testing labs is in progress. It is intended that every agricultural input, including seeds, should be tested at the laboratory before being supplied to farmers,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-steps-helped-curb-farmer-suicides-minister/article36445083.ece

14 September 2021||KOTTAYAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Narcotic jihad’ row: more support pours in for Pala Bishop||Days after Pala Bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt set off a controversy with his remarks about jihad by way of love and narcotics, the issue continued to boil over on Monday with more support pouring in for the prelate. Addressing mediapersons here on Monday, Bharatiya Janata Party State president K.Surendran said the party would not stand as mute spectator to attempts to intimidate the bishop. He also highlighted the need for society to discuss and debate on the subject. “What the bishop has said is a relevant issue and the BJP does not want to cash in on it politically. At the same time, we will not stand as silent spectators if a few goons from Erattupetta stage protest in Pala and issue threats to the bishop,” he said. Ample evidence: BJP Asserting that there were ample evidence for the existence of narcotic jihad, he accused the United Democratic Front and Left Democratic Front for finding fault with the bishop to appease extremists. During the day, a delegation from the BJP comprising senior leaders P.K. Krishnadas and A.N. Radhakrishnan visited Mar Joseph Kallarangatt at the Bishop’s House at Pala. Concern over conversion Meanwhile, the Nair Service Society (NSS) came up with a statement expressing concern over the forced conversion of girls. “That the terrorist activity of forced religious conversion of girls using the weapon of love or other means is indeed a matter of concern. The State and Union governments have the responsibility to find out and quell such elements,” read the statement issued by G.Sukumaran Nair, general secretary of the organisation. Earlier, Deepika daily, mouthpiece of the church, published an article by Metropolitan Archbishop Mar Joseph Perumthottam in support of the Pala bishop. “There are a few elements who are defrauding women by pretending love and in the cover of married life to abuse them for other purposes. It could be narcotics trafficking, terrorism, religious fundamentalism, or even prostitution. No matter if it is love jihad or narcotic jihad, enslavement to such elements on one’s own or by force or fraud is dangerous to any family or any community,” noted the Archbishop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/more-support-pours-in-for-pala-bishop/article36444487.ece

Later, speaking to the media, Mr. Raju turned philosophical and said, “History is replete with people going to jail for different reasons. Lord Krishna was born in jail, Mahatma Gandhi had gone to jail several times and Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy also went to jail. The reason for their going to jail is an open secret.” Replying to a query, he said let the State government come out with the survey numbers of the lands, which it claims were missing from the records, which had caused thousands of crores of rupees loss to the temple. He also said that the temple authorities had declined to give him details of the lands saying it was a ‘secret’. He also alleged that the attacks on temples have increased after the YSR Congress Party government had come to power. Commenting on the temple getting the ISO recognition recently, he said that recognition could not be achieved in a day and it was the result of the hard work of successive EOs over the years. He also advised the officials to take measures that the recognition was safeguarded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-should-reveal-survey-nos-of-missing-temple-lands-says-ashok/article36445189.ece
14 September 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Faculty shortage main reason for fall in AU ranking’||A number of factors, including shortage of teaching staff, have pulled down Andhra University in the recently released NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) ranking. In the overall ranking, AU slipped to the 48th position in the current year from 36th in 2020. In the ranking under universities, it stood 24 against 19 and under the engineering colleges category, its rank fell to 74 from 69. One of the main reasons for the oldest and the biggest State-owned university’s fall in ranking is said to be the shortage of teaching staff. The university has not recruited a single permanent teaching staff member in the last one decade and those present have retired over the years, reducing the staff strength from the sanctioned 1,200 to 341. Teacher-student ratio Till about 2020, the permanent teaching staff strength was around 356 and at present it is 241. The teacher-student ratio has fallen from 64 to 58. In some departments such as history there is no permanent faculty and in key departments such as physics and chemistry, the show is being run by one or two permanent professors. “Though AU has recruited about 450 contract and guest faculty this cannot better the rank, as the assessment is based on permanent postings,” said the Vice-Chancellor Prof. P.V.G.D. Prasad Reddy. The availability of permanent teaching faculty has added benefit as their research publications are also taken into account in the ranking framework. This deficiency also contributed to the lower rank, he added. However, the nine-decade-old university fared well in the external perceptions and this was the saving grace, he said. Fund scarcity The Vice-Chancellor also felt that it was difficult for State-owned public universities to compete with private ones as there was disparity in all aspects right from funding to liberty in recruitment. “Even Central universities have good funding, but our funds are meagre,” he remarked. Though the State government had given clearance to recruit 469 teachers, the issue has been pending in the court for the past few years. It is learnt that AU is mulling to recruit teachers on tenure-based criteria and use the services of the teachers from aided colleges who have been surrendered to the State government. “If the government agrees, then at least 10 to 15 of them can be taken on deputation by AU,” said Prof. Prasad Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/faculty-shortage-main-reason-for-fall-in-au-ranking/article36445086.ece

14 September 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Resident welfare associations oppose ‘true-up’ charges||Leaders of the Visakhapatnam Apartment Residents Welfare Association (VARWA) and the NIVAS (Visakha Residential Colony Associations’ Federation) have demanded that the government bear the ‘true-up’ charges, instead of taxing the electricity consumers. A demonstration was staged jointly by the representatives of the two associations at the corporate office of the Eastern Power Distribution Company of AP Ltd. (AP EPDCL) at Seethammadhara here on Monday. The participants, braving the incessant rain, held a banner and raised slogans opposing the recovery of charges from consumers and opposing electricity reforms. Later, a delegation of the VARWA and the NIVAS submitted a memorandum to the Chairman and Managing Director appealing to him to withdraw ‘true-up’ charges. VARWA general secretary B.B. Ganesh and president N. Prakash Rao said that increasing the tariff for consumers during the pandemic time was inhuman. G.S. Rajeswara Rao of Jeevan Soudha Apartments, VARWA general secretary V.V. Prabhakar and NIVAS general secretary C. Narayana Murthy were among those who participated in the protest. The VARWA and NIVAS leaders said it was distressing to note that Rs. 3,669 crore was being collected from people of the State towards ‘true-up’ charges. The additional charges on consumers of the EPDCL are fixed at Rs. 0.42 paise a unit from September, 2021 to March, 2022. They expressed shock that an additional Rs. 2,452 crore would be collected from the consumers for additional losses incurred by Discoms during 2019-20. CPI stages protest CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy has wondered as to how Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who had criticised the hike in electricity tariff by the previous government can resort to the same after assuming power. He was speaking at a protest organised by the party at the EPDCL Office, opposite Green Park hotel, on Monday as part of the State-wide protests. At a separate protest at Pendurthy, CPI city secretary M. Pydiraju and R. Srinivas Rao participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/resident-welfare-associations-oppose-true-up-charges/article36445183.ece

Associate Director of the Mysore-based Defence Food Research Lab (DFRL) R. Kumar visited the AU and held talks with Vice-Chancellor P.V.G.D. Prasad Reddy in this regard on Monday. The V-C gave details of the proposed lab to Dr. Kumar. He said that organising food testing was being taken up by AU for the first time. The lab, to be set up with Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) funds, would conduct analysis and research apart from testing of food. He also explained about the progress of the pharma testing and genetic testing labs, being set up by the university. He expressed optimism that the partnership with the DRDO would help in conducting research, which could meet the needs of the nation. The DFRL Associate Director spoke on the technical know-how and basic requirements for the testing lab.

Kulkarni from the Infectious Disease Section of Baylor College of Medicine, the USA. He was speaking at a webinar organised by the Andhra Medical College. He pointed out that due to the delta variant the average daily infections in India have come down to about 33,000 per day in this month, while there is surge in the USA. In India it peaked during April to July, but now it is steady and that is a good sign, unless and until if there is a third wave. He also expressed happiness on the vaccination rate in India. “Despite being a country of over 1.3 billion, about 15% is fully vaccinated and about 40% have taken at least one jab,” he said. Dr. Kulkarni cautioned about breakthrough infection, which is nothing but getting infected after the second dose. Though the percentage is very small, but the Delta variant is still prevalent and the only way to stay safe is by adhering to the COVID appropriate behaviour, said Andhra Medical College Principal P.V. Sudhakar. 52 new cases The district recorded 52 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, as on Monday morning, taking the cumulative count of cases to 1,56,332.

14 September 2021||Bengaluru,TELANGANA||CFR still highest in 90-99 age group||Despite the drastic decline in the number of COVID-19 deaths in the State, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) continues to be highest in the 90-99 age group. From 11.4% on July 13, the CFR in this age group rose to 12.1% on August 13 and has remained the same since then. While the fatality rate has remained constant among senior citizens of three groups — above 60 years, above 70, and above 80 — for the last three months, it has seen an increase in the centenarians group, from 4.8% on July 13 to 5.75% on September 12. Despite their vulnerability, the rate of infection is not very high among senior citizens. Senior citizens have accounted for a mere 14.5% of the total 29,61,735 positive cases (as of September 12). However, nearly 57% of the 37,504 COVID-19 deaths in the State reported till September 12 were from this susceptible group. A look at the absolute numbers shows that the highest number of deaths (10,765) have been reported in the 60-69 age group, while the highest number of infections (6,79,510) have been reported in the 30-39 age group. As many as 64 of the 92,630 infected children in the 0-9 age group and 93 of the 2,29,355 infected children in the 10-19 age group have succumbed to the disease so far.  Anoop Amarnath, member of Karnataka’s COVID critical care support unit, who heads the Department of Geriatric Medicine at Manipal Hospitals, said the high CFR in the nonagenarian group was because of the low absolute numbers. While this age group comprising the very elderly population is highly susceptible because of comorbidities, the pattern of infection during the second wave was different from last year’s outbreak, he said. “During the second wave, both the ascent and descent were rapid. Moreover, certain complications such as mucormycosis, stroke, and cardiac issues that patients developed post-COVID during the first wave were reported during the active phase of the infection in the second wave,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, attributed the high CFR in this age group to multiple age-related advanced comorbidities and geriatric issues. “While one of the potential reasons for the high mortality in the 90-99 age group is the high rate of disease progression, we have noticed many patients as well as their families refusing hospital admission for treatment,” he said. Dr. Manjunath added that case severity and mortality were considerably low among the vaccinated. Late presentation State Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said the death audit committee had found that 70% of those who have succumbed to COVID-19 had comorbidities, and most of them reported late. He said that the rate of decline in the condition of the elderly was rapid once they landed with moderate/severe infection. “The high CFR in this group is because of the low absolute numbers,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cfr-still-highest-in-90-99-age-group/article36444600.ece

Directions for the same have been issued by Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MA&UD) K.T.

14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Sanjay joins issue with Chief Minister||Telangana BJP president and Member of Parliament Bandi Sanjay Kumar joined issue with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao asking farmers not to go for paddy in the next agriculture season on the premise that the Centre has restricted to 60 lakh tonnes procurement only. “Why drag and blame the Centre for your failures? Who asked you to sign agreement for procurement of 60 lakh tonnes only instead of asking the entire produce be purchased? Why can't the TRS government procure 20 lakh tonnes of paddy for the State needs?,” he asked on Monday. Addressing a public meeting at Pothamsettipally in Medak as part of his ongoing 17th day of ‘Praja Sangrama Yatra’ along with former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh, the BJP leader said Mr. Rao has been changing his stance on agriculture issues often - cheating farmers with double speak and putting them in a quandary. “Till recently, he called for stopping cotton cultivation and retracted, the same vein continued with paddy on cultivating fine varieties. Did he not assure buying every single grain that is produced in Telangana? He wants to cover up his own inefficiency by transferring the blame on the Centre," he charged. While the Centre has been regularly enhancing the minimum support price and providing subsidy to the farmers, the government here has been denying the same benefit here. On top of it, there is no government help to farmers in distress following the recent heavy rains, he said. The area has been deprived of proper irrigation facilities despite Manjira river. The TRS government has failed the farmers in the last seven years and Mr. Rao has to apologise to the people for not fulfilling election-eve promises. The government has been able to build just 12,000 houses when the Centre had granted three lakh, the BJP is ready to get more houses sanctioned, he said. “There are no double-bedroom houses, no jobs and no stipend to the unemployed youth. Everyday we see attacks on the poor and disadvantaged groups. I demand the resignation of the Home Minister by accepting moral responsibility for the rape and murder of six-year-old girl,” said Mr. Sanjay Kumar. The party chief stated the BJP does not discriminate in providing welfare or development schemes to people -- be it in supply of subsidised rice, toilets construction, road development, water supply etc., but will not tolerate any kind of “insult” to the majority community, he said. He claimed the people of Telangana have realised that Mr. Rao has taken them for a ride. Mr. Raman Singh said the countdown for the downfall of the TRS regime has begun and expressed the confidence that the BJP will form the government after 2023 polls. “Corruption and single family rule has stopped the development of Telangana. None of the promises made in TRS manifesto have been implemented,” he said. Dubbak MLA M. Raghunandan Rao and others participated in the meeting. ‘No appointment’ Later, in the evening Union Minister of State for Agriculture Shobha Karandlaje also joined Mr. Sanjay Kumar’s programme and interacted with the employees of the shut down Nizam Sugar Factory. They presented a memorandum seeking revival and complained that the TRS government did not take any steps to reopen the unit despite making assurances during the agitation for separate State. Talking to the media, the Minister charged that the Chief Minister did not give her appointment when she was wanted to meet and discuss agriculture and farmers issues with him. “Where is Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao? He has been sitting at home and ruling. How many people has he met in last seven years? He has only cheated people with false promises. We will definitely take action against his corrupt rule at the right time,” she claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sanjay-joins-issue-with-chief-minister/article36444903.ece
14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Enhance support to farm sector’||Telangana government has requested the Centre to enhance funding given for agriculture and allied sectors in the State at least by 10 times as on an average the yearly support is only Rs. 800 crore now. In a representation submitted to Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shobha Karandlaje, who is on a visit to Hyderabad, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy said the State government had spent over Rs. 50,000 crore over the last four years for farmers’ security and investment support under Rythu Bima and Rythu Bandhu schemes. In seven phases of investment support given under Rythu Bandhu, Rs. 43,037 crore amount was credited into the bank accounts of 60.84 lakh landholding farmers. Similarly, Rs. 3,017 crore was paid to the families of 60,340 farmers following their death, irrespective of the reason, at the rate of Rs. 5 lakh per deceased farmer’s family, under the Rythu Bima group life insurance scheme. Under the PM-KISAN, 35.19 lakh farmers were given an assistance of Rs. 5,443.02 crore in Telangana so far. He brought to the Union Minister’s notice that although Telangana’s geography was only 3.4% of the country’s total area, the cultivation of crops was going in 4.65% of the country’s extent in Telangana and its share in the production of foodgrains was 9.9%. He appealed to the Union Minister to consider Telangana’s case as special, taking into consideration its success in the agriculture sector over the last seven years with the help of proactive policies of the State government and enhance funding at least by 10 times to the current support.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/enhance-support-to-farm-sector/article36444896.ece
14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||First MRSAM system handed over to Air Force chief||It was yet another triumphant moment for the APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex here when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh handed over the first Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (MRSAM) System to Indian Air Force (IAF) chief R.K.S. Bhadauria, earlier this week in the presence of Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) chairman G. Satheesh Reddy. Scientists at the Kalam Complex, including those at Research Centre Imarat (RCI) housed inside, had played a key role in making this advanced missile in association with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). “It is the true success of a synergistic effort put in by defence public sector and private sector units, respective scientists and technologists over the last dozen years with RCI being the nodal lab,” said senior defence officials on Saturday. More than 100 medium, micro and small scale industries were involved in the project, most of them based in and around the capital here, but which cannot be named. This has also helped in scaling up technologies and skill to global standards, they claimed. The lush green 4,000 acre missile complex conceived by former president Kalam also houses the Advanced Systems Laboratory (ASL) and the Defence Research & Development Lab and it has been in the forefront in the development of the strategic missile development projects including avionics over the years. Incidentally, Indian Navy has already inducted its version of MRSAM and this latest version has been tweaked to meet IAF needs with a hat-trick of successful trials for “accuracy, reliability and efficacy” conducted five years ago at Balasore. “An Army version of the missile is in the advanced stage of development,” informed senior officials. With BDL the lead production partner, IAF has contracted for 18 firing units with each consisting of 24 missiles each. MRSAM system provides point and area air defence for ground assets against threats from fighter aircraft, UAVs, helicopters, guided and unguided munitions, subsonic and supersonic cruise missiles. It is capable of engaging multiple targets at ranges up to 70 km and is powered by indigenously developed rocket motor and control system for achieving high manoeuvrability.

14 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Bansilalpet stepwell on path of resurrection||Perhaps after decades, the carved idol inside a grotto of the Bansilalpet stepwell was worshipped on Friday. The carving of Ganesh and that of Hanuman have been exposed as the well is being restored by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) in tandem with The Rainwater Project. The stepwell in Bansilalpet was one of the sources of water for Gandhi Hospital. “The well went into disuse in the early 80s after a few people committed suicide. When we began restoration, there was a talk about filling it up and turn it into a parking lot. That’s when we stepped in,” says Kalpana Ramesh, who is part of the restoration effort. “We have carted out nearly 500 tonnes of debris from it. According to the residents, this is 60 feet deep and we have reached only 35 feet,” said a GHMC worker supervising the clean up. “Over the past one month, 150 trucks have carted the debris. It would be humanly impossible to clean up with human labour and that’s why we deployed an earthmover,” said the GHMC supervisor. The debris being removed included building waste, film reels, plastic, discarded furniture, used tyres and electrical waste. The stone gallery on the right side of the entrance has collapsed and scaffoldings have been erected on the left gallery. At a higher level, the corbels show horses and coiled snakes. “When I first visited this place only the hint of the arches was visible. Initially, the GHMC did the clean-up manually. The trash was packed under the arches and inside the galleries,” says Kalpana Ramesh of The Rainwater Project. “This well is between the Nalla Pochamma and Yerra Pochamma Temple. Water from this well used to be drawn for the ablution of the goddesses,” says Parvathamma, who grew up in the area and her in-laws house overlooks the well. “Water from the well was supplied to Gandhi Hospital and other residential areas. This area was developed by Seth Bansilal to house people who lost properties during road widening,” informs Parvathamma. The colony was developed by Seth Bansilal, a wealthy benefactor of his era, around the stepwell and a playground with small houses surrounding it in one part of Bhoiguda village. Some of the houses still carry the numbering that was created at that time. Then the area got rechristened as Bansilalpet. Even as late as 2003, the colony retained its basic structure. In January 1938, when the British Viceroy Linlithgow visited Hyderabad, he made it a point to visit the Bansilalpet Model Village. Linlithgow was received by among others Seth Pannalal Bansilal and Seth Goverdhan Lal Bansilal, the sons of Seth Bansilal. Now the grand ceremonial entrance is a tawdry opening occupied by sundry shops selling pan, tea and snacks. The only marker is the foundation stone that was laid by a British Resident on February 13, 1933. According to an initial study by historians, the well may predate the construction of the residential colony by Seth Bansilal. “We need to know the full structure of the well and the construction style. We cannot reach a conclusion just by looking at the superficial structure,” said an architectural historian researching the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bansilalpet-stepwell-on-the-path-of-resurrection/article36444887.ece

14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Dalit Bandhu like scheme for other sections||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the Dalit Bandhu like programme for SCs would be extended to poor among other communities in a serial order after the programme reached saturation levels for SCs. Mr. Rao announced this at a meeting to discuss arrangements for the implementation of Dalit Bandhu programme of promoting entrepreneurship among SCs in four more mandals. The programme which was launched in Mr. Rao’s adopted village of Vasalamarri in Bhongir district and poll-bound Huzurabad constituency has been extended on pilot basis to Tirumalagiri mandal in Tungaturthy constituency, Chintakani in Madhira constituency, Charagonda mandal of Atchampet - Kalwakurthy constituencies and Nizamsagar of Jukkal constituency. Funds for these mandals would be released in a phased manner in two to three weeks, he said. Mr. Rao added that Dalit Bandhu was not a routine programme. It was never attempted in the past by any Central or State governments. Telangana had set a firm goal to ensure the uplift of SCs through the programme. Budget for the purpose would be released in phases throughout the State. Mr. Rao asked officials to adopt a parental approach for the development of SCs. It was up to the literate youth among SCs to shoulder the responsibility. About one lakh youth will be involved in various implementation committees. Resource persons will be picked up from these committees. He criticised the disinformation campaign against the government that it was pampering SC communities by extending several welfare programmes. The government had not neglected any community. The Rytu Bandhu programme was implemented across communities irrespective of caste and religion. Since there was good response to setting up of dairy units under the programme, Mr. Rao asked Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar to convene a joint meeting of SC welfare department, animal husbandry department and government run cooperative dairies to discuss the modalities. The meeting was also addressed by Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka who represented Madhira constituency, former Minister Motkupalli Narasimhulu and MLC Goreti Venkanna also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dalit-bandhu-like-scheme-for-other-sections-of-society-too/article36444908.ece
14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Kaleshwaram PH under construction submerges in SRSP water||The Sarangapur pump house under construction near Nizamabad as part of the Link-VII of Kaleshwaram Project submerged in water on Sunday as the flood water (backwater) of Sriramsagar Project flooded it with leakage in the surge pool. According to the project officials, the construction of pump house (Package-20) was taken up to lift Godavari water drawn from Sriramsagar to a height of 91 meters to serve an ayacut of nearly 4 lakh acres in Nizamabad and Kamareddy districts, in the areas not covered by other components of either Kaleshwaram or other projects such as Sriramsagar or Nizamsagar, with the help of two more pump houses in Package 21 and 22. As part of installing three motors with a capacity of 30 megawatt each to deliver 2,472 cusecs together. Water for the Package-20 pump house is designed draw from Sriramsagar with a 2.2 km long approach channel and a regulator to allow water reach the surge pool of the pump house after 17.79 km long tunnel. Heavy flood With the recent heavy flood to the main course of river Godavari and its tributary Manjira, Sriramsagar project has been receiving heavy flood for the last couple of weeks. According to the project engineers, leakages at the regulator gates between the surge pool and the pump house and the approach channel from Sriramsagar and the tunnel leading to the surge pool/pump house could be the reason for water submerging the pump house under construction. Two pumps have already been installed and work on the third pump was in progress at the time of the mishap with engineers planning trial run of at least one pump later this month. The Package-20 was taken up with an estimated cost of Rs. 893 crore and the submergence of the pump house is set to delay its completion and operationalisation. Irrigation authorities stated that pumping out water from the submerged pump house could be taken up only after water leave in Sriramsagar goes down below full reservoir level to assess the extent of damage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kaleshwaram-ph-under-construction-submerges-in-srsp-water/article36444899.ece
14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘COVID under control, no worry for 6 months’||Scarred by the devastating effects of COVID-19 pandemic during the first and second waves, people from various walks of life are worried about the possibility of a third wave. Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao, however, has suggested that the coronavirus situation in the State is under control and that there is no problem for the “next six months”. Questioned about the basis of the estimation, the senior health officer cited the current positivity rate of 0.4%, R-Naught value (number of people a positive person can infect) of 0.5% in the State, low bed occupancy in hospitals, vaccination coverage and the way new variants have merged across the world as some of the factors. “There is no chance of a third wave until a new and strong variant emerges. If we continue our vaccination drive to cover a large section of people, chances of a strong variant emerging in coming days is low,” said Dr Srinivasa Rao. In the first week of August too, he had said that the third wave will not emerge till December and listed some of the same reasons. He explained how an extensive vaccination coverage will mitigate risk of new variants of coronavirus. Not yet vaccinated Of the 2.8 crore beneficiaries in the State above the age of 18 years, 49% are yet to receive their first dose of vaccine. From January 16 till September 11, over 1.42 crore people have received their first dose and 52.92 lakh have taken both jabs. Special drives to improve the immunisation coverage in the Greater Hyderabad region was launched a few weeks ago. Mobile vans were used to take vaccination to people’s doorstep. Another special drive to vaccinate people in rural localities and towns of Telangana would be conducted for four weeks soon. A video conference will be held with collectors of all districts in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-under-control-no-worry-for-6-months/article36444876.ece
14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Complaints against private hospitals over dengue treatment||Complaints against private hospitals managements in the State have resurfaced. A few months ago, grievances were about overcharging COVID-19 patients. This time round, they are related to treatment for dengue and other viral fevers. Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said some private hospitals are asking attendants of patients to arrange for donor platelets when the platelet count is below one lakh, and charging thousands of rupees. “People have to understand that platelets have to be transfused when the count drops to less than 10,000. A patient can be managed and will recover without platelet transfusion when the count is around 10,000-20,000,” the senior health officer said while addressing a press conference held at the State Health Campus, Koti, on Monday. Asked what action was taken against such hospitals, Dr Srinivasa Rao said that changes in the hospitals’ practices cannot be brought about by shutting the hospitals or by taking punitive action. However, one can lodge complaints with the District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) concerned, he said. Asked what form of justice can be expected if such hospitals are not shut down, he said, “We have to strengthen our laws and try to bring about behavioural changes in hospitals. They are in the medical profession. They have to act in a noble manner.” Similar complaints were observed in 2019 when the incidence of dengue had spiked. Cases of dengue, malaria, and viral fevers are expected to decline by the end of September or mid-October. The senior health official said that people have already spent hefty amounts of money for COVID treatment at private hospitals and it is not justified to cause further financial inconvenience to people in the name of dengue treatment. He stressed that all arrangements were made at government hospitals to provide treatment for dengue and malaria.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/complaints-against-private-hospitals-over-dengue-treatment/article36444880.ece
14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Cong., BJP betraying Telangana: TRS||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has alleged that both the Congress-led governments in the past and Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at present in the Centre had betrayed people of Telangana on the promises made to the region during the formation of the State. Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao, Chief Whip Dasyam Vinay Bhaskar and legislators Pochampally Srinivas Reddy and Manchireddy Kishan Reddy said on Monday that the Congress and BJP governments at the Centre had betrayed on the promise of establishing a railway coach factory at Kazipet. Stating that people of the region are fighting for the coach factory for decades, they said it was sanctioned to Latur in Maharashtra. However, the State BJP leaders are mute spectators to their government’s decision, they said. They pointed out that it was on the then TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s insistence the promises of railway coach factory at Kazipet, steel plant at Bayyaram and tribal university were included in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. But all the three promises were not kept by the successive governments at the Centre. The TRS leaders suggested the BJP leaders to take up padayatras and visits in the State only after achieving coach factory to Kazipet. Instead of helping Telangana, they were spoiling the chances of allotment of industries/institutions and allocation of funds by the Centre. The Centre had also rendered injustice to Telangana in sanction of medical colleges but the BJP leaders from the State are unmoved by such discrimination, they alleged. Alleging that the Centre is discriminating against non-BJP ruled States, they said it is now trying to deceive farmers too by announcing that boiled rice would not be procured from the State. Since the decision would have severe impact on Telangana farmers, including prompting closure of boiled rice mills, the TRS leaders said the State government would think over on the issue to protect the interests of farmers.  BJP leaders should take up padayatras and visit the State only after getting coach factory to Kazipet.

14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Union Minister for promoting farm exports to double farmers’ income||Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shobha Karandlaje has stressed the need for promoting agriculture exports as they could facilitate in doubling farmers’ income within a reasonable time frame. The Centre is committed to work closely with the State to propel the country as a major exporter of agricultural products. The Union Minister was speaking at a meeting with senior agriculture officials of State and Centre at BRKR Bhavan on Monday. She underlined the need for setting up a dedicated cell to monitor agriculture exports. The cell would coordinate with the Centre and State governments as well as agencies concerned and the farmers to ensure that farmers secure value addition to their produce. She complimented the State government for taking up ambitious programme of growing oil palm in 20 lakh acres in the State, claiming that the move would help save lot of foreign exchange to the country. Agriculture and Cooperation Minister S. Niranjan Reddy briefed the Union Minister about the initiatives of the State government that resulted in 38% increase in the cropping area and 68% increase in production over the last seven years. The focus of the State government is to increase profitability to farmers, besides retaining rural youth in agriculture, crop diversification, farm mechanisation, focus on horticulture, especially oil palm, and improving nutrient and fertilizer efficiency. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar explained about the Kaleshwaram project claiming it to be an engineering marvel which resulted in increasing ground water levels. The State also pioneered several schemes like Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima and Rythu Vedikas. Agriculture secretary Raghunandan Rao said irrigation, power, investment support, extension system, supply of inputs, infrastructure support and social security for farmers were major drivers of the exponential growth of agriculture potential in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/union-minister-for-promoting-farm-exports/article36444905.ece

Revanth Reddy questioned the silence of Ministers in the TRS government and the Police Commissioner on the rape and murder of a six-year-old girl in Singareni Colony of Saidabad. Mr. Reddy also questioned the Home Minister Mahmood Ali’s silence on such a major incident in the colony adopted by him within the city. “Even after five days of the brutal incident, the Police Commissioner has not visited the family nor did the Ministers, reflecting how this government treated the Scheduled Tribes,” he said. The Congress chief, who visited the family members of the victim at their residence on Monday, also extended financial support to the family and assured them that the Congress would not keep quite till justice was done to them. He argued that the laxity on behalf of the police was due to the fact that the victim was a tribal girl and comes from a poor family. Attributing such incidents to the youth getting addicted to liquor and drugs in the State, he said usage of cannabis was on rise and its free availability was a huge concern. “Despite knowing how the drugs are being sold so freely there is no action from the police,” he said and alleged that the government was promoting liquor and focussing on increasing its consumption than dissuading people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/revanth-visits-rape-victims-family-extends-support/article36444891.ece
14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Why the delay in recruiting APPs: HC||Expressing dissatisfaction over the delay in filling up 174 posts of Assistant Public Prosecutor (APP), Telangana High Court on Monday instructed the government to complete the process by the end of this October. After hearing contentions of the government in a suo moto taken up PIL petition, a bench of Acting Chief Justice and Justice T. Vinod Kumar said no further extension of time would be permitted on the matter. After perusing the affidavit filed by Telangana State Level Police Recruitment Board, the bench observed the appointment process was going at slow pace. The bench declined to grant a time of 18 more weeks to complete the recruitment process as sought by the board. Absence of APPs was drastically affecting disposal of cases in different courts of the State, it said. While a GO was issued for recruiting APPs on this March 27, the government inked an agreement with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) on July 15 to conduct the exam. Thus, over three months of time was wasted for finalising an agreement to conduct an exam, the bench observed. “Why this delay in arriving at an agreement,” the bench said. The bench did not agree with the contentions of the board that it cannot act in haste in the appointment of APPs. It said even the HC had undertaken appointment of district and junior civil judges by handing over the responsibility of recruitment to an agency. “There is a lot of pressure on courts to dispose of pending cases. Cases are piling up due to non-availability of prosecutors despite charge-sheets being filed,” the bench said. With inadequate number of APPs, one APP was being burdened with the work of looking after matters relating to five courts, the bench noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-the-delay-in-recruiting-apps-hc/article36444900.ece
14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A Tughlaq act, says BJP leader||Senior BJP leader Gudur Narayana Reddy termed Chief Minister K Chandrasekhara Rao’s call against cultivation of paddy in the next summer season as ‘Tughlaq’ act. “Last year, he said government would buy each grain of paddy and now he is washing his hands off on that promise. Restricting farmers from cultivating paddy without making any alternative plans would mess up agriculture activities,” he said in a press statement on Monday. Mr. Reddy wanted to know if the government was not in favour of cultivation of paddy on a large scale, why is it constructing irrigation projects. “Had Mr. Rao not visualised the scenario of agriculture sector after the completion of irrigation projects? What alternative crops could be cultivated under the command area? What happens to the thousands of crores of rupees of public money being spent on irrigation projects, if their water is not used?” he wondered. If the Chief Minister is so concerned about protecting the interests of farmers, he should direct the agriculture department to find new export avenues for paddy and other traditional crops rather than throwing the blame on the Centre, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-tughlaq-act-says-gudur/article36444904.ece

Justice Mukta Gupta, who was hearing the Delhi Waqf Board’s plea to reopen the centre which has remained shut since March 31 last year, questioned the Centre as to how long it intended to keep the Nizamuddin centre locked, saying it can’t be “kept forever”. Counsel for the Centre stated that a legal action to reopen the centre can only be initiated by the lessee of the property and a resident of the premises has already filed a plea to handover the residential portion of the centre, which is pending final adjudication before another judge of the High Court.

He said around 21,000 urban homeless people have been registered across the country and around 8,000 have been vaccinated. Additional government pleader Gita Shastri said in Maharashtra, 1,761 mentally ill have been vaccinated. Greater risk Referring to the affidavit filed by the State, the court said, “The affidavit is silent on the number of mentally ill people who were homeless, without legal guardians and not in a position to give their consent for vaccination. Such people posed a greater risk of spreading the virus.” PIL on vaccination The Bench added, “Every citizen, no matter in which condition, needs to be taken care of by the State.” The court was hearing a public interest litigation concerning the vaccination for homeless mentally ill people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/have-you-vaccinated-the-homeless-hc/article36444770.ece

This followed several attempts by former Collector Nidhi Chaudhari and present Collector Mahendra Kalyankar to make such homes available through corporate social responsibility activity. Each container has a kitchen, table, and toilet. The district administration provided water connections, and landowners Yogiraj Chaudhari, Sundarabai Mane, Lakmabai Mane and Krishnabai Pande made the land available free of cost to place the containers. “Another 12 containers will be procured and installed soon. Our efforts to make permanent homes are on,” Mr. Kalyankar said. Around 17 hectares are being procured by the administration for the rehabilitation. On July 22, following heavy rain, 84 people lost their lives in a landslide.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/12-landslide-affected-families-in-raigad-get-container-homes/article36444766.ece
14 September 2021||New Delhi,||Centre should direct States to use bio-decomposer: CM||Terming the bio-decomposer technique a “smashing success” at curbing stubble burning in the Capital, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday appealed to the Centre to ask the neighbouring States to use the same to prevent pollution. The bio-decomposer technique utilised by the Delhi government last winter had turned out to be highly effective in dealing with agricultural stubble, he said. Mr. Kejriwal claimed the farmers were “very happy” and the neighbouring States should also implement the technique with winter around the corner and the city’s air quality expected to deteriorate during the months of October and November. Even as the Chief Minister announced he would meet Union Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav to seek his intervention regarding the same, the Delhi BJP accused Mr. Kejriwal of utilising the technique only to garner publicity at the cost of the taxpayers’ money. “ From October 10 onwards, we will start witnessing rising pollution levels till the end of November. A big reason behind this is the smoke that is generated due to stubble burning in Delhi’s neighbouring States,” Mr. Kejriwal said during a digital briefing. End blame game “Till now, all the governments used to blame each other on this issue. State governments would accuse the Centre of not releasing funds, the Centre would claim that the States are doing nothing. But no one’s going to earn anything out of this blame game,” he said. In October, Mr. Kejriwal explained, farmers harvest their paddy crop. When they cut the crop to harvest it, they leave a significant portion of the lower stem behind. This leftover part is called stubble or ‘Paraali’. Post the harvest season, a farmer barely has 20-25 days to sow the next crop of wheat. During this time, the farmers need to get rid of the stubble to clear their fields. The most convenient method to do this is to burn the stubble, he added. “Till now, all the governments did was to target the farmers. They’d penalise the farmers burning stubble. But what did the governments actually do? The entire problem is a mistake of the governments,” Mr. Kejriwal alleged. The Delhi government, however, had found a solution to the problem in the Pusa Institute’s bio-decomposer which was both cost-effective and had proven highly effective, Mr. Kejriwal said. According to him, the government had sprayed the solution on 1,935 acres of land in 39 villages. “The Delhi government approached the Commission for Air Quality Management with the solution. The Delhi government got WAPCOS — a PSU of the Jal Shakti Ministry of the Centre — to do an audit of our solution. WAPCOS conducted a full-fledged investigation. They surveyed 79 farmers in 15 villages spread across four districts,” he said. “After completing the process they have very clearly stated that farmers are extremely happy with the performance of the bio-decomposer. I reiterate, WAPCOS is a company of the Centre which has independently investigated the solution,” he added. Less time taken According to findings of the WAPCOS audit, Mr. Kejriwal said, 90% of the farmers said that the stubble decomposed within 15-20 days, whereas it would previoulsy take 40-50 days. The soil needed to be ploughed 6-7 times earlier, after using the spray the soil needs to be ploughed only once or twice. The organic carbon, nitrogen, bacterial and fungal content in the soil increased after using the bio-decomposer and the stubble essentially ended up becoming a manure for the soil, he said. “Just like how the farmers and the people of Delhi are happy with this solution, the same can happen in other States. All that the State governments have to do is to adopt the bio-decomposer method. All that the Centre needs to do is to mandate the States to use this solution,” Mr. Kejriwal said. “I appeal to the Centre to intervene and ask the States to implement it. This is how all of us will get freedom from pollution. I will meet with the Union Environment Minister with this report and urge him to take up the solution,” he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana, citing an RTI response on the bio-decomposer technique, alleged corruption in the process which was undertaken last year. “According to the RTI response, the cost of the decomposer solution was just Rs. 75,780 while Rs. 22,84,150 was spent on spraying it; only 310 farmers reaped the so-called benefits of the initiative on which crores were spent on publicity,” Mr. Khurana alleged.  Over 90% of the farmers said that the stubble decomposed within 15-20 days, whereas it would previously take 40-50 days Arvind Kejriwal Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/centre-should-direct-states-to-use-bio-decomposer-cm/article36444761.ece

Nod from architect Also, a certificate from the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) is no longer needed for rainwater harvesting systems and the people can instead take a certificate from any architect registered with the Council of Architecture. The government has also extended the last date for compulsory implementation of the rooftop Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) system to December 31. The DJB had earlier issued guidelines mandating owners of existing and new properties measuring 100 square metres and above to instal RWH structures. Conserve rainwater “The government is working to ensure that the water received through rain is conserved as much as possible,” an official statement said. “To increase the groundwater levels and efficiently utilise the rainwater, the government has adopted several measures. The adoption of the Dungarpur model of rainwater harvesting (RWH) is one of them. This model is also known as the INLINE Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) system. This model is cost-effective and is being implemented in the tribal-dominated Dungarpur district of Rajasthan,” the official statement added. In this method, the rainwater is directed to a borewell, instead of a regular rainwater-harvesting pit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/govt-to-provide-rs-50k-aid-for-rooftop-rainwater-harvesting/article36444749.ece

Justice Rekha Palli asked the authorities to submit their replies before the next date of hearing on November 18. The woman said her mother Bimla Devi complained of fever and other problems and was admitted to the Saroj Medical Institute here on April 28 after her RT-PCR report came positive. The plea said Devi was discharged in a critical condition by the hospital and the family could not arrange bed in any other hospital as there was shortage during the second wave of COVID-19. The patient died at her home on May 3. The woman claimed that she could not get the death certificate of her mother from the Municipal Corporation office as her brother was not cooperating in the process. The petition said it was not only a statutory obligation under the Disaster Management Act to provide ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life but it was the constitutional obligation also since it affected the right to life guaranteed under the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/woman-seeks-compensation-for-mothers-death-due-to-covid-19/article36444756.ece

Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said Mr. Kejriwal had, during the first wave of COVID-19 infection, promised that if a tenant was not able to pay rent due to financial reasons, the Delhi government would pay the landlord concerned. ‘Unfulfilled promises’ “Whatever promises the Chief Minister had made during the pandemic remain unfulfilled so far.

Target of 25% AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said that the landfills in the city were supposed to be reduced by 25% till now. “Bhalswa had a deadline of April 2021. Okhla of October 2021. Similarly, Ghazipur, too was supposed to be reduced by 25%. A Delhi Pollution Control Committee report states that the work is going on very slowly,” Mr. Bharadwaj said. Waste generation “North Corporation generates 4,500 metric tonnes of waste. Of this, 2500-2600 tonnes of garbage go to Bhalswa every day. In the last two years, 19 lakh metric tonnes of garbage have come, and 18.5 lakh metric tonnes is being processed at Bhalswa. More garbage is coming there than what can be processed. At this rate, this garbage won’t be processed in the next 100 years,” he added. The AAP leader said that the BJP-government corporations are “looting” the money of Delhi government in the name of clearing these “mountains of garbage”. “The BJP is looting the money given by the Delhi government by paying more as rent for trommel machines than what they cost. According to the DPCC, the environment is being harmed by about Rs. 500 crore because of the three garbage mountains of the municipal corporations,” Mr. Bharadwaj said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-looting-money-in-name-of-clearing-landfills-aap/article36444751.ece

14 September 2021||Pune,||Kirit Somaiya accuses Minister of Rs. 127 cr. money laundering scam||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya on Monday accused senior NCP leader and Maharashtra Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif and his relatives of being involved in a Rs. 127 crore money laundering scam. Minutes after Mr. Somaiya’s allegations, Mr. Mushrif, an influential leader from Kolhapur, said he would file a Rs. 100-crore defamation suit against the BJP leader at the Kolhapur district court within the next fortnight. “Mr. Mushrif and his family, including his son, have created companies which in turn have had transactions with Kolkata-based shell companies. Their financial transactions shown in their bank accounts received income from those companies which did not exist,” alleged the former BJP MP, who is also the vice-president of the party’s Maharashtra unit. Complaint and documents Mr. Somaiya, who has been targeting senior leaders in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government with alleged scam exposes, said he had already filed a complaint and submitted documents with Income Tax authorities in Mumbai and was in the process of giving documents to the Enforcement Directorate. Last week, the BJP leader had threatened that he would be firing a salvo at a senior Minister in the Thackeray Cabinet, without naming Mr. Mushrif. Dismissing Mr. Somaiya’s allegations as “utterly baseless” and “without any shred of evidence”, Mr. Mushrif claimed that the BJP leader was woefully uninformed and was uttering ill-informed allegations at the behest of BJP State president Chandrakant Patil. “Two years ago, the ED had raided my house and my properties in Kolhapur. Their searches yielded nothing…the BJP should be careful as Mr. Somaiya is sullying the party’s reputation by his phoney allegations. He cannot even read the name of my sugar factory correctly,” said Mr. Mushrif. Remarking that he had had an unblemished reputation throughout his political career, the NCP leader said the BJP was playing these low political games as they had no standing in Kolhapur. “Within two weeks, I will be filing a Rs. 100-crore defamation suit against Mr. Somaiya. He can lodge whatever case with whichever agency he wishes…it does not bother me in the least,” Mr. Mushrif said. In July 2019, the Income Tax Department had raided Mr. Mushrif’s residence and factory premises in Kolhapur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/kirit-somaiya-accuses-minister-of-rs-127-cr-money-laundering-scam/article36444769.ece

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||HRC chief calls for ‘close attention’ on Sri Lanka||The UN human rights chief on Monday said she looks forward to “concrete actions” from the Sri Lankan government on its promises, while urging members of the UN Human Rights Council to continue paying “close attention” to the island nation, whose rights record remains in international focus after a decade since its civil war ended. High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet was referring to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s remarks in June, when he told a domestic panel probing allegations of rights abuse that that his government was “committed to work with the UN to ensure accountability” and will implement “necessary institutional reforms”, evidently departing from his earlier position that Sri Lanka would pull out of UN mechanisms. Delivering an oral update on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka at the 48th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Ms. Bachelet sought “credible progress” in advancing reconciliation, accountability and human rights in the country. Her statement on Monday is a follow-up on her scathing report in January this year, where she noted that Sri Lanka was “on an alarming path towards recurrence of grave human rights violations”. Her report informed the debate in March this year, before the Council adopted a resolution on ‘Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka’, with 22 of the 47 member-states voting in its favour. India had abstained. In her update to the Council, the High Commissioner observed that the current social, economic and governance challenges faced by Sri Lanka indicate “the corrosive impact that militarisation and the lack of accountability continue to have on fundamental rights, civic space, democratic institutions, social cohesion and sustainable development.” She spoke of Sri Lanka’s draconian terrorism law, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which activists want repealed, pointing to the prolonged detention of lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah, for 16 months now, and of Ahnaf Jazeem, a poet, detained without charge since May 2020.  TNA welcomes concerns Observing that “surveillance, intimidation and judicial harassment of human rights defenders, journalists and families of the disappeared” has not only continued, but “broadened” to a wider spectrum of students, academics, medical professionals and religious leaders critical of government policies, she said: “Several peaceful protests and commemorations have been met with excessive use of force and the arrest or detention of demonstrators in quarantine centres.” Responding to the High Commissioner’s statement in a tweet, the Tamil National Alliance, the main grouping representing war-affected Tamils in the north and east in Parliament, said: “We welcome the HC’s concerns and appeal to the Member States to reflect this at the discussion and follow up.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hrc-chief-calls-for-close-attention-on-sri-lanka/article36444293.ece
14 September 2021||Lod,||Israeli firm unveils armed robot to patrol borders||An Israeli defence contractor on Monday unveiled a remote-controlled armed robot it says can patrol battle zones, track infiltrators and open fire. The unmanned vehicle is the latest addition to the world of drone technology, which is rapidly reshaping the modern battlefield. Proponents say such semi-autonomous machines allow armies to protect their soldiers, while critics fear this marks another dangerous step toward robots making life-or-death decisions. The four-wheel-drive robot presented on Monday was developed by the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries’ “REX MKII.” It is operated by an electronic tablet and can be equipped with two machine guns, cameras and sensors, said Rani Avni, deputy head of the company’s autonomous systems division. The robot can gather intelligence for ground troops, carry injured soldiers and supplies in and out of battle, and strike nearby targets. It is the most advanced of more than half a dozen unmanned vehicles developed by Aerospace Industries’ subsidiary, ELTA Systems, over the past 15 years. The Israeli military is currently using a smaller but similar vehicle, called the Jaguar, to patrol the border with the Gaza Strip.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israeli-firm-unveils-armed-robot-to-patrol-borders/article36444299.ece
14 September 2021||Washington,||Blinken defends Afghan withdrawal before Congress||Testifying before a U.S. House of Representatives Committee, Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended the Biden administration’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan after two decades, as well as the actual withdrawal process in the last weeks of August, characterised by chaos and violence focused around Kabul’s airport. Mr. Blinken, in his opening remarks, which he delivered via video-link to the House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) on Monday afternoon, suggested that President Joe Biden had inherited a bad deal on Afghanistan from his predecessor, Donald Trump, that the alternative to withdrawal would have cost lives, and that the withdrawal was coordinated with America’s partners. He said the Trump administration had pressed the (former) Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including “top war commanders” and had reduced U.S. troop strength to 2,500. This put the Taliban in their strongest position since September 2001 and the U.S. had its smallest troop level since the invasion, Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Biden had a choice between ending the war or escalating it — which would have come at the cost of casualties and resulted in a “stalemate”, according to Mr. Blinken. “There’s no evidence that staying longer would have made the Afghan security forces or the Afghan government any more resilient or self-sustaining,” he said. “Even the most pessimistic assessments did not predict that government forces in Kabul would collapse while U.S. forces remained,” he told U.S. lawmakers. Mr. Blinken also said he was in “ constant contact” with U.S. allies and partners “to hear their views and factor them” into U.S. thinking on withdrawal. “I want to acknowledge the more than two dozen countries that have helped with the relocation effort — some serving as transit hubs, some welcoming Afghan evacuees for longer periods of time, “ he said. Among the current activities of the State Department were efforts to help evacuate any remaining Americans, Afghans and citizens of partner countries who wanted to leave Afghanistan, Mr. Blinken said. The U.S. was also focused on counterterrorism, as per the Secretary, who said the Taliban had committed to prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a safe haven. ( This has been India’s central concern with the unfolding situation in Afghanistan). “That does not mean we will rely on them [the Taliban],” he said, adding that the U.S. would remain vigilant and maintain robust counterterrorism capabilities in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/blinken-defends-afghan-withdrawal-before-congress/article36444522.ece
14 September 2021||Barcelona,||Climate change could cause 216 mn to migrate: World Bank||Climate change could push more than 200 million people to leave their homes in the next three decades and create migration hot spots unless urgent action is taken to reduce global emissions and bridge the development gap, a World Bank report has found. The second part of the Groundswell report published on Monday examined how the impacts of slow-onset climate change, such as water scarcity, decreasing crop productivity and rising sea levels, could lead to millions of what it describes as “climate migrants” by 2050 under three different scenarios with varying degrees of climate action and development. Under the most pessimistic scenario, with a high level of emissions and unequal development, the report forecasts up to 216 million people moving within their own countries across the six regions analysed. Those regions are Latin America; North Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Eastern Europe and Central Asia; South Asia; and East Asia and the Pacific. In the most climate-friendly scenario, with a low level of emissions and inclusive, sustainable development, the world could still see 44 million people being forced to leave their homes. The findings “reaffirm the potency of climate to induce migration within countries,” said Viviane Wei Chen Clement, a senior climate change specialist at the World Bank and one of the report’s authors. Most vulnerable region In the worst-case scenario, Sub-Saharan Africa — the most vulnerable region due to desertification, fragile coastlines and the population’s dependence on agriculture — would see the most migrants, with up to 86 million people moving within national borders. North Africa, however, is predicted to have the largest proportion of climate migrants, with 19 million people moving, equivalent to roughly 9% of its population, due mainly to increased water scarcity in northeastern Tunisia, northwestern Algeria, western and southern Morocco, and the central Atlas foothills, the report said. In South Asia, Bangladesh is particularly affected by flooding and crop failures, accounting for almost half of the predicted climate migrants, with 19.9 million people, including an increasing number of women, moving by 2050 under the pessimistic scenario. “This is our humanitarian reality right now and we are concerned this is going to be even worse, where vulnerability is more acute,” said Prof. Maarten van Aalst, director of the International Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, who wasn’t involved with the report. Many scientists say the world is no longer on track to the worst-case scenario for emissions. But even under a more moderate scenario, Mr. van Aalst said many impacts are occurring faster than expected, “including the extremes we are experiencing, as well as potential implications for migration and displacement.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/climate-change-could-cause-216-mn-to-migrate-world-bank/article36444304.ece
14 September 2021||Kabul,||In audio, Taliban co-founder calls death rumours fake||The Taliban co-founder and now Deputy Prime Minister of Afghanistan released an audio statement on Monday saying he was alive and well after news of his supposed demise went viral on social media. Abdul Ghani Baradar, who was last week named as a number two to Mullah Mohammed Hassan Akhund, blamed “fake propaganda” for the death rumours in an audio message posted by the Taliban. Social media has been in a frenzy over the speculation — particularly in India, where rumours swirled that he had been mortally wounded in a shootout between rival Taliban factions at the presidential palace. “There had been news in the media about my death,” Baradar said in the clip. ‘Fake propaganda’ “Over the past few nights I have been away on trips. Wherever I am at the moment, we are all fine, all my brothers and friends. “Media always publish fake propaganda. Therefore, reject bravely all those lies, and I 100 percent confirm to you there is no issue and we have no problem.” It was not possible to authenticate the message, but it was posted on official Taliban sites — including that of the spokesman of the political office of the new government.

14 September 2021||KUALA LUMPUR,||Malaysian PM signs key pact with opposition MPs||Barely a month in office, Malaysia’s new leader has won opposition support to shore up his fragile government in exchange for a slew of reforms as Parliament reopened on Monday. Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob signed an unprecedented cooperation pact in Parliament with the main Opposition bloc led by Anwar Ibrahim, in a move to prevent any bid to undermine his rule ahead of general elections due in two years. The “political stability and transformation” pact will give Mr. Ismail the backing of 88 lawmakers in Anwar’s bloc, in addition to 114 that support him in the 222-member house. Mr. Ismail said in a statement that the pact will lead to bipartisan cooperation and political reforms that will bolster governance, fight the COVID-19 crisis, and help to revive the economy. “The government is confident that this memorandum of understanding will not only help cast aside all political differences but also ensure the country’s recovery is holistic and inclusive,” Mr. Ismail said. Officials said further details of the agreement will be unveiled soon. New laws The pact came after Mr. Ismail last week offered reforms, including new laws to prevent party defections and limiting the Prime Minister’s tenure to 10 years. He also pledged to immediately lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18, ensure bipartisan agreement on any new Bill and get opposition input on the country’s economic recovery. He also made it so the role of Opposition leader gets the same remuneration and privileges as a Cabinet Minister. Malaysia has recorded close to two million COVID-19 infections, with more than 20,000 deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/malaysian-pm-signs-key-pact-with-opposition-mps/article36444301.ece
14 September 2021||Seoul,||North Korea tests new ‘long-range cruise missile’||North Korea said on Monday that it successfully tested newly developed long-range cruise missiles over the weekend, the first known testing activity in months, underscoring how the country continues to expand its military capabilities amid a stalemate in nuclear negotiations with the United States. The state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that the missiles showed they can hit targets 1,500 Km away on Saturday and Sunday. State media published photos of a projectile being fired from a launcher truck and what looked like a missile traveling in the air. The North hailed its new missiles as a “strategic weapon of great significance” — wording that implies they were developed with the intent to arm them with nuclear warheads. North Korea says it needs nuclear weapons in order to deter what it claims is hostility from the U.S. and South Korea — and has long attempted to use the threat of such an arsenal to extract economic aid or otherwise apply pressure. The North and ally China faced off against South Korea and U.S.-led UN forces in the 1950-53 Korean War, a conflict that ended in an armistice that has yet to be replaced with a peace treaty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/north-korea-tests-new-long-range-cruise-missile/article36444302.ece

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Returning to school 17 months later||As children return to the classroom after an unprecedentedly long gap, many among their teachers realise that teaching will be tougher. And there are others who assume that it will be business as usual. In fact, they have already started teaching from the point ‘where we left it’, meaning where they were in their online classes. Teachers who stick to the syllabus no matter what happens in the outside world, like to identify themselves as teachers of this or that subject. They see their role purely in terms of the knowledge they enable children to acquire. They view the purpose of education in terms of success in examinations and, consequently, in life. With a sense of purpose so firmly held in their minds, such teachers stay clear of the personal life of children, especially its emotional aspect. We can understand how such teachers define learning — in terms of the prescribed syllabus as articulated in the textbook. There is no harm in acknowledging that teachers of this sort form the majority in the profession. Though in a minority, there are other teachers who realise that education is more than about completing the syllabus to prepare children to face examinations. These teachers know that their success as teachers depends on how they relate to children, no matter what subject they teach. For this reason, they worry about their children’s emotional well-being. When a child is not feeling well, such teachers ask what is wrong. They recognise individual differences and engage with children as persons with specific habits of mind and behaviour. For such teachers, the world outside the school matters because it makes an impact on children, their spirit and enthusiasm for what they are being taught in the classroom. For teachers of this kind, the long gap caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic in their daily routine interaction with children has made it problematic to resume teaching. They know that 17 months without teaching in a physical classroom has made a strange impact on themselves as well as on the children they teach. Gap impact Several obvious reasons can be cited. One that has been widely discussed comes under a poorly conceptualised title: ‘learning loss’. If small children cannot read at the level they had attained before the pandemic struck, this can hardly be described as a loss. The terminology of loss and gain seems natural in our times, but it is unsuitable for discussing children and their development at school. When they are small, children do not easily retain for long what they had picked up unless it is put to daily use. This is just as true of the facility in reading as in intellectual capacities to comprehend, analyse and judge. However, the facility once acquired returns when its need is created again — under circumstances that are not threatening. And that is where our systemic conditions pose a problem. These conditions encourage teachers to be impatient and short-tempered. It is not easy for people who have never worked in a school in our country to grasp the nature of the stress teachers chronically face and absorb. It is so general that it cannot be attributed to any one source, such as a principal or parents. The pressure to perform is a factor of the ethos and the ethos does not distinguish between smaller and older children. From the day a child enters school, he or she comes under this pressure. A minority of teachers realise that it is unsuitable for growth in the primary years, but these teachers have little influence on others. The wider social culture and government norms relentlessly push the child from the first month at school towards higher levels of performance. One suspects that this pressure will shape the classrooms most children return to after the COVID-19 gap. Many among them will find it difficult to join in at a higher level of efficiency in solving problems in math or language than they can feel comfortable with. This will be seen as a sign of weakness and the usual remedies will be applied to suppress such signs. The remedies endemic to our system are increased drill, coached collective answer-parroting and harder preparation for tests. Each one of these remedies will be counter-productive for the child’s development when classes resume and regain the dreaded full steam. Among teachers I have placed in the second category above, i.e., those who try to relate to children individually and not just teach them, there will be some who can reasonably guess the kind of psychological problems children might be facing as a result of the long COVID-19 closure of schools. The total withdrawal of a space so intimately linked to childhood must necessarily have been hard to endure for a lot of children. These would include children who might not have greatly enjoyed their daily chores at school and the curriculum, as well as many children who might have taken online in their stride, despite the relentless stress it brought them. Impact of the online mode Digital learning is known to bring with it certain addictive behaviours that may persist at school and take new and disturbing mutations. When children return to school, they may well feel off-balance, experiencing the uncanny sense of deprivation that hits the mind after an ordeal is over. For teachers to assume that such children will simply carry on with the remaining syllabus will be quite wrong, although this will not become obvious till later. Online teaching had extremely limited reach in most regions, and even more limited value for its receivers. The idea that teaching simply switched to online mode was little more than a myth. That there was nothing else that could have been done was another myth. Why schools were the absolutely last priority for reopening, lower than shopping malls, says something about the importance attached to education. In several other countries, every attempt was made to help schools function, after periodic closure. Nor were primary teachers in other countries given other duties, at airports and vaccination centres. Why mid-day meals were stopped along with teaching is hard to explain. Nor is it possible to calculate the loss incurred by hunger. No estimate has yet been made of the number of children who have left school altogether. Now that schools have at last reopened, the educationally better off States, for example, in the South, need to recognise two new priorities. Both concern aspects of children’s psychological comfort generally ignored in our system. If given some attention, it will enhance both children’s and teachers’ readjustment after the long gap they have endured without each others’ company. Space for these priorities The first of these two priorities is a space for the arts: music, painting, theatre and dance. Aesthetic experience has great healing powers, especially when it is not too focused on performance or ceremonial purpose. If State governments and private schools can devote resources and time to this otherwise marginalised area, they will make the resumption of routine life at school more nourishing. The other priority for school resumption is the reorganisation of this year’s curriculum. The ‘where we left it’ approach will not do for any stage of school education. A linear syllabus coverage approach does not serve children well even in normal times. The post-COVID-19 situation is far too complex to respond to the wooden pedagogy stuck to the chapters of the prescribed textbook. A team of subject-specialists and teachers must sit together to look at the syllabus designed for every grade level and deliberate on ways to reorganise it for this unusual academic session.

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||COVID-19, kidney injury and need for a vaccine shot||As of early September 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has affected over 200 million people and led to 4.4 million deaths worldwide. In India alone, 3,30,00,000 COVID-19 cases and 4,42,000 COVID-19 related deaths have been reported to date. While most infections are mild with respiratory symptoms, a severe form of the disease is seen in older adults and people with chronic heart, kidney and lung diseases, diabetes or other conditions that render the immune system weak. COVID-19 damages many organs including the lungs, heart and kidneys. Commonly seen complication Kidney injury as a complication of COVID-19 is more commonly seen in hospitalised patients. While the reported prevalence of kidney injury was 7% in a study of 2,650 patients admitted to a large hospital in southern India, a recent large study in the United States reported kidney injury in as many as 46% of 3,993 hospitalised patients, of whom 19% required dialysis. Patients with COVID-19 kidney injury also have increased duration of hospitalisation, with increased health-care costs. Unfortunately, there are many more deaths in those who have acute kidney injury. Understanding the microscopic changes in kidneys after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus is important and has been the focus of extensive research. Researchers, especially pathologists, across the globe have been unified in their observations of COVID-19 kidney injury — i.e., acute tubular injury (injury of the transporting channels in the kidney) is the hallmark of kidney pathology. Thrombi or blood clots, as seen in the lungs and heart, may also be seen in the kidney. Inflammation (influx of white blood cells) in the kidney has also been described by researchers. The kidney injury is more commonly seen in kidneys that already have chronic injury, such as that seen in diabetes or severe blood vessel diseases. The exact process in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus brings on the kidney injury has been studied to varying detail by different centres. The first question asked is: does the virus directly damage the kidney? Many centres across the globe have used a very special microscope called the electron microscope to look for evidence of virus in the kidney. The initial studies that emerged from China and the United States seemed to identify structures within kidney cells that looked like viral particles. This seemed to be logical, given that the kidney has a high concentration of ACE2, which is the key protein structure on a cell that the SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to. This step is critical for the virus to enter the cell. However, as more research was done, it became clear that what was once thought to be viral particles in cells were, in fact, increased numbers of vesicles (structures in the cell that are used in sending important signals) and were mere viral mimics. Even specific staining techniques to detect very small amounts of viral proteins failed to show virus in the kidneys. All of this suggested that direct viral injury was not the main method of kidney injury. If not, then how was the SARS-CoV-2 virus injuring the kidney? Changes after infection The main focus of our own research was to understand how SARS-CoV-2 causes kidney injury and how the proteins and genes change in kidneys after COVID-19 infection. This study from Mayo Clinic, recently published in The Mayo Clinic Proceedings (https://mayocl.in/3C52bsy), points to a strong immune response (immune response is the way the body fights against substances it sees as foreign or harmful) in the kidneys. The immune response was seen in all parts of the kidney tissue, including the small blood vessels and in the glomerulus (filtering unit of the kidney). This was mostly seen in those with severe cases of COVID-19. We were able to show two pathways of immune response to the kidneys; Innate immunity, which is the non-specific response you are born with, to fight harmful organisms. In COVID-19 kidneys, we found a rich infiltrate of white blood cells (called macrophages) in the kidneys. Adaptive immune response, which is the body’s acquired immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was evident by an increase in specific type of immune (T cells) in the kidney tissue. This was shown using state-of-the-art techniques, including transcriptomic, proteomics and mass-cytometry. Like sepsis-associated injury Several experts in the field had been suggesting that the kidney injury in severe COVID-19 behaves similar to kidney injury from sepsis, which is the body’s extreme response to an infection. In our study, we were able to compare the findings in COVID-19 kidney injury with kidneys from individuals with known sepsis, and indeed, found that the immune response in the two were very similar. This finding perhaps emphasises the need to manage COVID-19 patients in the same way as patients with sepsis. The observations from our tissue proteins analysis and ultrastructural analysis points also to mitochondria, (which is the powerhouse of the cell) bearing the final insult of the SARS-CoV-2. While this finding is unique to COVID-19 kidney injury, it lends important insight into potential treatment strategies that could be used in managing COVID-19. Key takeaways In conclusion, this Mayo Clinic study is important in that it emphasises a few important facts. First, there is a great need for researchers to capitalise on the patient specimens collected during the pandemic and gather and store data for current and future use. Data archived for future studies will potentially provide valuable information in the event of another pandemic. Second, it will allow the study of COVID-19 associated tissue injury in different populations. Third, by using state-of-the-art technology tools, we were able to analyse the body’s immune response to the virus, and how this response might be injuring kidneys. Taken together, the severe kidney injury seen in COVID-19 further supports the need for widespread vaccination to protect everyone from this viral infection.

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||In Manipur, a case for asymmetric federalism||As a normative idea and an institutional arrangement which supports the recognition and provision of an expansive ‘self-rule’ for territorially concentrated minority groups, asymmetric federalism has recently received bad press in India. The dissolution of Article 370 in 2019 which gave Jammu and Kashmir a special constitutional status, and intermittent attempts to dilute and dissolve the omnibus Article 371 which, among others, gives expansive constitutional powers to Nagas over land and resources (Article 371A), and to Manipur’s Hill Areas Committee (Article 371C) over tribal identity, culture, development and local administration, are exemplars. Driven by the argument that giving distinctive constitutional status to territorially concentrated minorities fosters centrifugal tendencies which over time inhibit national/State integration, development, and peace, antagonists of asymmetric federalism increasingly rallied around the majoritarian idea of a monolith, homogenous nation. On close scrutiny, however, this argument is neither novel nor new. Charles Tarlton, the American political scientist who developed the idea of asymmetric federalism in the mid-1960s, was mindful about its destabilising potential, if not properly harnessed. In fact, the unsuccessful experience of east European communist states to ‘hold together’ in the 1990s spawned deep suspicion about asymmetric federalism. An integrationist approach Indeed, the argument that asymmetric federalism fosters subversive institutions, political instability and breakup of States had also informed the minds of some of the founding fathers of the nation, when they participated in India’s Constituent Assembly debates. For some, the question of envisioning distinctive rights and asymmetric constitutional provisions is considered inconsequential given that India has become a ‘homogenous Hindu nation’ after Partition. Such a majoritarian standpoint sits uneasy with the idea of ‘autonomous’ district councils proposed by the Gopinath Bordoloi Committee, a sub-committee of the Constituent Assembly which sought to accommodate the distinctive identity, culture and way of life of tribal groups in the Northeast by envisioning ‘self-rule’. While members like Jaipal Singh and B.R. Ambedkar recognised tribal distinctiveness and underscored the need for separate institutional accommodation, Kuladhar Chaliha, a prominent member from Assam, for example, broached an integrationist approach when he openly advocated assimilation of tribal groups. This approach is also informed by a deep suspicion over the ability of tribal groups to self-govern and institute a semblance of ‘law and order’ given — to wit Chaliha — their practice of “summary justice”. Chaliha reinforced his integrationist push by contending that tribal “self-rule” would leverage “tribalstan” or “communistan” and would be inimical to India’s territorial integrity and security. This integrationist approach has been conveniently invoked to delegitimise continuing demand for constitutional asymmetry in Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh and in various other places in Northeast India. This integrationist approach resonates powerfully in two recent attempts by Manipur’s government to (i) stall the introduction and passage of the Manipur (Hill Areas) Autonomous District Council (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and (ii) induct nine Assembly members from the valley areas into the Hill Areas Committee. While the Manipur government’s standpoint that the Bill is a “sensitive” matter requiring legal vetting by the Department of Law and Advocate General of the State is plausible and can hardly be contested, the Speaker’s order of September 1 to induct nine Assembly members from the valley areas is seen by Lorho S. Pfoze, the lone MP representing Outer Manipur constituency, as a “malicious” and “direct assault” on the Hill Areas Committee and the constitutional protection accorded to the Hill Areas of Manipur under Article 371C. Clearly, in his overenthusiastic drive to cave in to the growing pressure from powerful valley-based civil society organisations (CSOs), which actively mobilised to ramp up majoritarian support for dissolution of long-standing constitutional asymmetry enjoyed by the hill people, the Speaker was too clever by half in applying his mind as it amounts to transgression of a domain exclusively reserved for the President of India under the Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee) Order, 1972. The Speaker dragged his feet until he was compelled to rescind the order on September 8 after Chief Minister Biren Singh was greeted with black flags and widespread call for boycott of his pet political project, ‘Go to the hills’, by various tribal CSOs during his tour to Churachandpur. Interestingly, this project is increasingly seen by these CSOs as a camouflage of the majoritarian state’s attempt to transgress and snatch away tribal lands by stealth through legal manipulation and sacralisation projects. The recent attempts to declare areas around Chivu in the Indo-Myanmar border as a protected site and sacralise it by replacing one of the three controversial monoliths with that of Thangjing (a Meitei goddess), invoke the Forest Reserve Act, sacralise Koubru hills as a lai-pham (deity-place) and encourage ching-kaba (hill-climbing) to effectuate this are clear pointers. A double-edged sword Although the timing chosen by the Hill Areas Committee to recommend, introduce and pass the Bill is questionable, it marks a calculated move to use this as a double-edged sword to simultaneously set apace electoral agenda for the upcoming Assembly elections in early 2022 and reclaim its agency to fortify state-level constitutional asymmetry. The attempt to increase membership of the six district councils to 31 members each and secure more powers to the councils by giving more developmental mandate are welcome. Yet, the reservation of one-fourth of the seats to socio-economically backward communities may complicate delimitation of constituencies. Earmarking merely three nominated members for unrepresented tribes/women is also simply not enough. If history is any guide, the task of reclaiming the Hill Areas Committee’s agency is not going to be easy as its 20-odd members often leverage tribe/party loyalty over commitment to protect constitutional asymmetry and common tribals’ cause. How the Hill Areas Committee and various tribal groups strategically navigate their politics to offset the majoritarian impulse to manipulate the legal and political process to dilute/dissolve extant constitutional asymmetry remains to be seen. A recent revelation by a tribal MLA in the Assembly that the hill areas attracted barely Rs. 419 crore (1.91%) out of the Rs. 21,900 crore budgetary expenditure of Manipur from 2017-18 to 2020-21 has unmasked Mr. Singh’s sincerity to ‘Go to the hills’. The lack of sincere commitment to promote tribal development, identity and culture that Article 371C seeks to bridge could not have come out starker. Recognising and institutionally accommodating tribal distinctiveness not just as a matter of political convenience, but as a valuable and enduring good will be key to promote the State’s integrity, stability and peace in the long run.

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Archakas of all hues||On August 14, 2021, the Tamil Nadu government appointed 24 trained archakas (priests) in temples across the State which come under the control of the Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE). On the same day, posts for odhuvar , poosari , mahout, garland stringers and an umbrella carrier were also filled. In the weeks since, a series of writ petitions have been filed before the Madras High Court assailing these appointments. State and temple The Tamil Nadu HR&CE Act, 1959, is the governing law on the administration of Hindu temples and religious institutions. In 1971, Section 55 of the HR&CE Act was amended to abolish hereditary priesthood. In 2006, the amendment provided for appointment of sufficiently trained Hindus irrespective of their caste as archakas to Hindu temples by the government. Challenges to both amendments were taken to the Supreme Court, which upheld the law, as amended. Nevertheless, calls to whittle down the scope and authority of the HR&CE Act have not diminished. In recent years, there has been a campaign seeking to “liberate temples” from the “clutches of government”. Building on this, the BJP’s manifesto for the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections in 2021 even included a proposal to hand over administration of Hindu temples to a “separate board consisting of Hindu scholars and saints”. The constitutional courts have had plenty of opportunities to consider the various challenges made to the HR&CE Act. In Seshammal v. Union (1972), the Supreme Court observed that the amendment to the HR&CE Act abolishing hereditary priesthood did not mean that the government intended to bring about any “change in the rituals and ceremonies”. Similarly, in Adi Saiva Sivachariyargal v. Govt. of Tamil Nadu (2015), it observed that “the constitutional legitimacy, naturally, must supersede all religious beliefs or practices”. The Court further went on to state that appointments should be tested on a case-by-case basis and any appointment that is not in line with the Agamas will be against the constitutional freedoms enshrined under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has recognised that the arguments using Agamas have been commonly used in petitions filed against any perceived government interference in the matters of temple administration. It has consistently held that any contention of violation of Agamas must be tested on a case-by -case basis. This is to say that no relief can be granted based on a bald averment that an executive decision or order has infringed Agamas or essential religious practices. Evolving jurisprudence Nevertheless, the evolution of rights-based jurisprudence over the last three years is of relevance. In Indian Young Lawyers’ Association v. State of Kerala (the Sabarimala case) and Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018), the Supreme Court reiterated the need to eliminate “historical discrimination which has pervaded certain identities”’, “systemic discrimination against disadvantaged groups”, and rejected stereotypical notions used to justify such discrimination. In all these cases, the Court prioritised judicial balancing of various constitutional rights. In the Sabarimala case, it held that “in the constitutional order of priorities, the individual right to the freedom of religion was not intended to prevail over but was subject to the overriding constitutional postulates of equality, liberty and personal freedoms recognised in the other provisions of Part III”. It went on to further clarify that “though our Constitution protects religious freedom and consequent rights and practices essential to religion, this Court will be guided by the pursuit to uphold the values of the Constitution, based in dignity, liberty and equality.” The constitutional courts will now be called upon to build on the gains of the Sabarimala case when it comes to administration of temples, insofar as it concerns matters that are not essentially religious. While doing so, they would be guided by principles of constitutional morality and substantive equality. The Supreme Court, in Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018), interpreted Article 15 as being wide, progressive and intersectional. The Court explained the intersectional nature of sex discrimination. Today, while most of the debate is around whether men from all caste groups can become archakas , we have failed to recognise the gender bias inherent in these discussions. Therefore, the present cases before the Madras High Court provide us with the opportunity to ask why women and trans persons should not be appointed as archakas . At once, caste orthodoxy and patriarchy entrenched within the realm of the HR&CE Act can be eliminated and supplanted with a vision of a just, equal and dignified society.

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Contentment in chaos||The US Open this year was supposed to be the unfurling of Novak Djokovic’s immortality, chasing a Calendar Grand Slam and a record-breaking 21st title. Tennis cognoscenti argued about just how washed out it would be as crowds returned to nil star power — Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and Venus Williams were all absent for the first time in 25 years. But the enduring storyline is of the emergence of fresh, charismatic talent on the women’s side unleashing a distinctive sort of chaos. Only this time, chaos led to hope and reassurance for the future. The women’s Next Gen Since 2017, the men’s tour has tirelessly marketed its ‘#NextGen’ campaign, a year-end event created to showcase its young crop. Finally, a leader has emerged from the pack in Daniil Medvedev, who defeated Djokovic in resounding fashion, signalling a real generational shift in men’s tennis that has been several years coming now. But the WTA doesn’t really need a splashy tournament or hashtagged extravaganza to build hype for its young players. They tend to go out and do it on their own. Exhibit A: the emphatic, definitive and astonishing exploits of teenagers Emma Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez at the US Open. In a closely fought final, Raducanu emerged victorious. It felt like the earth shifted a bit under New York. In tennis, critical acclaim is cyclical, often spurred by the defeats of legends. Federer’s early popularity came on the back of his win against Pete Sampras. It has, therefore, become something of a cardinal rule that the Next Gen must play and beat the veterans, instead of coming to the top after they have naturally faded. This is why Naomi Osaka and Bianca Andreescu’s title wins over Serena in 2018 and 2019 matter. A few years ago, one way to understand women’s tennis was to divide players into two groups: Serena Williams and everyone else. But not anymore. For fans of Serena and casual watchers of the sport, the wins might appear to deprive the world of history. But it is really a revelation, much like the recent triumphs of Raducanu and Fernandez. Their wins offer a sense of contentment: women’s tennis after Serena will not be starved of superlative star power. Collapsing constructs But the same could not be imagined of the men’s tour after the Big Three, until recently. For more than a decade, they have shut door after door on young stars-in-waiting who have tried to claim Grand Slam glory. In 2020, Dominic Thiem, often dubbed the eternal Prince Charles of men’s tennis, finally managed to break down the walls of the Big Three hierarchy — but without beating a single member of them. It felt exciting, promising and disappointing all at once. With Medvedev’s win, however, it seemed the sun had well and truly begun to set on the empire. Then again, this US Open showed what it would be like if we chose not to focus on constructs like ‘Big Three’ or ‘William Sisters’. These ideas in subtle ways direct how we think about tennis. Certain names shine brighter in draws wherever they’re placed. Tournaments become less about pitting a variety of talent from across the world against one another and more about micro-battles between a select few. These ideas need to lose their validity, because they no longer subscribe to what we can expect from a tournament. The 2021 US Open, in that regard, was a much-needed inflection point. It is the start of a fresh decade, and the depth of the women’s field is such that a player you haven’t heard of today can win a Major in the next two years. Some would argue that this is the problem with women’s tennis: it is too unpredictable. But this is the chaos that is inherent to the sport, and we need more of it. We need this new grammar to capture the men’s tour, too. There are countless opportunities to seize and openings to exploit. It is uncertain and confusing, but it is also thrilling because it is full of possibility. preethi.r@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/contentment-in-chaos/article36444288.ece
14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Talking amid conflict||Relations between the world’s two biggest powers, the U.S. and China, have been in free fall over the past five years amid the trade war launched by the Trump administration. Ties have remained strained despite the change in administration in Washington, with meetings between top officials, in Alaska and then in Tianjin, marked by their rancour. It is this perilous state of ties that likely prompted U.S. President Joe Biden to call his counterpart Xi Jinping on Friday, the first time they spoke since a conversation in February not long after Mr. Biden’s inauguration. While Mr. Biden wanted “to ensure competition does not veer into conflict”, Mr. Xi agreed both sides needed to “get the relationship right”, but underlined the repeated Chinese view that the troubles were “due to the U.S. policy on China”. Part of the Biden administration’s stated broader approach of competing with China where required but cooperating where possible, the U.S. has sought Chinese cooperation in Afghanistan after its disastrous exit, which has been celebrated by the state media in China, and also on climate change, which is a priority for this administration. At the same time, both sides have clashed on issues including human rights in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South China Sea actions, and the contentious inquiry into the origins of COVID-19. The Chinese side, for its part, has made clear it seeks concessions on some of the thorny issues before it will agree to discuss working together on others. In the July talks in Tianjin, Chinese officials presented two “lists” of demands to the U.S., including unconditionally revoking visa restrictions on Communist Party members and withdrawing an extradition request for Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of tech firm Huawei who is on trial in Canada. The Chinese side has also demanded the U.S. change its stance on the COVID-19 inquiry, where Washington has led calls for a more transparent investigation. The Chinese Foreign Minister likened U.S. calls for cooperation on climate change as seeking “an oasis” surrounded by desert. The “oasis”, he argued, would “sooner or later be desertified”. With the U.S. unlikely to agree to China’s preconditions, the state of relations is likely to endure. If the Chinese argument that it is unrealistic to insulate points of discord from a broader relationship is not entirely unreasonable, it is notable that Beijing’s officials have rejected that precise argument with regard to the strained relations with India, which has said cooperation on trade and other fronts cannot continue while the LAC remains in crisis. On the contrary, Beijing has hit out at New Delhi for “wavering and backpedalling” in its China policy, demanding that it keep the border “in an appropriate position”. If cooperating while in conflict appears an unreasonable proposition for China when it comes to ties with the U.S., it is unfathomable how it expects India to take a very different stand on bilateral relations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/talking-amid-conflict/article36444275.ece
14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||The first time||Daniil Medvedev’s stunning straight-sets victory over World No.1 Novak Djokovic brought the curtains down on one of the most eventful editions of the US Open in recent memory. In the lead-up, the script was laid out perfectly — of Djokovic trying to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Majors of the year and securing a record 21st Grand Slam title to take him past Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in the all-time tally. But Medvedev flipped that narrative with an astonishing display of power and creativity to secure his maiden Major trophy in his third final. The 25-year-old appeared the better player coming into the match. But to beat someone so skilled at turning pursuits of history and record-breaking feats into prime driving forces should count among the greatest of achievements. Medvedev is an unconventional counter-puncher, in that he has a blistering serve. On Sunday, the Russian ensured that one of the greatest returners of the modern era could not lay as much as a racquet on many serves, and remarkably, left the master of lateral baseline movement doubting his own patented game. The physical and emotional toll of the past fortnight was evident in the way Djokovic wept towards the end, with the only solace to be had from the notoriously fickle New York crowd finally warming up to him. Things might have seemed straightforward for Djokovic. Nadal and Federer were absent and he had beaten a rising star for each of his last three Majors, including Medvedev in a lopsided contest in Australia. But to overcome three of them in succession — here Matteo Berrettini, the Wimbledon finalist, Alexander Zverev, who beat Djokovic en route to the Tokyo Olympics gold, and Medvedev — proved beyond him. This is the kind of challenge that also awaits Federer and Nadal — more advanced in their careers than Djokovic — as they plot their return amidst growing evidence that the next generation is ready to contend. The women’s game, more amiable to the young and the fledgling, still managed to surprise as 18-year-old British qualifier Emma Raducanu triumphed over an equally unheralded Canadian teenager, Leylah Fernandez. For Raducanu, whose only previous appearance at a Slam was at Wimbledon 2021 where she capitalised on a wild card and reached the fourth round, to go three full weeks without losing a set was astounding. Fernandez should hold her head high too, for she beat two former champions in Naomi Osaka and Angelique Kerber, and two top-five players in Elina Svitolina and Aryna Sabalenka, all in three-setters. Raducanu’s technically solid game and Fernandez’s lefty flair can only be worthy additions to the fascinating mix of playing styles that adorns women’s tennis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-first-time/article36444276.ece
14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Reception of American blacks in Africa||Lagos, Sept. 13: A Cambridge-educated Nigerian judge and a visiting American civil rights leader met at a diplomatic reception in Lagos not long ago, and their conversation turned to the race problem in the United States. The black American told of brutal treatment he had received at the hands of Alabama policemen, and moving to unbutton his shirt, he offered to show the scars that they had left on his back. But the Nigerian stopped him saying, “I am simply not interested.” He later explained. “That young American assumed that he and I had some special common bond. But all we really have in common is that we both have black skin, and that’s evidently more important to him than it is to me.” The incident reflects what some regard as a new estrangement between American [blacks], many of whom look to Africa for their cultural heritage, and black Africans who are in charge here after a century of colonial domination. A black man who advises the black President of a country in southern Africa recalled a meeting with American [blacks]. “The Americans were talking about racism, and about burning down buildings in Detroit. Well, we sympathise, but now we’re in charge of our country, we’re trying to develop it, and we need all the buildings we have.” As tourists and as diplomats, as businessmen and even as potential settlers, American blacks are still streaming to Africa, but often it turns out not what to be they expected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/reception-of-american-blacks-in-africa/article36444285.ece
14 September 2021||CHENNAI,||Centre-industry trust critical during pandemic: Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said that the trust between government and industry is critical for leveraging opportunities thrown up by the COVID-19 pandemic. She also gave the assurance that the proposed development finance institution, the National Bank for Infrastructure Financing and Development, would become functional ‘soon’. She was addressing members of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here. This trust is also reflected in the government’s actions, she said. Elaborating on the government’s strategy for handling the pandemic, the Minister said that on the one hand the focus was on ramping up vaccination as that was the biggest protection against the pandemic, while on the other hand, the government was working on ramping up health infrastructure, including in the tier 2 and tier 3 cities, by supporting the private sector.  Liquidity is no longer a major concern, she said, while pointing out that the Bank-NBFC-MFI channel had been de-clogged. From October 15, there would be a special drive to reach credit to those who need it, the Finance Minister said. Parliament had earlier this year passed a Bill to set up a Rs. 20,000 crore DFI with a view to mobilise Rs. 111 lakh crore required for funding of the ambitious national infrastructure pipeline, which has more than 7,000 greenfield and brownfield projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/centre-industry-trust-critical-during-pandemic-sitharaman/article36444264.ece
14 September 2021||Mumbai,||Jet to resume local flights in Q1 of 2022||Jalan Kalrock Consortium, the successful resolution applicant of Jet Airways, announced on Monday that the grounded carrier would resume domestic flying operations in the first quarter of next year. The process of reviving Jet Airways was on track, with the existing Air Operator Certificate (AOC) already under process for revalidation, the consortium said. “The consortium is working closely with the relevant authorities and airport coordinators on slot allocation, required airport infrastructure, and night parking,” the new owners said in a statement. “We received the NCLT approval in June 2021, and since then we have been working closely with all concerned authorities to get the airline back in the skies,” said Murari Lal Jalan, lead member of the consortium and the proposed non-executive chairman of Jet Airways. “Jet Airways 2.0 aims at restarting domestic operations by Q1-2022, and short haul international operations by Q3/Q4 2022,” Mr. Jalan said. “Our plan is to have more than 50 aircraft in 3 years and over 100 in 5 years, which also fits perfectly well with the short-term and long-term business plan of the consortium,” he added. The revival plan for Jet Airways is being implemented as approved by NCLT and all the creditors would be settled as per the plan in the coming months, the consortium said in a statement. Captain Gaur, the new Accountable Manager and acting CEO said the airline would start with domestic operations on an all narrow-body aircraft fleet leased from major global aircraft lessors. Already more than 150 full-time employees had been hired on payroll and the plan was to onboard another 1,000 employees in the next 6 months across categories, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/jet-to-resume-local-flights-in-q1-of-2022/article36444272.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||NCLT can’t allow tweaks in a successful resolution plan: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday held that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) cannot permit withdrawals or modifications of a successful resolution plan, once it has been submitted to it after due compliance with the procedural requirements and timelines, solely at the behest of the resolution applicant. This would only create another tier of negotiations wholly unregulated by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the apex court observed. “Since the 330 days outer limit of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Proceedings (CIRP) under Section 12(3) of the IBC, including judicial proceedings, can be extended only in exceptional circumstances, this open-ended process for further negotiations or a withdrawal, would have a deleterious impact on the corporate debtor, its creditors, and the economy at large as the liquidation value depletes with the passage of time,” a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah observed in a 190-page judgment. The court said the NCLT cannot read too much into its residual powers under the IBC and create procedural remedies which have substantive outcomes on the process of insolvency. The judgment pertained to the NCLT’s decision to allow Ebix Singapore Private Limited to withdraw its resolution plan submitted for Educomp Solutions. The National Companies Law Appellate Tribunal had, however, reversed the NCLT order, saying the latter did not have jurisdiction to permit such withdrawal. The correctness of the NCLAT decision had come up in appeal before the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/nclt-cant-allow-tweaks-in-a-successful-resolution-plan-sc/article36444262.ece

Kotak Special Situations Fund (KSSF) has invested Rs. 200 crore in TVS Supply Chain Solutions and has provided Rs. 800-crore finance to T.S. Rajam Rubbers Private Ltd. through a non-convertible debentures route. The loan will help TVS SCS promoter R.

Dinesh in consolidating their ownership in a valuable and high-growth, technology-led business,” Srini Sriniwasan, managing director at KSSF’s parent Kotak Investment Advisors, said. ‘Growth-oriented focus’ KSSF’s chief executive Eshwar Karra said the investment was in line with the fund’s objective of participating in growth-oriented businesses. The fund is registered as an alternate investment fund with regulator SEBI and currently manages $1 billion with a mandate to invest in special situations, credit and distressed space in the domestic arena.

14 September 2021||MUMBAI,||Kinetic forays into EV kit business||Kinetic Engineering Ltd. said it had transformed itself into an auto components firm making mainly gear boxes and EV parts. The company, which had earlier been making losses, had been in the profit zone for the last two quarters, said managing director Ajinkya Firodia. In its former avatar, it used to make the Luna brand of mopeds and the Kinetic Honda scooter. It had outstanding debt of Rs. 250 crore that it has now repaid. It has come out with an Electric Vehicle (EV) kit for the manufacture of EV three-wheelers that are in demand, following incentives provided by the government, the company said. Since the government is encouraging EV supplies from domestic sources, the company is expecting major demand for EV kits, “We are celebrating 50 years... our company has now converted into an auto component manufacture,” Mr. Firodia said. “We have developed a complete EV kit that is 100% Indian. We are supplying the axle and gear box, and have sourced the motor and controller from domestic third parties,” he said. Demand in India for EV three-wheelers is about 20,000, sourced mostly from China. The firm is expecting Rs. 40 crore of business from this business and and will soon introduce a kit for EV two-wheeler assembly, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/kinetic-forays-into-ev-kit-business/article36444258.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Don’t let judicial delays fail IBC’||The Supreme Court on Monday held that judicial delay should not be a reason leading to the failure of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) regime like the way it did in the days before the Code came into existence. “We urge the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Appellate Law Tribunal (NCLAT) to be sensitive to the effect of such delays on the insolvency resolution process and be cognisant that adjournments hamper the efficacy of the judicial process,” a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah appealed. The judgment is significant as NCLT and NCLAT are among the key tribunals struggling with a burgeoning backlog only matched by their increasing vacancies. The NCLT and the NCLAT should endeavour to strictly adhere to the timelines stipulated under the IBC, it said. “Judicial delay was one of the major reasons for the failure of the insolvency regime that was in effect prior to the IBC. We cannot let the present insolvency regime meet the same fate,” Justice Chandrachud observed. The Bench observed that ‘long delays’ in approving resolution plans under the IBC by the NCLT affect their implementation. “These delays, if systemic and frequent, will have an undeniable impact on the commercial assessment that the parties undertake during the course of the negotiation,” the Bench highlighted. The court drew attention to a report filed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ Standing Committee on Finance on the implementation of IBC. The report had noted that a delay in the resolution process with more than 71% cases pending for over 180 days was in deviation of the original objective and timeline for corporate insolvency resolution process envisaged by the IBC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/dont-let-judicial-delays-fail-ibc/article36444261.ece
14 September 2021||HYDERABAD,||New deadline for COVID policies is Mar. 31: IRDAI||Insurance regulator IRDAI has extended the timelines for insurers to sell and renew short-term COVID-specific health insurance policies by another six months till March 31. The partial modification of an earlier circular, in which it had set September 30 as last date for sale and renewal of Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak, is bound to come as a relief for both existing and prospective policyholders given the lurking threat of another wave of the pandemic. Introduced last year by insurers on the directions of IRDAI, customer response to the COVID-specific health covers has been encouraging. The mounting claims, in the face of a number of people hospitalised for COVID-19, however, led to reports of insurers keen on a tariff revision. All other terms and conditions remain valid as specified under the respective guidelines, the regulator said. Separately, IRDAI also extended till March 31 exemptions granted to general insurers for obtaining wet signature on applications as well as issuing hard copies of the policy documents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/new-deadline-for-covid-policies-is-mar-31-irdai/article36444255.ece

It observed that as Vodafone Idea’s large liabilities are falling due, and given the impending launch of JioPhone Next (whose roll-out timeline has now been pushed to before Diwali), “the sooner the government measures as well as tariff hikes are rolled out, the better.” A moratorium on AGR and spectrum payments are reportedly among key relief measures being lined up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sizeable-tariff-increase-must-for-vodafone-idea/article36444270.ece

Barca faces Bayern Munich at Camp Nou in Group E on Tuesday — the first time after the 8-2 thrashing last year — and will begin the competition as outsiders following a traumatic summer transfer window. “I felt like everyone else, I was in a state of shock,” Busquets said in a press conference. Meanwhile, Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said things were changing at Barcelona and added that players like midfielders Pedri and Frenkie De Jong and forward Memphis Depay would get opportunities to shine. Managing game time Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he will carefully manage Cristiano Ronaldo’s playing time. United returns to action in Tuesday’s match against Swiss club Young Boys and Solskjaer said he would not rule out resting Ronaldo. Massimiliano Allegri is the man who has taken Juventus closest to its dream of Champions League glory in recent seasons, but he begins this season’s European campaign in the midst of a dreadful start to the domestic season. Juventus kicks off at Malmo, a relatively soft start to Group H which before the Napoli defeat Allegri called the “most important” game of a group which also contains current European champion Chelsea.

14 September 2021||New York,||Clinical Medvedev dashes Djokovic’s Grand Slam dream||Daniil Medvedev shattered Novak Djokovic’s Grand Slam dream with a straight-set victory in the US Open final here on Sunday, denying the World No. 1 a record-breaking 21st Major men’s singles title. Dominant Russia’s second-ranked Medvedev dominated Djokovic 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to prevent the first calendar-year Grand Slam since 1969 and keep Djokovic level with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal atop the career Slam title list. “Sorry for you fans and Novak because we all know what he was going for,” Medvedev said. “What you have accomplished in your career... for me, you are the greatest tennis player in history.” Medvedev captured his first Grand Slam title in his third Slam final, a rematch of February’s Australian Open final, won in straight sets by the 34-year-old Serbian to launch his Slam quest. “Congratulations to Daniil. Amazing match,” Djokovic said. “If there’s anyone that deserves a Grand Slam title right now, it’s you.” Djokovic’s bid to sweep the US, French and Australian Opens and Wimbledon in the same year for the first time since Rod Laver did it 52 years ago collapsed at the last hurdle, with the 83-year-old Aussie legend Laver among 23,700 watching at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic missed out on his fourth US Open title and will enter 2022 tied with ‘Big Three’ rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, both absent with injuries, on an all-time record 20 men’s Slam titles. A tearful Djokovic paid tribute to the crowd that roared support for him even when all seemed lost down two sets and two breaks. “Even though I have not won the match, my heart is filled with joy and I’m the happiest man alive because you guys have made me feel special on the court,” Djokovic said. “You guys touch my soul. I’ve never felt like this in New York.” Djokovic saw his 27-match Slam win streak halted three shy of the record he set in 2015 and 2016 when he won four consecutive Slams, ending with the 2016 French Open. Medvedev, 25, became the third Russian man to win a Grand Slam title after Yevgeny Kafelnikov at the 1996 French Open and 1999 Australian Open and Marat Safin at the 2000 US Open and 2005 Australian Open.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/clinical-medvedev-dashes-djokovics-grand-slam-dream/article36444518.ece

14 September 2021||Chennai,||Technology will play a bigger role: Kumble||Former India captain and head coach Anil Kumble felt that analytics and data intelligence in the sport is going to play a bigger role going forward especially in the shorter formats of the game like T20 and The Hundred. “I think the shorter the game, the sort of influence that data will have will be more and more. The dependence on data is far more in putting together a squad, strategies and match-ups. And we keep talking about match-ups and that's how you build a strategy around teams, so that will be the driving factor,” said Kumble. India’s highest Test wicket-taker was speaking at a panel discussion on Building Competitive Advantage through Sports Analytics and Data Intelligence, organised by Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai, with Deakin University South Asia. The 50-year-old who is currently the head coach of IPL side Punjab Kings, also added that players will need to adapt to new technologies and data if they don’t want to be left behind. “I know that we are still sort of having that debate over, is this too much technology in sport or should I just go back to my own belief of ‘I just watch the ball and hit the ball’? “Yes, that's a simple way. But then I think, if you don't sort of adapt to technology that's coming in and use that technology for the good of the game, I think people will be left behind,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/technology-will-play-a-bigger-role-kumble/article36444502.ece
14 September 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Unfortunate to end up here early’||India and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) captain Virat Kohli stated that COVID-19 has thrown the cricket schedule out of gear, and that “anything can happen”. Kohli arrived in UAE for the second leg of the IPL a few days earlier that planned, after the fifth Test between India and England was called off. The final Test at Manchester took the hit after members of the Indian contingent, including head coach Ravi Shastri, tested positive for COVID-19. “It is unfortunate that we had to end up here (in UAE) early, but with COVID-19, things are very uncertain. Anything can happen at any time. Hopefully we will be able to maintain a good, strong, and secure environment, and have a quality IPL,” Kohli said in a RCB Bold Diaries video. Kohli and pacer Mohammed Siraj - both of whom travelled from Manchester to Dubai via a chartered flight - will serve a quarantine period of six days before joining the RCB squad for training.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/unfortunate-to-end-up-here-early/article36444512.ece

There are certain events where we have good chances of winning medals in the Commonwealth Games, they (athletes who are good in these events) will only be sent only for this,” said Lalit K. Bhanot, the chairman of AFI’s Planning Committee, on Monday evening. “But definitely we will go with full strength to the Asian Games. And those who qualify, we will send them to the World championships (in the US).” The three majors will be held within the space of some two months from July 15, next year. But AFI president Adille Sumariwalla made it clear that there will be a last meet, before the Worlds and the Olympics, where athletes will have to prove themselves even if they make the qualification cut earlier. Final trial “We have seen that the qualification period for the Olympics and Worlds is a very long one. So, athletes have sometimes qualified even a year before. “Now, we have taken a decision that there will be one final trial (most probably a championship) where they will have to perform even if they had already qualified,” said Sumariwalla. “If they are close to the qualifying performance, it’s fine, otherwise those people will be dropped.” The AFI also made it clear again than non-campers will not be picked for relay teams.

14 September 2021||KOCHI,||AFI takes tough measures||They all broke national records this year but the slump in their performance at the Tokyo Olympics has forced the Athletics Federation of India to change the coaches of long jumper M. Sreeshankar, shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor and javelin thrower Annu Rani. “Sreeshankar’s coach, his father (former international S. Murali), had given in writing that if he did not perform at the Olympics, if he did not cross 8m, he will stop coaching him and he will listen to us and we can get him another coach, foreign coach or whatever. The first action has already been taken, we have changed his coach,” said AFI president Adille Sumariwalla after the federation’s executive council meeting in Jaipur on Monday evening. Hohn removed “Annu’s and Shivpal Singh’s coach Uwe Hohn (former world record holder) is also being sent home and we are looking for a foreign coach for Toor.” Two new javelin coaches will be appointed. However, the fate of Russian Galina Bukharina, the relays and quartermilers coach, is not clear. For years, the AFI had been harping that the women’s 4x400m relay team had the potential to win an Olympic medal. This time, however, India could not qualify for the Olympics with many of the leading quartermilers injured. “We are evaluating the reasons: what happened in the women’s, the injuries, the causes... but don’t forget the men broke the Asian record, so the 400m coach has one good and one bad... we have to evaluate, there is no love for anybody, if you don’t perform, you perish,” said Sumariwalla. Despite the many setbacks, this has also been India’s best-ever Olympics with javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra bringing the country its first athletics gold. And with three medals coming in the under-20 Worlds in Nairobi, the AFI has decided to focus on the juniors in a big way. Foreign coaches Foreign coaches will be brought for the juniors in select events like the 400m, javelin throw, long jump, triple jump and race walking. They will have more competitions too. The AFI president also revealed that Tata Steel will be the host of the National Open championships for the next five years in Jamshedpur.

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||India gets past Ukraine, enters semifinals||Making amends for its failure to finish the job in the second set, India scripted a commanding 5-1 victory in the blitz tiebreaker against Ukraine to enter the semifinals of the FIDE Online Chess Olympiad on Monday. After India comfortably won the first set 4-2, Ukraine rallied from 0.5-2.5 in the second to win the last three games, involving Vidit Gujrathi, R. Vaishali and K. Humpy, in that order. In the tiebreaker, played under the time-control of three minutes for each player and a two-second increment per move, India dominated in great style after resting Viswanathan Anand and P. Harikrishna on the top two boards. Nihal Sarin, beneficiary of a 12-minute advantage on the clock after Platon Galperin reported late in the first set, won against the same rival when the Ukrainian’s internet connection dropped. Soon, Vidit drew with Vassily Ivanchuk and Harika scored her third victory of the day by destroying Nataliya Buska with a fine display of tactics. Vaishali returned to winning ways before Humpy drew to complete India’s triumph. Anand relieved “Relived”, was how Anand described the feeling after the match, before adding, “Obviously disappointed not to score in the second game, which would have clinched it (for India). When I made the draw, I thought we had clinched it anyway. “I looked at the three (ongoing) games and thought on at least two, we were safe. Then a dramatic turnaround happened after which India did extremely well in the blitz.” Harika’s return to form was great news for India. Recovering from viral during the league phase during which she was involved in three draws, Harika produced a scintillating performance by winning against in-form Nataliya Buska and Natalia Zhukova.  The results (quarterfinals):   Set I: Ukraine lost to India 2-4 (Vassily Ivanchuk drew with Viswanathan Anand; Kirill Shevchenko drew with P. Harikrishna; Iulija Osmak drew with K. Humpy; Nataliya Buska lost to D. Harika; Platon Galperin lost to Nihal Sarin; Mariia Berdnyk drew with R. Vaishali).   Set II: India lost to Ukraine 2.5-3.5 (Anand drew with Ivanchuk; Vidit lost to Kirill Shevchenko; Humpy lost to Osmak; Harika bt Natalia Zhukova; R. Praggnanandhaa bt Galperin; Vaishali lost to Berdnyk).   Blitz tie-breaker: Ukraine lost to India 1-5 (Ivanchuk drew with Vidit; Shevchenko lost to B. Adhiban; Osmak drew with Humpy; Buksa lost to Harika; Galperin lost to Sarin; Berdnyk lost to Vaishali) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-gets-past-ukraine-enters-semifinals/article36444499.ece

14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Raducanu and her Indian sojourn||When Mahak Jain won the girls’ title in the Road to Wimbledon UK under-14 tennis championship in 2015, Emma Raducanu had given a hint of her future by winning a doubles quarterfinal against the Indian 6-2, 6-0. Raducanu, about 12 then, had partnered Andre Lukosiute to beat Mahak and her partner Mathilde Sreeves. Queried about Indian players dominating the tournament, British coach Dan Bloxham had mentioned then that English players were “working doubly hard”. The 18-year-old Raducanu has taken the quickest steps, as a qualifier ranked 150, to a Grand Slam title in New York. Her best title before this was the $25,000 tournament she won in Pune in December 2019. In January 2018, Raducanu had won the ITF grade-3 junior tournament in Chandigarh, and followed that with the grade-2 title in Delhi. Vaidehi Chaudhari had a good match against Raducanu in Delhi, but retired at 4-6, 2-4 owing to a sprained ankle “I remember Emma being very energetic and getting every ball back. She was very quick on court. I feel very proud to have played a good match against her,” recalled Vaidehi, who trains with coach Jignesh Raval in Ahmedabad. “Emma was on a mission then. She was winning a series of junior titles at that time. She was on fire,” recalled Raval. Conceding that Raducanu’s incredible success has lent a lot of clarity to the right approach, Raval said that he would make a series of videos to educate players and parents about, “what to do, and what not to do”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/raducanu-and-her-indian-sojourn/article36444516.ece

14 September 2021||BENGALURU,||Rahul, Prasidh among probables||K.L. Rahul, Prasidh Krishna, Mayank Agarwal and Devdutt Padikkal headline Karnataka’s white-ball probables list that was announced on Monday for the upcoming domestic cricket season. The State selection committee drew up a list of 35 players for the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament to be held from November 4 and the Vijay Hazare one-day tournament starting December 8. Fazal Khaleel, chairman of the State senior selection committee, said the move to name probables for both tournaments was to create a pool and keep players together as a bunch rather than allowing them to splinter. Continuous monitoring “The BCCI mandates that we register a fixed number of players,” he said. “It also helps us keep them close to the coaches so that we can continuously monitor their progress and fitness.” “We are closely looking at a few promising youngsters and we also need to build a solid bench that is capable of stepping up because the national team players will not be always available. “But it’s not that there will be no additions and deletions. That depends on players’ form and fitness,” Khaleel added. As it stands, Rahul will be unavailable for the Mushtaq Ali trophy, as he will be away with the Indian national team at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates.  The list: K.L. Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Devdutt Padikkal, R. Samarth, Mohd. Aqib Jawad, Rohan Kadam, A. Rohan Patil, Abhinav Manohar, K.V. Siddharth, Manish Pandey, Anirudha A. Joshi, Karun Nair, K.L. Shrijith, B.R.

I don’t think I’ve ever been hit on the head by a car before and it’s quite a shock for me because I don’t know if you’ve seen the image but my head really is quite far forward. And I’ve been racing a long, long time, so I’m so, so grateful that I’m still here.” Verstappen was later handed a three-place grid drop for the Russian Grand Prix with Hamilton hoping the ruling set a precedent for the pair’s future battles on track, after a series of incidents between them this year. “I think I’m ultimately proud of stewards,” said Hamilton of the ruling. “I need some time to really reflect on it, but I think it definitely sets a precedent, and I think it’s important for us moving forwards, for the safety of the drivers, that there are strict rules in place.”  Honestly, I feel very fortunate today... I’m so, so grateful that I’m still here||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hamilton-praises-halo-for-saving-him/article36444713.ece
14 September 2021||Monza,||Three-place grid penalty for Verstappen||Red Bull’s championship leader Max Verstappen was handed a three-place grid penalty for his role in the frightening crash with Lewis Hamilton in Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix, the stewards at Monza announced. The Dutch driver was “predominantly to blame” for the incident that wiped him and his Mercedes rival out of the race won by McLaren’s Daniel Ricciardo, a statement read. The penalty will be applied at the Russian GP. Verstappen, who leads Hamilton by five points, had tried to muscle past Hamilton who had just rejoined the track after a pit-stop. But Verstappen’s car, pushed onto the kerb at the Turn One chicane, ended up with its back wheel rolling over the top of his rival’s Mercedes, narrowly missing Hamilton’s head. Both drivers then slid into the gravel and were forced to retire. In the stewards’ verdict after interviewing both drivers, although Hamilton’s line forced Verstappen onto the kerb, the Red Bull man had attempted the manoeuvre too late for him to have “the right to racing room”. Meanwhile, Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Raikkonen will return to Formula One action at Sochi. Raikkonen was sidelined for the Dutch and Italian GPs after he tested positive for COVID-19, earlier this month. One of the Alfa Romeo’s reserve drivers — Robert Kubica — replaced Raikkonen for both races. The 41-year-old Finn posted an Instagram message which read: “I am all good. See you at the next GP.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/verstappen-handed-three-place-grid-penalty/article36444575.ece

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||A big, intriguing dose of dopamine||Chronicling real-life terror strikes in the tone of a thriller is a trend that has been in vogue for some time. Filmmakers Nikkhil Advani and Nikhil Gonsalves have come up with their version of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks — but unlike others — the show positions itself in a government hospital that is low on resources, but high on talent and human spirit. The location lends itself to a more humane, a more rational and compassionate view of the crises that led to the death of 174 people (including nine attackers), as well as a melodramatic, blood-soaked narrative of the mind-numbing night. Made in the popular idiom, where you are expected to first get engaged and then get entertained by a real human tragedy, Advani and his cast and crew don’t disappoint and carefully navigate 60-odd hours of horror to stitch together an eight-episode series that is compelling for the most part. Potent commentary The series starts as a medical thriller, but soon spreads to different locations that were hit by terrorists and, along the way, makes potent comments on our health infrastructure and role of the media in a national crisis. It loudly raises issues of medical ethics, and makes a point on how government hospitals are still the last hope of the poor and the abandoned. And, of course, there are bullet points like the social discrimination of a Muslim doctor, and a female doctor not being considered equal to her male counterpart, that are underlined with an ink-splattering marker. Another interesting aspect is the way the writers have imbued the back stories of the protagonists to the narrative. It gives an insight into the inner demons they are grappling with and, up to a point, provides respite from the shower of bullets. The immaculate casting adds to the quality of writing. The body language of the actors and proficient use of medical terms lend an air of authenticity to the proceedings. Mohit Raina is utterly persuasive as Dr. Kaushik Oberoi, for whom saving human life is more important than judging its character. Oberoi is the rare breed of skilful professional who is guided by heart, and Raina makes the character believable. Among the rest of the cast, Konkona Sen Sharma lends credible support as the social services director whose troubled past has not diminished her empathy for the disadvantaged. The way she twists her shoulder in between all the chaos gives us a sense of the tiring staff (no amount of make-up could have captured that). As the young residents, Mrunmayee Deshpande, Natasha Bharadwaj and Satyajeet Dubey ensure there are no botch-ups. But it is Tina Desai as Ananya Ghosh, the intrepid F&B manager of Palace Hotel, who steals the show with an effortless performance. Shreya Dhanwanthary is not bad either as the TRP-chasing broadcast journalist. Raw, gritty sequences The action sequences choreographed by Mohammad Amin Khatib are raw and gritty, and together with editor Maahir Zaveri, ensures the last two episodes take our breath away. Art director Vijay Ghodke ensures that the setting of a run-down general hospital doesn’t look plastic. Though there is so much footage of the attacks in the public domain, cinematographer Kaushal Shah’s footage merges with the images in our memory. However, the marriage between the craft and the cause is not consistently smooth. After a point, the series falls into a pattern where every shoot-out is followed by the back story of one of the characters. It means after every few minutes, at a corner of the screen, something is typed with the background sound of a jerky typewriter to tell you where you are. It irks. So does the way the nail paint of the journalist comes and goes during the attack. There are also passages where it seems that the show is keen to press old wounds, so that blood oozes out to colour our opinion. The balance between the good Muslim-bad Muslim trope feels manufactured, and if you keep pressing the same buttons, even well-meaning comparisons lose their bite. Invoking the 1984 Sikh riots to say that no religion is bad, and that it is the people who use them for their motives are, has become repetitive. Writers have to find newer ways to put the point across. Overall, Mumbai Diaries 26/11 reads like a diary of a person who knows how to smartly conceal his real emotions.

14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Vijay Sethupathi-Parthiban reunion is a wisecracking win-win||When we think of one-upmanship, it’s mostly different personalities and people from different strata of society. In latest Tamil release Tughlaq Darbar , Singam (Vijay Sethupathi) and Rayappan (Parthiban) are two different people; the former is a thondan (worker), and the latter is his thalaivar (leader). But let us, for a minute, observe the actors playing them: Vijay Sethupathi’s casual approach has been most effective in the past few years, making him a hot favourite among audiences, while Parthiban has proved since the 90s that he’s blessed with a phenomenal gift of the gab. The two came together in Naanum Rowdy Thaan (2015), an irreverent film that had oodles of comedy and worked brilliantly. They recreate that to a large extent in Tughlaq Darbar , a political drama that infuses funny lines and emotion in considerable measure. Singam admires Rayappan and wants to be like him, but his circumstances drastically change when he’s hit by a jealous party member. Will these new circumstances, in his pursuit of political greatness, lead him to a path of good or evil? Vijay Sethupathi isn’t doing anything radically different from what he has done already in films like Pizza and Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kanom , but that it plays out in a political milieu — where people are trying to get ahead of each other at any cost — is refreshing (the segment involving a mirror is one that Sethupathi aces). Good comedy writing Director Delhiprasad Deenadayalan also seems to have a good sense of comedy writing; another scene in which a few people are expecting a phone call is a laugh riot. We wished there was more of that, rather than the filmmaker’s idea to take forward a great comical set-up with colours of revolution (literally). It doesn’t help that some of the supporting characters, with the exception of Vasu (Karunakaran), aren’t written well; Manimegalai (Manjima Mohan) seems to be just pondering what the hell is going on, while the romance angle with Kamatchi (Raashi Khanna) seems to be there just for the sake of it. Thankfully, we get an interesting song in Kami Kami , composed by Govind Vasantha and written by Karky. The biggest USP of the film is the interesting assortment of actors thrown in the mix; Vijay Sethupathi (showing a lot more purpose that he did in his other recent release Laabam ), Parthiban (the nakkal in him is still intact) and even Sathyaraj. With all of them in decent form, it seeks to address the all-important question that Kamal Haasan was asked in the classic Nayakan : “ Neenga nallavara kettavara?”  Well, the answer lies within you.

14 September 2021||Chandigarh,||Akali Dal names candidates for Assembly polls||Taking a lead over its political rivals in the run-up to next year’s Assembly polls, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has announced names of 64 candidates for the 117-member House. On Monday, party president and Lok Sabha MP Sukhbir Singh Badal, who will contest from Jalalabad, released the names of 64 party candidates. The longer list comes days after the party announced the names of 22 candidates. According to the party statement, former Agriculture Minister Tota Singh will contest from Dharmot. Former Education Minister Dr. Daljit Singh Cheema will contest from Ropar. The other senior leaders on the candidate list include Janmeja Singh Sekhon from Zira, Maheshinder Singh Grewal from Ludhiana West, Sikander Singh Maluka from Rampura Phul, Jagmeet Brar from Maur, Sharanjit Singh Dhillon from Sahnewal and Gulzar Singh Ranike from Attari (SC) constituency. The SAD and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have inked an electoral alliance for the 2022 polls, with former contesting 97 seats and the latter 20. ‘Cong. betrayed people’ “We have been raising the issues surrounding public interest and anti-people stance of the ruling government during the last four and half years. Already our party cadre are on the ground and have been working hard to convey to the masses about betrayals committed by the ruling Congress government. In this chain, taking a lead we have formally announced names of 64 candidates,” said Dr. Daljit Cheema. The SAD earlier had an alliance with the BJP but parted ways with the NDA over the farm laws issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/akali-dal-names-candidates-for-assembly-polls/article36444727.ece
14 September 2021||Lucknow,||BSP will not go with BJP to form govt. in U.P., says Misra||Senior Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Satish Chandra Misra on Monday ruled out “200%” any post-poll alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh, asserting that his party would form a government with a clear-cut majority. The BSP would also not tie up with any other party, the close confidant of party supremo Mayawati, said. “We will neither form an alliance with any other party nor take support. We would prefer to sit in the Opposition,” the BSP general secretary said. “The BSP is forming its government in 2022 with a full majority. In case of any other scenario arising after the elections, we will never go with the BJP and this is 200 per cent final,” he said. Mr. Misra’s assertion came amid a growing perception that the BSP could again join hands with the BJP if the 2022 Assembly elections throw a hung House. The BSP has in the past formed governments in the country’s most populous State both with the BJP and the Samajwadi Party (SP). In 1993, it tied up with the SP, whose Mulayam Singh Yadav-headed the government. In 1995, it pulled out and Mayawati became CM with the BJP’s support for a few months. In 1997 and in 2002, the BSP again formed the government in coalition with the BJP. In 2007, relying on a Dalit-Brahmin combination, the party formed the government on its own, winning 206 seats in the 403-member assembly. Winning formula The BSP is once again trying to revive this winning “Dalit-Brahmin” combination, holding a series of ‘Brahmin sammelans’ across the State.Dalits constitute an estimated 20% of the population of Uttar Pradesh and the Brahmins are said to form 13%. “The BSP started the trend and all the parties are now aiming to rope in the Brahmins and going all out to woo them,” Mr. Misra, the BSP’s Brahmin face, said, referring to similar “sammelans” held by the BJP and the SP. “But 80% of the Brahmins are with us. Only those Brahmins who are office-bearers of any party or are themselves contesting the elections are not with the BSP, and all these parties are fighting for them through the outreach programmes,” he said. ‘BSP in sweep polls’ Mr. Misra claimed that not just the Brahmins but members of all other castes and religious groups who have a first-hand experience of the Mayawati government are supporting the party this time. He said the party is all set to surpass its showing in the 2007 elections. In an apparent reference to All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi, Mr. Misra claimed there is a trend of leaders coming from other States at election time to target Muslims in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bsp-will-not-go-with-bjp-to-form-govt-in-up-says-misra/article36444734.ece
14 September 2021||September 14 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Bhoot Police’ movie review: Two ghost hunters address the family audience||In times when the OTT platforms are serving a lot of trash in the name of being realistic and visceral, here comes a horror-comedy that literally tells us to push logic into a corner and take a ride that is mostly amusing and mildly frightening. Mounted like a modern-day fable, the tale of two ghost hunters, addresses the family audience, a rarity these days. Taking forward the Stree kind of storytelling, it comes across as a stress buster during the pandemic. Usually such fare expects the audience to believe in the mumbo jumbo, but director Pavan Kripalani, who has established himself as a kind of spook specialist, teams up with writers Devashish Makhija and Sumit Bakheja to create a universe where one of the two lead protagonists prides in selling superstition to the believers. It provides an opportunity to consistently mock at the genre even as they tell the story of a spirit on the prowl. Ghost hunters Vibhuti (Saif Ali Khan) and Chiraunji (Arjun Kapoor) have been roped in by Maya (Yami Gautam), a tea estate owner, to complete the unfinished business of their father. Vibhuti sees it as yet another opportunity to fleece an innocent client, while his younger brother feels it is time they showcase the skill they have inherited from their father. Their names are traditional but their vocabulary is very up to date. Meanwhile, Maya’s sister (Jacqueline Fernandez) has her own plans and motives to tackle the situation. It spirals into a series of satirical and subversive situations, making social and political comments between the lines. Be it the take on girl education or a subtle reference to the National Register of Citizens, or for that matter, a jibe at nepotism, the writers keep it witty for the most part and use the horror trope to remind us of the social fears that we face. Be it the fair of occultists or the ghost’s movement in the woods, Mr. Kripalani’s strands of comedy and horror feed off each other. The imaginative use of the Kyun Ho Gaya Na number ‘ Aao Naa’ by a villager to help her husband in taking a dump on a dreadful night is one of the highlights. Perfect casting The casting is spot on. Saif Ali Khan is in the Go Goa Gone mode and effortlessly doles out one punchline after the other. It is his pitch-perfect performance that makes the writing livelier. Arjun Kapoor fits the part of the brooding brother looking to find his mojo. So does Jacqueline as the glamorous social media influencer who wants to shift to London. Jaaved Jaaferi and Jamie Lever’s comic timing add to the mirthful atmosphere. The storyline gets predictable towards the end, but before it drags, Bhoot Police pack their bags, perhaps for a second outing.

14 September 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Spare Punjab, move protests to Delhi: Amarinder to farmers||Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday urged farmers’ unions not to hold protests across Punjab against the farm reform laws as the demonstrations were not in the “economic interest of the State” and advised the protesters to shift their sit-in venues to Delhi’s borders or in Haryana. ‘In solidarity’ He said the Punjab government and its people had already expressed solidarity with the farmers against the farm laws and argued that the ongoing protests at 113 places in the State were considerably hampering its economic development. “I want to tell farmer brothers that it is your Punjab, your villages, your people. We should not disturb our Punjab. You do whatever you want to do at Delhi (borders), put pressure on them [the Centre] and make them agree,” said Captain Amarinder. He accused the Shiromani Akali Dal of “double crossing” the farmers on the issue of the farm laws. The Chief Minister said the laws were drafted with the consent of the Akali Dal with its MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal as the Union Minister. He alleged that even former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal had argued in favour of these laws but the party changed its tune completely when the move backfired. He said the Congress was the only party that protested against the contentious laws from day one. “The Congress government called an all-party meeting and then held consultations with the farm unions. Later, the government convened a special session of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha and passed Bills aimed at countering these farm laws,” he said while addressing a gathering at an event to lay the foundation stone of PAU - College of Agriculture at Ballowal Saunkhri in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district. The Chief Minister said the Constitution has been amended 127 times since 1950. “So why not one more time to repeal the farm laws for providing succour to the farmers who have been sitting at the Singhu and Tikri borders,” he asked. In Hoshiarpur, Capt. Amarinder appealed to the representatives of various farmers’ unions to spare Punjab from their protests and mount pressure on the Centre from the Delhi borders or Haryana instead. Reacting to Captain Amarinder’s statement, Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij accused him of instigating the farmers. “It is a very irresponsible statement of Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to tell farmers that do whatever you want in Haryana or at Delhi borders but do not do it in Punjab,” Mr. Vij said in a tweet. “This proves that Amarinder Singh has done the work of instigating farmers,” he added.  (With inputs from PTI)   The Constitution has been amended 127 times since 1950.

14 September 2021||JAIPUR,||Differently abled couples take pledge against dowry system||Twenty-one differently abled and underprivileged couples, who tied the nuptial knot at a mass wedding ceremony in Udaipur, took a pledge against the dowry system and called upon the people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The ceremony was organised with adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour. This was the 36th mass wedding ceremony organised by the Narayan Seva Sansthan (NSS), a charitable institution, for the persons with disability, many of whom had earlier received its assistance through corrective surgery. Donors gifted several household items to the newly married couples. The celebration took place on Saturday like any other wedding, with all rituals and processions, though the participants wore face masks and maintained a degree of distance from one another. NSS president Prashant Agarwal said the institution had so far helped 2,109 differently abled couples in leading a happy and prosperous married life. “We have entered the 19th year of our flagship campaign against dowry with the regular holding of these ceremonies,” Mr. Agarwal said. Several couples were skilled through the Sansthan’s vocational training programmes, while the institution also recruited a few of them by offering jobs which fitted their capacities. Social inclusion Couples from several States had approached the NSS with the request for assistance to support their wedding. Mr. Agarwal said 21 couples from five States were shortlisted for the mass wedding, which ensured their social inclusion and help for leading a normal life, which would enable them to become a part of the mainstream society. Roshan Lal, 26, appearing in the teachers’ recruitment examination and married to Kamla Kumari, had earlier benefited from free-of-cost surgery and skills training classes provided by the NSS. Sant Kumari, 24, also married in the ceremony, said she would launch a start-up to utilise her stitching skills and extend financial support to her husband. The NSS has taken up activities such as artificial limb distribution, corrective surgery, skill education, health care support, free food offering and talent nurturing along with mass wedding ceremonies for the differently abled. The institution has also launched the World of Humanity Foundation to nurture their skills and enable them to earn a sustainable livelihood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/differently-abled-couples-take-pledge-against-dowry-system/article36444994.ece
14 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Civil society hails ‘public spirited activists’ during anti-CAA protests||At a public meeting held at the Press Club of India in New Delhi on Monday to mark a year of Umar Khalid’s imprisonment for his alleged role during anti-CAA protests, several civil society members, including activists, journalists and parliamentarians, raised questions over whether the citizens have the right to oppose the government and its policies under the ruling dispensation. Mr. Khalid was taken into custody on September 13 last year after hours of questioning. The speakers at the meeting said through the investigation by the Delhi police of the ‘riots’, the “public spirited activists and youth” had been targeted by the government. Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan said, “It is nearly two years since the anti-CAA protests began. It was an exemplary protest where political parties were not involved and it were the women and the public spirited youth who came forward. The Constitution was being explained to the children and the preamble was being read out. The protest was against a law which, by several factors, was against the Constitution as it is a discriminatory law.” Stating that there were recorded evidences of people carrying out violence, Mr. Bhushan said, “Despite videos, the country’s finest public spirited activists and Muslims were targeted. It is a conspiracy to frame innocent people and allow the guilty to go scot-free under the garb of an investigation.” Syeda Hameed, former member of the Planning Commission, said, “Umar Khalid’s only crime was that he was upholding the Constitution and was raising his voice against the CAA-NRC-NPR. He stood by those women, children and ‘dadis’ who had never stepped out earlier. Shaheen Bagh was a courageous movement which spread to other parts of the world as well. The protest had become a fountainhead of ‘Inquilaab’.” The victims were made conspirators, said Zafarul Islam Khan, former Chairperson of the Delhi Minorities Commission. “There should be a high level judicial inquiry, which still has not happened. Several of the FIRs were clubbed together so that proper investigation does not happen. Local victims are also not being helped much even though they were the ones most affected. We need to ensure black laws such as the UAPA are removed, else this pattern is bound to continue,” he said. Stating that Mr. Khalid is “one of the brightest and most uncontaminated minds of this age,” Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Kumar Jha said, “In these difficult times, you will not find heroes in films but behind bars for speaking against the government.” Siddharth Vardarajan, the founding editor of The Wire, said, “The collateral benefit to the police from the misuse of power has also been their attempt to rewrite history of the anti-CAA protests. What also marked it out was the fact that it was something that rose from among the people. The manner in which law enforcement is working in Delhi, the actual conspirators of communalism are actually being given a free pass.”  Umar Khalid’s only crime was that he was raising his voice against the CAA-NRC-NPR Syeda Hameed Planning Commission ex-member||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/civil-society-demands-release-of-umar-khalid-from-unjust-arrest/article36444746.ece
14 September 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi riots: police to file separate chargesheets after court objection||After a Delhi court questioned the police over a wrongly-clubbed FIR based on multiple complaints of alleged rioting during the 2020 communal violence, it decided to segregate and file separate chargesheets in the cases involved. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav had asked the police why five incidents of alleged rioting, theft, and arson which took place at three different blocks - C, D, and E of Delhi’s Bhajanpura area on different dates were clubbed in a single FIR and chargesheet. In a status report submitted on September 10, the Bhajanpura SHO replied that complaints of rioting that took place in D and E blocks “will be investigated separately and in all these three incidents separate chargesheets will be filed”. The court agreed. Besides, in the other two complaints related to the alleged rioting at C block, the court has agreed to consider the chargesheet already submitted in the case. In this case, two accused — Neeraj and Manish — were arrested based on two complaints filed by the shopkeepers who alleged that their shops were allegedly looted and vandalised by the riotous mob during the communal violence. While framing the charges, the sessions judge revoked the arson charges against the accused, noting that the shopkeepers did not allege the commission of offence and that there is no CCTV footage. “A fine-tooth-comb analysis of the complaints and statements reveals that none of them has identified the accused persons to be part of the riotous mob which had vandalised their shops,” ASJ Yadav said in an order dated September 10. He noted that there are no allegations by the complaints regarding the commission of arson in their shops and as such ingredients of Section 436 IPC [mischief by fire or explosive substance] are not at all made out. “Even from the photographs filed on record, no incident of committing mischief by fire or explosive substance is borne out,” he said, adding that there is no CCTV footage or video clip of the incident on record. The court also noted that the complaints of different dates were clubbed together. While one complainant alleged that the alleged crime took place on February 24, while the others claimed that it happened on February 25. “Whether these complaints of different dates could have been clubbed by the investigating agency in one FIR is a question which will be seen during the course of the trial,” the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-riots-police-to-file-separate-chargesheets-after-court-objection/article36444739.ece
14 September 2021||New Delhi,||HC seeks status report on protection of witnesses in Tihar custodial death case||The Delhi High Court on Monday called for a status report from the prison authority on the steps taken to ensure safety and security of witnesses in the alleged murder of gangster Ankit Gujjar inside Tihar jail. Justice Mukta Gupta, who last week transferred the investigation in the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), directed that all witnesses be kept in a cell monitored by CCTV. The High Court also sought the medical report of two witnesses who were allegedly not receiving proper treatment in spite of suffering “grievous injuries” in the same incident of assault. During the hearing, CBI counsel said the investigating agency has registered an FIR into the case. The 29-year-old was found dead inside his cell in Tihar jail on August 4. Witnesses’ petition The court’s direction came while hearing a petition by five witnesses in the case seeking directions to ensure their safety and security as well as to restrain the authorities from “threatening/coercing/injuring them with a view to prevent them from seeking justice for themselves and the deceased inmate”. “The petitioners are all inmates of Delhi Prisons and are eyewitnesses to the murder of one Ankit Gujjar [deceased], by respondent no.1 officials, inside Central Jail no.3 on 03.08.2021,” the petition reads. “The sequence of events clearly demonstrates the existence of an imminent threat to the lives of the petitioners on account that they are eyewitnesses to a gruesome and brutal murder inside the jail premises by influential and powerful jail officials, at the behest of the highest rung authorities of the administration,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-seeks-status-report-on-protection-of-witnesses-in-tihar-custodial-death-case/article36444736.ece

14 September 2021||New Delhi,||Former BJP, INLD leaders join Congress in Haryana||A former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and a former leader of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) joined the Haryana Congress on Monday in the presence of All India Congress Committee State in-charge Vivek Bansal and Pradesh Congress chief Kumari Selja. Those who joined the party are industrialist Ashok Goel Mangaliwala, former BJP leader Pawan Beniwal and former INLD leader Kanwarjit Singh. While Mr. Beniwal was BJP’s candidate from Ellanabad constituency in the last Assembly polls who unsuccessfully contested against INLD’s Abhay Chautala, Mr. Singh is the son of former Congress MP Tara Singh. Welcoming all the three leaders, Ms Selja said the BJP at the Centre as well as in Haryana is “anti-farmer and anti-labourer”. “There are leaders who understand that the Congress is the only viable option to the BJP which has proved to be a failure in all spheres of governance in Haryana,” she said. Mr. Bansal claimed that the winds are blowing in favour of the Congress and against the BJP in Haryana.

14 September 2021||New Delhi,||HPC: dacoity, robbery not covered for interim bail||A High Power Committee (HPC), set up to decongest jails during the COVID-19 pandemic, has clarified that offences like dacoity, robbery and kidnapping for ransom are not covered under its criteria for granting interim bail to prisoners. The HPC clarfied, “merely because specified offences — like offence under Section 302 (murder) IPC, that too with a rider--was included in the class or category of cases recommended for grant of interim bail, it does not mean that offences like docoity, robbery, kidnapping for ransom, etc. were also included”. “Such cases were consciously kept out,” the HPC, headed by High Court Judge Justice Vipin Sanghi, said. The HPC was constituted last year on the direction of the Supreme Court to decongest jails to prevent the spread of COVID. “The object was only to release some of the prisoners, and not all the prisoners, on a reasonable classification arrived at on the basis of orders passed by the Supreme Court, intending to implement the same in letter and spirit,” the HPC said. “It is, however, reiterated that those inmates whose cases are not covered in the criteria laid down by this committee can still file application seeking bail before the court concerned which, if filed, may be considered by the courts on merits,” the HPC said. It further said that “no prisoner irrespective of the category or class of offence that he/she may be involved in, can seek or claim that he/she be released from prison, as a matter of right”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hpc-dacoity-robbery-not-covered-for-interim-bail/article36444737.ece
14 September 2021||New Delhi,||Court grants time to Sirsa to file reply in defamation case||The Delhi High Court on Monday granted an additional four weeks to Manjinder Singh Sirsa to file reply on Delhi Minister and AAP leader Satyendar Jain’s plea related to his criminal defamation case against the Shiromani Akali Dal leader. Justice Mukta Gupta also granted time to the two other accused — editor and publisher of a media house — to state their stand on the plea and posted the matter for hearing on January 13. Lawyers appearing for Mr. Sirsa and other accused sought time from the court to file their response. On August 5, the judge had issued notice on Mr. Jain’s plea challenging a trial court order rejecting his application to cure the defects in a legal document pertaining to his defamation complaint and stayed further proceedings before the trial court. In his petition, Mr. Jain informed that he filed a defective certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which was not in consonance with the guidelines framed, and thus sought the trial court’s permission to file a corrected certificate to authenticate the electronic document pertaining to the allegedly defamatory statement in question.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/court-grants-time-to-sirsa-to-file-reply-in-defamation-case/article36445062.ece
