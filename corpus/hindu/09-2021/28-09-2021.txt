28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bandh hits road, rail traffic in many States||Farmers blocked highways and rail lines, shut down markets and institutions in some cities and States and held mass rallies across the country in response to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM)’s nationwide strike call on Monday, exactly a year after the President gave his assent to the three contentious agricultural reform laws. The SKM is a platform of farm unions which joined hands to protest against the laws, whose members, in thousands, marched to the borders of Delhi 10 months ago to demand that the three laws be repealed. Their call for a Bharat Bandh between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Monday was supported by major parties including the Congress, Left parties, Akali Dal, YSR Congress Party, Trinamool Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Trade unions and transport unions backed the bandh in some parts of the country, though some declined to shut down business even while offering “moral support” to the farmers. The SKM termed the response ‘unprecedented’ around midday. Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait declared the bandh ‘successful’, telling an online students’ parliament that it proved the farmers had support from labourers and youth, and the agitation was active across the country, not just in a few States. “Farmers are on the streets for 10 months, but the blind and deaf government neither sees nor hears anything. In a democracy, there is no other option but to protest. We insist that if there is Bill wapsi [repeal of the laws], then only there will be ghar wapsi [return home],” he said. Vehicular movement was disrupted on national and State highways in most parts of Punjab and Haryana. Shops and commercial establishments were closed in many parts of the two States which make up the largest mass of the protesting unions, though the situation was normal in their joint capital Chandigarh. 25 trains affected Train tracks were blocked at more than 20 places in the northern zone, with the Railways saying at least 25 trains were affected in the morning. There were also reports of train tracks being blocked at some locations in Bihar and West Bengal. In the national capital, there were massive traffic snarls at Gurugram and Ghazipur as Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh saw increased security due to the farmers’ protests. The Delhi police instituted intensive checks of vehicles entering the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bandh-hits-road-rail-traffic-in-many-states/article36705403.ece
28 September 2021||MANGALURU,||No response to bandh call in Udupi, Dakshina Kannada||The Bharat Bandh called by Samyut Kisan Morcha demanding the repeal of farm laws did not get any response in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi on Monday. Public transport operated as usual. Educational institutions, commercial establishments, government and private offices functioned normally. Hotels remained open. However, the Raitha, Dalit, Karmika and Janapara Chaluvaligala Okkuta, Dakshina Kannada, took out a procession and blocked the National Highway 75 at BC Road for sometime and staged a protest. The Bunder Shramikara Sanga staged a protest in Bunder in support of the bandh. Some activists of the CPI(M) staged a protest near the Clock Tower. Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) activists staged protests in different parts of the district. In Udupi While speaking at a protest rally in Udupi, district secretary of the Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers Association Susheela Nada said that anganwadi workers decided to support the bandh as the Union government is planning to dilute the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS). The Union government wants to opt for closure of anganwadi centres in a phased manner, she rued and added that such a move will only increase malnutrition cases in the country. A protest rally was taken out from Jodukatte to Martyrs Memorial in Ajjarakadu in Udupi. The protesters shouted slogans against the Union government for enacting the three farm reform laws.

28 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Gulab leaves a trail of destruction in north coastal districts||Cyclone Gulab left in its wake a trail of destruction in the north coastal districts and affected normal life across the State in the last 48 hours. A woman died in a wall collapse incident under Pendurthi police station limits in Visakhapatnam district, and crops in thousands of acres were damaged by the downpour. A large number of low-lying habitations in various cities and towns were flooded due to the heavy rains. As many as 253 mandals received more than 10 cm of rainfall under the influence of the cyclone as of 8.30 a.m. on Monday and rains continued to lash the State later. Thirty-two locations in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts recorded more than 25 cm rainfall during the period. Visakhapatnam airport had water pooled up all around it. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy instructed Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das to personally monitor the relief operations in the north coastal districts. During the day, Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Revenue Dharmana Krishna Das and Mr. Aditya Nath Das took stock of the impact of rains and relief measures being taken up in Srikakulam in a meeting attended by Collector Shrikesh B. Lathkar and other officials. Officials said Vajrapukotthuru and Santhabommali Mandals bore the brunt of nature’s fury. Communication hit Mr. Aditya Nath Das directed officials to respond quickly when people submitted their grievances and to continue to be on high alert following the likelihood of more rains. Electricity and communication networks were destroyed and uprooted trees brought traffic to a grinding halt on many roads in the north Andhra region. Several villages were cut off due to the downpour. Power supply was disrupted since September 26 evening. Personnel of the Eastern power DISCOM are replacing fallen electric poles with new ones on a war-footing and trees uprooted by gales are being removed by workers deployed by the departments concerned. There was moderate rainfall in the Rayalaseema region. Meanwhile, Krishna District Collector J. Nivas took steps to mitigate the impact of the rains, which disrupted normal life in Vijayawada city. Several mandals, including Vijayawada, received heavy to extremely heavy rainfall. G. Konduru and Bapulapadu Mandals received more than 10 cm of rainfall. The district received an average of 44.4 mm rainfall at 8.30 a.m. on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gulab-leaves-a-trail-of-destruction-in-north-coastal-districts/article36705951.ece
28 September 2021||Kolkata,||Clashes mar Bhabanipur campaign||The last day of campaigning for the crucial Bhabanipur byelection on Monday was marred by violence, with BJP vice-president Dilip Ghosh being manhandled. Supporters of the Trinamool Congress tried to prevent the BJP MP from campaigning by raising slogans and even pushing and shoving him. Mr. Ghosh’s security personnel were finally seen brandishing firearms to keep the crowd at bay. After losing in Nandigram in the Assembly election earlier this year, Chief Minister and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee has returned to contest from her old constituency of Bhabanipur. She is pitted against the BJP’s Priyanka Tibrewal and Left Front nominee Srijib Biswas. “If there is no campaign, if we cannot reach the voters, then what is the point of holding elections,” Mr. Ghosh said. Repeated requests for security appeared to have been ignored by the Election Commission of India (ECI), he said, seeking postponement of the byelection, scheduled for September 30. ECI seeks report Earlier in the day, BJP MP Arjun Singh was also prevented from campaigning in the constituency. Mr. Singh alleged that four BJP supporters were injured in violence during the day. The ECI has sought a report on the incident from the Office of Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), West Bengal. Later in the day a delegation of BJP leaders met the CEO and demanded that the election be held under prohibitory orders in the entire constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/clashes-mar-bhabanipur-campaign/article36705405.ece
28 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Hartal disrupts normal life in State||The dawn-to-dusk hartal in Kerala on Monday, expressing solidarity with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s nationwide strike call against the contentious farm laws, and backed by the ruling Left Democratic Front and the opposition United Democratic Front, was near-total but largely peaceful. Normal life was disrupted with shops and business establishments remaining shut and public transport keeping off the road. Private vehicles plied. Attendance was low in government offices. The hartal was marked by isolated incidents of violence. In Kozhikode, the staff of an Asianet broadband franchise were allegedly manhandled by hartal supporters. Near Pallichal, Thiruvananthapuram, hartal supporters allegedly manhandled the manager of a petrol pump. The heavy rainfall which lashed several districts on Monday also prompted the public to stay indoors. Across the State, trade unions organised protests demanding the Centre to withdraw the contentious farm laws. Daily life unaffected Meanwhile, daily life remained largely unaffected in Karnataka, including Bengaluru, during the “Bharat Bandh.” Though most businesses remained open and all forms of public transport ran as usual, the State witnessed multiple protests by farmers. Bengaluru, Hubballi, Belagavi, Mysuru and other major cities saw protests by thousands of farmers demanding withdrawal of the farm laws. Farmers were joined by the trade unions, Dalit and Kannada organisations in their protests. Protesters tried to picket bus stands and block highways in Kalaburagi, Mysuru and other districts. However, all disruptions were brief and soon dispersed by the police. The bandh passed off peacefully in the State without any untoward incident, senior police officials said. Kannada activist Vatal Nagaraj came down heavily on the lack of support for the bandh call. “This is not a farmer’s issue alone. Everyone who eats food is adversely affected by the farm laws. The government is going for privatisation in all sectors. People cannot be bothered about only traffic issues,” he said. In Telangana, the Bharat Bandh organised by the Congress and Left parties evoked mixed response. The fleet of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation, cab services, autorickshaw and other transport services operated as usual in State capital Hyderabad, but the buses were obstructed in districts. A scuffle ensued between the police and the agitators when they tried to stop buses coming out of the Hanamkonda depot. Over 800 buses were off the roads in the erstwhile Mahabubnagar district. Telangana Congress Committee president A. Revanth Reddy and his followers were arrested near the Uppal bus depot in Hyderabad. The movement of people was curtailed largely due to the incessant downpour caused by the Gulab cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. Despite calls given by various trade unions of the Left parties in the city and across the State, all commercial establishments and business houses operated normally.

28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,||Bandh evokes mixed response in State||The Bharat Bandh organised by Congress and Left parties in the State, protesting against the farm laws of the Centre, on Monday evoked mixed response in the State. The bus fleet of Telangana State Road Transport Corporation, cab services, auto-rickshaw and other transport services were plying on the road as usual in the State capital, but the buses were obstructed in districts. A scuffle ensued between the police and the agitationists when they tried to stop buses coming out of Hanamkonda depot. Over 800 buses were off roads in the erstwhile Mahabubnagar district. Telangana Congress Committee president A. Revanth Reddy and his followers were arrested near Uppal bus depot in Hyderabad while the president of Telangana Jana Samiti M. Kodandaram’s clothes were torn in another protest at Hayathnagar. The police banged at the window panes of Mr. Kodandaram’s car, pulled him out and physically moved him into their own vehicle and shifted him to Meerpet police station. The movement of people was curtailed largely due to the incessant downpour caused by the Gulab cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. Despite calls given by various trade unions of Left parties, all commercial establishments and business houses were operating normally. Political parties and farmers’ unions who supported the bandh call were also not to be seen enforcing strict compliance. Thanks to the inclement weather, the police also did not deploy much force anticipating a lacklustre turnout. However, several teams were deployed around the Assembly in view of the ongoing monsoon session. “We anticipated there won’t be much response to the bandh call in the State, so did not deploy forces,” a senior officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bandh-evokes-mixed-response-in-state/article36705677.ece
28 September 2021||CHENNAI,||Don’t let political parties go scot-free after damaging public property, says HC||Political parties and communal, linguistic or ethnic groups cannot be let to go scot-free when their cadre indulge in violence, damage public property and terrorise the people during agitations, the Madras High Court has said. It has insisted upon stringent action against them to recover the losses not only for the physical damage caused but also for disruption of public services due to the violence. Justice S.M. Subramaniam said that ordinary citizens were mostly voiceless and hence it was the duty of the constitutional courts to be the voice of the voiceless for the purpose of protecting their fundamental and constitutional rights. He pointed out that it was such voiceless citizens who were forced to tolerate numerous illegalities committed either by political parties or the communal, linguistic and ethnic groups. “A majority of right-thinking citizens are the victims of such violence and their normal life gets affected to a great extent. Many poor people have lost their property and huge damage has been caused to public property. Therefore, the Government of the day is expected to initiate quick and effective actions in such circumstances where any mischief is committed and damage or loss is caused to the properties,” he wrote. Observing that effective implementation of the Tamil Nadu Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act of 1992 was not visible in the State even 29 years after its enactment, the judge directed the Commissioner of Revenue Administration to issue a circular directing Collectors and Superintendents of Police to ensure stringent action. He said the government officials should be punished for their lapses. The directions were issued while disposing of a writ petition filed by Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) in 2014. The party had challenged an inquiry initiated by the Commissioner of Revenue Administration in June 2013 for recovering from it the reported financial loss suffered by Metropolitan Transport Corporation Chennai (MTC) which could not operate its buses in full strength between April 25 and May 19 of 2013 due to violence. The court was told that the PMK and Vanniar Sangam had conducted “Chithirai Tiruvizha” in Mamallapuram on April 25, 2013. On that day, some party cadres entered into a wordy quarrel at Kadayam Theru Colony bus stop near Marakanam. It snowballed into large-scale violence and road traffic was disrupted for several hours on the East Coast Road (ECR). Several properties were damaged. After the police resorted to arrest, the party contemplated demonstrations at various places on April 30, 2013, without obtaining due permission. Hence, the party founder S. Ramadoss and many others were arrested. This incident escalated the violence with the cadres indulging in road roko, throwing of stones on vehicles, felling of trees and damaging public as well as private property. On account of such violence, a tense situation prevailed in Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts from April 25, 2013 to May 19, 2013 and regular bus services could not be operated. Totally, 58 buses (12 in Chennai, 26 in Tiruvallur and 20 in Kancheepuram) were damaged during that point of time and the loss to the public exchequer ran to several crores of rupees, MTC counsel M. Chidambaram told the court. Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the issue, the judge said a writ petition against a notice issued for inquiry could not be entertained and that it was up to the PMK to defend itself during the inquiry. Though it was argued by the party that the criminal cases booked against the party cadres had ended up in acquittal, the judge said the proof required in a criminal case was way higher than that was required in an inquiry under the 1992 Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dont-let-parties-go-scot-free-after-damaging-public-property/article36705527.ece
28 September 2021||Bengaluru,||Bandh call evokes little response in city||Life remained largely unaffected in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka during the Bharat Bandh called by Samyukta Kisan Morcha, which is spearheading protests demanding rollback of farm laws. Businesses remained open and public transport services were not hit. The State witnessed multiple protests by farmers in almost all districts. Bengaluru, Hubballi, Belagavi, Mysuru and other major city centres saw protests, with farmers joined by trade unions, Dalit and Kannada organisations. Farmers had a run in with the police in Bengaluru, when contrary to what was permitted, they began walking from various points in the city to congregate at Town Hall, from where a protest rally to Mysuru Bank Circle was to be taken out. The police detained several farmers’ leaders, including Kurubur Shanthakumar. The city witnessed traffic snarls in the central business district and other arterial roads where farmers took out rally. Most trade and transport associations had announced moral support to the bandh, but had refused to close down businesses citing losses they have already incurred due to the pandemic. Badagalpura Nagendra, one of the conveners of Samyukta Horata-Karnataka, accused the BJP government in the State of proactively working to sabotage the bandh. Kannada activist Vatal Nagaraj came down on the lack of support for the bandh call. “This is not a farmers’ issue alone.

They took out a march, raised slogans against the Union government, and stopped traffic on the main roads for some time on the day. The protesters in Shivamogga hit the streets early in the morning.

In all these districts, public transport buses and autorickshaws operated like on any other day but with decreased intensity and away from protest sites. Government and private offices, business and commercial establishments functioned normally and shopkeepers carried out their businesses as usual. Shops and commercial establishments around the venues of demonstrations and road blocks were shut down for some time till the protestors dispersed before they reopened. The Jubilee Circle in Dharwad, Kittur Chennamma Circle in Hubballi, Hosamani Siddappa Circle in Haveri, Mahatma Gandhi Circle in Gadag became the venues of demonstrations and consequently, the roads leading to these junctions were closed for some time. The police diverted traffic on these roads via alternative routes till the completion of the demonstrations. The central business districts in these cities witnessed normal business. However, people avoided travelling on a bandh day because of which the public transport buses had fewer number of passengers. In Dharwad, scores of farmers staged demonstration under the aegis of Samyukta Horata Karnataka. They also took out a protest march from Jubilee Circle to the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad. Leading the protest, activist S.R. Hiremath said that the Centre had introduced the farm laws at the behest of corporate companies and these laws are detrimental to the progress of the farm sector. Token road blockades were also staged on some of the national highways passing through these districts and on the Hubballi-Dharwad Bypass Road. Barring instances of heated arguments between protestors and police at a few places, no untoward incidents were reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/road-blocks-mark-bandh-in-several-dists-in-north-karnataka/article36705654.ece

28 September 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Tangedco may issue detailed procedure for fixing static meters’||Tamil Nadu Electricity Ombudsman S. Devarajan has said Tangedco might consider issuing a detailed working procedure for the replacement of old conventional meters with static meters, especially in multi-tenement dwellings. He said this while passing an order on a complaint filed by a consumer about abnormal readings having been recorded after the replacement of old meters with static meters. As per the proceedings, old meters were replaced with static meters in two service connections on the premises of Coimbatore-based A. Yakoob Hussain on May 15, 2020. After the replacement of the meters, the readings recorded on June 30, 2020 and subsequently on August 31, 2020 were abnormally high. Mr. Hussain requested a revision of the consumption charges by taking the previous six months’ average. Tangedco said that as per the direction of the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum (CGRF) of the Coimbatore Electricity Distribution Circle, it had conducted a study for the period from December 4, 2020 to December 24, 2020, which found that the existing static meters were healthy, and hence, the readings were correct. The root cause of the problem was a wiring defect, it added. The Ombudsman noted that as per regulation 30 of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Distribution Code, the onus was on the consumer to maintain or test the equipment and wiring on his premises. The consumer was liable to pay the recorded current consumption charges, which were due to incorrect wiring on his premises, the Ombudsman said while rejecting the plea. “Tangedco should educate consumers whenever old conventional meters are replaced with static meters. Its field engineers and staff should also be educated whenever they are installing static meters to avoid such occurrences elsewhere,” Mr. Devarajan said.

28 September 2021||Kochi,||Govt. ban on online rummy set aside||The Kerala High Court on Monday set aside the State government’s ban on online rummy played for stakes by including it in the Kerala Gaming Act, 1960. Justice T.R. Ravi passed the verdict while allowing a writ petitions filed by the companies engaged in the business of developing and offering online games, challenging the notification that included the game in the purview of the Kerala Gaming Act. The petitioners contended that the notification issued in 1976 had exempted rummy from the provisions of the Act. However, the government, by notification issued on February 23, 2021, had brought "online rummy played for stakes" under the Act. The government action amounted to a violation of their fundamental right to do business and, therefore, it was arbitrary and unreasonable, they said. The court declared the notification as arbitrary, illegal and in violation of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. According to the court, the notification had been issued in relation to a game that already stood exempted from the provisions of the Act under Section 14 of the Kerala Gaming Act and since the game did not come within the meaning of 'gambling' or 'gaming', by providing a platform for playing the game. The court declared that online rummy played either with stakes or without stakes remained to be a 'game of skill' and a game involving skill predominantly stood exempted from the Act. Element of cheating The government submitted that online rummy was not a game predominantly of skill and there was an element of cheating involved and even the deal of cards was manipulated. Besides, the government had the power to bring the game under the Act, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-sets-aside-govt-ban-on-online-rummy/article36705348.ece

In a memorandum submitted to Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb on Monday, organisations such as the Chakma Buddhist Welfare Society and the Chakma Development Foundation of India said repeated attacks by Bengali Muslim settlers in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh made at least 10,000 Tripuris take refuge in the adjoining Dhalai and South Tripura districts of the State. There are about 3,00,000 Tripuris in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The Tripuris are also among the 19 recognised tribes of Tripura. “At least 860 families or about 8,600 persons from 28 Tripuri villages… under Khagrachari district of Bangladesh have fled to Tripura and settled in various places such as East Sabroom, Silachari, Suknachari, Kaptala Para, Gorakappa, Ailmara and Karbook, Pancharatan and all the way up to Raisyabari since 2000,” the memorandum said. ‘Settlers grabbing land’ “Every day, the Bangladeshi Tripuris are fleeing as their lands are being grabbed by the Muslim settlers,” Arunjoy Chakma, a representative of the Chakma organisations, said. Some documents revealed Tripuris or other non-Muslim communities who converted to Islam have been spared the attacks or land-grabbing by Islamist radicals in Bangladesh, the organisations said. The Chakma organisations also alluded to Tripura police records pointing to at least 108 Rohingya refugees having been arrested in the State between 2018 and March this year. “The government should conduct a State-wide inquiry in Tripura against the influx of foreigners, irrespective of their ethnic origin or religion,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/chakma-groups-seek-probe-into-entry-of-10000-tripuris-from-bangladesh/article36705572.ece

In a video-conference with the Collectors, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that power should be restored as soon as rain subsided and suggested frequent monitoring of the situation. He said Rs. 1,000 should be given to each family returning home from relief camps. He wanted quality food to be given to those taking shelter in such camps, along with the required medical care and safe drinking water. The Chief Minister instructed the authorities to set up relief camps wherever necessary and to remove water from inundated areas in Visakhapatnam city by pumping it out. He also directed the officials to be liberal in preparing enumeration reports of crop damage. He said the officials should be on a high alert to the likelihood of heavy rain in the next couple of days, particularly on the borders with Odisha where it was raining heavily. Priority should be given to mitigating the impact of flooding caused by Vamsadhara and Nagavali rivers, he added. Speaking from Visakhapatnam, Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das said winds were blowing at 90 kmph along the coast of northern districts and that many trees were uprooted. Relief measures are in full swing in Visakhapatnam city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/expedite-relief-measures-instructs-cm/article36705392.ece
28 September 2021||Bengaluru,||BMTC plans to roll out e-bus service on November 1||After a long delay, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is likely to roll out the electric bus (e-bus) service on November 1 [Kannada Rajyotsava Day]. To begin with, 10 electric buses will be operated as feeder services to Namma Metro. Under the Bengaluru Smart City project, the BMTC will operate 90 e-buses in the city through a service provider. The BMTC will receive the first electric bus, which has left from the plant in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, in a day or two. The officials are hopeful of receiving all 90 buses by the end of the year. A BMTC official said: “As per the specifications fixed by us, the service provider is providing the first bus. After completing RTO formalities, we will operate it on city roads to verify if all specifications are complied with.” “Thereafter, the service provider will send the rest of the buses. There is a plan to formally inaugurate the e-bus services on Kannada Rajyostava with 10 buses,” the official said. The BMTC has been making efforts to run e-buses since 2014. First bus in Kengeri? The first e-bus is likely to be operated in the Kengeri area connecting the metro station. “It will operate on the ordinary bus service routes connecting the metro station. Ordinary bus fares will be applicable to e-buses as well,” said an official. The e-bus are nine metres long and can carry 33 passengers. As per the agreement, BMTC is paying Rs. 51 per km to the service provider. The ‘operational cost’ provided by the BMTC includes electric charge, driver, and others. The service provider will operate the buses for 12 years. The service provider will also be given space at depots such as Kengeri, Yeshwantpur, and K.R. Puram to put up necessary infrastructure that includes charging points. At each depot, space will be provided to park 30 buses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bmtc-plans-to-roll-out-e-bus-service-on-november-1/article36705438.ece

28 September 2021||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI,||Ex-Goa CM Faleiro resigns as Cong. MLA||Former Goa Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro on Monday resigned as party MLA and is likely to join the Trinamool Congress (TMC). He said the country needed a leader like West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It’s Mamata who has given a tough fight to Narendra Modi and their [BJP’s] juggernaut. Narendra Modi ji had 200 meetings in Bengal, [Home Minister] Amit Shah maybe had 250 meetings. Then there was the ED, the CBI and everybody. But the Mamata formula has won. She has been able to stand, she is a street fighter,” Mr. Faleiro told reporters in Margao. Mr. Faleiro’s decision to become the face of the TMC in Goa will not only be significant for the State Assembly election that usually witnesses a fractured mandate and smaller parties with two or three MLAs deciding government formation, but also carries national implications. “I would like all the Congress parties [which have split from the Congress] to come together and fight the next parliamentary election,” he said. With election strategist Prashant Kishor frequently meeting Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar apart from advising the TMC president, the poll could be the first occasion where regional players could work together to assert their importance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ex-goa-cm-faleiro-resigns-as-cong-mla/article36705579.ece

Mr. Kiran, a native of Gajuwaka area, has more than 2,500 followers on social media platforms. “On September 15, the weather system was suggestive of a cyclonic storm, which was confirmed five days ago. Since then, I have been tracking it. Initially, the weather system suggested that it could hit the coast between Puri in Odisha and Visakhapatnam. However, 36 hours before landfall, I was convinced that the cyclone was heading straight towards the north Andhra region and would make landfall between Gopalpur and Kalingapatnam, and I was right,” said Mr. Sai Kiran. The weather blogger said that he tracked the path of the weather system relenetlessly and continued to post updates on social media. “I have not slept for the last 48 hours as I have been receiving a number of messages from my followers and those I do not even know.

The Bench said if the government made a policy call to withdraw aid, an institution cannot question the decision as a “matter of right”.

28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jobs up 29% since 2013, says survey||In the first quarter of this fiscal (April-June 2021) 27% of the establishments surveyed for the All-India Quarterly Establishment-based Employment Survey reported COVID-19-related retrenchment. However, the overall employment numbers had increased by 29% from the base year of 2013-14, a report released on Monday said. The report, released by Labour and Employment Minister Bhupender Yadav, covered 10,593 firms that employed more than 10 workers and were spread over nine sectors that account for 85% of the total employment in such establishments. Overall, employment stood at 3.08 crore in the first quarter, up from 2.37 crore as reported in the Sixth Economic Census (2013-2014). All but two sectors — trade and accommodation & restaurants — saw an increase in employment over the period. The report said the IT/BPO sector had the most impressive growth (152%), followed by health (77%), transport (68%), financial services (48%), construction (42%), education (39%) and manufacturing (22%). Manufacturing was found to account for 41% of the establishments, followed by education (22%) and health (8%). There was a decline in employment in trade (25%) and accommodation and restaurants (13%), which Mr. Yadav said could be attributed to the second wave of the pandemic that was at its peak during the survey. Dip in female workers The number of female workers showed a decline too, from 31% in the Sixth Economic Survey to 29% as of the first quarter of the quarterly employment survey. Speaking about the importance of the survey, Mr. Yadav said: “Evidence-based policy making and statistics-based execution is the major focus of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.” He added that this survey and others covering unorganised sectors being conducted by the Labour Survey would help in policy-making.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jobs-up-29-since-2013-says-survey/article36705401.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||SEC gets four months’ time for civic polls||The Supreme Court on Monday gave the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission (TNSEC) four months to complete the elections to urban local bodies in the State. Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the TNSEC, originally sought time till April 2022, that is, seven months, to complete the polls and report back to the court. However, the senior lawyer immediately agreed to inform the TNSEC about the four-month deadline given by the top court to hold the elections. “I will tell the [State] Election Commission to speed it up,” Mr. Rohatgi said. Senior advocate P. Wilson, appearing for petitioner S. Shankar, had agreed with the poll body’s plea for more time. “Mr. Wilson, you had filed a petition for elections...Now you want adjournment?” Chief Justice Ramana asked the senior lawyer. Mr. Wilson said “everyone wants elections” to the local bodies to be held. The new government, which was sworn in only in May, was working hard to achieve that goal, he added. Mr. Wilson noted that there were over 600 urban local bodies in the State. He said his petition was originally about the prolonged delay in conducting the delimitation exercise and the elections to local bodies in 9 districts. That objective had been achieved. During the previous hearing, the TNSEC had informed the court that the polls to the local bodies in the 9 new districts would be completed by October 12. The Commission had said it would then need a few months to prepare for the urban local body elections, considering the COVID-19 situation. In June, the court had directed the TNSEC to complete the delayed local body elections in 9 new districts in the State by September 15. The court said the notification for the elections had been issued way back in 2019. The tenure of the previous local bodies had ended in 2018-2019. In December last year, the court had granted an extension of six months to complete the delimitation process and conduct the elections in the 9 districts. It had ordered that the delimitation in the 9 districts should be completed in three months. The districts in question are Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Vellore, Tirupattur, Ranipet, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Tirunelveli and Tenkasi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tnsec-gets-four-months-time-to-complete-urban-local-body-polls/article36705519.ece

28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Talks on farmers’ blockade stalled, Haryana tells SC||Nearly a year after farmers started their protest along the inter-State borders of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for the complete withdrawal of three agricultural laws, the Haryana government has indicated to the Supreme Court that hardly any headway has been made in efforts to convince them to remove “blockades” from inter-State roads and national highways. The Supreme Court has so far taken a nuanced stand on the issue, recognising the right of the farmers to protest while at the same time advising them against disrupting public movement — an equally important right. The court, in August, had asked the three States to take stock of the ground situation and consult among themselves about the best way forward. In its affidavit, the Haryana government said it has been trying to resolve the issue with the farmers since September 10. A meeting headed by the Chief Minister was also held. A State-level committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary was formed to find a way out of the blockades. A meeting of the Committee scheduled on September 19 was not attended by the farmers' leaders. However, industrialists from Sonipat, the district near the blockade, came to the meeting on their own volition and informed the panel about the “myriad difficulties” faced by them due to the blockade. “Sincere efforts are being made to remove the blockade from inter-State roads and National Highways and to resume free flow of traffic on those roads for the convenience of the general public by way of persuading the farmers organisations to cooperate. Regular deliberations are being held by local administrations with farmers’ organisations from time to time to convince them to remove the blockade as the general public is facing great hardship due to such blockades,” the Haryana government said in its affidavit. In August, the court, however, also conveyed its staunch belief that the solution to end the farmer-government impasse over the three agriculture laws lay with the government. The court was hearing a petition filed by Monica Agarwal, a Noida resident. She has complained that commuting between Delhi and Noida had become a nightmare due to road blocks because of the farmers’ protest. “The solution lies in the hands of the Union and States. If the protests are on, the traffic should not be stopped in any manner,” the Bench had remarked. In a recent affidavit, the Uttar Pradesh government had also said it had reached out to the farmers about the inconvenience being caused to commuters. It had said that blocking free public movement was illegal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/talks-on-farmers-blockade-stalled-haryana-tells-sc/article36705190.ece
28 September 2021||New Delhi,||Caste data 98% error-free, RGI told panel||The Union government last week told the Supreme Court that the caste data enumerated in the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) of 2011 was “unusable”, but in 2016, the Registrar-General and Census Commissioner of India had informed the Standing Committee on Rural Development that 98.87% of the data on individual caste and religion was “error free”. In its report analysing the action taken by the government on the recommendations made by the committee on ‘BPL Survey currently Socio Economic & Caste Census (SECC), 2011’, the Registrar-General and Census Commissioner of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, has been quoted as saying that the “data has been examined and 98.87% data on individuals caste and religion is error free”. The Office of the Registrar-General of India said that errors had been noticed in the data of about 1.34 crore individuals out of the total surveyed population of 118 crore. Govt. stance Taking a diametrically different position, the government, in its affidavit in the Supreme Court filed last week, cited many reasons why the data is “unusable”. The government had said that the total number of castes surveyed in 1931 was 4,147, while the SECC figures show that there are more than 46 lakh different castes. “Assuming that some castes may bifurcate into sub-castes, the total number can not be exponentially high to this extent,” the affidavit said. The affidavit added that the entire exercise was corrupted because the enumerators had used different spellings for the same castes. In many cases the respondents, the government said, had refused to divulge their castes. Error in govt. judgement Rashtriya Janata Dal Rajya Sabha member Manoj K. Jha said the error was not in the data, but in the government’s judgment. “As Leader of the Opposition in Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav said that the government is stonewalling the whole exercise because of fear of the numbers. The numbers will reveal a tragic story,” Mr. Jha said. Former I&B Minister and Lok Sabha member Manish Tewari said if 98% of the data was error-free, as the RGI conceded, there was no reason for the government to withhold it, after taxpayers’ money was spent in conducting the SECC. “The fact remains that the UPA government was not very enthusiastic about a caste census. However, in the face of a belligerent Opposition, it agreed to conduct SECC which was meticulously done. Since 98% of the data is error-free the government should put it out in the public,” Mr. Tewari said. The Narendra Modi government finds itself boxed in a corner over the issue as allies Janata Dal(U) and Apna Dal are repeatedly demanding a headcount of the Other Backward Castes (OBC). The government is facing heat from the Opposition parties, the majority of which support the call. On Sunday, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren led an all-party delegation to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah pressing for a caste census. The RJD, meanwhile, is planning to begin protests on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/caste-data-98-error-free-rgi-told-panel/article36705317.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM launches health ID for every citizen||The campaign for strengthening health facilities that had been going on for the past seven years is entering a new phase today, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi while launching the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission via videoconferencing on Monday. “Today, we are launching a mission that has the potential of bringing a revolutionary change in India’s health facilities,” he stated. The Arogya Setu app helped in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 infection, he noted, and lauded CoWIN for its role in making India achieve a record administration of about 90 crore vaccine doses under the free vaccine campaign. Referring to the use of technology in health, Mr. Modi pointed out that there had been an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine during the pandemic period. So far, about 125 crore remote consultations had been completed through e-Sanjeevani. “This facility is connecting thousands of countrymen living in far-flung parts of the country every day with doctors of big hospitals of cities while sitting at home,” he said. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission would now connect the digital health solutions of hospitals across the country with each other. A release issued by the Union government stressed that the mission would not only make the processes of hospitals simplified but also increase ease of living. Under this, every citizen would now get a digital health ID and their health records would be digitally protected. Holistic health model The Prime Minister highlighted that India was working on a health model that was holistic and inclusive. It also stressed on preventive healthcare and, in case of disease, easy, affordable and accessible treatment. Unprecedented reforms in health education was on. A much larger number of doctors and paramedical manpower was being created now. “A comprehensive network of All India Institutes of Medical Science [AIIMS] and other modern health institutions is being established in the country and work on establishing one medical college in every three Lok Sabha constituencies is going on,” he said. Mr. Modi emphasised strengthening the health facilities in villages. He pointed to the strengthening of primary health centre networks and wellness centres. More than 80,000 such centres had already been operationalised, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-launches-health-id-for-every-citizen/article36705325.ece
28 September 2021||LUCKNOW,||Upper castes dominate U.P. Cabinet||On Sunday, on being inducted as a Minister, Jitin Prasada became the sixth Brahmin in the Cabinet of the Yogi Adityanath government of Uttar Pradesh and the 11th name from the influential community to feature in the Council of Ministers. With the induction of seven new faces, the number of Ministers went up to 60. Apart from Mr. Prasada, the six new faces belong to Kurmi, Bind and Kumhar OBC communities, and Khatik Scheduled Caste (two) and Gond Scheduled Tribe (one). The upper castes continue to dominate in terms of representation, forming the largest block, especially in terms of Cabinet berths and important Ministries. With 11 names, Brahmins are the largest beneficiary, followed by Thakurs (seven) who belong to the traditional ‘upper castes’. The OBCs have 23 representatives, including a Sikh Jat, and Dalits have nine. One is a Shia Muslim. The State now has 24 Cabinet Ministers. Of these, 16 belong to the ‘upper castes’, with Brahmins and Thakurs (Kshatriya) having five names each, as per official information. Mr. Adityanath, who is also a priest, was born a Kshatriya and his deputy, Dinesh Sharma, is a Brahmin. The Cabinet also has three Khatris — Ashutosh Tandon, Suresh Khanna and Satish Mahana — and one each from the Bania (Nand Gopal Gupta), Bhumihar (Surya Pratap Shahi) and Kayasth (Sidharth Nath Singh) castes. Keshav Prasad Maurya, also a Deputy Chief Minister, is among the seven OBCs in the Cabinet. He is joined by Swami Prasad Maurya, Rajbhar MLA Anil Rajbhar, Dara Singh Chauhan, Jat community members Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary and Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary, and Mukut Bihari Verma, a Kurmi. The only Dalit in the Cabinet belongs to the Kori sub-caste, Ramapati Shastri. Tweeting after the latest Cabinet expansion, Mr. Adityanath said it reflected the philosophy of Jan Sangh leader Deen Dayal Upadhayay. “Today’s expansion is filled with the intent of providing representation to all sections, feeling of social balance, message of harmony and providing opportunity to the person standing on the last rung,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/upper-castes-dominate-up-cabinet/article36705312.ece
28 September 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. notifies COVID compensation||Following a Supreme Court judgment, the Union Home Ministry has issued orders for an ex gratia of Rs. 50,000 to the next of kin of those who died of COVID-19. More than 4.4 lakh persons have died of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic last year. In a letter sent to the States, the Ministry said the amount would be disbursed from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The SDRF is the primary fund available with the State governments as part of their response to notified disasters to meet expenditure on providing immediate relief to victims. Govt. contribution The Union government contributes 75% of the SDRF allocation for general category States and Union Territories, and 90% for special category States (northeastern States, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir). COVID-19 was notified as a disaster by the Ministry on March 14, 2020. The Ministry said the ex gratia was applicable to the deceased, including those involved in relief operations or associated in preparedness activities “subject to the cause of death being certified as COVID-19” as per the guidelines issued by the Health Ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on September 3. The assistance would be applicable from the date of the first case in the country and continue till the de-notification of COVID-19 as a disaster or till further orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-notifies-covid-compensation/article36705338.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Set up digital archive of all workers at Parliament site’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after reviewing the construction work of the new Parliament building on Sunday night, said once the project was completed, a digital archive of all the workers involved in it should be set up, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said on Monday. During his surprise visit that lasted about an hour, he enquired about the progress of the project and emphasised the need for its timely completion. “He interacted with the workers engaged at the site and also enquired about their well-being. He stressed that they are engaged in a pious and historic work,” the Prime Minister’s Office said. Mr. Modi told officials that all workers should be fully-vaccinated against COVID-19 and monthly health check-ups held for them. Apart from an archive of their names, home towns and photos, all workers should be given a certificate for their participation in the project, he said. The new Parliament building, which is coming up adjacent to the existing heritage building, is scheduled to be completed by November 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/set-up-digital-archive-of-all-workers-at-parliament-site/article36705183.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cong. questions PM’s visit to new Parliament building site||The Congress on Monday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s inspection of the under-construction Parliament building, part of the Central Vista project, and asked if he had visited any hospital during the peak of the second wave of COVID-19. On Sunday evening, Mr Modi had visited the under-construction building that houses the new Parliament. ‘Questionable timing’ “I don’t know if the Prime Minister was seen visiting a hospital under construction, or an oxygen plant under construction,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said at a press conference here. Mr. Khera said three months ago, people were losing their loved ones and the country is yet to fully come out of the grief and the pain that everyone went through during the peak of the second wave. “Three months ago, each one of us was losing our loved ones, we were trying to save our loved ones and today the Prime Minister goes to visit a Rs. 20-30,000 crore Central Vista project. The timing of which in any case is hugely questionable,” Mr. Khera said. ‘Thoughtless gesture’ We would have supported him if he was visiting some hospital site. I am sorry; we can’t support a gesture, as thoughtless and as insensitive as this,” he added. In a separate tweet, former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh posted a photo of the Prime Minister at the construction site and tweeted, “The different avatars of the self-styled Sarvagyani. Anything for a photo-op to divert attention!”.

28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Panchjanya calls Amazon ‘East India Company 2.0’||Increasing concerns are being expressed by organisations associated with the RSS about the corporate sector in the country, not just India Inc but multinational corporations as well. Not only cover stories in the RSS-associated Panchjanya magazine, which had taken on Amazon this week after attacking Infosys a couple of weeks ago, but also the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM), an organisation that lobbied successfully for India’s exit from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), has been raising the red flag over what it terms “flipping” of Indian unicorns. In its second cover in three weeks, Panchjanya dealt with the issue of Amazon and its alleged acts of omission and commission. After hitting out at the Infosys group in a cover story for the snags in India’s Income Tax portal and attributing unsavoury motives to the mess-up, calling into question the group’s patriotism, this week, the magazine took on Amazon. The magazine termed the company “East India Company 2.0” for its “marauding, unethical ways”, and alleged that the company had bribed Indian officials. Last week, the Union government said it would probe the charges. SJM’s concerns The SJM, on its part, agreed with the sentiments expressed about Amazon, but had other concerns as well. Ashwani Mahajan of the SJM said, “Our happiness with regard to our start-ups is a short-term one, as we find that many have not remained Indian any more. Most of these high-ticket start-ups have been flipped away and are no longer Indian companies in essence.” “In the Sangh [RSS], we are not against wealth creators, but there is a definite nationality to capital, whether you agree or not. This flight of Indian capital and entrepreneurship is not something that has started now. Many changes have occurred in the last 30 years, but there are certain regulatory changes that the government can undertake even now to arrest this trend,” he said. “There is need to overhaul the system from policy, regulations, access to capital to push entities to register in India. The differential policies discriminating indigenous and attracting foreign entities needs to stop. However, to ultimately discourage Indian start-ups to flip, we need to take some tough measures as well, including those who flip, a foreign company.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panchjanya-calls-amazon-east-india-company-20/article36705310.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jaishankar in Mexico for Independence celebrations||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is scheduled to meet his Mexican counterpart, Marcelo Ebrard, and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday. Mr. Jaishankar, who is on a three-day visit to Mexico earlier, said in a social media message that he intended to participate in the celebrations marking the 200th anniversary of the Mexican Independence. “Participating in the celebrations of Mexico’s 200th anniversary of attaining independence. We are working together in the United Nations Security Council. India is Mexico’s ninth largest trade partner,” said Mr. Jaishankar on arriving in Mexico City. He also pointed out that this was the first visit by an Indian External Affairs Minister in 41 years. As part of the celebrations, Mexico launched an exhibition titled “La Grandeza de Mexico” on Monday in the presence of foreign dignitaries. The exhibition is meant to showcase cultural and historical artefacts. India and Mexico are serving as non-permanent members of the Security Council, which is discussing hotspots such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Myanmar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaishankar-in-mexico-for-independence-celebrations/article36705331.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Only two States sought extra grains’||Telangana and Meghalaya are the only States that have sought additional foodgrains from the Centre in pursuance of the Supreme Court’s June order to provide dry rations to migrants without ration cards, according to the Food Ministry’s response to a Right to Information (RTI) petition filed by an intervenor in the case. The Centre has not yet allocated any grains for this purpose, and refused to release its correspondence with States on the issue, claiming exemption under the RTI Act on the grounds of a “fiduciary relationship”. In its June 29 judgment in a suo motu case on migrant workers and unorganised sector workers facing hardships due to COVID-19, the court gave States a July 31 deadline to set up a scheme to distribute dry rations and run community kitchens for such workers as long as the pandemic continues, and directed the Centre to provide the needed grains. On September 17, the Food Ministry said only Meghalaya and Telangana had sought additional foodgrains for this purpose. It was responding to an RTI request filed by Right to Food activist Anjali Bhardwaj, one of the intervenors in the Supreme Court case. Asked about the quantity of extra grains the Centre had given the States, the Food and Public Distribution Department said, “So far, no additional allocation of foodgrains has been made...” “There is complete non-compliance and contempt of the SC direction,” said Ms. Bhardwaj. The intervenors also sent legal notices to State governments regarding implementation of the SC order. Ms. Bhardwaj had also asked for a copy of the correspondence between the Centre and the States regarding additional foodgrains. The Ministry denied the information, stating, “Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act 2005 exempts information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship from disclosure unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-two-states-sought-extra-grains/article36705336.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||An institution’s right to govt. aid is not a fundamental right: SC||The right of an institution, whether run by a majority or minority community, to get government aid is not a fundamental right. Both have to equally follow the rules and conditions of the aid, the Supreme Court held in a judgment on Monday. “Whether it is an institution run by the majority or the minority, all conditions that have relevance to the proper utilisation of the grant-in-aid by an educational institution can be imposed. All that Article 30(2) states is that on the ground that an institution is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language, grant of aid to that educational institution cannot be discriminated against, if other educational institutions are entitled to receive aid,” a Bench of Justices S.K. Kaul and M.M. Sundresh said, referring to the court’s T.M.A Pai decision. The Bench said if the government made a policy call to withdraw aid, an institution cannot question the decision as a “matter of right”. An institution is free to choose to accept the grant with the conditions or go its own way, it said. The judgment came in an appeal filed by Uttar Pradesh against a decision of the Allahabad High Court to declare unconstitutional a provision of the Intermediate Education Act, 1921.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/an-institutions-right-to-govt-aid-is-not-a-fundamental-right-sc/article36705333.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||DRDO tests Akash Prime missile||The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Monday successfully tested a new version of the Akash surface-to-air missile Akash Prime from the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur, Odisha. “In comparison to the existing Akash System, Akash Prime is equipped with an indigenous active Radio Frequency (RF) seeker for improved accuracy. Other improvements also ensure more reliable performance under low temperature environment at higher altitudes,” a DRDO statement said. A modified ground system of the existing Akash system had been used for the flight test, the statement further said. In its maiden flight test after improvements, the missile intercepted and destroyed an unmanned aerial target mimicking enemy aircraft, the DRDO noted. Congratulating the team on the successful flight test, DRDO Chairman G. Satheesh Reddy said Akash Prime would further boost the confidence of the Army and the Air Force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/drdo-tests-akash-prime-missile/article36705187.ece

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar was hearing a petition filed by the woman, through advocate Akshita Goyal, to transfer her case to Delhi from Ambala. She has asked the case to be prosecuted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. A zero FIR was lodged at Delhi in the case in July. The case was subsequently transferred to Ambala. A zero FIR can be filed in any police station and forwarded to the jurisdictional police station for further action. During the hearing on Friday, the Supreme Court asked the Delhi police whether they had any objection to taking over the investigation if the case was transferred to their care. Ms. Goyal, arguing the case, urged the court to direct the DCW to protect her client. Counsel appearing for the Delhi Commission for Women told the Bench that the woman had approached the Commission on July 23 and they were willing to rehabilitate her. “You need to give her protection and basic necessity,” the Bench addressed the DCW side.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/spell-out-safety-steps-for-sexual-abuse-victim-sc-tells-dcw/article36705188.ece

Wind speed recorded during the past 24 hours was not destructive. Gajapati district received uniform rainfall, which was not even intense. Two blocks of Koraput and Malkangiri have recorded above 100 mm rainfall,” said Pradeep Kumar Jena, Special Relief Commissioner of Odisha. A.P. villages cut off Electricity and communication networks were damaged and uprooted trees brought traffic to a halt on many roads in north Andhra, leaving several villages cut off. With power supply disrupted since Sunday evening, personnel of the Eastern power DISCOM worked to replace fallen electric poles on a war-footing and work was underway to clear uprooted trees. There was moderate rainfall in the Rayalaseema region. Several mandals, including Vijayawada, received heavy to extremely heavy rainfall. G. Konduru and Bapulapadu Mandals received more than 10 cm of rainfall. The district received an average of 44.4 mm rainfall till 8.30 a.m. on Monday. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced an ex-gratia relief of Rs. 5 lakh each to the kin of those killed and instructed Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das to personally monitor the relief operations in the north coastal districts. During the day, Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Revenue Dharmana Krishna Das and Mr. Das took stock of the impact of rains and relief measures being taken up in Srikakulam in a meeting attended by Collector Shrikesh B. Lathkar and other officials. Evacuations in Odisha Odisha had shifted 46,075 persons including more than 1,500 pregnant women and elderly persons to safer places in the southern districts, Relief Commissioner Pradip Jena said. While 21 blocks received rainfall above 50 mm, the highest 148 mm was recorded in Potangi block of Koraput. A few roads in the southern districts were inundated but disaster response forces worked swiftly to restore road communication by removing uprooted trees. Traffic affected “The vehicular movement on the the National Highway 26 connecting Raipur-Vijaynagaram was affected due to a landslip. Two 50-metre stretches in Sunki Ghat road along the NH-26 were blocked. Those roadblocks would be cleared shortly,” said Abdaal M. Akhtar, Koraput Collector. “The deep depression over south Odisha and adjoining south Chhattisgarh moved westwards and lay centred over south Odisha and adjoining south Chhattisgarh,” said the latest bulletin of the IMD. “It is likely to move nearly westwards and weaken into a depression during the next six hours and into a well-marked low pressure area during the subsequent 24 hours.” Though major damage to the public infrastructure including power distribution lines was not noticed, all Collectors of the affected districts were asked to submit their damage assessment report immediately, said the SRC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gulab-leaves-trail-of-destruction-in-north-ap/article36705193.ece
28 September 2021||Ghaziabad,||Bandh receives mixed response in west U.P.||Western Uttar Pradesh saw a mixed response to the Bharat Bandh called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Monday. While the markets in the region remained largely open, the national and State highways saw blockades by farmer unions through the day, leading to traffic jams. The bandh was led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union in the region and was supported by all the major political parties. Police sources in Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar said the traffic pressure increased in the morning because it was a working day; the Delhi Police had placed barricades and were checking vehicles coming from the neighbouring States for any farmer movement into the Capital. As the day progressed, the traffic situation eased. “The bandh proved a success. Those who described it as a movement limited to three States would have seen that it is a countrywide movement. Not only political parties, but we also got support from trade and labour unions and merchant associations as well,” Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of BKU said. He apologised to those who were affected by the jams through the day, particularly in the NCR. “I request them to consider that they dedicated a day to the cause of farmers who are on the road for the last 10 months,” said the farmer leader. Describing the Uttar Pradesh government’s hike in the sugarcane purchase price by Rs. 25 a quintal as a “cruel joke” on the farmers, Mr Tikait said soon BKU would launch a protest against the State government. “If the government thinks that it could tire us out or distract a section by this cosmetic increase in sugar cane prices before the elections, it is mistaken. We stand by our motto that as long as farmer laws are not repealed, we will not return home.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bandh-receives-mixed-response-in-west-up/article36705198.ece
28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,||Many areas inundated as rains lash Hyderabad||Day-long, incessant downpour on the first day of the work week gave the city shudders, with visions reappearing from last year’s disastrous floods in the month of October. The showers, under the impact of Cyclone Gulab, started lashing the city in the intervening night between Sunday and Monday— a little more delayed than expected. Initially, officials from the Meteorology department had warned that the city could experience heavy rains on Sunday evening. Heavy inundation was reported from across the city including areas such as Krishna Nagar, Tolichowki, Khajaguda, Golkonda, Ameerpet, Koti, Chilkalguda, Secunderabad, Osmangunj, and Bahadurpura, where traffic police donned the mantle of GHMC workers in working the manhole covers and removing obstacles for free flow of water. As per the data obtained from the automatic weather stations installed across the city, Rajendranagar area has reported the highest rainfall at over 11 centimetres by 8 p.m. on Monday. Sivarampally recorded close to 10 cms, followed by Malakpet at 8 cms . Serilingampally, Ramachandrapuram, Chandanagar, Kapra, Jubilee Hills, Mehdipatnam, Goshamahal, Alwal, and Falaknuma recorded over 7 cms of rain. Those in distress may call GHMC helpline at 040-211111111, where a control room will function 24X7. The control room received a total of 312 complaints pertaining to rain, by 5 p.m. on Monday. Other localities receiving heavy rainfall included Madhapur, Machabolarum, Asifnagar, Banjara Hills, Begum Bazar, Chandulal Baradari, Vijaynagar Colony, Kushaiguda, KPHB, Santosh Nagar, Hayatnagar, Manikonda, Chandrayangutta, L.B.Nagar, Secunderabad, Malkajgiri, Goshamahal, Jubilee Hills, Falaknuma, Saroornagar, Qutbullahpur, Karwan, Uppal, Saroornagar, Musheerabad, and several others. Water stagnation was reported from a number of localities, where local representatives and citizens concerned got busy clearing the water along with the monsoon emergency teams of GHMC. Severe traffic jams were experienced during evening hours on several stretches owing to water logging and tree falls. Mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi said the GHMC officials and staff have been kept on alert to face any emergency situation precipitated by continuous rains. A total of 30 rehabilitation centres have been identified to shift people from low lying areas, and a total of 195 monsoon emergency teams, and 139 static teams have been posted at inundation prone areas. In order to drain water from water logged areas, 237 motor pumps have been deployed, Ms.Vijayalakshmi said. Those in distress may call GHMC helpline at 040-211111111, where a control room will function 24X7. The control room received a total of 312 complaints pertaining to rain, by 5 p.m. on Monday. Special Chief Secretary, Municipal Administration and Urban Development Arvind Kumar issued emergency instructions through tele conference, where he asked officials to organise mobile Annapurna stalls even during night time, to provide food to the stranded people. Eight boats have been deployed for rescue efforts, apart from 45 excavator vehicles, and 55 power cutting machines to cut the fallen trees. He issued directions for immediate removal of fallen trees and electrical poles facilitating speedy restoration of power supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/many-areas-inundated-as-heavy-rains-lash-hyderabad/article36705675.ece
28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Jobs increased by 29% since 2013, says survey||The report, released by Labour and Employment Minister Bhupender Yadav, covered 10,593 firms that employed more than 10 workers and were spread over nine sectors that account for 85% of the total employment in such establishments. Overall, employment stood at 3.08 crore in the first quarter, up from 2.37 crore as reported in the Sixth Economic Census (2013-2014). All but two sectors — trade and accommodation & restaurants — saw an increase in employment over the period. The report said the IT/BPO sector had the most impressive growth (152%), followed by health (77%), transport (68%), financial services (48%), construction (42%), education (39%) and manufacturing (22%). Manufacturing was found to account for 41% of the establishments, followed by education (22%) and health (8%). There was a decline in employment in trade (25%) and accommodation and restaurants (13%), which Mr. Yadav said could be attributed to the second wave of the pandemic that was at its peak during the survey. Dip in female workers The number of female workers showed a decline too, from 31% in the Sixth Economic Survey to 29% as of the first quarter of the quarterly employment survey. Speaking about the importance of the survey, Mr. Yadav said: “Evidence-based policy making and statistics-based execution is the major focus of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.” He added that this survey and others covering unorganised sectors being conducted by the Labour Survey would help in policy-making. Mr. Yadav said while 27% of the establishments reported pandemic-induced retrenchment, the silver lining was that 81% of the workers had received their full wages during the lockdown (March 25 to June 30, 2020). Useful for policy-makers Earlier, Labour and Employment secretary Sunil Barthwal said having contemporary data was useful for policy-makers and this survey would help other government departments and Ministries as well. Mr. Barthwal said the survey would help the public as well as they could focus on learning skills that are found lacking in the workforce. He said when the government was coming up with COVID-19-related welfare schemes, like the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, the only data available was from the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation and the Employees State Insurance Corporation, or “administrative data”. “Soon, field surveys will start for the unorganised sector as well,” Mr. Barthwal said. The Labour Bureau, with the expert group for all-India surveys under Prof. S.P. Mukherjee, is also carrying out surveys on migrant workers and domestic workers. A senior Ministry official said these surveys would be significant in policy-making in general and in framing a “national employment policy” soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jobs-increased-by-29-since-2013-says-survey/article36705383.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||Army trying to fix issues with indigenous guns||Improved roads in border areas and induction of Chinook heavy lift helicopters will enable the Army to quickly deploy artillery guns to forward areas, said Lt. Gen. T.K. Chawla, Director General of Artillery on Monday. On artillery modernisation, he said the Army is working closely and doing “lot of hand holding” with Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to resolve issues with the indigenous Dhanush and towed artillery guns to turn them into “robust and reliable” systems. “Since its design and development project it follows Preliminary Service Quality Requirements (PSQR) evolved by DRDO and Army. During the trials some parameters have been achieved and some which need further improvement. These concerns have been shared with DRDO,” Lt. Gen. Chawla said in an interaction with select journalists on the eve of Gunners Day, observed on September 28. The Advanced Towed Array Gun System (ATAGS) is a 155mm, 52 calibre heavy artillery gun jointly developed by the DRDO in partnership with Bharat Forge and the Tata Group. “Firing trials were held recently in July-August in Pokhran. DRDO is working with its development partners in order to achieve these firing and non-firing parameters,” he said while stating that a timeline cannot be given as it was a design and development project. Teething troubles On the Dhanush artillery gun being developed by the OFB based on the original drawings of the Swedish Bofors guns, Lt. Gen. Chawla said there are few teething issues which they need to iron out but it is good work in progress. “We as the user are looking forward to it fructifying sooner than later,” he stated. As long as they are able to iron out those issues, the Army can do some confidence firing; that is what has been agreed with OFB, he said. The Army has already given an indent for 114 Dhanush guns with the OFB. A lot of hand holding has been done by the Army, both for ATAGS and Dhanush, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/army-trying-to-fix-issues-with-indigenous-guns/article36705185.ece

The Delhi police instituted intensive checks of vehicles entering the city. The national trade unions held a solidarity protest in Jantar Mantar. Speaking on the sidelines of an event, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urged the Centre to consider the farmers’ demands. “Bhagat Singh, [whose birth anniversary is being celebrated], did not fight for freedom for a day when farmers have to sit on the streets and protest for a year to get their demands considered,” he said. Shutdown in Kerala In Kerala, the bandh was complete in most parts of the State with a full shutdown of normal life. There was a more lukewarm response in Karnataka, with some protesters detained in Bengaluru. Heavy rain in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh dampened protest activities, but the farmers’ cause was supported by most political parties, including the ruling YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh, which suspended the State bus services and declared a school holiday. Roads blocked in Bihar Farmer bodies staged protests in parts of Tamil Nadu as well. Markets were shut and public transport stayed off the roads in Odisha and Jharkhand. The RJD and the Congress workers blocked roads and rail tracks in parts of Bihar.

28 September 2021||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI,||Former Goa CM Faleiro resigns as Congress MLA||Former Goa Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro on Monday resigned as member of the Legislative Assembly as he is all set to join the Trinamool Congress. Mr. Faleiro said the country needed a leader like West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It’s Mamata who has given a tough fight to Narendra Modi and their juggernaut. Narendra Modi ji had 200 meetings in Bengal, [Home Minister] Amit Shah may be had 250 meetings. Then there was the Enforcement Directorate, the CBI and everybody. But the Mamata formula has won. She has been able to stand, she is a street fighter,” Mr. Faleiro told reporters at his residence in Margao. Though he resigned from the primary membership of the Congress, he is likely to formally join the Trinamool in Kolkata soon. Mr. Faleiro decision to become the face of the Trinamool in Goa will not only be significant for the State Assembly election that usually witnesses fractured mandate and smaller parties with two or three MLAs decide government formation but also carries national implications. With election strategist Prashant Kishor frequently meeting NCP supremo Sharad Pawar apart from advising the Trinamool chief, the Goa election could be the first occasion where regional players could work together to assert their importance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/former-goa-cm-faleiro-resigns-as-congress-mla/article36705314.ece
28 September 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC slams govt. for changes in NEET-SS exam pattern||The Supreme Court on Monday slammed the Union government for making changes at the eleventh hour in the examination pattern of the postgraduate National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-Super Specialty 2021 (NEET-SS 2021). “Young doctors cannot be left to the mercy of insensitive bureaucrats and cannot be treated like football,” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud lashed out at the National Board of Examination (NBE) and the National Medical Commission (NMC), besides the Union government. The NEET-SS is scheduled for November 13 and 14. The exam dates were announced on July 23. The change in pattern was announced on August 31. Justice B.V. Nagarathna, on the Bench, observed that students’ study pattern would be according to the pattern of the exam. A sudden change in the exam pattern at the last minute would leave them floundering. ‘Why the hurry?’ Justice Chandrachud asked the government why it was in such a hurry to change the pattern this year itself, and that too after the exam was notified. “Students prepare for months for such exams... Just because you have power you are wielding power like this. Please speak to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to look at this,” Justice Chandrachud said. The hearing was based on a petition filed by over 40 doctors, who contended that the last-gasp changes were made to favour a particular branch of medicine. The court listed the case for hearing on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-slams-govt-for-changes-in-neet-ss-exam-pattern/article36705334.ece
28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Tat Tvam Asi explained||The Bhagavad Gita is held to be the essence of the Ultimate Truth which is the subject matter of the entire Vedas. In a discourse, Swamini Satyavratananda drew attention to the views of interpreters who have shown that the import of the Mahavakya ‘Tat Tvam Asi’ is made clear in a systematic way in this text. It is customary to view the 18 chapters of the Gita as three shadgams or sections of six chapters each. In each of these sections, three broad topics are dealt with. In the first set of six chapters, the three topics discussed are jiva vichara, the sadana of karma yoga to attain moksha, and the human effort, purusha prayatna, to gain self knowledge. The second shadgam discusses Ishwara swaroopa, the sadana of upasana yoga or meditation on Saguna Brahman, and Ishwara Kripa. The focus in the third shadgam is on the oneness of Paramatma and jivatma, the sadana of jnana yoga through practices such as sravana, manana, nidhidyasa, etc., and the importance of character building by cultivating worthy qualities and virtues. It is shown that the first topic in each of the three shadgams, namely jiva vichara, Ishwara vichara and Jiva-Brahma Aikya Jnana, respectively unfolds the explanation of the three terms Tvam, Tat and Asi in the Mahavakya. The ‘Tvam’ pada refers to the essential nature of the individual soul, the ‘Tat’ pada is about the nature of the Supreme Brahman and the ‘Asi’ pada affirms the oneness of Paramatma and the jivatma. The second and the third topics in each of three sections deal with yoga sadanas, karma, bhakti and jnana and importance of human effort, God’s grace and the cultivation of Daivi sampath or virtues. The practical integration of the Gita teaching in one’s life along with faith in Ishwara Kripa is sure to lead one to the state of a jivanmukta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tat-tvam-asi-explained/article36705329.ece

They demanded action against a financier they held responsible for his death. On information, the police rushed to the spot and held talks with the agitators who dispersed later. According to sources, Subramanian, the deceased, had helped his friend Senthil of Udayarpalayam secure a loan of Rs. 20,000 from Natarajan of Melakudiyiruppu about a year ago. But Senthil reportedly failed to repay the loan. Moreover, he went missing and could not be traced for the past few weeks. Following this, Natarajan had reportedly asked Subramanian to repay the loan. As pressure mounted, he attempted to end his life a week ago. He was subsequently admitted to the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Post Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) and then to the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, where he breathed his last.

28 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Prevent illegal immigrants from committing crimes: HC||The Madras High Court on Monday directed the Union Home Ministry to consider framing appropriate laws, in three months, to prevent illegal immigrants from committing petty crimes, repeatedly, just to stay back in the country. Expressing shock over some illegal immigrants managing to even obtain Aaadhar cards, the court impressed upon the need to deport every foreigner residing illegally in the country. Justice M. Dhandapani ordered that Foreigners Registration Offices and Immigration Check Posts on land borders should share details regarding the entry of foreigners into the country with the State law enforcing agency on a fortnightly basis. The State police, in turn, must track the movement of foreigners by establishing special wings in every district and identify those who overstay their visa period without valid extensions. Foreigners who have overstayed their visa period or have entered the country illegally without requisite documents must be sent to detention camps/holding centres until they get repatriated to their countries as per guidelines issued by the Home Ministry. Foreigners lodged in prisons on being convicted for criminal offences must be deported immediately after the completion of their sentence, the judge ordered. The orders were passed while disposing of a batch of bail petitions filed by Sri Lankan, Nigerian, Chinese, Iranian and Bangladeshi nationals, booked for various criminal cases. The judge was taken aback to learn that over 13,000 foreigners were residing illegally in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Tiruchi alone. He also could not believe that some of them were residing illegally in the country for over 10 years, and no steps had been taken to deport them. Observing that the lack of coordination between Central and State agencies was the reason why illegal immigrants continued residing in the country and indulged in nefarious activities, the judge said the State police was the fulcrum of the set up, since it had to identify illegal immigrants and take action to apprehend them and bring them to the notice of authorities, so that deportation can be taken up. “It has also come to the attention of the court that illegal migrants, with a view to circumvent deportation and to continue their stay in the territory of India, resort to certain subterfuge like committing petty crimes and serving simple sentences and come out and do the same once over. Such acts… is not in the interest of safety and the security of the country. However, no mechanism or law is available as on date to identify such individuals and curb such acts,” he said. After directing the Centre to consider bringing in a law to curb such practices, he ordered the listing of the matter again on January 4 for the Centre and the State police to report compliance with the directions issued by him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prevent-illegal-immigrants-from-committing-crimes-hc/article36705494.ece
28 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rainfall to be restricted to Western Ghats districts||Districts such as The Nilgiris, Theni and Coimbatore may receive a few spells of heavy rain on Tuesday. Most parts of the State may experience dry weather till Thursday except for moderate rains in a few other districts, according to Meteorological department. Those districts along the Western Ghats and delta region and south Tamil Nadu would receive light to moderate rain on Tuesday due to strengthening of westerlies and pull effect of Cyclone Gulab that made a landfall on Sunday night. Officials of the Meteorological Department noted that the remnants of the cyclone, which is weakening gradually, had an indirect impact on some parts of the State as it gathered moisture during its movement. This triggered rainfall in the Western Ghats region. On Monday, some rain gauges in places like Salem (3 cm), Valparai (4 cm) and Yercaud (2 cm) received light rainfall till 5.30 p.m. The recent spell had brought down the rain deficit in a few districts and all districts have received rainfall that fall under normal category. The shortfall in rains at Kanniyakumari district has been reduced to 17% now, which is termed ‘within normal’ by the department. (Rainfall in excess or deficit up to 19% is considered normal by the IMD). N. Puviarasan, Director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, said the rainfall deficiency in a few districts would be covered by the weather system expected after October 1. The approaching cyclonic circulation from the east Bay of Bengal might increase the rainfall activity over the State from Friday. It might bridge the gap in rains in coastal areas like Chengalpattu, which was short of seasonal rainfall quota by 12%. Chennai too might experience wet weather from September 30, he added. The Meteorological Department has forecast isolated heavy rains over north interior parts on Thursday and that may shift to coastal and adjoining interior parts on October 1. Rainfall up to moderate intensity may occur in many places in other districts and Puducherry. With the Southwest monsoon active, the State has so far recorded an overall rainfall of 39 cm, which is 21% excess than its seasonal share since June 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rain-likely-in-western-ghats-districts-for-two-days/article36705560.ece
28 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Dumping of debris into a stretch of Cooum river continues||A portion of Cooum river near Arumbakkam and Thirumangalam continues to be vulnerable to dumping of debris and slurry from construction sites. A section of residents from Mogappair and Arumbakkam complained that debris from construction sites are often dumped into this portion of the river. Though projects have been devised for eco-restoration of the waterway, sewage pollution and encroachments on river bank continued, they said. Slurry from construction sites, brought in heavy vehicles, was dumped on the banks of the river. The slurry then found its way into the river bed through a pit dug nearby. The pool of slurry stagnated on the river bed. It would obstruct the free flow of floodwater during the northeast monsoon, residents feared. Residents of Golden George Nagar also alleged that slurry from pile foundations at the construction site of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board, near Arumbakkam, was also brought by lorries and dumped into the river. However, work has been halted temporarily after a directive by the National Green Tribunal, Southern Bench. K. Sridhar, president, Golden George Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, said, “Lorries disposing of slurry in the river along Poonamallee High Road, near the bridge connecting Nerkundram with our area, has reduced now. But, we are now fighting against the problem of construction debris and fresh encroachments.” The association had mobilised funds to plant saplings along the river banks in their locality to prevent pollution and misuse of the waterway. However, this could not be implemented until the stretch was cleared of debris, he said. ‘Remove vegetation’ Residents also wanted the river, particularly near Koyambedu, to be cleared of vegetation before the monsoon. Officials of the Water Resources Department said steps were being taken to clean the portion of Cooum as part of monsoon preparedness. “We will coordinate with the Greater Chennai Corporation to remove solid waste under the Chennai Rivers Restoration Project. Measures will be taken to step up monitoring of the stretch and seize such lorries,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dumping-of-debris-into-a-stretch-of-cooum-river-continues/article36705480.ece
28 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Formulate action plan to check water pollution in Coonoor: NGT||The Coonoor Municipality cannot shirk its responsibility of preventing pollution in the water bodies in Coonoor, in the Nilgiris, as the pollution may impact areas downstream of a river, the Southern bench of the National Green Tribunal has said. It ordered that an action plan be drawn up to end the problem. The bench also directed the Additional Chief Secretary of the Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department and the Director of Municipal Administration to look into the issue and come up with a proper action plan to prevent the pollution of the river. The NGT had taken up the case suo moto in 2020 following a media report that elephants in the area did not have access to proper drinking water as the water bodies in the region were polluted. The Tribunal had formed a joint committee and directed the Coonoor Municipality to come up with a timeline to address the issue of water pollution. The Municipality recently sought additional time to finalise a service provider to carry out photo-remediation of the beds of the streams. While the earlier proposal gave a timeline of August 2021 to seek funds from the government, the revised proposal provided a timeline of October 2021, and nine months from the date of financial approval for the schemes to be completed. The Municipality also submitted that there were 109 commercial establishments that were letting their sewage into the water bodies and after notices were served, seven of them had stopped discharging the sewage. It also informed the Tribunal that action was being taken to prevent the public from throwing garbage into the water bodies. The joint inspection committee submitted to the Tribunal that the short-term measures taken by the Municipality were commendable and in the right direction, but was of little or no help in improving the quality of water in the water bodies. The committee also submitted that an analysis of the the water samples found no severe adverse impact to the environment and also suggested that a timeline of 9 to 12 months be given for sewage treatment plants to be set up considering the terrain, the weather conditions and the pandemic situation. While directing the Additional Chief Secretary to come up with an action plan, the bench also asked the Municipality to take action against establishments discharging sewage into the water bodies, and take short term measures to prevent the discharge till a a permanent one is implemented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/draw-up-plan-to-check-water-pollution/article36705521.ece

28 September 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Defence corridor: T.N. seeks Centre’s support||Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu called on Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi on Monday and handed over to him a memorandum seeking the Centre’s support for various proposals in the Tamil Nadu Defence Industrial Corridor. Mr. Thennarasu proposed that the funding for the corridor may be shared between the State and the Centre in the ratio of 25:75. Tamil Nadu urged the Defence Ministry to sanction six major proposals. Under the Defence Testing Infrastructure Scheme, the State sought sanction for five proposals — communication systems & RF antenna in Chennai; testing infrastructure for unmanned aircraft systems in Ulundurpet/Sholavaram; a mechanical and material testing facility in Tiruchi; electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility tests in Chennai; and testing infrastructure for ammunitions in Tiruchi. Pointing out that only one Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) lab was located in Tamil Nadu, the State government requested the Centre to establish two such labs in the defence industrial corridor nodes in Coimbatore and Tiruchi. It also sought the transfer of the Indian Air Force airstrip in Ulundurpet or Sholavaram on lease to it for setting up an aviation technology hub. Though the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was sourcing a large number of components/equipment/sub-systems from Tamil Nadu, it had no facility in the State, the memorandum pointed out. It requested the Union Minister to set up HAL’s Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) Final Assembly and Check-Out (FACO) unit at Sulur in Coimbatore. Tamil Nadu also sought the establishment of a joint venture between HAL and TIDCO. The State government sought the early announcement of a Central scheme to support and promote investment in the defence industrial corridors. As the Cabinet Committee on Security has approved a Rs. 10,990-crore programme to indigenously develop airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) systems for use by the Indian Air Force, it would be based on the existing Netra Mk-1 developed by the Centre for Airborne Systems, a DRDO lab, with active participation from the industry in Tamil Nadu. “The Tamil Nadu government is actively promoting the formation of a PPP consortium through TIDCO for development and commercial production of these systems,” the memorandum said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/defence-corridor-tn-seeks-centres-support/article36705504.ece

The street, under the Anna Nagar zone of the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and located close to D.G. Vaishnav College, is directly linked to Poonamallee High Road. However, residents alleged that the incomplete stormwater drain work has forced them to commute an extra kilometre in order to reach Poonamallee High Road. According to residents, the work began last year just before the first wave of COVID-19. After temporarily halting work when restrictions were put in place, it was resumed and completed all along the Poonamallee High Road. “However, the section that was dug up at the junction of our street was not properly covered, making the spot inaccessible to vehicles. One portion still remains completely open,” said S. Venkataramanan, a resident of the street. According to him, a child fell into the uncovered pit, which also had iron rods protruding from it. “Luckily, bystanders rescued the child immediately,” he added. Another resident said people, particularly students, found it difficult to take the longer route that often became congested during mornings. The residents said they had submitted petitions to the Corporation and to the office of Anna Nagar MLA M.K. Mohan, but no action had been taken. “The MLA’s office asked us to talk to an official in the Corporation, who in turn promised to check...Nothing has happened since,” Mr. Venkataramanan alleged. A zonal-level official of the Corporation said that necessary action would be taken soon after the site was inspected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/incomplete-swd-in-arumbakkam-inconveniences-residents/article36705482.ece

In a statement, he referred to reports of the proposed agitation by an association of employees to highlight the issues. The extension of the duration of working hours of retail outlets of the organisation had caused inconvenience to women employees, as they found it difficult to travel in several buses for 20 km to 30 km and return home after the end of working hours at 9 pm. Lack of toilet facilities, delay in the payment of salary for temporary staff, the women staff being abused by some officials and attempts to sabotage the sale of products were among the issues raised by Mr Panneerselvam, quoting media reports. As these issues had no financial implication and they required a fair settlement, it was the duty of the government to get them resolved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panneerselvam-asks-cm-to-intervene-in-co-optex/article36705523.ece

Film and Television Institute. Mr. Haasan said that it was the duty of a ‘good’ government to recognise artistes. In a statement, Mr. Haasan said that the Kalaimamani award given to him in 1974 and the Best Supporting Actor award that he received for Nammavar in 1994 from the Central and State governments were just small recognition for the versatile actor. “As far as I am concerned, actor Nagesh deserves any major award presented in cinema. If he was born in France, America or Germany, I can guess the kind of recognition he would have received. Despite 12 years having passed since his death, the government continuing to ignore him is a disappointment,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-wants-due-honour-for-nagesh/article36705524.ece

The Air Force Administrative College (AFAC), where the accused officer, Flight Lieutenant Amitesh Harmukh (29), was posted, sought the handing over of the case to it under the Provisions of the Air Force Act, 1950 to initiate court-martial proceedings. The officer was produced before the court, which extended his judicial remand till September 30. N. Sundaravadivelu, who appeared for the accused officer, argued that the local police did not have the right to arrest a serving officer of the IAF and he could be tried only through a court-martial. The prosecution opposed the pleas of the IAF and the accused’s counsel. N. Thilageswari, in-charge of the Additional Mahila Court, posted orders on the arguments for September 30. The Flight Lieutenant was arrested by the All Women Police Station, Coimbatore Central, on Saturday based on a complaint lodged by a woman colleague. According to the police, the 28-year-old woman officer alleged in her complaint that Harmuk raped her on the night of September 10 at her accommodation on the Air Force Administrative College (AFAC) campus.

Mr. Ravi Sam and association vice-chairman Durai Palanisamy told presspersons here on Monday that Tamil Nadu was once a major cotton producing State. Though it was a leading textile producer now, the industry purchased cotton from other States. With the removal of 1 % market committee cess on cotton, the Cotton Corporation of India(CCI) has expressed willingness to establish warehouses in the State. The first one will come up in Coimbatore and the Central Warehousing Corporation will handle it, said T. Rajkumar, chairman of Confederation of Indian Textile Industry. The CCI had nine lakh bales of cotton with it and if the industry wanted to purchase cotton from it, the CCI would move the cotton to the warehouses here. This would help in cost saving for the industry. With the Union government approving the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for textiles, 10 to 15 industries in the State were expected to invest approximately Rs. 300 crore each under the scheme. Works to commission a textile processing park proposed by SIMA at Cuddalore would be expedited. The association had developed a common infrastructure at Cuddalore with an investment of Rs. 96 crore, and two units had expressed willingness to put up plants immediately. The Union government would support establishing one mega textile park in each southern State. The Tamil Nadu government had expressed willingness to have three parks - at Dharmapuri, Thoothukudi, and Virudhunagar. Mr. Ravi Sam said the other focus areas of the Association were working with the Union government and urging it to sign free trade agreements with select countries soon. Further, the import duty on cotton should be removed and the hank yarn obligation should be reduced to 20 %, he said.  The Cotton Corporation of India has expressed willingness to establish warehouses in the State and the first one will come up in Coimbatore. T.

28 September 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Delay in finalising contractor for water supply in West Zone causes concern||Maintenance of drinking water systems and ground water supply has taken a hit in a few wards in the West Zone. Sources in the civic body said that after the expiry of the term of contract for maintenance of drinking water and ground water systems, a few wards in the Zone were left without the maintenance system, in that if there were to be a leak, there was no one to attend to it as it would be the responsibility of the contractor concerned to attend the leak. Likewise, there were hardly any turncocks available to regulate water supply in those wards. There was no one available in the wards in West Zone – particularly in Vadavalli and Veerakeralam – to supply ground water, for the Corporation usually outsourced the ground water supply to the contractors. While the Corporation relied on contractors for drinking water supply in all the added areas – 40 wards, the problem was now only in a few wards in West Zone because the civic body had failed to float tenders in time to renew the contract for borewells in those areas. For added areas in North, East and South zones, the Corporation had renewed the contract in time, well ahead of the 2021 Assembly election. The sources said unless the Corporation floated tenders and awarded contracts , it would be difficult to supply drinking and ground water to the residents in those wards. In the old city, the Corporation has given the drinking water supply maintenance contract to Suez India Pvt. Ltd.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delay-in-finalising-contractor-for-water-supply-in-west-zone-causes-concern/article36705551.ece

Petition submitted In a petition submitted at the weekly grievances meeting here on Monday, the association said that following a case filed in 2017, the court had, in June this year, stayed the quarrying in Uttukuli, from where stones for crushers, m-sand manufacturers and wet grinders were mined. Unlike quarries for crushers and m-sand, those for grinder stones were not deep mined. Besides, stones for grinders could not be mined elsewhere, the association said. The stay would throw out of business around 5,000 families in 11 villages,, who were involved in mining stone for grinders.  The stay would also hit wet grinder manufacturers, the association said, and pointed out that wet grinder manufacturing was the first cluster development programme selected by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation. And, the wet grinders manufactured in and around Coimbatore had the Geographical Indications Registry tag. By intervening to get the stay vacated, the administration would help the 30,000 families that were dependent on the wet grinder business, the association said, and also sought amendments to the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959. The State Government should amend the Rules in such a way that those who owned even less than an acre of land could also mine the stones. The association also assured the administration that manufacturers were ready to bear the compounding charges the Government would levy on mining the grinding stones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/manufacturers-of-wet-grinders-want-stay-on-mining-vacated/article36705552.ece

28 September 2021||KARAIKUDI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK will lose polls as long as it aligns with BJP, says Congress MP||Congress MP Karti Chidambaram on Monday said the AIADMK would suffer electoral losses as long as it had BJP in its fold in Tamil Nadu. Speaking to reporters, he said the BJP would not be able to make a big dent in non-Hindi pockets. The people of Tamil Nadu had rejected the party many times. The AIADMK, which was shown the door in the elections, would continue to lose its vote bank due to the presence of BJP as an ally. He added that former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami should talk in a responsible manner. When Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had implemented several of his poll promises and the people were convinced, the Leader of Opposition giving wrong statements would only show him in poor light. The AIADMK had many intra-party issues. In order to keep the party members intact, Mr. Palaniswami made claims that the Assembly polls would be held along with the general election to the Lok Sabha in 2024. “I reiterate that in the rural local body polls, the AIADMK will face defeat miserably.” On the national scenario, the Congress was the only dominant force to fight the BJP. The elections in the Hindi heartland, coming up next year, would be the beginning of the end of BJP rule. The change of guard in Gujarat was nothing but a reflection of the people’s anger against the BJP, he said. The Congress MP said there were serious allegations of malpractice and misappropriation of funds by the AIADMK during the last nine years in power. A classic case of corruption and mismanagement was the UGD work being carried out in Karaikudi Municipality. The work should have been completed at least two years ago, but appeared to be never ending. “I will certainly meet the CM soon and submit a memorandum in this regard along with Congress MLA S. Mangudi.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-will-lose-polls-as-long-as-it-aligns-with-bjp-says-congress-mp/article36705627.ece
28 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘To bounce back, hospitality industry needs to innovate’||Madurai has the potential of anchoring the region to develop into a holistic tourism circuit, Collector S. Aneesh Sekhar said while speaking on the occasion of World Tourism Day on Monday. To bounce back from the loss the industry suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said, all stakeholders in the sector need to ideate, innovate and collaborate. He promised to revive the Tourism Advisory Committee in the district for regular interactions to actively promote and market tourism sites. He cited the example of Kerala’s district-level tourism promotion councils that are empowered to take care of tourism spots. “Many heritage sites within the city are lost in congested commercial spaces. They need to be retrieved, maintained and made visible,” he said, adding completion of Smart City projects would also take care of the parking woes. Tourists who come to Madurai also looked forward to choices beyond Meenakshi temple. No other district in the region had such a strategic location to offer tourism packages from beaches to mountains, spiritual, cultural, food and heritage trails. “Well thought-out plans and their execution with institutional support and public-private partnership can help Madurai blossom into a tourism hotspot,” said Dr. Sekhar. Corporation Commissioner K. P. Karthikeyan suggested pre-fixed packages under mass and niche tourism to help earn revenue. He said Madurai was the landing destination for several districts and therefore, it would be of value addition to look beyond what it offers now. The challenges of cleanliness, sanitation, green cover and traffic management have to be addressed to make tourism products consumable, he underlined. Director, South Indian Hotels & Restaurants Association (SIHRA) S. Sundar said the advantages the region has need to get converted into business. “The end-user of our products should see Madurai as a model. The administration, tourist guides, hotel owners, have to work in tandem to aggressively market tourism,” he said. The Tiruchi Circle of Archaeological Survey of India published a brochure on the Jain caves which was released by the Collector. Superintending Archaeologist T. Arun Raj, said a scientific approach to heritage tourism helps to give visitors an interesting peep into history. G Raveendran, Madurai Travel Club President, also spoke at the event that was marked by a quiz for students and panel discussion on how to promote tourism, the job opportunities and the role of the stakeholders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/to-bounce-back-hospitality-industry-needs-to-innovate/article36705881.ece
28 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Plea of Sattankulam case accused dismissed||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court dismissed a petition filed by suspended Sub-Inspector of Police P. Raghu Ganesh, accused in the Sattankulam custodial death case of trader P. Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks. The petitioner, Raghu Ganesh, had sought copies of the statements given by 45 witnesses to the CB-CID Investigation Officer, before the investigation into the custodial death case of the traders was transferred to the CBI. The trial court dismissed a petition filed by him under Section 207 (Supply to the accused of copy of police report and other documents) of the Cr.P.C. Challenging the dismissal of the petition, he filed the criminal revision petition before the High Court. As per the provisions of Section 207, Cr.P.C., the accused should be furnished with copies of all the statements and documents which were likely to be placed by the prosecution in the trial, the petitioner said. Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup observed that the State government had transferred the investigation in the case from the CB-CID to the CBI. When the CBI took up the investigation, it conducted an independent probe and did not depend on the probe already conducted by the CB-CID. Therefore, when the CB-CID had recorded the statements of 45 witnesses, it was for the CBI Investigation Officer to consider them or reject them. The officer was likely to record fresh statements and the same would be made available to the trial court. Only those copies of the statements of the witnesses recorded by the CBI based on which final report was filed before the Judicial Magistrate were furnished to the accused, the judge said and dismissed the petition. However, the court permitted the accused to get a videography copy of the postmortem conducted on the bodies of Jayaraj and Benicks. In a connected case, the judge partly also allowed the petition filed by the accused seeking to discharge him from the charge under the provision of Section 188 of the IPC (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-of-sattankulam-case-accused-dismissed/article36705875.ece
28 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Turning AIR’s primary channels into relay stations will kill local flavour’||Prasar Bharati’s decision to convert four primary radio channels in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry radio station into relay stations of AIR, Chennai, is causing disquiet among the staff. The order was supposed to come into effect from January this year but was stalled till this month. Sources said, AIR Madurai, Tiruchi, Coimbatore, Tirunelveli and Puducherry will relay programmes produced majorly by the Chennai station from next week. Radio listeners, speakers, writers, teachers, students, scientists and social activists have signed a petition to the Prasar Bharati, the Director of AIR-Chennai and the Members of Parliament, requesting a rollback because they fear a uniform pattern and common programmes would kill the local flavour. AIR Madurai’s Radio Science commentator for the last 18 years, P. Rajamanickam, told The Hindu , that Chennai and Tiruchi – primary stations – started functioning independently from 1947. Subsequently, the other four came up with an autonomy to generate their own programmes. Each station produced its local programmes on women, youth, children, health, sports, folk, performing and other creative arts and promoted local talents. The radio stations also catered to the needs of farmers giving them weather reports, and information about pests and pest control. “But now by merging the regional with State and central content, the purpose of radio to reach and meet the last local man will be defeated,” said Mr. Rajamanickam. “The move is unwarranted as the linguistic divergence and cultural flavour of the interiors will be lost,” he added. A former Programme Executive with AIR-Madurai, said the move would reduce the workload as every station suffers severe staff crunch. But it will seal local recruitments of casual announcers who record and produce majority of the local programmes. If the order is implemented, the daily production days for the five primary channels will reduce. “As a result, employees will be laid off and the independent broadcasting system invested in will be wiped out,” he said. According to another staff, a similar order was issued for radio stations across Assam last December but was rolled back after protests by the locals. The Tamil Nadu Science Forum has also urged the MPs in the State to immediately intervene to prevent the death of independent radio stations in T.N. and Puducherry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/turning-airs-primary-channels-into-relay-stations-will-kill-local-flavour/article36705888.ece

When we attempted to contact the higher officials, they too responded in a cold manner. We have no other option but to approach Chief Minister M. K. Stalin,” they charged. The members also suspected that rice and other essential commodities given for the differently-abled persons were not issued by the officials, Mr. Kumar claimed and urged the new government to conduct a probe. They submitted a petition to Collector Aneesh Sekhar during the grievance day meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/officials-not-ready-to-share-information-under-rti-act/article36705885.ece
28 September 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Over 600 held for protest against Centre||Hundreds of members belonging to various labour unions and farmers’ associations took part in protests across Madurai district as part of Bharat Bandh organised against the Centre for its anti-people, anti-farmer and anti-labour policies. Madurai MP, Su. Venkatesan, took part in a huge road roko in the city in which the agitators raised slogans against the Centre for phenomenal increase in the price of petrol and diesel. Addressing the members of various trade unions, the MP said that all the rights the farmers had got all these years have been snatched by the Centre through the three new farm laws. “The country’s food market is the biggest one in the world and till now the Governments had protected it from corporates. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party Government has opened it to the corporates with the three farm laws,” he said. Similarly, the Centre has undone what the working class of the country had gained through prolonged struggle from the pre-Independence days as their rights through various labour laws by through four new labour codes. While, world leaders have realised the power of public sector units (PSUs) during the worst humanitarian crisis – the COVID-19 pandemic – the Centre was keen to sell the PSUs that would render huge workforce unemployed. The protesters also sought to increase the number of working days from 100 to 200 under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and also to extend it to urban areas. Members of CITU, LPF, AITUC, INTUC, and cadres of various political parties took part in the protests. Over 600 protesters were arrested and later released. Virudhunagar In a protest organised at Virudhunagar, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) said the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, which promised to usher in “good days”, had betrayed farmers, the common man and labourers to help corporates ‘loot’ the country. AIKS joint secretary Vijoo Krishnan said the government promised minimum support price (MSP) that would be more than 50% of the production cost of agricultural produce. However, it enacted three farm laws that were against the interest of the farmers and consumers. While the production cost of garlic was Rs. 32 a kg, six farmers in Mansdsaur in Madhya Pradesh were killed in police firing when they were protesting against the offer of just Rs. 1 a kg. The number of farmer deaths had crossed one lakh since 2014, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-600-held-for-protest-against-centre/article36705893.ece

28 September 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Jipmer not to insist on BPL ration cards||In an amendment to its earlier order, Jipmer will not insist on BPL ration cards from patients for accessing free treatment and services from October 1. In a modified order superseding its earlier circular, Jipmer stated that there would be “no insistence of BPL card production for registration of a patient by the Medical Records Department”. “This will be purely voluntary. However, patients shall be encouraged to do so for their convenience”. Free treatment in OPD, including issue of drugs and routine investigations for all patients irrespective of income, as is the practice, will continue, the new circular said. Emergency treatment too will continue to be provided to patients irrespective of income. Patients admitted to general wards will also not be charged for their stay regardless of income as is the current policy, Jipmer also said. Jipmer’s move to accept only BPL cardholders with monthly income less than Rs. 2,499 (the income limit prevailing in the Union Territory for the category) as criterion for accessing free services had led to an outcry from political parties for limiting access to free treatment. ‘Maintain status quo’ Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan had also asked the institution to put the circular on hold and maintain status quo. Jipmer, though, had clarified that the proposal was only to streamline income proof documentation into a single entity and was a patient-friendly measure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jipmer-not-to-insist-on-bpl-ration-cards/article36705836.ece

Dressed like actors Rajinikanth, Surya and others, the stage artistes submitted a petition at the Collectorate seeking permission to perform at Mutharamman Temple in Kulasekarapattinam. They said they would get income to run their families, pay medical bills and tuition fee of their children.

A group of villagers from Subramaniyapuram near Serakulam in Srivaikundam taluk submitted a petition seeking regular supply of drinking water. They said the villagers, now getting drinking water from a deep borewell once in 15 days, had to look for other sources by spending a lot of money. The situation had worsened further as the drinking water being supplied from the deep borewell was being pumped to nearby Lakshminarayanapuram too. Hence, a new drinking water scheme to benefit Subramaniyapuram should be executed. Demanding shifting of a liquor shop on the first street of Bryant Nagar, members of Manithaneya Narpani Iyakkam, Traders’ Association of Bryant Nagar and the administrators of Sri Bathrakaliamman Temple submitted a petition. They said those coming to the liquor shop posed a threat to women, children, students and patients coming to a nearby hospital in the area. The cooks to be posted in the backward class students’ hostel, who had received the appointment orders from the Department of Backward Class Welfare and awaiting to receive the individual orders from the District Backward Class Welfare Officer, submitted a petition for early disbursal of the order. Though the officials said in last March that the individual appointment orders would be given after the Assembly polls, the selected candidates were waiting indefinitely even four months after the election model code of conduct were lifted. Hence, the orders should be handed over immediately, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stage-artistes-seek-permission-to-perform-at-temple-during-dasara/article36705865.ece

Pasupathi - has incorporated in the App special features such as images of fishes, voice-based search to make different searches about market condition, location tracking for delivery of fish, and daily freshness of fish using image gallery to reduce the complexity of fish selling. This mobile App that would enable maximising returns through peak-hour sales will help fisherwomen to boost their economic conditions and improve the quality of life, said A. Martin, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, CUTN, the research guide. This android-based mobile App is a first-of-its-kind developed for fisherwomen in Nagapattinam district in the local language, he said. The fisherwomen could add fishes into inventory using images. A drop-down list is shown with fish images as well as fish names to store into inventory. Voice-based search is provided in this mobile App which will help the fisherwomen and customers to know about availability of fishes, he said. They can also do text-based search to find all kinds of fishes. The delivery location of the customer as well as current position of the fisherwomen is updated using Global Positioning System (GPS). Android Geo coder API in Google, latitude and longitude coordinates is applied to identify the customer and fisherwomen location and distance. The different fishes added to the customer cart are shown using customer orders module. The new user registration for both fisherwomen as well as customer is carried out using new user registration. The demonstration has already been carried out, Prof. Martin said. The mobile App will, while boosting the local economy, will help the fisherwomen selling in streets to manage their time in a better way. “It will reduce their business hours - right from leaving from home, buying, selling of fishes, preserving of fishes and returning home. In the long term, the quality of life, children's education and satisfaction of work-life balance of fisherwomen will definitely improve,” Prof. Martin said.

Candidates have their election symbols drawn on walls in suburban and rural areas in a bid to bring them close to the hearts of voters. After the Election Commission made it clear that no wall graffiti would be allowed in urban areas without the permission of the property owners during the two earlier elections, most of the walls remained unblemished even in the midst of high-octane electioneering. Now, the rural civic polls have revived the age-old political culture of painting the walls with election symbols. While candidates for the posts of panchayat union and district panchayat councillors get the symbols of political parties, aspirants for panchayat president and village panchayat ward positions are given ‘independent’ symbols. Hence, they have to be taken to the voters only thorough wall graffiti. “Since the candidates have been allotted symbols only on Saturday last, they are being displayed on the walls now,” says Sundararaj, an independent candidate for Keezhanatham village panchayat president. As the services of painters have become costly due to sharp rise in demand, Mr. Sundararaj and his supporters draw the symbols on the walls after getting permission from the landlords. Since most of the panchayat president and the panchayat ward member candidates are known to the voters, they easily persuade the landlords to allow them to draw their symbols on the walls. But the panchayat union and the district panchayat councillors, representing many villages, struggle to get permission. “The candidates have to execute an agreement with the property owners saying they would repaint the wall after the end of the polls with the original colour. The agreement mostly says the repainting work should be completed to the satisfaction of the landlord within 72 hours after the end of the election,” says N. Rajendran, a painter, from Palayamkottai. In a few places, supporters of the candidates and even the candidates themselves become ‘painters’ for promoting their symbols. Painters struggle while drawing ‘independent’ ranging from coconut tree to road-roller. “Drawing ‘Two Leaves’ or ‘Hand’ or ‘Rising Sun’ takes only a few minutes. But drawing other symbols is an ordeal as we have to do it to the satisfaction of the candidate,” according to Mr. Rajendran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/graffiti-herald-the-coming-of-rural-local-body-polls-in-tirunelveli/article36705869.ece
28 September 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Lukewarm response to bandh call in three districts||Condemning the farm laws and expressing their solidarity with farmers indefinitely protesting against the new Acts, DMK and its allies on monday staged road roko at four places in Tirunelveli district.

28 September 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Committee demands probe into drinking water scheme||The Longwood Shola Watchdog Committee has urged the State government to order an investigation into a drinking water scheme for Kotagiri Town. In a letter to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, committee secretary K.J. Raju said the Halakkarai drinking water scheme was inaugurated in 2015 and was estimated to cost Rs. 10.60 crore. RTI application In a reply to a Right to Information application a couple of months ago, the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board had stated that the final cost project was yet to be estimated for a drinking water project that was supposed to have been completed in 2018. Also, an audit of the funds spent so far had not been done. Mr. Raju faulted the choice of areas identified for storing water, saying that this posed the risk of landslips in the surrounding slopes also. The Rifle Range wetland as a water source could be an alternative to the Halakkarai project, he said. The wetland had enough water to meet Kotagiri’s demand for water for many decades, but was being neglected. “There are four wells that have been dug in the wetland. However, these wells that were constructed at a cost of Rs. 20 lakh are not being used, as the local body officials claim that the water is not fit for drinking,” said Mr. Raju. But, a few feet away, two more wells had been dug to supply water to Kotagiri town. “This illustrates the fact that the other wells too can be used,” he said. The committee has called upon the government to declare the Rifle Range wetland a protected swamp, and prevent further encroachments. It has also called for the removal of the eucalyptus trees around the wetland, pointing out that the trees were water guzzlers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/committee-demands-probe-into-drinking-water-scheme/article36705549.ece
28 September 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Old students share memories at police training school in Vellore||For the old students of Police Training School at Vellore Fort, Monday was a memorable day. Around 25 alumni of the 1987 batch of trainee Sub-Inspectors for Law and Order wing of the Tamil Nadu Police Department gathered at the corridor in the central pillar hall to reminisce their days at the training centre. After a gap of three decades, most of them have retired from service as Superintendents of Police and Assistant SPs. “Due to our work, we were able to talk to each other only over the phone. When the idea to have a reunion came up, I decided not to miss it," says 60-year-old R. Veera Raghavan, who was Superintendent of Police (Cyber Crime), Chennai. The reunion had individual and group photo sessions of classmates for a commemorative mug and a thanksgiving session for teachers. Of course, they had plenty of time to talk about their olden days. But the most interesting part of the event was the hour-long talk by individuals during which they shared funny moments that happened during their training days. M. Kumaravel, Assistant Commissioner of Police, traffic, Chennai headquarters, said whenever he, along with a group of trainees, visited the Christian Medical College, they were given a salute by the security personnel there even if they did not wear the police cap and were not in their uniform. Retired as DSP (Vellore), N. Domnic Xavier, who was the key organiser of the reunion, said that after returning from a break in Chennai to the training school once, he and a few colleagues forgot to do their short haircut — a must for trainee policemen. A pair of scissors came in handy for them to cut each other’s hair before attending the morning roll call at 5.30 a.m. But their efforts were in vain as the school instructor had found the haircut was not uniform and gave them an extended drill as a punishment. Everyone at the reunion meet had their share of funny moments during their training period. But when the retired ADSP, Sundaramurthy, entered the corridor, everyone welcomed him, calling ‘CMC’ Sundaramurthy. The nickname has nothing to do with his work or his initials. Fellow trainees used to make fun of Sundaramurthy as he used to spend most of his leisure time during training days standing in front of CMC Hospital. The Police Training School was started in 1896 inside the Tipu and Hyder Ali Mahals. It was used as a prison for the Mysore kings and his descendants by the British. The school trains, on an average, 300 recruits every seven months. The 1987 batch had 340 trainee SIs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/old-students-share-memories-at-police-training-school-in-vellore/article36705879.ece

28 September 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Law and Order in T.N. in a shambles: former CM||Former Chief Minister and AIADMK co-cordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday said that law and order in the State was in a shambles and heinous crimes, including murders, were on the rise. Speaking at a party meeting to review the preparations for the upcoming local body election in the district, Mr. Palaniswami said that law and order situation under the AIADMK government had been better than under the present regime. “It is quite amusing that the Director General of Police was now coming out with a statement that a number of rowdy elements have been taken into custody. But law and order in the State is deteriorating and one is at a loss to understand what the government has been doing all these days,” he said. Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK government was misleading people by making tall claims that it had fulfilled all the aspirations of the people. The government was claiming that it had implemented 202 schemes since assuming office although only a couple of announcements had been implemented. The previous AIADMK regime had announced the establishment of Jayalalithaa University in Villupuram district to ensure that higher education was accessible to the weaker sections. But Minister for Higher Education K. Ponmudi had dashed all the hopes of the students by affiliating the university to Annamalai University in Chidambaram. Renamed scheme Charging that the DMK makes promises only to break them, he said the Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam was only a renamed version of the previous AIADMK government’s Amma Mini Clinics scheme. Out of the 644 announcements made under Rule 110 in the Legislative Assembly during the previous regime, as many as 198 were implemented while another 409 were on the verge of completion, he said. Former Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam said an anti-incumbency sentiment was prevalent against the DMK government within four months of them coming to power. The government had let down all sections and people should teach a fitting lesson to the DMK in the local body polls, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/law-and-order-in-tn-in-a-shambles-former-cm/article36705530.ece
28 September 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||29 elected unopposed for posts of village panchayat ward member||After candidates for 29 posts of village panchayat ward member won unopposed, 91 are left in the fray in the ordinary election to be held for 25 posts of rural local body. Among the vacant seats that would go for election are one post of district panchayat ward member, three posts of panchayat union ward member, four posts of village panchayat president and 17 posts of village panchayat ward member. For the 54 seats that had fallen vacant, 163 nominations were received and five of them were rejected after scrutiny. Among the 158 accepted nominations, 38 papers were withdrawn. The four posts in district panchayat and panchayat unions are contested on party lines. However, the outcome of the election to none of the post is going to make any big difference in the heads of the rural local bodies. The post of district panchayat member of Ward 19, which was won by the AIADMK, fell vacant after R. Seeniammal’s demise. This seat has been reserved for women (general). Six candidates, including those from the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam and Nam Tamilar Katchi, are contesting. The AIADMK had bagged the district panchayat by winning 13 of the 20 seats. Two seats of ward members in Rajapalayam panchayat union and one seat in Virudhunagar panchayat union will go to the polls. Three candidates from AIADMK, DMK and NTK are contesting for the post of ward 12 member of Virudhunagar panchayat Union. The seat was earlier won by AIADMK. AIADMK had won 14 seats, while rival DMK had got nine seats in the 25-seat Virudhunagar panchayat union. Seven candidates each are in the fray in Ward 13 and Ward 15 of Rajapalayam panchayat union. The DMK, which won Ward 13, has again fielded its candidate. Both the AIADMK and its ally BJP are testing their strength here. Other parties contesting are the AMMK, NTK and Makkal Needhi Maiyam. In Ward 15, reserved for Scheduled Caste (general) of Rajapalayam panchayat union, the CPI is pitted against the AIADMK which had won the seat earlier. The AMMK, Puthiya Tamilagam and the NTK are in the contest. For the four posts of panchayat president, 15 candidates are vying and 53 candidates are testing the strength for 17 posts of village panchayat member.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/29-elected-unopposed-for-posts-of-village-panchayat-ward-member/article36705633.ece
28 September 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Centre has betrayed farmers after promising ‘good days’: Kisan Sabha||The All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) on Monday said the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, which promised to usher in “good days”, had betrayed farmers, the common man and labourers to help corporates ‘loot’ the country. Participating in a protest organised by farmers’ associations and labour unions as part of Bharat bandh here, AIKS joint secretary Vijoo Krishnan said the government promised minimum support price (MSP) that would be more than 50% of the production cost of agricultural produce. However, it enacted three farm laws that were against the interest of the farmers and consumers. While the production cost of garlic was Rs. 32 a kg, six farmers in Mansdsaur in Madhya Pradesh were killed in police firing when they were protesting against the offer of just Rs. 1 a kg. The number of farmer deaths had crossed one lakh since 2014, he said. The farm Acts were brought in when the entire country, including farmers, were suffering during the COVID-19 lockdown. The farmers were suffering as they were denied the MSP. While the government said the MSP for paddy was Rs. 1,868 a quintal, farmers in Bihar were forced to sell their produce for Rs. 800. When workers were rendered jobless during the lockdown, the government brought in four labour codes that increased working time from eight hours to 12 hours a day. Besides, the workers were denied right to form unions. ‘Legal hoarding’ The Centre removed paddy, wheat, pulses, oilseeds, onion and potato from the list of essential commodities so that corporates could legally hoard them and profit by exporting them, he alleged. Despite the death of 650 farmers, who were in a year-long protest in New Delhi demanding repeal of the farm Acts, the government remained reluctant to resolve the issue. The farmers had vowed to defeat the BJP in the election to be held to the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarkhand Assemblies. Tamil Vivasayigal Sangam founder O. Narayanasamy spoke. Over 100 farmers and workers were arrested when they tried to stage a rail roko at Virudhunagar. Over 900 people were arrested when they indulged in road roko in 17 places in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-has-betrayed-farmers-after-promising-good-days-aiks/article36705629.ece

Shankar, had agreed with the poll body’s plea for more time. "Mr. Wilson, you had filed a petition for elections...Now you want adjournment?" Chief Justice Ramana asked the senior lawyer. Mr. Wilson said "everyone wants elections" to the local bodies to be held. The new government, which was sworn in only in May, was working hard to achieve that goal, he added. Delay in delimitation Mr. Wilson noted that there were over 600 urban local bodies in the State. He said his petition was originally about the prolonged delay in conducting the delimitation exercise and the elections to local bodies in 9 districts. That objective had been achieved. During the previous hearing, the TNSEC had informed the court that the polls to the local bodies in the 9 new districts would be completed by October 12. The Commission had said it would then need a few months to prepare for the urban local body elections, considering the COVID-19 situation. In June, the court had directed the TNSEC to complete the delayed local body elections in 9 new districts in the State by September 15. The court said the notification for the elections had been issued way back in 2019. The tenure of the previous local bodies had ended in 2018-2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-gets-four-months-time-for-civic-polls/article36705624.ece

28 September 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Lukewarm response in Belagavi||Response to the Bharat Bandh called by farmers organisations was lukewarm in Belagavi district. However, members of farmers associations and Congress workers, AAP members and some labour unions held protests in several places. Most government and private offices and shops and eateries were open in the morning. NWKRTC buses and private vehicles were running as usual. Schools and colleges remained open. Similar scenes were witnessed in Chikkodi, Gokak, Saundatti, Athani and other towns. Farmers tried to stop buses from leaving the NWKRTC Bus Stand in Belagavi in the morning. This delayed departure of some buses. Farmers set fire to tyres in front of the bus stand. However, the police dispersed the protestors after some time. Sidagouda Modagi, farmers leader, said that the protest will continue as long as the Union government remained adamant about not withdrawing the farm laws. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who addresses farmers as his brothers, is not really concerned about our welfare. He has time to fly to America to meet corporate bosses, but has no time to meet farmers who are agitating in New Delhi for over 10 months now,” he said. Farmers succeeded in stopping vehicles near the toll booth in Hire Bagewadi on the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway. This led to vehicles being stopped on both sides for a few minutes. After some time, the police arrived at the spot, cleared the road for vehicles and took the protestors into custody. Farmers held a rasta roko protest at the Rani Channamma Circle for sometime. They also formed a human chain and sat around the circle for over an hour. Some farmers got into an altercation with the police who asked them to leave the place. Congress leader Ayesha Sanadi and others protested against the farm laws at Hire Bagewadi. In Gokak, KRRS youth wing leader Manju Pujari addressed the protestors. He gave an ultimatum to the government and said that it would have to face the wrath of the farmers, if the farm bills are not withdrawn soon. In Nippani, Praveen Kharande, I.N. Baig and others led the protest. Tahsildar Mohan Bhasme received the memorandum from them. In Yaragatti, near Saundatti, farmers blocked the Belagavi-Bagalkot Road. Protests were held in Bagalkot and Vijayapura districts too. In Bagalkot, farmers held a protest in front of the Yalagur Cross. In Vijayapura, members of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene held a protest at Karjol Cross. In Vijayapura city, farmers blocked the main road for over an hour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lukewarm-response-in-belagavi/article36705661.ece

28 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Narrow escape for metro workers||It was a narrow escape for 22 Namma Metro workers who were, for six months, staying in the building that collapsed in Lakkasandra on Monday. According to the police, the labourers noticed bricks falling from the building and plastering coming off since Sunday. They realised it may fall at any moment and decided to come out on Monday morning. No one was inside or near the building when it collapsed, so there were no injuries. The Adugodi police said the owner of the building, Suresh, and his family, were earlier residing in the building and had vacated two years ago. The building was vacant for almost two years, and he recently rented it out to the metro workers. “The owner made the mistake of renting out a building in bad condition. We have taken up a suo motu case under IPC section 336, whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, and are investigating further,” the police said. While local residents said there were around 40 workers in the building, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) clarified that 22 workers who are working in the underground stretch were living there. “Cracks were observed in the basement and the labourers were shifted immediately from the building. No labourer belonging to the metro workers’ contractor was injured,” BMRCL said in a statement. But activists pointed out that this is not a one-off incident. “It is a known fact that metro workers are living in horrible conditions. They are forced to live in dilapidated buildings even in other workers’ colonies. Workers are facing hardships as these buildings are available at cheaper rent. The Labour Department should inspect the areas where metro workers are living. BMRCL, being the principal employer, should make sure that the metro workers, one of the largest workforce in the city, live in safe condition with all amenities,” said Ekta M., co -founder of Maraa, who has been highlighting the working condition of metro workers since the outbreak of the pandemic. ‘Buildings damaged’ Meanwhile, Sherylin, a resident of the locality, said other buildings were damaged too. “When the building started tilting, we informed the building owners. But he said that he was out of station and did not turn up. Immediately, we alerted metro workers living in the building and all of them came out. We also shifted vehicles close to the building and blocked the road on either side to avoid movement of people. While the building was collapsing, it impacted other structures too. A wall of the adjacent building got damaged. A family, including children, ran out of the house after noticing wide cracks on the walls,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/narrow-escape-for-metro-workers/article36705452.ece
28 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Do we even have a democratic govt.?’||Farmers’ leaders in Karnataka on Monday vowed to fight the farm laws enacted by the Union government, however long it may take. With Dalit, labour and Kannada organisations joining the rallies on Bharat Bandh day to oppose the farm laws, the protests expanded into a wider critique of “privatisation and pro-corporate policies” of the Centre in various parts of the State. The protesters also targeted Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who had termed the farmers’ agitation a “sponsored protest” during his reply on price rise in the Legislative Assembly recently. “This is no longer just about the farm laws. We are opposed to the corporate takeover of the country — airports, ports, highways, etc. The National Monetisation Pipeline announced recently is nothing but handing all of us over to the corporates, just like the farm laws do. The government is moving towards privatisation of electricity, which will hit all of us, including the farmers. The anti-cow slaughter Bill is another ploy to take away dairy farming from farmers,” said Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha. Many farmer leaders termed the ongoing movement a “second freedom struggle”. Badagalpura Nagenda, convener of Samyukta Horata-Karnataka, said the regime that has not allowed the farmers of the country to enter the national capital would be “thrown out of Delhi”. G.C. Bayyareddy, another convener of Samyukta Horata, said there was no question of backing down and the farmers were prepared to fight the farm laws to the end. “On November 26, we will hold a mega protest rally in Delhi to mark one year of the protests. We will soon meet and chalk out a strategy at the national level,” he said. Launching an attack on Mr. Bommai, Mr. Bayyareddy said, “We could call Mr. Bommai himself a sponsored Chief Minister.” Mr. Chandrashekhar sought to know if “we have a democratic government”, considering it does not acknowledge a Bharat Bandh. He also said it was not dignified on the part of a Chief Minister to defame the farmers of the country. A ‘failure’ BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi termed the bandh a “failure” and claimed that the farmers of the country had not supported the protest which was “politically motivated and instigated by vested interests to create anarchy in the country”. He claimed that it proved that all the “common farmers” has sided with the agriculture reform laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/do-we-even-have-a-democratic-govt/article36705464.ece

28 September 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||One complainant can’t lodge two complaints on same incident: HC||The High Court of Karnataka has held that the same complainant cannot be permitted to improve on the first complaint as an afterthought to bring in other offences by lodging a second complaint on the same incident. “Once having registered a complaint on a particular premise of an incident, it is not open to the complainant to register another complaint on the very same incident regarding what happened during the same period,” the court observed. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while quashing the second FIR registered by the police based on a second complaint lodged by the Hoskote Municipality Commissioner, who was chief of the flying squad to check poll code violations in Hoskote Assembly constituency during campaigning for the State Assembly elections in 2018. The Commissioner had lodged two complaints against B.V. Byre Gowda and other workers of the BJP. The first complaint was lodged for putting up banners and buntings illegally, while another complaint was filed for abusing and assaulting election officers for removing the buntings and banners. The court, from the contents of the complaints, noted that the cause of action was an incident that had occurred on the same date, time and location, but the complainant had split the complaints into two, and hence two FIRs were registered by the police between 9 a.m. and 9.15 a.m. on April 18, 2018. “A counter-complaint is always permissible on the same incident as there can be two complaints and two FIRs, if it is a case of complaint and counter-complaint or a case of consequential complaint. These are not the facts in the case at hand. Therefore, without a shadow of doubt it would be hit by the doctrine of sameness,” the High Court held. “The complainant cannot be permitted to improve on the earlier complaint and as an afterthought bring in other offences in the second complaint.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/one-complainant-cant-lodge-two-complaints-on-same-incident-hc/article36705467.ece

28 September 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||A stroll down memory lane for Bommai and Nirani||Visiting one’s alma mater is always a memorable experience which revives old memories and makes one relive those old cherishable moments. On Monday, it happened with Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and his Cabinet colleague Murugesh Nirani. Both alumni of BVB College of Engineering and Technology (Now KLE Technological University), the leaders became emotional and spoke at length cherishing the old memories during the inauguration of the platinum jubilee celebrations of their alma mater . Showering praises on Vice-Chancellor of KLE Technological University Ashok Shettar and Chairman of KLE Society Prabhakar Kore, the two appreciated the transformation the institution has undergone in the last two decades. “I feel like taking admission once again in the college,” Mr. Bommai jokingly said, while the gathering comprising of other alumni, former and current faculty members and students cheered him. On a lighter note, the Chief Minister remembered some of the classrooms which he never visited, the library from where he never borrowed books, some special rooms in the college hostel, his classmates and their help and the college canteen where his attendance was compulsory. Mr. Bomai also recalled the strike of PWD officials, in which they took part and which ultimately resulted in the postponement of their examination and various other instances that he cherishes for life. On a serious note, he remembered his teachers with gratitude and said whatever good decisions for the people he took were the outcome of the education he received at his alma mater . He also recalled a strict Vice-Chancellor D.M. Nanjundappa and said that because of him he could complete his engineering education. Mr. Nirani, who is Minister for Large and Medium Industries, too became nostalgic and recalled his days in the college. “I am student of 35% category. That’s why I have become Industries Minister. If I had scored more, I would have become an assistant executive engineer like several of my classmates,” Mr. Nirani said, recalling his initial days as an industrialist. He narrated his success story which began with an investment of Rs. 10 lakh and how his company is now crushing 75,000 tonnes of sugarcane everyday. The Minister invited students to visit his sugar factory and also take up entrepreneurship instead of just taking a job. He also invited them to the entrepreneurship workshops being jointly held by the Union and State governments in a bid to assist budding entrepreneurs. He also listed out various schemes of assistance meant for those who wanted to become entrepreneurs. Welcoming the dignitaries, Prof. Shettar [Vice-Chancellor of KLETU] briefed about the KLE Tech Park which has been built at a cost of Rs. 4 crore with close to Rs. 1 crore contribution from the Alumni Association. He recalled B.V. Bhoomaraddi who donated 50 acres of land for setting up the engineering institution 75 years ago and said that the platinum jubilee celebrations will conclude on the birth anniversary of B.V. Bhoomaraddi on May 9, 2022.

28 September 2021||Hubballi,KARNATAKA||Forensic labs to be set up in six cities||In order to facilitate early detection of crime and expedite investigation, the State government will set up Forensic Science Laboratories (FSL) in six cities in Karnataka, including Hubballi-Dharwad, Kalaburagi, and Mysuru. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai announced this on Monday while addressing a gathering after performing bhoomi puja for the construction of Kasabapet police station and other works in Hubballi. This issue has already been discussed with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, he added. High pendency The High Court of Karnataka had recently noted that the criminal justice system had been “crippled” in the State because of the huge pendency of samples awaiting forensic tests because of a lack of human resources and testing facilities. The court, in its order in August, had said that an effort should be made to submit reports within three months on all the 35,738 articles/samples awaiting tests connected to 6,994 pending criminal cases. Mr. Bommai said the State government also planned to set up a police training centre for mid-level police officers, on the lines of the National Defence Academy at Khadakwasla in Pune. He said that for the first time, the State government was appointing police officers based on the concept of ‘officer on crime scene’, and the appointment of over 16,000 police personnel and sub-inspectors had been initiated. The Chief Minister also said that the government had plans to establish 500 police stations by setting up 100 per year for the next five years. As part of the welfare measures, the government would construct 10,000 residential quarters for the police personnel. This apart, kennel clubs would be set up for training police dogs, he said. Home Minister Araga Jnanendra said the foundation had been laid for the construction of police station, traffic police station and residential quarters at a cost of Rs. 21 crore. Steps also have been taken for checking online lottery and gambling by passing the requisite Bill, he said. The government has taken a strong decision of sending online gamblers to jail, he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Bommai had some advice for senior officers on the occasion. He asked those of the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police and above not to restrict themselves to administrative work in office. “You should visit all the police stations and do police work on the ground.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/forensic-labs-to-be-set-up-in-six-cities/article36705462.ece

28 September 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Farmers stage protests; vehicular movement normal||Farmers representing different organisations staged demonstrations at different locations in Kalaburagi city and took out protest marches through the major streets on Monday opposing the three new farm laws. The agitations, which were coordinated by Samyukta Horata Karnataka, a conglomerate of different farmers organisations, were part of the Bharat Bandh called by farmers protesting on the Delhi borders for the last several months demanding the repeal of the laws.

The protestors suddenly reached the railway station but were stopped at the entrance. However, the police foiled bids to block trains. Members of the District Congress Committee and Youth Congress held a car rally in the city. Congress leaders B.R. Patil and Sharan Prakash Patil, Raitha Krishi Karmika Sanghatane State secretary H.V. Diwakar, Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha’s district president Sharanabasappa Mamshetty, Akhila Bharata Kisan Sabha’s district president Maula Mulla, CPI leader Mahesh Rathod, Janwadi Mahila Sanghatan’s State vice-president K.

28 September 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Mangala Resource told to give report on waste management||Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra on Monday asked Mangala Resource Management Pvt. Ltd., a start-up guided by Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mutt, to submit a detailed project report (DPR) to Mangaluru City Corporation on how collection, transportation and processing of solid waste could be done in a better way in the city. Speaking at a public consultation meeting on solid waste management here, the Deputy Commissioner asked the start-up to submit the report within a week. The meeting was called to introduce a better solid waste management system in the city as the seven-year contract of Antony Waste Handling Cell Pvt. Ltd., which now collects and transports solid waste for the corporation, will end on January 31, 2022. The Deputy Commissioner also asked the corporation to extend the existing contract for some more months, if required, till a new system is put in place. Swami Ekagamyananda of Ramakrishna Mutt told the meeting that the start-up is now processing wet waste produced by 600 housees (flats) in 16 apartments in the city on the premises of the apartments itself by adopting pot compost method. This has been going on for the last one-and-a-half years. He suggested that the corporation introduce e-vehicles for collecting and transporting waste as it could save up to 50% in terms of fuel cost and maintenance of vehicles. Swami Ekagamyananda said that the corporation might require 300 e-vehicles and 20 lorries. About Rs. 10 crore investment might be required for purchasing vehicles. An area of bout 5,000 sq ft might be required in each one of the 60 wards to process wet waste in the ward level itself to convert it into compost. Wet waste will be converted as compost in a foul-free method. About 2,100 manpower is required to handle solid waste — from collection, transportation to processing. Mayor Premananda Shetty told the meeting that the council of the corporation in its special meeting earlier this month had approved a detailed project report on revised solid waste management submitted by Anti Pollution Drive. It will be withheld without ratification till the DPR of the start-up is placed before the council for discussion. The option of selecting a final DPR, from among the two, for recommending to the government, will be given to the council. Mr. Shetty said that the corporation will provide data to the start-up for preparing the DPR as per the guidelines of the government. Earlier, the Mayor had gone on record that a committee will be formed to discuss the DPR in detail, if required, to make modifications before sending it to the government. If required, a public consultation will also be held. Some of the modifications can also be made while calling for bids to take up waste management for the next five years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangala-resource-told-to-give-report-on-waste-management/article36705924.ece

Angara on Monday said that despite the district having many places of tourist importance, they are yet to be exploited to the full extent. Speaking after inaugurating the World Tourism Day celebrations organised by the district administration here, Mr. Angara said that some places naturally attract people while others have to be developed for the purpose.

The administration is determined to facilitating such investments in the district, the Minister said. Mr. Angara, who holds the Fisheries and Ports portfolio also, said that 12 projects related to the fisheries sector are being implemented in Dakshina Kannada with Union government assistance. These projects, besides helping the fishing community, will contribute to the growth of the tourism sector, he said. Member of Legislative Assembly D. Vedavyas Kamath said that the administration needs to draw up a coastal tourism map for better planning and exploitation of resources. Travel desks can be established at railway stations, bus terminals and airports to guide visitors to the district. There are many who would have a few hours at their disposal during their visit to Mangaluru; but have no guidance. Travel desks can help such visitors, he said. Mr. Kamath said that Kudrus (river islands), vast extent of the beachfront area in Bengre and similar other locations are some of the places that could be developed into centres of tourism. The district administration’s proposal for development of Kudrus is with the Union government, he said.

The deplorable condition of the stretch of road passing through Shantinagar, a densely populated area in Narasimharaja Assembly segment, had drawn severe flak from the commuting public, who had also staged protests against the continued apathy of the authorities. of road from Shantinagar 1st Cross to Ek Minar Mosque and a drain at a cost of Rs. 2.5 crore had begun in March-April this year, it was suspended midway due to non-availability of construction material during the COVID-19 lockdown. “The work has resumed now and we have asked the contractor to complete the work in a time-bound manner. We are hoping the work will be completed by October-end”, said Shivakumar, Assistant Commissioner of MCC’s Zone 8, who accompanied MCC’s Executive Engineer Ranjit Kumar on an inspection of the work on Monday. Though the work had been sanctioned more than three years ago, issues related to clearing the alleged encroachment of the road had delayed the process. Officials have clarified that the ongoing works relate only to asphalting after freeing the encroachments and was not part of any road-widening exercise that entailed acquisition of land. The stretch taken up for repair now is a portion of the road leading to Sathgalli Bus Depot on Outer Ring Road (ORR) from Forum Mall.

28 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Promoting UoM’s folklore museum||Stakeholders of the tourism sector in Mysuru have set their eyes on promoting Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion on the Manasagangotri campus which houses a folklore museum with a rare collection of artefacts related to the folklore traditions of Karnataka. On the occasion of World Tourism Day here on Monday, the stakeholders, including the Mysuru Travels’ Association, the Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association and the Tourism Department had organised an event at the mansion, inviting Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham, Mayor Sunanda Palanetra and Vice-Chancellor of University of Mysore G. Hemantha Kumar. B.S. Prashanth, head, Karnataka Tourism Society, C. Narayana Gowda, president, Hotel Owners’ Association, Museum Director Manjunath and others were present. The palace was constructed during the regime of Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar for princess Jayalakshmi Ammani. It was acquired by the university in the 1950s to establish a postgraduate centre, and underwent comprehensive restoration work with funding from Infosys in 2002. It houses the folklore museum. The mansion is now again in need of restoration. “We did the Tourism Day event specifically at the mansion as we wanted to promote the museum it houses. The mansion and its museum are unexplored by many tourists who are not aware of its presence,” said Mr. Prashanth. The stakeholders have urged the Mayor to consider bringing VVIPs to the mansion for experiencing its value and promotion. Mr. Prashanth said the stakeholders have urged the Deputy Commissioner to deploy a buggy at the entrance of the University on Bogadi Road for ferrying the tourists arriving there on Ambari, hop-on hop-off double-decker bus, for exploring the museum. “As the bus is not allowed inside the campus and the tourists have to walk a distance to access the museum, we have made the request,” he said. Plea to VC The stakeholders have also urged the VC to permit tourist buses inside the campus for accessing the mansion only on Tuesdays as on this day the zoo is closed for visitors and the tourists have a time of at least one or two hours which they could spend exploring the museum. “We are planning to submit a memorandum in this regard to the VC through the Karnataka Tourism Society. The VC has also been urged to fix an entry ticket for the museum so that the university gets regular revenue for its maintenance. Presently, the entry to the museum is free,” he said. Earlier, Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, the scion of erstwhile royal family, greeted visitors to the palace with roses marking the World Tourism Day.

28 September 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Hotels see jump in occupancy||Is tourism showing signs of revival in Mysuru? If the COVID-19 situation continues to remain stable like now and there is no threat of a third wave, the recovery can be expected by the year-end, the stakeholders hope. The hotel occupancy earlier was in bad shape in Mysuru. However, with the situation returning to near normal, the hotels have seen rise in occupancy which has crossed 50-60 per cent during weekends. “I can say the revival has commenced but we have a long way to go for reaching the statistics of pre-pandemic days. Hotels and restaurants are seeing business. This is a good sign. The economy cannot revive fully unless tourism recovers fully,” said Hotel Owners’ Association President C. Narayana Gowda. The occupancy during weekdays was around 25-30 per cent. Mr. Gowda said the stakeholders had urged the government to consider holding the Dasara events taking all necessary precautions. There is a difference between the pandemic situation last year and this year. The procession could have been conducted as usual as it could have helped the tourism economy, he felt. Tourists from Kerala are few but nearly 10-15 per cent of visitors are from Andhra Pradesh/Telangana and Tamil Nadu, he said. Doubts Mr. Gowda feels hotel bookings for Dasara season may start from the first week of October. He, however, expressed doubt over group bookings with no major Dasara events, and the Jamboo Savari confined to the palace premises for a limited audience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hotels-see-jump-in-occupancy/article36705790.ece

28 September 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Landslip holds up traffic on Gap Road||Huge rocks fell on the Gap Road stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway on Sunday night blocking the road. Heavy rain triggered the landslips where road work was in progress. The stretch has witnessed over 20 major landslips since the road- widening work started. According to Devikulam Subcollector Rahul Krishna Sharma the landslip on Sunday night was a major one. No casualty However, there was no casualty, he said. Traffic was suspended from Monday and it would take some days to clear the debris, he added. Rex Felix, assistant executive engineer, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that the works to clear the debris started on Monday morning. However, heavy rain hampered the work and it would be resumed after the rain subsided, he said. The road traffic along the Gap Road stretch had been suspended for nearly six months following a major landslip on June 17, 2020. Another major landslip on August 6 destroyed vast areas of cardamom cultivation on the downhill areas of the road. The road-widening work on the Gap Road stretch resumed last November and it was nearly completed in July. The road was partially opened for traffic on a trial basis last month. The Rs. 268.2-crore road-widening work on the 41-km Munnar-Bodimettu stretch began in 2017. There were widespread allegations that the unscientific road works triggered the landslips. Rocks were blasted simultaneously at various spots and this shook sensitive layers of rocks causing the landslips, it was alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/landslip-holds-up-traffic-on-gap-road/article36705739.ece

28 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Near-miss involving barges: IWAI for heightened alert||Close calls involving barges on National Waterway-III, the latest being at Champakkara on Sunday, has prompted stakeholders to heighten their alert, with the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) shooting off letters to barge operators and the Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) to ensure adherence to communication protocol between vessels and to deploy skilled crew members. The crew members must be familiar with the peculiarities of waterbodies their barges pass through. Sunday’s near-miss incident (involving a barge carrying rock phosphate to Ambalamugal and an ammonia carrier barge proceeding to Eloor) could have been avoided if crew members had communicated the position of each vessel well in advance while approaching the narrow waterbody at Champakkara, said Mathew George, Director of IWAI, which owns and maintains the waterway. This is because it is tough to widen the corridor by acquiring land in the densely-populated area. A copy of the letter sent to the KMB has been forwarded to the District Collector (in his capacity as Chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority) to convene a meeting of stakeholders to prevent such incidents that could turn disastrous in case of collision, he added. Unlike roads, waterways are considered to be the safest mode to carry chemicals, fuel, and other hazardous cargo in bulk. It is also the most energy-efficient way to transport cargo. Water Metro The general secretary of Kerala Maritime Organisation, A.M. James, who owns an Italy-registered barge that transports liquefied ammonia, explained how utmost caution must be exercised, since barges carry sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, and rock phosphate and sulphur through Kochi’s waterways. “Crew members must be experienced, since many areas are narrow and have curves in abundance. They ought to up their vigil since 23 Water Metro ferries, each carrying up to 100 passengers, are set to commence services in early 2022,” he said. In the event of near-misses, crew members often trade charges, claiming that the other did not respond to telephone calls. In this context, they must adhere to navigation rules, which include communicating by using powerful horns, Mr. James added. Double-skin hull Meanwhile, stakeholders in the sector demanded caution against operating single-skin (those with a single-layer of hull) barges which could suffer leakage in case of collision. Double-skin vessels will ensure added protection even in case a vessel runs aground, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/near-miss-involving-barges-iwai-for-heightened-alert/article36705724.ece

The Kerala Homestay and Tourism Society (Kerala HATS) organised a heritage walk in Fort Kochi and Mattancherry to highlight the need to form a Kochi Heritage Tourism Development Authority. The NGO submitted a memorandum to the Collector demanding steps to conserve heritage structures in the area. Required measures Kerala HATS director M.P. Sivadathan said officials of the agencies that ought to conserve heritage and ensure cleanliness of such locales were either inefficient or not interested in executing their duty. Lack of coordination was another issue, he said. The Collector must take steps to remove encroachers, renovate and conserve the 300-year-old Odatha located near Veli Ground, the Dutch Cemetery, the cemetery of Malabar Jews, the weed-infested Parade Ground and the over 140-year-old Hari Shenoy Bungalow, among other heritage structures, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ecotourism-circuit-mooted-in-periyar/article36705726.ece
28 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||A plot that rivals the best of con movies||A petition to the Chief Minister jointly submitted by six persons on how they were taken for a ride by Monson Mavunkal, the self-styled antique collector and amateur archaeologist who was arrested by the Crime Branch on Sunday, reads like the script of a brilliantly plotted con movie. That the accused managed to cheat the victims of Rs. 10 crore seems beside the point while considering his ingenuity and audacity of plotting the con and sustaining it for nearly four years. The forged documents from the finance ministry and banks purportedly showing that his Rs. 2.62 crore, proceeds from the sale of antiques abroad, remains frozen since 2010 as per the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) were the pivot around which he weaved such an incongruous story that it defies logic that people had actually fallen for it. First in 2017 The accused initially sought the help of two of the petitioners in 2017 to continue the legal fight for getting his money released. He invited them to his rented house at Kaloor packed with ‘invaluable antiques’ and several premium vehicles. To further convince them, he flashed his connections with influential people by way of photographs, videos and posters of the elite events allegedly organised by his company. The names invoked by the petitioners literally constitute the who’s who of the political, police, film and business fraternity. What initially started off as a request for Rs. 1.50 crore ended up with the two petitioners, the petition claims, paying as much as Rs. 6 crore between June 2017 and June 2019. They also roped in the other four petitioners who collectively paid another Rs. 4 crore. Whenever they demanded refund, Monson flashed his connections and even held meetings in the presence of political and police bigwigs who allegedly mediated on his behalf. He even placated them by generously giving away premium vehicles and rare ‘antiques.’ Most of those antiques, the petitioners’ later realised, were cheap knock-offs bought from an Ernakulam-based person who used to rent it for film shooting. The luxury vehicles bought from a person in Bengaluru were yet to be paid for. He even claimed to possess a ‘chemical used in rocket launch’ and showed a certificate by a DRDO scientist to prove its authenticity. Monson seems to have used a mix of coercion and persuasion as at one point he allegedly flashed three guns. He claimed to have bumped off someone in Mumbai and hung the body from a metro pillar there using his connections, not less than that of Dawood Ibrahim. Police officer’s letter When the petitioners still insisted on getting their money, he sent two of them to Dubai and Qatar for generating revenue by selling antiques to royal families there. When the petitioners demanded the ownership documents of those antiques, he gave them documents, purportedly issued by a senior police officer, on the high security for his possessions. An agreement he reached with four of the petitioners on January 19 to return Rs. 4 crore in three months was also not met. The petitioners alleged that Monson was plotting a new fraud in the name of selling 93 Islam-related antiques to the Qatari royal family for Rs. 15,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-plot-that-rivals-the-best-of-con-movies/article36705750.ece
28 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Vaccine gap: HC adjourns hearing||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday adjourned to Thursday the hearing on an appeal filed by the Centre against a single judge’s verdict allowing those willing to take a second paid dose of Covishield vaccine four weeks after the first jab, instead of the stipulated 84-day gap. The single judge had also directed the Central government to make necessary provisions in the CoWIN portal to enable this. When the appeal came up, the Bench, comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali, asked Kitex Garments Limited and Kitex Childrenswear Limited, Kochi, that filed the writ to furnish the details regarding the number of employees who had already received the second jab following the directive. The Centre contended that the 12-week interval, which was based on a scientific study, meant that better immunity would be provided only 12 weeks after the first jab and not before. Hence, any insistence on taking the second dose prior to 12 weeks would actually impede the development of immunity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccine-gap-hc-adjourns-hearing/article36705740.ece

28 September 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||A smart system to tackle phishing developed||Clicking on an innocuous-looking link received over WhatsApp is all it takes for an unsuspecting user to fall prey to a phishing attack. That probability has only increased manifold ever since the onset of the pandemic last year, with companies and individuals being hit by wave after wave of such attacks. A four-member team of computer science students, who recently graduated from the Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology (RSET), has developed a Deep Learning-based solution to detect websites with phishing motives as part of their B.Tech final-year project. The solution has caught the eye of the Kerala Police Cyberdome, which is in the process of adding it as a module to their existing app, BSafe, for alerting fraud and spam calls. “Unlike the existing models for detecting phishing attacks that largely take into account the website URL alone, our solution collects HTML, including script tags, to differentiate a malicious website from a benign one. We have developed a browser extension where a user can feed the website URL and the solution will run a phishing check,” said Nithin Valiyaveedu, a member of the team. Roshan Reju, Nithin K.M., and Vysakh Murali made up the rest of the team guided by Sangeetha Jamal, assistant professor, RSET Ethical hacker The team reached out to Cyberdome using Mr. Roshan’s contacts there in his capacity as an ethical hacker. Two presentations were held for the Cyberdome representatives who were impressed by the solution. The team has since then shared the API code of the solution with the Cyberdome for adding it as a module in BSafe. “BSafe, a mobile and web-based application, is building up a database of numbers involved in scams and helps users of the app to alert and even block such numbers automatically. We plan to incorporate the phishing attack detecting solution as an additional feature in our app, for which the process is now under way,” said Cyberdome sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-smart-system-to-tackle-phishing-developed/article36705832.ece

The Corporation had published the draft of the protocol a few weeks ago and was planning to release the revised version by the end of the month while the protocol was set to be launched on October 2 on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, coinciding with the Sanitation Week. However, the response to the draft from the public has been overwhelming, necessitating a thorough revision of the protocol. “We have been receiving suggestions from all quarters, by email, post, on WhatsApp, and through the website. It takes time to sort them all out and design the protocol for each new sector that has come up in the discussions,” said S. Jayasree, Health Standing Committee chairperson of the Corporation. The draft protocol comprised rules that need to be followed in 28 sectors. But with the recent suggestions, the number of sectors has risen to 48. “We have a few sectors more to consider such as saloons and beauty parlours, accommodation of guest labourers, online marketing, food delivery and even the Corporation office, which need to be incorporated to make the protocol really comprehensive,” Ms. Jayasree added. The new suggestions have to be presented before the expert committee once again for further discussions before they are finalised. Training centre Meanwhile, the training centre for the protocol, which was planned to be set up at Anakkulam Cultural Centre, has been shifted to Shekharan Memorial Hall at Eranhipalam. The training module is being prepared. Training will be imparted to all sections of people, and certificates will be issued in association with the Kerala Institute of Local Administration. At the same time, all other ground-level activities for the implementation of the protocol such as forming ward committees and registration of residents’ associations and other units are in progress. The Corporation had conducted discussions on the draft with all sections of people including Kudumbashree groups, trade unions, media, youth organisations, NGOs and restaurant associations. The draft was distributed among all sections resulting in everyone coming up with creative suggestions in their respective fields. “There is no point in hurrying and launching a half-baked protocol. We plan to do it thoroughly and hence the delay,” Ms. Jayasree said, adding that there were plans to translate the protocol into Hindi and English as well, for the benefit of the migrant population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rollout-of-hygiene-protocol-may-be-delayed/article36705720.ece

They said they too had suffered “moral harm” and trauma after escaping death narrowly. These 10 survived while two fishermen on the boat died that day from the bullets. Italy paid the families of the two men Rs. 4 crore each. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice Indira Banerjee, the 10 survivors had complained that they had not got even a penny from the Rs. 10 crore compensation paid by the Republic of Italy. In fact, they were not even made parties in the case. They said they wanted their share of the compensation from the Rs. 2 crore given to Mr. Fredy. In August, the apex court stayed the disbursement of Mr. Fredy’s compensation. On Monday, the Bench agreed to a request made by advocate A. Karthik, for Mr. Fredy, for more time. The court adjourned the case by six weeks. In an earlier hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, had suggested that the crew could directly approach the High Court with their plea for a portion of the owner’s compensation. Mr. Mehta had said the apex court Bench, instead of taking up the matter directly, ought to ask the High Court to implead the boat owner and the 10 crew members and decide their case there. On June 15, the Supreme Court had agreed to close criminal proceedings against marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, after Italy paid over the Rs. 10 crore. The 10 survivors had argued that the bullets damaged the outer body of the boat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fisher-crew-seek-compensation/article36705735.ece

High-tech city Kiran Kumar, secretary of the Kanjikode Industries Forum, said that the industry demanded setting up of a high-tech city, biomedical engineering hub, vegetable and mango processing clusters, skilling in indigenous industries with a focus on coir, khadi and handloom, metal industries, and promoting experimental farm tourism. Former diplomat Suresh K. Menon briefed on infrastructure, and suggested that Palakkad could be converted into a water surplus district and made a logistics and warehouse hub for the State. Sreemahadevan Pilla, director of the Ahalia group of institutions, suggested setting up of knowledge and community learning hubs, platforms to link the academy with the industry, and creating skill development centres. Jayakrishnan G. Menon, former chief general manager of NABARD, stressed the promotion of different crops.

28 September 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Hartal near-total in capital||The dawn-to-dusk hartal, backed by Left Democratic Front (LDF) and United Democratic Front (UDF), was near-total in the district on Monday. Barring a few isolated incidents, the shutdown that was announced in response to a call for a nationwide bandh by Samyukt Kisan Morcha has largely been peaceful. While public transport vehicles remained off the roads, few taxis, autorickshaws and private vehicles could be seen in various parts of the district. While the movement of such vehicles remain unobstructed, there were a few instances of commercial outlets being forcibly closed by hartal supporters. A supermarket and a financial institution was shuttered down when a group of agitators objected to their attempts to operate on the hartal day. Minor violence broke out at a petrol pump at Ayanimoodu, near Pallichal, around 11.30 a.m. when nearly 10 activists manhandled its manager and a few employees including women for defying their instruction to suspend business for the day. The Naruvamoodu police have registered a case in connection with the incident. Hartal supporters in Ayilam, near Attingal, purportedly hurled abuses at a group of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme workers when they had arrived for work on a plantation field. The Chala bazaar presented a deserted scene, as only a few dejected traders opened their stalls in futile anticipation of customers turning up on the hartal day. While KSRTC suspended regular services during the hartal, special trips were undertaken at the behest of the City police from Thampanoor to the Regional Cancer Centre, Thirvuvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital, and the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. The public utility resumed trips at 6 p.m. Major institutions including Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) ferried their staff on convoy basis with police protection. With all trade unions except Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) pledging support towards the hartal, attendance levels was abysmal in the Secretariat and other government offices. The Thiruvananthapuram City police had adopted tight security with pickets set up at 142 locations. Universities had deferred their examinations that were scheduled on the day. In front of Raj Bhavan All India Kisan Sabha vice-president and CPI(M) Polit Bureau member S. Ramachandran Pillai has said any attempt to privatise the agricultural sector by implementing the contentious farm laws in the country could sound the death knell for large sections. He was inaugurating a protest meeting organised by the Kerala Samyuktha Karshaka Samiti in front of the Raj Bhavan to pledge solidarity with the nationwide Bharat Bandh on Monday. Kerala Samyuktha Karshaka Samithi chairman Sathyan Mokeri, who presided over the meeting, said farm laws threatened to push the country into unrest under such circumstances. Binoy Viswam, MP, former Speaker M. Vijayakumar, and leaders of various farmers organisations, also participated in the demonstration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hartal-near-total-in-capital/article36705930.ece
28 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Fraudster’s arrest puts top leaders, officers in a spot||Several politicians and top police officers were reportedly left red-faced after photographs and videos showing them in the company of alleged fake antique dealer and “debt-dodging confidence trickster” Monson Mavunkal went viral on mainstream and social media on Monday. Monson had fallen into the police dragnet on Sunday on the charge of palming off recently handcrafted cheap knock-offs as authentic relics to wealthy, uninformed and eager collectors. The suspect’s social media account showed him in the company of an astonishing number of rich, famous and influential people, including Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran, MP, actors and the police top brass. Monson had reportedly endeared himself to Mr. Sudhakaran by claiming that he was a German-trained cosmetologist. Mr. Sudhakaran admitted that he had sought out Monson’s service as a stylist. He was not a party to Monson’s financial dealings. Sudhakaran sees plot Mr. Sudhakaran said the Chief Minister’s Office had hatched a plot to discredit him and Monson had come in handy for the conspirators. The police said Monson had lured investors to part with crores of rupees as an advance fee for vast interest-free loans later. The self-styled archaeologist allegedly claimed that he needed cash advance to free up the vast sums deposited in his foreign bank accounts by some rich potentates who had purchased antiques from him. Additional Director General of Police, Manoj Abraham, had reportedly flagged the possibility of fraud after a tour of Monson’s private museum. He had also pulled up an IPS officer in 2020 for overstepping his jurisdictional bounds to save Monson from prosecution in a financial-fraud case. Intelligence reports Several had doubted Monson’s elaborate and persuasive tales about owning rare religious artefacts and reliquaries. However, the police lacked a specific complaint to proceed against him despite cautionary intelligence reports. Officials said Monson often blurred the line between fact and fiction for “personal gain.” He had an uncanny knack for making people believe in things that did not exist. Monson had allegedly claimed to own the “staff of Moses,” silver pieces received by Judas Iscariot for betraying Jesus Christ to Roman soldiers, Veronica’s veil and other imaginary rarities from the mythical world. Monson moved in a cavalcade of expensive cars and surrounded himself with bodyguards wearing black glasses and dark suits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fraudsters-arrest-in-kerala-puts-politicians-officers-in-a-fix/article36705352.ece

Images made using these fluorescent inks are invisible under normal light. They turn visible only when viewed under UV light. Such fluorescent materials find anti-counterfeiting applications in bank notes, passports, and other high-security documents. For the achievement, the NIIST was awarded the Certificate of Merit under the category of CSIR Technology Awards at the 80th Foundation Day celebrations of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) held in New Delhi on Sunday. The seven-member NIIST team involved in the project on security printing materials included Vijayakumar C., Jubi John, Sreejith Shankar P., Praveen V.K., Saju Pillai, Karunakaran V., and NIIST director A. Ajayaghosh. What the NIIST team did was to identify molecules that can absorb UV light and emit different colours. A normal organic molecule will decompose over time under harsh conditions. But a currency note has to last for a certain period of time. A passport had to last longer, Dr. Vijayakumar, Principal Scientist, Chemical Sciences and Technology Division, NIIST, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/niist-lauded-for-security-printing-technology/article36705938.ece

But this time, instead of expressing their intense love, they spoke about the concerns over COVID-19 and the precautions to be taken to check its spread.  Be The Warrior , inspired by Vaikom Mohammed Basheer’s intense love story Mathilukal , is an illustration video made for creating awareness of the pandemic. In the video, Basheer and Narayani speak about COVID-19, its mode of spread and precautions to be taken. The wall of passionate love between them has now turned into a wall of concern, care and caution. Thrissur-based Oaktree Brand Wagon (OBW) has made the illustration video for the Health Department. The department decided to use the theme for awareness videos after watching the illustrations prepared by artist Shakir Eravakkad to be drawn on the wall of the Pala subjail for COVID awareness. The conversation In the beginning of the video, Narayani asks Basheer: “Is it crowded outside.” “It seems people have forgotten about the pandemic,” replies Basheer. “You should be careful. You may be a great writer, but should not go out without a mask,” Narayani advises Basheer. “Masks should be properly worn, not on the neck. You have to take both doses of the vaccine too,” she says. “I have taken all precautions,” replies Basheer. When Basheer expresses his concern that he is a feeble writer and corona is very powerful, Narayani consoles him “Be alert, but don’t panic.” The video ends with a message from Basheer. “It is a fight to build a pandemic-free country.” Narayani draws a mask and sanitiser bottle on the walls of the jail.

28 September 2021||Vijaywada,KERALA||Bandh evokes mixed response in A.P., Telangana||The Bharat Bandh called by farmers unions and supported by Congress and other Opposition parties to protest against the NDA government's three agri laws was peaceful and evoked a mixed response in Andhra Pradesh. While the bandh was total in Chittoor and East Godavari districts, it evoked good response in Srikakulam, Vizianagarm, Ongole and Nellore sistricts. The protest saw a mixed response in Kurnool, Anantapur disticts. Commuters faced a harrowing time as the APSRTC withdrew bus services. However, autorickshaws plied in many parts of the State. Educational institutions were shut. Leaders of the Left parties and trade unions took out protest rallies across the State. Daily life unaffected Meanwhile, daily life remained largely unaffected in Karnataka, including Bengaluru during the bandh. Though most businesses remained open and all forms of public transport ran as usual, the State witnessed multiple protests by farmers. Bengaluru, Hubballi, Belagavi, Mysuru and other major cities saw protests by thousands of farmers demanding withdrawal of the farm laws. Farmers were joined by the trade unions, Dalit and Kannada organisations in their protests. Protesters tried to picket bus stands and block highways in Kalaburagi, Mysuru and other districts. However, all disruptions were brief and soon dispersed by the police. The bandh passed off peacefully in the State without any untoward incident, senior police officials said. Kannada activist Vatal Nagaraj came down heavily on the lack of support for the bandh call. “This is not a farmer’s issue alone. Everyone who eats food is adversely affected by the farm laws. The government is going for privatisation in all sectors. People cannot be bothered about only traffic issues,” he said. Farmers had a run in with the police in Bengaluru, when contrary to what was permitted they began taking out rallies from various points in the city to congregate at Town Hall, from where a protest rally to Mysuru Bank Circle was permitted. Police detained several farmer leaders at these rallies, including Kuruburu Shanthakumar. “We were holding a peaceful demonstration and not even blocking the road. We have been detained illegally and this is an undemocratic act. We have refused to get down from the bus at the police station and are protesting here only,” he said from Adugodi Police Station. The city witnessed traffic snarls in some arterial roads where farmers took out a rally. Transport services In Telangana, the Bharat Bandh parties evoked mixed response. The fleet of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation, cab services, autorickshaw and other transport services operated as usual in State capital Hyderabad, but the buses were obstructed in districts. A scuffle ensued between the police and the agitators when they tried to stop buses coming out of the Hanamkonda depot. Over 800 buses were off the road in the erstwhile Mahabubnagar district. Telangana Congress Committee president A. Revanth Reddy and his supporter were arrested in Hyderabad, while the president of Telangana Jana Samiti M. Kodandaram’s clothes were torn in another protest at Hayathnagar. The police banged at the window panes of Mr. Kodandaram’s car, pulled him out and shifted him to the Meerpet police station. The movement of people was curtailed largely due to the incessant downpour caused by the Gulab cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. Despite calls given by various trade unions of the Left parties in the city and across the State, all commercial establishments and business houses operated normally.

Mr. Chopra, who is 6 foot 5 inches tall and weighs 170 kg, was in Gooty to inaugurate a gymnasium on Monday. A well-known motivational speaker around the world, Mr. Chopra said his mantra for a happy life was to ‘say yes to life and no to drugs’. “The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of us to stay at home and we’re spending more time sitting down than we usually did. It’s hard for a lot of us now to do the sort of exercise we normally do. It’s even harder for people who don’t usually exercise. But during such times, it’s very important for people of all ages and abilities to be as active as possible,” Mr. Chopra said. “Just taking a short break from sitting, and doing three to four minutes of light intensity physical movements such as walking or stretching, will help ease your muscles and improve blood circulation. Regular physical activity benefits both the body and mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, Type-2 diabetes, and various cancers — all conditions that can increase susceptibility to COVID-19,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/asias-strongest-man-inaugurates-gooty-gym/article36705805.ece

The residents also ensured that the people staying in the adjacent buildings were evacuated from their houses and no vehicles were parked in the surrounding area. According to officials, the building, located on the 7th main road, is at least over 50 years old.

28 September 2021||Chennai,ANDHRA PRADESH||K’taka directed to release water to T.N.||The Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) on Monday directed Karnataka to immediately release “some quantity” of water towards making good the shortfall in realisation of the latter’s share of Cauvery water. The release should be as per the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal’s decision of 2007, which was modified by the Supreme Court in 2018. Disclosing this, S.K. Haldar, chairman of the Central Water Commission, who is also the head of CWMA, told The Hindu over phone that the situation would be reviewed at the next meeting, scheduled to be held early October. He added that Tamil Nadu too had been asked to clear the deficit in the receipt of water by Puducherry for irrigation in the Karaikal region. The authority will meet again on October 7, said a member of the Tamil Nadu team of Water Resources Department officials, adding that the State had agreed to release half a thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) of water to Puducherry. According to a release issued by the Tamil Nadu government later in the day, the present shortfall in realisation is 33.7 tmc ft. Till September 26, Karnataka has supplied 85.8 tmc ft, since June 1, against the prescribed quantity of 119.5 tmc ft. “Karnataka has not followed the judgment of the Supreme Court on water sharing for Tamil Nadu properly,” the release said. It said the neighbouring State, despite being told by the authority to release water at the previous meeting, did not “fully implement” it. To persistent queries, Mr. Haldar refused to get drawn into specifying any quantity of water to be released by Karnataka. However, he indicated that “as on date, [the] Mettur [reservoir] has not got the storage it used to have. Going by the 30-year average, it used to have a good storage of 40-45 tmc ft. Compared with that, there is some deficiency, and at least that quantity should be made up. “ On Monday morning, Mettur’s storage was 35.774 tmc ft (capacity: 93.47 tmc ft), with the water level remaining at 73.49 ft (full level: 120 ft). Discharge through the river and canal was marginally higher than the inflow, which was about 7,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs). The CWMA chairman said Karnataka had drawn to his attention the “deficient rainfall” in its part of the Cauvery basin. “We have conceded their point,” he said. The meeting, which lasted about two-and-a-half hours, was attended by officials of the Tamil Nadu government, physically, while representatives of other States, including Karnataka, took part virtually. The Tamil Nadu team consisted of Sandeep Saxena, Additional Chief Secretary (ACS - Water Resources and Public Works); R. Subramanian, chairman of the Cauvery Technical Cell, and Pattabhiraman, member of the cell. The Tamil Nadu government opposed any discussion on the Mekedatu dam project, as the matter was sub judice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-directed-to-release-water-to-tn/article36705458.ece

28 September 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Surgeon’s research on adult spinal deformity wins global acclaim||A Guntur-based spine surgeon’s path-breaking research on adult spinal deformity (ASD) has won global acclaim. Dr. J. Naresh Babu’s original research paper, ‘Adult Spinal Deformity Patient Profile: A Paradigm Shift in Comprehensive Patient Evaluation in Order to Optimize Treatment and Improve Patient Care’ was published in Asian Spine Journal in 2019. He presented the work virtually at the Scoliosis Research Society annual conference held at St. Louis, U.S.A. on Sunday and got a special invitation to present his research paper at the Global Spine Congress in Paris in November. “Low back pain is the most common problem in the elderly. The back problem in adults is not just a problem with back pain but a diverse problem that has many other broad characteristics that are transmitted by age,” Dr. Naresh Babu told The Hindu on Monday. Present diagnostic methods indicate treatment for ASD based on the angles of deformity noticed on the X-ray. Dr. Naresh Babu highlighted the shortcomings of the present approach and the need for a new tool. While proposing that the back X-ray along with a patient’s symptoms such as low back pain, leg pain, sciatica, pressure on nerves and other health problems that are transmitted through age are important considerations, he also stressed the importance of support from family members and expectations of treatment outcome in elderly patients. Currently, there is no guidance on how to weigh all these elements and use them in daily treatment. Dr. Naresh Babu AO ASD classification project launched three years ago aims to guide the medical decision process and develop a comprehensive classification to select a treatment strategy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/surgeons-research-on-adult-spinal-deformity-wins-global-acclaim/article36705955.ece
28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||TS govt. plans B-Hub for life sciences||The State government is actively working on the setting up of Biosciences Hub (B-Hub) with essential focus on life sciences sector on the lines of the T-Hub as it has the potential to grow significantly in the coming days. The development follows the government’s resolve to double the industry size from the existing $50 billion to 100 billion in the coming 10 years. The city is already in the forefront as the bulk drug capital of the country providing 33% of the vaccines consumed internationally, Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao said. Discussions were held with major players like Kiran Mazumdar Shah of Biocon and she was convinced to make investments in life sciences segments in the State, he said while participating in a short discussion on “progress of industries and IT sectors in the State” in the Legislative Assembly on Monday. He said given the State’s condition as landlocked area, the government focused on 14 core sectors including IT, electronics, defence and aerospace, textiles, food processing and gems & jewellery and attracting some of the major names in these sectors. “The top five most valued technology firms – Micrososft, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google have their large bases in the city. The State overtook Bengaluru for two consecutive quarters in terms of office space absorption. IT exports which were pegged at Rs. 57,228 crore at the time of formation of the State reached Rs. 1.45 lakh crore at present,” he said. This was because of the commitment of the government to promote industry in a transparent manner for creating employment. Responding to a suggestion on reservations for locals in private sector, he said the move proved counter productive as could be seen from experiences in some States. “One State enacted legislation and a company is prepared to shift its base from there. We are in negotiations with the firm for setting up its base here,” he said. The State government was however providing additional incentives to companies which were employing locals like providing additional capital subsidy and sales tax exemption of 5% each for employing 70% locals. The government would also bring out a legislation to curb cyber crime which was on the rise following the advent of IT into daily lives. The draft of the legislation was being prepared in association with the NALSAR law university and it would be a reality soon, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-govt-plans-b-hub-for-life-sciences/article36705340.ece

People moved freely on their private vehicles as the public transport was off the roads, though autorickshaws plied in many parts of Kurnool and Anantapur districts. APSRTC buses remained in the depots with the State government and YSR Congress Party lending support to the bandh.

But suddenly she disappeared with my baby when I went out of the maternity ward,” said Songa Sindhuja, narrating how the accused had befriended her and later kidnapped the baby. Madapati Mary, wife of Krishna Murthy, is a native of Tummidi village in Bantumilli mandal of Krishna district. She went to Machilipatnam Government Hospital for a medical check-up on September 25. She introduced herself to Sindhuja as her sister-in-law and helped her in the ward. Sindhuja, wife of S. Yesobu, delivered a female baby a couple of days before. Chilakalapudi police arrested the accused and handed over the infant to her parents on Sunday. “Mary moved very closely with me for two days. She said the baby resembled her brother Yesobu. We shared food and Mary took care of the baby and made me believe that she was our relative,” Sindhuja told The Hindu.  “When the hospital staff asked me to get my Arogyasri card details updated, I went out leaving the baby in her (Mary) care. On returning, I found the infant and Mary missing,” she said. Chilakalapudi CI R. Anka Babu said after kidnapping the baby, Mary reached the Machilipatnam bus station in an auto-rickshaw and boarded a bus to Bantumilli. From there, she went to Tummidi village in another auto-rickshaw. “We are verifying the background of Mary and whether any other person had assisted her in the crime,” the CI said. “Sindhuja’s case is an example of how some women and criminals are resorting to infant kidnaps at hospitals. As part of the investigation, we have studied about 15 such cases reported in the last few years. We request the public to be cautious on the movement of strangers and alert the police,” said Special Branch DSP Dharmendra. Krishna district SP Siddharth Kaushal said the accused was produced in a court on Monday and she was granted bail. “The case is being investigated from all angles. Police will conduct a meeting with the government hospital authorities on ways to step up security,” the SP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/she-made-me-believe-she-was-my-sister-in-law/article36705953.ece

Ten of his crew members have approached the apex court, saying they have every right to get their share from boat owner Fredy’s compensation. The crew members said they too had suffered “moral harm” and trauma after escaping death narrowly. These 10 survived while two fishermen on the boat died that day from the bullets. Italy paid the families of the two men Rs. 4 crore each. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice Indira Banerjee, the 10 survivors had complained that they had not got even a penny from the Rs. 10 crore compensation paid by the Republic of Italy. In fact, they were not even made parties in the case. They said they wanted their share of the compensation from the Rs. 2 crore given to Mr. Fredy. In August the apex court had stayed the disbursement of Mr. Fredy’s compensation. On Monday, the Bench agreed to a request made by advocate A. Karthik, for Mr. Fredy, for more time. The court adjourned the case by six weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/enrica-lexie-case-crew-seek-compensation/article36705355.ece
28 September 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Black tiger shrimp variety back in vogue in Prakasam||Aquaculturists in Prakasam district, who burnt their fingers growing white-leg shrimp (Litopenaeus Vannamei) extensively during the pandemic, are now opting for black tiger shrimp(Penaeus Monodon) variety to compensate for the loss incurred. Black tiger shrimp was in vogue in the last decade too, but the farmers were not keen on growing this variety after it was affected by diseases. In 2009, they shifted to growing of Vannamei, the much-sought after in the USA in view of better productivity and disease resilience. Now, shrimp farmers are once again favouring black tiger shrimp cultivation in the wake of squeezed margin even when the production is up to the mark. “Raising white-leg shrimp is turning out to be risky of late as its survival rate has fallen to about 60% due to disease. The cultivation has become less profitable due to falling prices too,” say a group of aquaculturists in the coastal mandal of Kothapatnam. While the market rate for Vannamei has improved by about Rs. 70 per kg of late, the feed cost has also gone up rendering the cultivation risky given the poor survival rate over a period. On a pilot basis, progressive aquaculturists have raised black tiger shrimp in Kothaptnam, Chinnaganjam and Tangutur in the last season encouraging others to follow suit. “Black tiger shrimp fetches a premium rate of Rs. 700 for a 20 count,” says Manne Edukondalu, who has sourced quality black tiger shrimp seeds from Madagascar and raised them in 20 acres in Kothapatnam. The Marine Products Export Development Authority(MPEDA) should make available specific pathogen-free black tiger shrimp broodstock for the farmers to complete the shift smoothly, added another aquculturist Suresh Babu, from from Chinnaganjam. Subsidised power The State government should ensure subsidised power to the sector as promised. “We are now charged Rs. 3.40 per unit of power as against Rs. 1.50 per unit earlier,” says a farmer Ramesh Babu while running aerator for the healthy growth of vannamei in his pond. The galloping price of diesel is also adding to our woes, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/black-tiger-shrimp-variety-back-in-vogue-in-prakasam/article36705803.ece

28 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||KPCC on the back foot as Sudheeran quits AICC||Congress leader V.M. Sudheeran conveyed his “intense disillusionment” with the “imperious” style of functioning of the incumbent Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leadership to All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Tariq Anwar, who called on him at his house here on Monday. Mr. Sudheeran’s resignation in close succession from the AICC and the KPCC’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC) had prompted Mr. Anwar’s placatory visit after a day of dilly-dallying. Mr. Sudheeran’s move has arguably cast the helmsmanship of KPCC president K. Sudhakaran and Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan under a cloud. It was also interpreted as an oblique criticism of AICC general secretary, organisation, K.C. Venugopal, who purportedly headed an emergent triad of the three leaders in Congress politics in the State. Mr. Sudheeran’s position also resonated with the organisational line of party veterans Oommen Chandy, Ramesh Chennithala, and Mullappally Ramachandran. The political calculus behind the reconcilement bid was that the Congress could ill afford to lose a leader of Mr. Sudheeran’s stature, given the slew of recent high-profile defections to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Mr. Anwar, who is in charge of Kerala, remained closeted with Mr. Sudheeran for over an hour. Mr. Sudheeran commanded no party faction. However, his clean politician image and single-man social campaigns had endeared him to party workers. He had also captured the public imagination to some measure by pointedly refusing to contest elections despite having savoured repeated success at the hustings. Mr. Sudheeran said his path forward would hinge on whether the AICC would resort to course correction. There should be some tangible result on the ground, he said. “The new leadership had initially instilled a feeling of hope. However, they soon dampened expectations by adopting a non-consultative style of functioning alien to the Congress,” he said. The authoritarian trait was evident in the arbitrary nomination of DCC presidents, he said. When pressed about the possibility of withdrawing his resignation, Mr. Sudheeran said he rarely retracted his decisions. He was a congenital Congress person who adhered to the Gandhi-Nehruvian school of thought. He hankered after no post and had flagged the issue purely in party interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kpcc-on-the-back-foot-as-sudheeran-quits-aicc/article36705350.ece
28 September 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||The ethical face of Congress in Kerala||V. M. Sudheeran, a former KPCC president himself, was for long the ethical face of the Congress in Kerala. Of late, the veteran leader had a series of run-ins with the current KPCC leadership over the appointment of DCC presidents and lack of consultation within the party. Mr. Sudheeran had pointedly rejected the neo-liberal economic outlook of the Manmohan Singh era recently. Instead, he argued for a return to Nehruvian socialism, a political line that could endear him to the Left. Notably, Mr. Sudheeran’s resignation from the AICC had come at an ominous time when defection to the CPI(M) was in vogue among disgruntled Congress leaders. Some of Mr. Sudheeran’s critics in the KPCC felt that the veteran had created unnecessary political theatre for getting accommodation at the party’s national level. They also blamed him for his “inflexible stance” on prohibition that arguably precipitated the “bar bribery” case that undermined the stature of the Oommen Chandy government in 2015. Mr. Sudheeran had made his mark as Speaker, Health Minister, MP and legislator. He had the backing of Church on prohibition issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/the-ethical-face-of-congress-in-kerala/article36705341.ece

28 September 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan launches ‘Dharma Patham’ at Kanaka Durga temple||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy virtually launched ‘Dharma Patham’, an initiative by the Endowments Department to revive ancient temple-centric culture on Monday. The idea is to give a push to the traditional art, culture, and medical and health programmes that used to be part of temples many years ago. Apart from organising cultural programmes at temples regularly, the department plans to conduct training camps in yoga and health. Training for EOs On the occasion, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy suggested that the officials take a cue from the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) and adopt best practices in the management of temples. “The development of temples depends upon the functioning of the executive officers. A training session on TTD management practices should be conducted for the EOs,” he said. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy wanted the officials to focus on providing all necessary facilities, quality prasadam etc. Donations given by philanthropists and donors should be used for development and betterment of temples. The donations should not be diverted. “A visit to temples and prasadams have to create a positive impact on devotees and give them a wonderful experience in their lives,” he said. Temple lands Referring to lands of temples, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy suggested that the officials conduct a survey and geotag them. A committee comprising the District Collector, SP and a government pleader in each district could be formed to protect temple lands. Similarly, a police officer of SP rank could be appointed in the Endowments Department for vigilance and security. There were 18,000 temples wherein 47,000 CC cameras were installed. CCTV cameras should be installed in all temples, he said. Endowments Minister Velampalli Srinivas Rao, Chief Commissioner of Land Administration Neerabh Kumar Prasad, Principal Secretary (Revenue, Endowments) G. Vani Mohan and TTD EO K.S. Jawahar Reddy were among those present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-launches-dharma-patham-at-kanaka-durga-temple/article36705343.ece

28 September 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP plans ‘Rythu Kosam’ protests in Krishna, Guntur||A strategy meeting of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) presided by its national president N. Chandrababu Naidu has resolved to organise ‘Rythu Kosam Telugu Desam’ protests in Krishna and Guntur districts on September 30 and agitate against the ‘betrayal of Rayalaseema farmers’ by the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, in Hindupur on October 6, alleging that the irrigation projects in the parched region were completely neglected. Mr. Naidu said the farm sector was mired in a deep crisis and blamed it on the policies of the State government, while pointing out that the YSRCP had facilitated the passage of the new farm laws in the Parliament by extending its support. He said the groundnut crop was damaged in 15 lakh acres in Rayalaseema, but the farmers got little support from the government. He alleged that the government imposed a burden of Rs. 36,000 crore on the people in various forms. The TDP leaders criticised DGP D. Gautam Sawang, accusing the latter of making misleading statements on the involvement of Vijayawada-based Aashi company in drug smuggling racket busted in Mundra port in Gujarat. “The DGP must tell whether it was not a fact that Aashi company had filed GST returns nine times up to June with its Vijayawada address and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence alerted the neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh about the drug smuggling,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-plans-rythu-kosam-protests-in-krishna-guntur/article36705819.ece

In this regard, the government had set up a committee which submitted a report on the situation. Based on the report, the government had given three options to those institutions, including to voluntarily withdraw from grant-in-aid benefits, and hand over the assets to the government or run them as private institutions. With this, of 133 degree colleges, 125 managements, almost 93%, had come forward to hand over their grant-in-aid status and assign staff to the government. Besides, five to seven institutions had agreed to give their assets to the government along with staff. Similarly, of 122 junior colleges, 103 were willing to give up their grant-in-aid status and five institutions had agreed to give their assets to the government along with staff.

Party workers, women and representatives of various people’s organisations participated in the rally.

Mr. Sai Kiran, an alumnus of Raghu College of Engineering, is working with a private construction company now. “I started to focus on the convergence and divergence, rainfall accumulation, wind patterns, cyclone forecast and tracking the movement of weather systems . I started with a WhatsApp group with friends and family members before switching to blogging about weather,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/weather-blogger-rises-to-the-occasion/article36705826.ece
28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Gates of twin reservoirs lifted||Four gates of the Osmansagar and one gate of the Himayatsagar reservoirs have been lifted to release flood water into the Musi River. A statement from the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board informed that two gates of Osmansagar reservoir were lifted on Monday, while two other gates had been lifted on September 23. All the four gates have been lifted by 1-2 feet to release 960 cusecs of water into the river. By lifting two gates of Himayatsagar by two feet, 700 cusecs of water will be let downstream, the statement informed. Officials have been kept on alert to evacuate people from the banks of Musi river as there is risk of inundation. HMWS&SB managing director M. Dana Kishore, during a review meeting on Monday, asked the officials to take precautionary measures to prevent untoward incidents during heavy rains. Localities with chronic sewage overflow issues should be identified and it should be ensured that there is no overflow, he said. A total of 16 emergency response teams have been deployed on the ground, with five members in each team, armed with necessary equipment. Mini jetting machines should be kept ready to clear obstructions. Manhole covers and safety grilles should be ensured on all manholes of considerable depth, and waterlogging points should be monitored. Waste from drainage works should be removed immediately, as also garbage from nala crossings. Caution boards should be set up near the manholes in areas prone to inundation, and sewerage supervisors should be stationed near deep manholes. Safety equipment is a must for the field workers, he said, and asked officials to ensure that drinking water is not polluted due to rain. Nodal officers have been appointed for effective coordination with the police and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, he said. Open manholes should be reported to the water board by calling 155313.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/gates-of-twin-reservoirs-lifted/article36705687.ece
28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre ignoring promises made to Telangana: KTR||Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao has criticised the Central government for ignoring the projects forwarded by Telangana and not implementing the assurances given in the State Reorganisation Act. The Minister took a dig at the Congress and the BJP leaders for indulging in “cheap politics” in their efforts to bring down the reputation of the State, which was ranked among the top contributors to the country’s economy. The Centre had not implemented the assurances given to Telangana like setting up of a railway coach factory, tribal university, steel factory at Bayyaram and the ITIR as promised in the State Reorganisation Act, he said. But the BJP promised rail coach factory in Maharashtra during the previous elections and the factory was set up within two years at Latur. The Telangana government proposed to develop five industrial corridors — Hyderabad-Nagpur, Hyderabad-Warangal, Hyderabad-Mumbai, Hyderabad-Bengaluru and Hyderabad-Vijayawada — but none of them had received approval so far. There was no response to the State’s request for extending Rs. 1,000 crore assistance for setting up Pharma City, the largest pharma cluster coming up at Mucherla on the city outskirts. The BJP, which promised 2 crore jobs a year, was instead rendering equal number of people jobless in the name of disinvestment. He was replying to the debate on “Progress of industries and IT sectors in the State” which came up as short discussion in the Assembly on Monday. Job notification He criticised the BJP leaders for their claims of conducting Million March if the government failed to issue job notifications. “There are 8.32 lakh vacant posts in the Central government. Why are you (the BJP leaders) not asking about that? The Centre is removing people from their jobs in the name of disinvestment and these leaders do not raise any questions,” he wondered. Mr. Rama Rao said the State on its part was making significant contribution to the country’s economy, which was evident from the RBI’s handbook of statistics. Telangana, which was 11th in the country in terms of area, was the fourth largest contributor to the economy after Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Karnataka, according to the RBI handbook. “The State’s contribution is acknowledged by the RBI, not by our government. Why are these leaders trying to hurt the image of the State as the most investor friendly?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-ignoring-promises-made-to-telangana-ktr/article36705703.ece
28 September 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Bad roads, waterlogging make traffic crawl in city||Traffic congestion was the order of the day on the city’s motorways as waterlogging, gutted roads and sand heaps reduced vehicular traffic to a crawl in several parts due to torrential rains. The arterial Purana Pul to Aramghar Road was one of the worst affected as flyover construction work is going on at multiple spots on the stretch. Movement of heavy duty vehicles has damaged the road. At Shastripuram near Mir Alam Tank, a traffic police official was seen guiding vehicles after a large pothole turned the road treacherous. A similar situation prevailed at Bahadurpura near the zoo with just gravel on the stretch and traffic police manning the junction. At RP Road, police had to step in to clear a sewage line which had led to waterlogging in the area. “Coming to college has become a big problem as the Falaknuma flyover has been closed for repair and other stretches have become bad due to rain and construction debris,” said Sharwani, a government college teacher. Some citizens took to social media to highlight the problem in their respective localities. “Bahadurpura main road area has become very dangerous. The road is completely damaged due to rain and the muck is up to one foot but no action. We are facing problems while riding vehicles,” wrote Venkatesh Dhotre tagging the Mayor and other top officials of the civic administration. The continuous rain with intermittent heavy showers due to the effect of Cyclone Gulab reduced visibility too. “Due to rain in the city, there may be waterlogging on the road which may cause traffic delays. So we request you to leave early towards your destinations and reach safely,” was the message sent out by Hyderabad City Police on social media platforms. In the evening rush hour, traffic in Lakdi-ka-Pul, Masab Tank, Banjara Hills, Panjagutta was gridlocked due to shrinking of carriageway near the Assembly due to the session, flooding near CM’s Camp Office and flooded approach ramp of Somajiguda flyover.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bad-roads-waterlogging-make-traffic-crawl-in-city/article36705692.ece
28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CM reviews rain situation||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday took stock of the situation in the State due to heavy rains, along with Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar. Mr Rao directed the CS to take all necessary precautions against any loss of life or property due to heavy rain across the State that is expected to continue for another two days due to the impact of Cyclone Gulab. The CM called for the Revenue, Police, and other departments to work in coordination. Meanwhile, Mr Somesh Kumar again held a teleconference with District Collectors and asked them to remain vigilant in the wake of warnings of heavy rains from the Meteorological Department. DGP M. Mahender Reddy, Special Chief Secretary, Roads and Buildings Sunil Sharma, Panchayati Raj Secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania and Disaster Management Secretary Rahul Bojja were also present at the conference. Mr. Somesh Kumar also made it clear that tough measures should be taken to prevent loss of life and property. If necessary, services of NDRF teams in Hyderabad, Kothagudem and Warangal should be utilised. He said that a separate control room should be set up in each Collectorate office and information should be provided to the control room set up at the Secretariat. The situation should be reviewed by appointing Special Officers at problematic areas such as inland areas, ponds, ditches and bridges, he said. Mr. Mahender Reddy said he has directed Police commissioners and SPs to work in coordination with the Collectors. A teleconference was held with police officers to this effect, he averred.

28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Infrastructure investments are capital expenditure’||Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao has asserted that the State government is incurring capital expenditure for improving infrastructure and improving productivity of the assets for future generations. “Investments on infrastructure should be looked at as capital expenditure, not debt. This is the investment for the future,” he said. Replying to a question during the Question Hour in the Assembly on Monday, Mr. Rama Rao dismissed the charges that State was being pushed into debt trap by the present dispensation. The boom in economic activity witnessed at present was because of the investment made in the infrastructure and value being created, he said. He said the government had decided to take a loan of Rs. 5,900 crore and an in principle agreement had been reached with the SBI which agreed to give term loan for meeting the targets set under the Strategic Road Development Programme. To a query, he said debt servicing for the proposed loan would be to the tune of Rs. 296 crore a year and the government took steps to ensure that the GHMC was not burdened on account of the loan. He asserted that the government had deployed new technologies for road development besides introducing transferable development rights that saved Rs. 3,000 crore to the GHMC. The State was the first to create TDR bank and the launch of SRDP and related works were follow up of brain storming with experts for over three years. In all, 22 works under SRDP had been completed with an estimated Rs. 1,946.9 crore and 24 works (21 by the GHMC and 3 by other departments) were under progress at a cost of Rs. 5,693.51 crore. The Minister said a detailed time schedule had been fixed for the completion of the works. Responding to a query by MIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi, he said works worth Rs. 1,545 crore had been taken up in Charminar zone and were under progress. Some of the works were delayed because of the agency, but they would be fast tracked in the coming days. Simultaneously, plans were being prepared for the second phase of the SRDP programme, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/infrastructure-investments-are-capital-expenditure/article36705701.ece
28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Asad for Dalit Bandhu-like scheme for Muslims||Hyderabad parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday quoted data on socio-economic conditions of Muslims in Telangana, put forward by academics, to buttress his demand for a roll-out of a Dalit Bandhu-like scheme for at least 1% of Muslims who are living in abject poverty. Mr Owaisi was speaking at a discussion on Muslims in Telangana – Poverty and Other Challenges , jointly organised by the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen and the Centre for Development Policy and Practice, where experts said that the number of Muslims living in abject poverty is increasing. The AIMIM president said that it is his opinion that the government should extend Rs. 10 lakh to 2% Muslims living in abject poverty – 18,000 households – in the State, and in case the financial burden is high, then at least 1% - translating into 9,000 households – be covered. “I promise you that our MLAs from Telangana will demand this (Rs. 10 lakh for Muslims) based on the data when a discussion, God willing, happens,” Mr Owaisi said, adding that the data presented during the discussion would be eye-opening, and counter stereotyping of the community. “Muslim appeasement never happened, and nobody will do it. We want to show them: this is the data, this is where we are weak, you do us justice,” he said. Mr Owaisi said that while the literacy rate of Muslims in Telangana is 77%, that of the State is 67%. The dropout rate increases as students from the community do not proceed towards higher education. This, he said, is due to the fact that Muslims did not have financial wherewithal. Development economist Prof Amir Ullah Khan from CDPP said that according to Prof Amitabh Kundu, new data indicates that discrimination against Muslims in the country has increased two-fold and post-COVID-19, the participation in the salaried workforce has halved. Prof Khan said that helping to create an asset for beneficiaries is the most efficient anti-poverty intervention. “If you give a Dalit household an asset or give ownership of something such as a small land parcel, a small house, this is a most efficient anti-poverty intervention. He can acquire an asset with Rs. 10 lakh. If you give this to 18,000 (Muslim) households, you will spend Rs. 1,800 crore, which is only 1.5% of the Telangana annual budget,” he said, adding that unspent funds allotted for minorities welfare over the past four years too could be used. Prof Abdul Shaban, former bureaucrat G Sudhir and Venkatnarayana Motukuri also spoke on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/asad-for-dalit-bandhu-like-scheme-for-muslims/article36705708.ece
28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Congress demands repeal of anti-ryot laws, cut in fuel prices||TPCC president and Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy criticised the double standards of TRS over the three controversial farm laws enacted by Centre citing the party’s opposition to them and, yet, not participating in the bandh on Monday. He cited the example of Minister K.T. Rama Rao saying the TRS party was against the laws and sought to know why TRS was not participating in the bandh, if the party was sincerely opposing them. On one hand, TRS was enacting the drama of rivalry with the BJP in Telangana, on the other, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was enjoying dinner with Mr. Modi in New Delhi. Speaking after his arrest near Uppal Bus Depot when he was participating in the Bharat Bandh, he said more than 400 farmers had lost their lives during the agitation against the farm laws for the last 10 months. He mentioned that the TRS leaders had participated in only one protest against the farm laws in Dec. 2020. Later, TRS had entered into a secret deal with BJP to suppress farmers’ agitation, he alleged. The implementation of controversial farm laws would lead to the creation of artificial scarcity of food grains and other products, he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-demands-repeal-of-anti-ryot-laws-cut-in-fuel-prices/article36705696.ece
28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Man murders wife over abortion, vigilantes assault youngster||A woman was throttled to death by her husband in Moosapet under Sanath Nagar police station limits on Sunday night for allegedly aborting their child. The victim, Manasa (24) from Darpally in Nizamabad district, married E. Gangadhar (32) from Jagadgirigutta on November 20 last year, after which the couple rented a house at Moosapet and led a happy life for two months. Later, Gangadhar started harassing her, following which she lodged a domestic violence case at Jagadgirigutta. However, the dispute was resolved by the elders and the couple started living together. Later, the harassment continued and Manasa went off to stay with her mother-in-law as Gangadhar’s father had recently died. “When he overheard family members saying that Manasa was pregnant, he brought her back to their rented house and asked about her health. Manasa told him about the abortion and Gangadhar lost his temper, throttling her to death,” police said. He then informed his brother about the offence, who in turn rushed to the spot and alerted police.  In another incident, a youngster was beaten up by vigilantes for travelling on a bike with a girl belonging to a different faith, at Golconda. Though the incident took place on September 24, it came to light only on Monday after the video of the mob attack went viral. According to Golconda police, the youngsters, both residents of Gajwel in Siddipet district, came to the city for shopping and were on the way to Golconda Fort, when a group of people noticed a religious cloth tied to the scooter on Toli Chowki road, and stopped the vehicle. They questioned the boy about the religious clothes, why he was travelling with the girl from their community and other details. Moral policing When the 25-year-old revealed his identity, the group forced the girl to get off the bike and then started attacking the youngster. In the video, the attackers were seen forcing the girl to call her family to ‘report’ the incident. The duo, who are childhood friends, were visiting the city without their respective families’ knowledge. Golconda police said based on the complaint lodged by the youngster, a post-graduate in organic chemistry, a case was registered and a painter identified as Mohammed Rafi was detained in connection with the attack. “Efforts are on to identify and arrest other attackers,” police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/man-murders-wife-over-abortion-vigilantes-assault-youngster/article36705690.ece
28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Heavy rains to lash TS for next couple of days||A deep depression, the remnant of Cyclone Gulab, over south Odisha and adjoining north Andhra Pradesh, is expected to move westwards and weaken into a depression over the next 12 hours which will lead to continuation of heavy rainfall for the next couple of days across Telangana. The India Meteorological Department has forecast heavy rains with thunderstorms and high winds at many places for the next few days. With regard to the twin cities, generally cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain has been forecast with day temperature likely to creep up to 28 degree C from 25 degree C recorded on Monday, a good seven degrees below normal. Night temperatures may dip slightly with 22 degree C, from 23.8 degree C. Telangana State Development Planning Society, in its forecast, stated that during the last 24 hours, highest rainfall of 118.8 mm recorded was at Kamepalle (Khammam), highest maximum temperature of 35.4 degree C recorded at Nagula Vancha (Khammam) and lowest minimum temperature of 21.8 degree C was recorded at Bantwaram (Vikarabad).

28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bandi to ensure paddy procurement by Centre||Telangana state BJP president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar said he will take the responsibility for the Centre to purchase the entire paddy produced by farmers and demanded Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao to apologise for trying to ‘mislead’ people about the procurement policy. “It is the Centre, which does procurement and Mr. Rao has no role except to be a middleman. He is unneccessarily scaring the farmers by asking them not to raise rice crop,” he told a public meeting as his ‘Praja Sangrama Yatra’ entered the 31st day in Rajanna-Sircilla district on Monday. Continuing his padayatra amid heavy rain, Mr. Sanjay Kumar focused his attack on Chief Minister and senior Minister K.T. Rama Rao and claimed that Dalit Bandhu scheme was but a mere copy of Modi government’s “Stand up India” to provide financial support to the tune of Rs. 1-5 crore for Dalits to become entrepreneurs. Mr. Rao has only cheated the Dalits with his unfulfilled promises by not making someone from the community the chief minister, not attending celebrations of Dr. Ambedkar birthday and so on. All the welfare and development schemes are funded by the Centre but the TS CM affixes his photos to pass them off as his own, he charged. “He is a Chief Minister who never comes out from his farmhouse to listen problems of people and mitigate their woes. Our party is always ready to help people whether in COVID, heavy rains or floods. BJP has never insulted any religion, but it will not tolerate if majority religion is insulted,” he said. His party was sure to form the government in TS when it will take action against Mr. Rama Rao holding him responsible for the suicide by many Intermediate students due to software glitches. He also urged the police not his harass party activists by foisting fake cases and accused some officers becoming ‘pawns in the hands of the ruling party’. The BJP leader had earlier threatened to take out a ‘million march’ in support of unemployed youth if the government failed to issue job notification by Deepavali. While 1.91 lakh government jobs are vacant, 25 lakh are unemployed as per the TS Public Service Commission data, he added.

Some other teachers of local languages like Lambadi and Koya were also teaching in tribal areas. She said the Women and Child Welfare Department had sent proposals to government to sanction an additional 870 Anganwadi centres in view of increase in population. The proposals were more for Hyderabad. As educationally qualified personnel were not available, she said the recruitment rules of Anganwadi staff had been relaxed in Agency areas to enrol locals. Proposals were also sent to enhance the remuneration of teachers at mini Anganwadi centres on par with regular teachers of the centres as the workload of the former had gone up due to increase in population. The notification for filling up vacancies at the centres was issued.

The traffic situation eased later in the day. Showing solidarity with the farmers, Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar visited the Ghazipur border and joined the protesters. Mr. Kumar said the farmers have been sitting on protest for the past 10 months but Prime Minister Narendra Modi, “who has time to visit the construction site of the Central Vista project, has no time to listen to their demands”. “Farmers are educated and they understand the long-term implications of the three anti-farm laws. In the long run, the laws will edge farmers out of the farming sector, with a select few corporate houses dictating terms to them,” Mr. Kumar said.He added that the governments of Prime Minister Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal were responsible for the massive traffic jams in the Capital, as they had “consistently refused to listen to the farmers’ demands”. “The farmers had no other option but to call an all-India bandh to awaken the sleeping governments,” he said. Traffic diversion The Delhi traffic police said they had closed both carriageways at Dhansa border, Chhatta Rail and Subhash Marg. Movement was also not allowed near the Red Fort. The Ghazipur border was closed for movement from both sides due to the protest and traffic was impacted on NH-9 and NH-24. “Commuters moving to and from Uttar Pradesh can use DND, Vikas Marg, Signature Bridge, Wazirabad road etc. Traffic on NH-24 and NH-9 has been diverted to Road Number 56 to take Maharajpur border, Apsara border and Bhopura borders for U.P.,” they said in a statement in the morning. Parag Jain, a chartered accountant working in a firm in Gurugram, said it took him nearly three hours to reach office where his attendance was mandatory on Monday. “The Delhi police had installed barricades at many points due to which I reached office in almost three hours. This is by far my worst experience ever while travelling to office,” he said. The protests also led to massive traffic snarls on the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway with the Delhi police erecting barricades to check the vehicles entering the national capital. The police allowed only two lanes for vehicles to pass through the barricades, causing bumper-to-bumper traffic extending for several hundred metres in the Millennium City. Several motorists took to Twitter to post the pictures of the snarl and expressed their anger and helplessness. While some described it as “insane”, others said “it was the mother of all traffic jams”. The Gurugram police said the traffic jam was caused due to the barricades placed by the Delhi police. There were no traffic-related updates on the Gurugram police’s Twitter handle. The traffic situation improved in the afternoon after the police removed the barricades and the Bharat Bandh drew to a close.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bandh-effect-chaos-on-city-roads-as-borders-closed-for-traffic/article36705596.ece
28 September 2021||New Delhi,||HC stays order directing Delhi govt. to deliver on ‘rent promise’||The Delhi High Court on Monday stayed its July 22 order directing the Delhi government to take a decision on whether to implement the promise made by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal last year in which he said his government will pay rent for those who are unable to do so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said irreparable loss would be caused to the Delhi government if an order of stay is not passed. “There is a prima facie case in favour of the appellant [Delhi government]. Balance of convenience is in favour of the appellant and irreparable loss shall be caused. We stay the operation, implementation and execution of the order of the single judge till the next date of hearing,” the Bench said while posting the case for further hearing on November 29. On July 22, the HC Bench of Justice Prathiba M. Singh had directed Mr. Kejriwal to live up to his promise made in a press conference last year. “The promise/assurance/representation given by the CM clearly amounts to an enforceable promise, the implementation of which ought to be considered by the government,” Justice Singh had ruled. Justice Singh had said the CM cannot first make a “clear and unequivocal oral assurance” and then fall silent when it comes to its implementation. The judge had directed the Delhi government to take a decision within six weeks whether to implement the promise made on March 29, 2020, bearing in mind the larger interest of the people. If a decision is made to implement the promise, the government should frame a clear policy, the court had said. In its appeal against Justice Singh’s order, the Delhi government claimed that, “no indiscriminate and unconditional assurance for payment of rent by the GNCTD during the lockdown was made by Mr. Kejriwal”. The government, represented by counsel Manish Vashisht, claimed that a “fervent appeal” was made by Mr. Kejriwal to the public at large not to coerce the tenants into paying rent. However, the same was “found to be a sort of a promise” by Justice Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-stays-order-directing-delhi-govt-to-deliver-on-rent-promise/article36705586.ece
28 September 2021||New Delhi,||Kejriwal launches tourism app||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched a Delhi tourism mobile app — Dekho Meri Dilli . This puts Delhi on the list of a select few cities of developed countries to have such an app, the CM said. The app was launched at the Delhi Secretariat on the occasion of World Tourism Day. From helping tourists learn about Delhi, its top destinations and its hidden gems to booking tickets to heritage monuments, the app will facilitate a range of services with a single click. Heritage walks Exclusive heritage walks can also be booked in addition to special food tours to the city’s top culinary hubs. It also provides information on all shopping destinations and city markets, accommodation, entertainment and leisure options. There are sections dedicated to Delhi For Kids, Delhi Delicacies, Food Tours and Health Walks. “This app will be extremely useful to people who come to Delhi from all over the world,” the CM said, adding that the app has a unique feature that allows one to browse through monuments, eating joints, entertainment and recreation sites within a 5-km radius of one’s location. Tourism is expected to get an enormous boost from the app, which will in turn benefit all sectors, including food and beverages, entertainment and hospitality, said Mr. Kejriwal. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the tourism portfolio, said the average tourist spends 1.5 days in Delhi.“We hope to increase this to 2.5 days. We wish to give tourists options and make their experiencebetter,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/kejriwal-launches-tourism-app/article36705592.ece
28 September 2021||New Delhi,||‘Filing PILs has become career in itself’||Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Monday said that filing of public interest litigations (PILs) has become an “industry and a career in itself”, while defending the Centre’s decision to appoint Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner. The Solicitor General, representing the Centre, argued that Mr. Asthana was appointed as Delhi Police chief after following the due procedure, as applicable to the national capital. Mr. Mehta said there was a plethora of Supreme Court judgments, which state that a PIL is not maintainable in service matters. The Solicitor General argued, “If an officer or officers feel that they were better suited for the post, nothing prevented them from espousing their own causes”. ‘Fulfil one’s desires’ “Some citizens of this country have a desire to run the administration. Not being capable of facing democratic election, and running the government, they fulfil their desire by filing such PILs asking questions such as why this appointment is made, why this decision is taken, how this policy is made,” Mr. Mehta said. During the hearing, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, representing Mr. Asthana, said the petitioner was “a proxy for somebody who does not want to come in the front” and holds “personal vendetta”. “People are always aggrieved if some peer or someone in the same service is selected. But here there is no [such] challenge. They are people who are educated, at the pinnacle of their career,” Mr. Rohatgi said. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh after hearing arguments from all the parties reserved its judgment on the plea challenging Mr. Asthana’s appointment.  Some citizens of this country, have a desire to run the administration.

The car intercepted Tinku’s vehicle after which two persons came out of it and started shooting at him. At least eight rounds were fired. A murder case has been registered and further probe is under way. The incident comes three days after gangster Jitender Mann was shot dead inside a courtroom.

28 September 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Desperate Afghan students trying to extend stay through admissions||Mohammad Sadiq Zarify, an M.Tech student in the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, keeps his fingers crossed for his admission into the Ph.D. programme in IIT-Delhi while Ibrahim Farough, a B.Tech student, prays for a formal letter from the Ministry of External Affairs for his smooth admission in the higher course. Though the admissions would mean academic advancement for these two students from Afghanistan, what is uppermost in their mind is that the admissions would help stretch a ‘dignified life’ for a couple of years more in India. Nine Afghanistan students are on the campus of the NIT-Rourkela to pursue engineering courses after they were granted scholarships by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). Scholarships of four of the nine students are said to have lapsed after the completion of their respective courses in the NIT. Scholarship stopped “We have run out of money as scholarship is stopped following completion of our courses. The NIT authorities have just allowed us to stay in hostels and access food. We don’t have a penny to spend even for a cup of tea outside campus. There is no way my parents can send me money for monthly expenses now,” said Mr. Zarify. Mr. Farough, who has completed B.Tech (civil), said as an international student neither he could get campus placement nor could he return home as international flight operations to Afghanistan are yet to resume. He pins all hopes on the M. Tech programme that would enable him to get monthly stipend. His brother, who is working in a juice making company, is the only earning member in the family and he has since lost job following the Taliban’s ascent to power. As a retrenched employee in the education department, Mr. Zarify’s father can part with a portion of his savings for his son’s immediate requirement. But Mr. Zarify rules out this possibility as the rest of the family has to survive on the little saving back in Kabul. He said his family does not have relatives in other countries where he can seek financial assistance. Four Afghanistan students said they have no money to spend for treatment if one of them falls ill. “We have contacted the ICCR officials intimating them about our distress. They told us to first take admission and show admission papers to become eligible for getting scholarship again. On the other hand, the NIT-Rourkela authorities said they cannot give them admission in automatic route. They need a formal request from the MEA,” Mr. Farough said narrating the problem. Sympathetic grounds When contacted, P.K. Das, NIT-Rourkela Registrar, said: “Passed out Afghanistan students have been allowed to stay in hostels on sympathetic grounds following crisis in their country. But the NIT cannot bear the expense without the government’s approval. We have informed the government about the visa status of all students.” “The passed out B.Tech students cannot be taken as M.Tech students through automatic route. A central admission process is going on. The NIT-Jaipur is conducting it. A lot of issues are involved in the process. Who is going to take care of scholarship and bear expenses? The government has to approve it,” said Prof. Das.  The NIT-Rourkela authorities said they cannot give them admission in automatic route. They need a formal request from the MEA Ibrahim Farough B.Tech student||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/desperate-afghan-students-trying-to-extend-stay-through-admissions/article36705762.ece

Terming these laws as anti-farmers and anti-food security, Mr. Channi said these laws are a potent threat to the livelihood of farmers and their future generations.

The weatherman said the cyclonic circulation lying off the coast of Myanmar is likely to move towards the West Bengal coast, leading to rain at many places in south Bengal on Monday and at most places on Tuesday and Wednesday. Kolkata is among the places likely to receive heavy rain.

28 September 2021||Herat,||Afghan entrepreneur says Taliban will not silence her||An Afghan business leader who employs hundreds of women on her saffron fields has vowed to speak up for the rights of her workers, and “not remain silent” under Taliban rule. The hardliners have increasingly excluded women from public life since sweeping to power in mid-August, pushing many women entrepreneurs to flee the country or go into hiding. “We will raise our voice so that it reaches their ears,” said Shafiqeh Attai, who started her saffron company in the western city of Herat in 2007. “No matter what happens we won’t just sit at home, because we have worked very hard.” Ms. Attai’s business, the Pashton Zarghon Saffron Women’s Company, produces, processes, packages and exports the world’s most expensive spice with an almost exclusively women workforce. More than 1,000 women pick the brightly coloured crocuses across the company’s 60 acres of land in the Pashton Zarghon district of Herat Province. “I worked hard to establish my business,” the 40-year-old said. “We don’t want to sit quietly and be ignored. Even if they ignore us, we will not remain silent.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghan-entrepreneur-says-taliban-will-not-silence-her/article36705172.ece

A volley of air strikes from the Saudi-led coalition targeted the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have stepped up their assault on the government’s last northern stronghold. Hundreds of fighters have died this month after the Houthis renewed their campaign for the capital city of oil-rich Marib province. “Fifty-eight Houthi insurgents and nine loyalists were killed in fighting and air strikes in the provinces of Marib and Shabwa in the past 24 hours,” military sources said, in figures that were confirmed by medical sources. The rebels rarely announce their casualties. According to the military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Saudi-led coalition launched more than 20 air strikes in the past 24 hours. “It targeted Houthi vehicles, meeting points and reinforcements in Shabwa and Marib,” they added. The Houthis initially escalated their efforts to seize Marib in February, hoping to seize control of the region’s oil resources and strengthen their position in peace negotiations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/more-than-60-killed-in-fierce-fighting-for-yemens-marib/article36705178.ece
28 September 2021||The Hague,||ICC prosecutor targets Taliban, IS-K in probe||The International Criminal Court’s new prosecutor sought on Monday to relaunch an investigation into Afghanistan, focusing on the Taliban and the Islamic State-Khorasan group while alleged U.S. crimes will take a back seat. Karim Khan, who took over in June, said the situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban’s takeover last month meant war crimes were no longer likely to be investigated properly. A lawyer for alleged victims of U.S. torture in Afghanistan said she was “stunned” after Mr. Khan announced he would “deprioritise” the investigation into American forces, a probe that has long enraged Washington. The ICC’s inquiry had been put on hold in 2020 after the now-deposed government in Kabul said it would try to investigate war crimes allegations itself. Mr. Khan said that the “current de facto control of Afghanistan by the Taliban, and its implications (including for law enforcement and judicial activity) represents a fundamental change in circumstances necessitating the present application.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/icc-prosecutor-targets-taliban-is-k-in-probe/article36705175.ece
28 September 2021||Taipei,||U.K. warship makes rare transit via Taiwan Strait||The Royal Navy said a British warship was sailing through the Taiwan Strait on Monday, a move that challenges Beijing’s claim to the sensitive waterway and marks a rare voyage by a non-U.S. military vessel. “After a busy period working with partners and allies in the East China Sea, we are now en route through the Taiwan Strait to visit Vietnam and the Vietnam People’s Navy,” read a tweet from the official account for HMS Richmond , a frigate deployed with Britain’s aircraft carrier strike group. Local media said it was the first time a British warship had transited through the narrow waterway separating Taiwan and mainland China. The British Navy survey ship HMS Enterprise transited through the strait in 2019. The U.K.’s Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. warships regularly conduct “freedom of navigation” exercises in the strait and trigger angry responses from Beijing, which claims Taiwan and surrounding waters — and almost all of the South China Sea. The U.S. and most other countries view those areas as international waters that should be open to all vessels. China’s initial response to the British warship’s passage was muted on Monday. “We hope the relevant countries can do more to build mutual trust between countries and uphold peace and security in the region,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. ‘Evil intentions’ Later, the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theatre Command said it has organised air and naval forces to follow the Richmond and warn it. “This kind of behaviour harbours evil intentions and damages peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” it said. “Theatre command forces always maintain a high level of alert and resolutely counter all threats and provocations.” Until recently, Washington was the main global power willing to sail through the Taiwan Strait. Military threats But a growing number of U.S. allies have transited the route as Beijing intensifies its military threats towards Taiwan and solidifies its control over the disputed South China Sea. Canadian, French and Australian warships have all made voyages through the Taiwan Strait in recent years, sparking protests from China. Taiwan’s Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng confirmed to reporters that a foreign vessel had sailed through the waterway but did not state which country it was from. Taiwan’s 23 million people live under constant threat of invasion by authoritarian China, which has vowed to seize the island one day — by force if necessary. Beijing has stepped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016, who views the island as “already independent”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-warship-makes-rare-transit-via-taiwan-strait/article36705180.ece
28 September 2021||Washington,||‘Biden aide to meet Saudi Crown Prince on Yemen’||President Joe Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is travelling to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the U.S. presses for a ceasefire in the years-long war between the kingdom and Houthi rebels in Yemen. Mr. Sullivan will be the highest-ranking Biden administration official to visit Saudi Arabia. Besides seeing the Crown Prince, Mr. Sullivan is expected to meet with Deputy Defence Minster Khalid bin Salman, a brother to the Crown Prince, according to two senior administration officials. The officials were not authorised to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Biden White House has largely steered clear of the Crown Prince since making public in February a CIA report that showed MBS likely approved the killing of Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in a 2018 operation at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. But the White House has resolved that bringing an end to perhaps the world’s most complex conflict needs engaging with the most senior Saudi officials face to face, an official said. National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said Mr. Sullivan would also visit the UAE, a Saudi ally in the war. The Saudis have drawn international criticism for airstrikes killing civilians and embargoes exacerbating hunger in a nation on the brink of famine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-aide-to-meet-saudi-crown-prince-on-yemen/article36705181.ece

28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The Quad could end up running out of steam||Coming on the eve of the first in-person Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) summit in Washington DC, the new Australia-U.K.-U.S. (AUKUS) trilateral security partnership appears to be sending a subtle message to the Quad: shape up or become irrelevant. The announcement of the AUKUS and the recent outcome of the Quad summit indicate that AUKUS will go on to form a key security arrangement of the Indo-Pacific region, thereby potentially forcing the Quad to recede to the background in a struggle for attention, political will, and resources. But before we get to the implications of AUKUS on the Quad, let us briefly examine how AUKUS is also useful to the Quad. A reassurance to allies Still reeling under intense international criticism in the way the United States withdrew its forces from Afghanistan resulting in a humanitarian disaster, AUKUS seeks to unambiguously signal U.S. President Joe Biden’s commitment to U.S. allies especially in the Indo-Pacific. In some ways, AUKUS helps reassure its allies of the U.S.’s security commitments and underlines Washington’s pivot to the Indo-Pacific. Second, the deal and particularly the sharing of American nuclear submarine technology with Australia will help Canberra overcome past hesitations about taking on China with more conviction. Third, notwithstanding the point that AUKUS may set alarm bells ringing for the Quad, AUKUS is still a shot in the arm for the larger Indo-Pacific agenda of which India, the U.S., Japan, Australia, among others, are key partners. In other words, AUKUS will help the Quad’s declared aim of keeping the Indo-Pacific region free, open and inclusive thereby contributing to its core agenda. No replacement, but... AUKUS may not replace the Quad and yet it appears that AUKUS has ventured where the Quad has been reluctant to make forays into — the military domain. More so, AUKUS also exposes the inherent, also self-imposed, limits of the Quad, i.e., its inability and lack of desire to give itself any military role. The focus of the recently-held Washington summit, on challenges ranging from COVID-19 to climate shows that the Quad is unlikely to take a security-dominated turn; that is precisely the vacuum AUKUS seeks to fill. The larger question then is whether the Quad is losing its steam. For sure, the Quad seems to offer no clear purpose which, as a result, leads to too many items crowding the agenda. It neither has a secretariat or a charter, like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), nor a clear set of activities such as AUKUS. The ever-growing list of focal areas of the Quad will eventually make it a less than useful deliberative forum. Put differently, with too many items on its agenda, the Quad faces the danger of becoming a talk shop with very little actual work. What is ironic is that all the Quad members have security/military considerations in mind vis-à-vis China while engaging the Quad platform, but no one seems to be keen on framing it in such a manner, as is evidenced by the summit’s joint statement (North Korea and Myanmar find mention in the statement though, not China). There is little interest in properly institutionalising the Quad nor has the objective for ‘Quad Plus’ been purposefully pursued. Let me put this somewhat differently: Indo-Pacific remains a grand strategic vision, AUKUS has the potential to become a major military/security arrangement in the Indo-Pacific, and the Quad/Quad Plus could end up becoming a talk shop within the Indo-Pacific. New Delhi’s hesitations New Delhi has taken the stand that “there is no link between the AUKUS and the Quad” just as it had argued earlier that there is no link between the Malabar naval exercises and the Quad even though the Quad membership is replicated in the Malabar exercises and two-thirds of the AUKUS form 50% of the Quad. Technically, New Delhi’s stand is accurate — just because there is a striking similarity in the membership of these forums, they are not the same institutional architecture. And yet, if one were to go beyond such technicalities, it is evident that these groupings share a larger vision about the Indo-Pacific, i.e., addressing the challenge from China, and the desire for an open and free Indo-Pacific. Be it AUKUS, which enables Australia to stand up to Chinese bullying or provides the United Kingdom — its aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth , the flagship of the U.K.’s Carrier Strike Group, is in the region — with a more prominent, and desirable, role in the Indo-Pacific or the annual Malabar exercises which focus on the Indo-Pacific or the Quad, their common geopolitical theatre is the Indo-Pacific. So while they are not technically related to each other, there is a broader reality that unites them all. There is no point in refusing to accept that self-evident reality. There is also little doubt today that the Indo-Pacific is of great importance to India for a number of reasons. For one, given the continental challenges it faces including from the new developments in Afghanistan, New Delhi would do well to shift some attention to the maritime sphere. Second, at a time when India is continentally pressed against a rock and a hard place, an opportunity has presented itself for India — in the form of growing global interest in the Indo-Pacific — to be at the centre of a new geopolitical churning which it must make use of for its own security and prosperity. Third, it is also a major way of bringing together like-minded states to check Chinese hegemony in the region. Given this context, if AUKUS potentially overshadows the enthusiasm around the Quad, it would be disadvantageous to India’s interests in the Indo-Pacific region. Other Quad counties are either on the AUKUS or are alliance partners; India is neither. Eventually, therefore, the Quad faces the potential challenge of becoming a talking shop without an actionable mandate. More so, bereft of any defence arrangement, the material returns from the Quad over time would also be minimal. Indo-Pacific engagement This situation is made worse by India’s hesitation about joining major regional economic frameworks. India, for instance, is neither a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership nor can its trade relations with the Indo-Pacific countries rival those of China. So, given our rather weak economic influence and performance in the Indo-Pacific region, what might help the country is being part of a security arrangement which can take care of its regional defence/security concerns. Even before AUKUS, India’s current engagement of the Indo-Pacific was neither capable of contributing to its national security nor promoting its economic influence in the region. And now, AUKUS may have further shrunk the potential space available for the Quad, and India, to play a serious role in the region’s security architecture. Sources of India’s hesitations Even though it is not just New Delhi which is hesitant about the Quad venturing into the security/military domain, India has been hesitant about the Quad moving beyond the non-military issues. So, what are the sources of New Delhi’s hesitation regarding a robust role for the Quad in the security/military domain? One could advance two hypotheses in this regard. One, India’s traditional reluctance about military alliances and the desire to maintain strategic autonomy. New Delhi fears that militarising the Quad could undo this jealously guarded tradition. It is, however, possible to explore military utility for the Quad without making it a formal military alliance. More so, exploring mutually beneficial military and security cooperation within the Quad framework need not contradict the principles of strategic autonomy. The operative part of ‘strategic autonomy’ is autonomy, not strategic. The second hypothesis has to do with domestic political considerations: The Narendra Modi government is keen to avoid any military overtones for the Quad due to potential Chinese reactions to it. Recall how India and Australia had for many years soft-peddled the forum for fear of provoking China. Australia seems to have overcome its hesitation, but has India done so? For the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, any heat on the Line of Actual Control with China in the run-up to crucial State elections next year and then the 2024 parliamentary election would be unwelcome. This seems, therefore, to be a case of domestic political considerations trumping the pursuit of strategic necessities.

28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Leave that crown in the garage’||In November 2009, the CEO of PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi, found herself standing between U.S. President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. Mr. Obama began the introductions. When he got to her, Dr. Singh exclaimed, “Oh! But she is one of us!” Without missing a beat Mr. Obama responded, “Ah, but she is one of us, too!” In her new book, My Life in Full: Work, Family, and our Future, Ms. Nooyi says she belongs in both worlds. She writes: “I am still the girl who grew up in a close family in Madras... I am also the woman who arrived in the U.S. at age twenty-three to study and work, and somehow, rose to lead an iconic company, a journey that I believe is possible only in America.” An excerpt from the book:  The phone rang again. This time, it was a recruiter asking if I’d interview for the position of senior vice president of corporate strategy and planning at PepsiCo, the beverage, snack, and restaurant company. The role included overseeing fifty high-potential executives, new hires who came into the planning department for eighteen months or so and were then rolled into management jobs throughout the company. Mentoring and training were to be a big part of the job. I thought twice about going into a consumer business. Much as I knew I could learn anything, after eight years at Motorola and ABB, I was steeped in engineering, technology, and massive infrastructure projects. When I heard that PepsiCo also owned KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, I wondered if the job was really for me. I don’t eat meat. How could I relate to these restaurants? Shortly, both GE and PepsiCo were pressing me with attractive job offers. I was weighing my options with Raj [Nooyi] and my friend Orit Gadiesh, the chairman of Bain and Company, as my sounding boards. Preetha and Tara were rooting for PepsiCo after we received a large gift basket of goodies and T-shirts. Ronnie Miller Hasday, the head of corporate hiring, knew exactly how to capture the family’s interest. An outsider I pulled up to PepsiCo to begin my new job on March 30, 1994. White American men held fifteen of the top fifteen jobs at PepsiCo when I walked in. Almost all wore blue or grey suits with white shirts and silk ties and had short hair or no hair. They drank Pepsi, mixed drinks, and liqueurs. Most of them golfed, fished, played tennis, hiked and jogged. Some hunted for quail together. Many were married with children. I don’t believe any of their wives worked in paid jobs outside their homes. I am not detailing these characteristics to focus on these particular men. My colleagues were smart, creative, dedicated people and shouldered tremendous responsibility and stress. They built a beloved enterprise. The fact is that PepsiCo’s leadership mirrored almost every senior-executive suite in corporate America in 1994. Even the most accomplished women were still milling around in middle management. The number of female CEOs among the five hundred biggest companies that year was zero. On the CEO floor of PepsiCo when I arrived, no one was expected to be a deeply engaged parent, let alone a great mother and wife. Dealing with teachers, doctors, dentists, groceries, clothing, cooking, cleaning, laundry, home décor, gardening, houseguests, birthdays, holidays, and vacations was just not their area. Maybe they were engaged – just a bit – in the emotional health, academic success, and general good behaviour of their children. Even if they were interested in any of these things, these guys just didn’t have time. Importantly, the men I worked with didn’t judge one another on how their work and family lives came together. They were plenty competitive but also caring and supportive of one another through crises, including divorce, illness, or troubles with their kids. None of this crossed my mind when I met them. I was well aware that I was an outsider: I was still the eighteen-year-old girl at IIM Calcutta; the Indian immigrant in the polyester suit at Yale; the vegetarian, expectant mother in La Crosse, Wisconsin. At BCG, I had been inside many industries, but I’d never encountered a female client. From 1994 to 1999, I worked and worked and worked. Whatever toll my work life took on my role at home, I still had the lifeboat of Raj. He was now a partner at a consulting firm, working and travelling like crazy, yet a steady source of support. We also had a housekeeper, who drove and cooked for us, and a nanny, and they kept the house running and the children safe. My mother was spending more time with my sister’s and brother’s families in New York in these years, although she was always available to step in to help when needed. Raj’s parents also helped out whenever we asked them to. Preetha missed me a lot in these years. She was an adolescent, and much of what she saw was a busy, stressed-out mother. I was loving and present during difficult times but not really there day-to-day. Her angst was expressed by verbal outbursts, and I struggled to cope with them. Tara was a calmer, quieter child, who once wrote me a note, which I still keep in my desk drawer, that lays bare the emotions of these years. On a big sheet of construction paper, decorated with flowers and butterflies, she begs me to come home. “I will love you again if you would please come home,” the note says. In her sweet, crooked printing, the word please is spelled out seven times. ‘The news can wait…’ I was in my office late on Friday on December 1 [2000], when Steve [Reinemund, then CEO of PepsiCo] called me from Dallas to share the news that I would be named president of PepsiCo and join the board. I was over the moon. I packed up at work immediately. I drove home. It was about 10 p.m., and the wintery roads were peaceful and dark. I entered our house through the kitchen door and dropped my keys and bag on the counter. I was bursting with excitement – so eager to tell everyone. Then my mother appeared. “I have the most incredible news!” I exclaimed. “The news can wait,” she said. “I need you to go out and get milk.” I picked up my keys, went back to the car, drove to the Stop & Shop a mile away, and bought a gallon of whole milk. When I walked into the kitchen again, I was hopping mad. I slammed the plastic bottle on the counter. “I’ve just become president of PepsiCo, and you couldn’t just stop and listen to my news,” I said loudly. “Listen to me,” my mother replied. “You may be the president or whatever of PepsiCo, but when you come home, you are a wife and a mother and a daughter. Nobody can take your place. So you leave that crown in the garage.” Excerpted with permission from Hachette India||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/leave-that-crown-in-the-garage/article36705169.ece
28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The curious case of the Punjab Congress||The installation of Charanjit Singh Channi as the new Chief Minister of Punjab may be viewed as an important landmark in the State’s political history in terms of the politics of ‘presence’. Mr. Channi is the first Chief Minister from the Dalit community in the political history of Punjab, going back to its pre-Partition days when governments were formed after the 1937 and 1946 provincial elections. Even the key portfolios in successive governments never went to the community in the past despite it constituting one-third of the population in Punjabi Suba, since its reorganisation in 1966. It is the Jatt Sikh community that consistently got disproportionate representation in successive Assemblies and in the governments. Giani Zail Singh, a Sikh OBC, was the lone exception, as the Chief Minister of the State (later the President of India). Jatt Sikhs qualify as the ‘dominant caste’, going by the noted sociologist M.N. Srinivas (1972) formulation, as they are numerically strong, land-owning and not very low (middling) in the caste hierarchy. The change is a major gamble Considering the extremely narrow social basis of political power in the State, it is obvious that the Congress high command, a euphemism for the Gandhi family, has taken a gamble, even if done reluctantly, by anointing a non-Jatt Sikh, and from a Dalit community. Landless Dalits, being farming labourers in rural Punjab, have historically shared an uneasy relationship with Jatt Sikhs. The high command has also made a gamble by indicating that it wants Navjot Singh Sidhu, a late entrant to the party, as the face of the Assembly election campaign as clearly indicated by Harish Rawat, the Congress party’s Punjab affairs-in charge. Though it was denied later after protests, the position of the Chief Minister has already come under cloud. Mr. Sidhu being the first choice of the high command in case of an electoral win, is making it obvious in the way he has been allowed to play the role of king-maker. He has reportedly vetoed the chief ministerial chances of Sunil Jakhar and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and is currently influencing key administrative decisions. His loyalists such as Pargat Singh have been included in the Channi cabinet. If the high command actually takes such a drastic step, it is going to be in a spot facing another round of dissidence from Sidhu detractors within the party. The party shall also lose the Dalit community support base in the State and elsewhere also. The third gamble the party high command has taken is by abruptly replacing a long-term powerful Chief Minister (Captain Amarinder Singh), less than three months before the election code of conduct comes into effect. This is probably for the first time in the history of the Grand Old Party that the high command has moved so recklessly; there was no such development even during the Indira Gandhi-Rajiv Gandhi era. There are not many parallels in other parties except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) replacing Sahib Singh Verma with Sushma Swaraj just before the 1998 Assembly elections in Delhi, which did not work. ‘Social balancing’ is a risk The ‘historic’ appointment of Mr. Channi is being hailed as a ‘master stroke’/‘game-changer’. The running argument is that purported ‘social balancing’ would fetch electoral dividends for the incumbent party as the ‘Channi factor’ would consolidate and galvanise the Dalit community. However, the community has historically been divided along regional, religious, linguistic and caste lines. Scheduled Castes as in other States have never voted en bloc for any party if one is to go by surveys by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies and a field-based study by Kanchan Chandra (2004). In fact, the Congress should instead be wary of a brewing counter-mobilisation among the Jatt Sikh community which may be sensing a loss of power and blaming it on the internecine war among its power-hungry community leaders such as Mr. Sidhu. A ‘humiliated’ Captain, a royal from a former Sikh princely State and a senior Jatt leader with a five-decades long career, is most likely to accentuate this sense of loss. Capt. Amarinder has enjoyed considerable support among his fellow community due to his bold stands vis-à-vis the Centre on panthic issues, by getting the Punjab Termination of Water Agreements Bill passed as the Chief Minister in 2004 that resulted in the annulment of the pact entered into by the State in 1981 on the sharing of Ravi and Beas river waters with Haryana and Rajasthan and, more recently, on the contentious farm laws issue. Whether a rebellious captain would try to damage the Congress’s prospect by forming a regional outfit or joining another party is another issue. Unfulfilled promises It is questionable whether removal of Capt. Amarinder would be sufficient to address the anti-incumbency factor. After all, it was not only about the leadership of Capt. Amarinder, however unpopular he might have become of late — as being projected by citing surveys. It has mainly been due to the non-fulfilment of the promises made by the party in 2017, after it won, about creating new jobs, bringing industries back, rejuvenating the farming sector and improving the power sector that made party legislators and workers restless and wary of facing voters. Capt. Amarinder may be held culpable in the public eye for his inability to show urgency in acting against those responsible for sacrilege and the subsequent police actions (the incidents relate to the desecration of a religious text and subsequent police firing that took place at Faridkot in 2015). However, greater failures such as bringing an end to the drug menace and flourishing land, sand and transport mafias may not be viewed as Capt. Amarinder’s sole responsibility As Aam Aadmi Party leaders have been alleging, it is not only Akali Dal leaders but also many Congress leaders who have been under scrutiny for being complicit in wrong-doings. A lot to mind ahead With ‘operation Captain’ over, the onus now is on incumbent Mr. Sidhu and fellow rebel Jatt Sikh leaders — most of them are influential only in one region — to not only secure their community vote but also those from other communities and the other electoral regions. The direct and visible role played by the Gandhi siblings (Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) means that they have to take greater responsibility in keeping dissidence in check and ensuring the party’s success. A tall order for them. Already, the ‘revelation’ by loyalist Ambika Soni that a non-Sikh should not be appointed as a Chief Minister in the Punjabi Suba, reportedly to deny space to senior leader Sunil Jakhar, has brought back the contentious Hindu-Sikh question that might be to the electoral advantage of the beleaguered BJP. Finally, the Channi cabinet, with six first-time Ministers, would need the whole-hearted support of the State’s higher bureaucracy, undergoing large-scale transfers at the moment, to fulfil at least some of the unfulfilled promises. The higher bureaucracy may not be too willing to cooperate fully as elections are round the corner and with the Centre watching things intently. The paucity of time, the empty treasury and high indebtedness are also going to be huge challenges.

28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Measuring regional diversity||The National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF) is a methodology adopted by the Ministry of Education to rank higher educational institutions in India. On September 9, the Education Minister released the sixth edition of the NIRF rankings. The NIRF formulates the ranking on the basis of five parameters. Each of these has one to five sub-parameters. This article discusses one of the sub-parameters (Region Diversity) of the parameter named Outreach and Inclusivity. Problematic formula The NIRF calculates regional diversity inaccurately because it takes into account only the percentage of students enrolled from other States and countries at that particular institution. The formula that it applies is this: RD = 25 × fraction of total students enrolled from other States + 5 × fraction of students enrolled from other countries. This formula calculates the regional diversity of States not on the basis of State-wise representation by students at the institution, but on the basis of the percentage of total students enrolled from all States except the State the institution is located in. This is problematic. Let’s say that there are 100 students in total at an institution in New Delhi of whom 99 belong to Uttar Pradesh. The formula will show that the institution is extremely diverse because 99% of the students are from ‘other’ State(s), which is misleading. To improve accuracy, the NIRF should ask two questions. One, from how many States have students come to study at the institution? The answer to this will give us what we can term as horizontal regional diversity. Here, we take a bird’s-eye view of the geographical area of India and then we count the States represented by one or more students studying (or enrolled) at the institution. However, this alone will not help comprehensively assess regional diversity. Even if all 29 States are represented at the institution, we won’t know how many students are from towns and villages, how many are from non-metropolitan big cities, and how many are from metropolitan cities. Horizontal regional diversity can be more comprehensively assessed by asking a second question: what is the size of the hometown of the students? This can be termed as vertical regional diversity. Its calculation will show us how many students have come from Tier I, Tier II, Tier III cities and towns, and villages from within each State. Comparing two institutions For a clearer understanding of horizontal and vertical diversity, let us compare the demographic data of the Faculty of Law, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, and of the National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru. Under ‘Region Diversity’ in the NIRF rankings, Jamia scored 17.75 out of 30 and NLSIU scored 27.04. At Jamia, there were students from 15 States. Of them, 76% came from U.P. (44.7%), Delhi (16.1%) and Bihar (15.25%). No student came from Arunachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu or Telangana. Only 1.4% of the students were from south India (comprising five States, Puducherry and Lakshadweep). Clearly, horizontal regional diversity is weak. On the other hand, Jamia’s performance on vertical regional representation is impressive because 43% of the students came from small cities, towns, and villages, though only from 15 States. At NLSIU, only 18% of the students came from small cities, towns, and villages. The institution is primarily accessible to students from metropolitan and non-metropolitan big cities, though the students came from 24 States. Thus, it performs well on the horizontal front but weakly on the vertical. How does the NIRF intend to calculate such diverse regional diversities? Even if the concept of vertical and horizontal diversity is incorporated into the parameter, the NIRF cannot brush under the carpet the methodological challenge of determining what place (city, town, village) a student comes from — should it be the place at which the student was born, the place of current residence, the place where high school was completed, or the place at which the student’s father/mother was born? The NIRF rankings make the positional goods the institutions have to offer more transparent to students, parents, funders, and the government. Incidentally, on the basis of the five parameters, the ranking creates a transparent hierarchy of higher educational institutions in India. The least we can therefore ask for is more accurate parameters. The policy questions above must be answered by the NIRF. This article intends to only evoke scholarly scepticism about the accuracy of regional diversity, as calculated by the NIRF. And ideally, it should also lead readers towards asking how other parameters can be made more accurate.

28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Revitalising PM-KUSUM||The Union Minister of Power, New and Renewable Energy recently reviewed the progress of the PM-KUSUM scheme and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to accelerating solar pump adoption. Launched in 2019, PM-KUSUM aims to help farmers access reliable day-time solar power for irrigation, reduce power subsidies, and decarbonise agriculture. But pandemic-induced disruptions, limited buy-in from States, and implementation challenges have all affected the scheme’s roll-out. How can we unlock the opportunities it promises? Barriers to uptake PM-KUSUM provides farmers with incentives to install solar power pumps and plants in their fields. They can use one of three deployment models: off-grid solar pumps, solarised agricultural feeders, or grid-connected pumps. Off-grid pumps have been the most popular, but the nearly 2,80,000 systems deployed fall far short of the scheme’s target of two million by 2022. Barriers to adoption include limited awareness about solar pumps and farmers’ inability to pay their upfront contribution. Progress on the other two models has been rather poor due to regulatory, financial, operational and technical challenges. Only a handful of States have initiated tenders or commissioned projects for solar feeders or grid-connected pumps, according to our study. Yet, both models are worth scaling up for they allow farmers to earn additional income by selling solar power to discoms, and discoms to procure cheap power close to centres of consumption. We propose five steps for tackling the myriad challenges linked to PM-KUSUM’s implementation. First, extend the scheme’s timelines. Most Indian discoms have a surplus of contracted generation capacity and are wary of procuring more power in the short term. Extending PM-KUSUM’s timelines beyond 2022 would allow discoms to align the scheme with their power purchase planning. Second, create a level playing field for distributed solar plants. Selling surplus power to discoms is one of the main attractions of grid-connected models. Yet, discoms often find utility-scale solar cheaper than distributed solar (under the scheme) due to the latter’s higher costs and the loss of locational advantage due to waived inter-State transmission system (ISTS) charges. To tackle the bias against distributed solar, we need to address counter-party risks and grid-unavailability risks at distribution substations, standardise tariff determination to reflect the higher costs of distributed power plants, and do away with the waiver of ISTS charges for solar plants. Third, streamline land regulations through inter-departmental coordination. Doing so will help reduce delays in leasing or converting agricultural lands for non-agricultural purposes such as solar power generation. Fourth, support innovative solutions for financing farmers’ contributions. Many farmers struggle to pay 30-40% of upfront costs in compliance with scheme requirements. Further, they cannot access bank loans without collateral. We need out-of-the-box solutions like Karnataka’s pilot of a farmer-developer special-purpose vehicle to help farmers install solar power plants on their farms. Fifth, extensively pilot grid-connected solar pumps. Current obstacles to their adoption include concerns about their economic viability in the presence of high farm subsidies and farmers’ potential unwillingness to feed in surplus power when selling water or irrigating extra land are more attractive prospects. Further, the grid-connected model requires pumps to be metered and billed for accounting purposes but suffers from a lack of trust between farmers and discoms. Adopting solutions like smart meters and smart transformers and engaging with farmers can build trust. But piloting the model under different agro-economic contexts will be critical to developing a strategy to scale it up.The scheme, if implemented successfully, can generate thousands of jobs, reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture, and result in oil import savings.

28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Words and deeds||For the third consecutive year in a row, and his fourth such speech since he was elected in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the UN General Assembly, outlining his outlook on India’s place in the world. Referring to India’s large population, he said that the world grows when India grows, and transforms when India reforms, pointing to examples of the country’s progress and impact: in the area of vaccines and pharmaceuticals, particularly to counter COVID, green technology and the promise of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, and poverty alleviation. He also enumerated how many Indians had been provided water connections, banking access, insurance coverage, health services and homes, although his claim that these “all-inclusive” development goals had been achieved only in the “last seven years”, struck a politically partisan note that was out of place. Moving to regional matters, Mr. Modi pointed to the contrast between India’s actions and those of Pakistan and China in veiled references. In an apparent message to Pakistan, he linked events in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have taken control, to the problem of “regressive thinking” that leads to the use of terrorism as “a political tool”. He also called for safeguarding the maritime sphere from the “race of expansion and exclusion” and referred to the need for investigating the “origins of the coronavirus”, subjects China is sensitive about. Addressing the UN directly for its own shortcomings, the PM said that time waits for no one, urging the UN to speed up the reforms process that has been flagging for more than a decade, which would include an expanded Security Council. This, he explained, is the only way to restore the credibility of global governance institutions. Mr. Modi’s strongest words came at the beginning of his speech, where he launched a defence of the state of Indian democracy, which has come in for some criticism over the past few years. He said India had been named the “mother of democracy” for its adherence to democratic values, symbolised by its diversity, pluralism, inclusivity, and equality, that allowed someone like him, who had once worked at his father’s tea stall, to become the country’s leader. The PM’s words appeared to be a response to comments made during his Washington visit, where U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris stressed the need to strengthen democratic processes internally. Even as he addressed the UN, protesters outside criticised his government for actions against activists, NGOs, the laws on agriculture and citizenship, and incidents of lynching and mob violence. While the PM’s commitment to India’s “great tradition of democracy” was heartening, it will be measured not by words at the world body, but by answers and actions on the ground in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/words-and-deeds/article36705155.ece
28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||High water||Tropical cyclones laden with moisture and accumulated energy pose a growing challenge, as they have the propensity to inflict heavy damage to lives and property. As the annual monsoon retreats, thousands are left assessing the impact of cyclone Gulab, a rare event for September, on coastal Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and other areas inland. This weather system, with a gusting wind speed of 70 knots at landfall, appears to have been less intimidating than cyclones Yaas and Tauktae, although it continued to keep the seas unsafe for fishermen all along the coastline north of Andhra Pradesh, after moving overland. There have been some distressing deaths and inevitable material losses for many, and the focus must now be on relief and rehabilitation; in the recovery phase of COVID-19, the weather system has upended life for many, disrupting key inter-State road links and leading to the cancellation or diversion of several trains. The imperative is to reach out to those affected by Gulab with food, shelter and health-care support, deploying the many administrative capabilities acquired during the pandemic with the same alacrity. The welcome concern for public health and economic security must lead to stronger institutional responses to natural disasters too. The northern Indian Ocean, of which the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are a part, experiences only a minority of tropical storms annually, at about 7% of worldwide events, but their destructive impact on the subcontinent is severe due to a dense population and poor capacity to absorb large quantities of rainfall dumped in a short period over cities and towns. Financial arrangements to insure the population against material losses also remain weak, and as the experience in West Bengal with cyclone Amphan demonstrated last year, relief measures can easily fall victim to corruption. The influence of climate change on cyclone characteristics in a world that is heating up due to accumulation of greenhouse gases is an ongoing topic of study. The IPCC, in its scientific report on 1.5° C warming, said with a high degree of confidence that changes in the climate system, including the proportion of tropical cyclones, would experience a larger impact from increasing warming. Research evidence shows more cyclones forming over the Arabian Sea when compared to the Bay; overall there were eight storms of concern to India in 2019, and five last year, Amphan being a super cyclone.

28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||An Emperor’s Odyssey||Tokyo: Emperor Hirohito set a history-shattering precedent on Monday when he and the Empress left Japan for a whirlwind European tour which will take them to seven countries. Never before in the long centuries that the Emperors have ruled over this country has a reigning monarch left the shores of Japan on a foreign tour for any purpose whatsoever. Till the end of the last war, the Emperors were regarded as living gods — the Imperial Family was popularly believed to have descended directly from the Sun-Goddess, Amaterasu Omikami — and it was unthinkable that such a divine personage should condescend to visit other lands ruled by mere mortals. For Hirohito, this is actually the second time he has left the shores of his country. Just 50 years ago, in 1921, when Europe was still struggling to recover from the ravages of World War 1, Hirohito, then barely 20, was sent out in his capacity as the Crown Prince on a visit to several countries in Western Europe. For the Empress, however, this will indeed be a voyage full of thrills and discoveries for she has never left Japan before. If it is a voyage of discovery for the Empress, it is going to be a journey of re-discovery for the Emperor, for present-day Europe will have little resemblance to the Europe which he saw half a century ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/an-emperors-odyssey/article36705163.ece
28 September 2021||New Delhi,||ICRA raises FY22 growth estimate to 9%||Rating agency ICRA has bumped up GDP growth forecast for 2021-22 to 9% from 8.5%, citing better prospects for the second half of the year due to a ramp-up in COVID-19 vaccination and healthy Kharif estimates. A potential third wave, and whether existing vaccines can protect against new variants that might emerge, remain key risks, ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said. ICRA expects higher government spending to boost growth in the second half of the year, in contrast to the first quarter when government consumption expenditure had trailed last year’s levels. On the vaccination drive, ICRA estimates almost three-fourths of Indian adults could receive their second COVID-19 vaccine shot by the end of 2021, if the average of 7.9 million daily doses between September 1 and 26, can be sustained. This should help boost demand for contact-intensive services in the fourth quarter, although some services such as business travel may revert to pre-Covid levels with a longer lag, the agency pointed out. Ms. Nayar said increasing vaccine coverage would boost confidence and re-energise demand for contact-intensive services, thus helping revive parts of the economy worst affected by the pandemic. While industrial trends remained lacklustre in September, indicated by a flattening out of GST e-way bills, and dampened electricity demand due to heavy rains, ICRA noted this was also likely to distort trends in mining and construction. Agriculture, though, is expected to do better than anticipated. “Late sowing has helped bring Kharif acreage nearly at par with last year’s record area. The first Advance Estimates of crop production signal a robust rise in Kharif output, barring coarse cereals and oilseeds, quelling concerns raised by the uneven monsoon and episodes of flooding,”  she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/icra-raises-fy22-growth-estimate-to-9/article36705152.ece

28 September 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Attrition in IT sector to cross 1 million this year’||The IT sector is set to witness attrition of more than 1.15 million this fiscal according to Xpheno, a specialist staffing firm. “With an average of 23% attrition projected on a talent base of 5 million, the sector is set to witness over 1 million talent movements this year,” said Kamal Karanth, co-founder, Xpheno. Overall attrition in the sector has not changed in the last four years, but its status shifted from ‘highly involuntary’ until a year earlier to ‘highly voluntary’ in the current fiscal. “Attrition rates for FY20 and FY21 and expected levels for FY22 are largely the same. The difference is the shift from involuntary to voluntary attrition. The onset of the pandemic triggered a wave of involuntary attrition with enterprises cutting down on flab in response to the market lockdown,” pointed out Mr. Karanth. Voluntary attrition refers to employees quitting of their own accord, likely for better prospects. Work-from-home made job-hunting easy. “Techies are able to engage with 10-15 prospective employers simultaneously, compared to 2 or 3, pre-pandemic. Sitting at home, they take job interviews, complete the recruitment process and collect offer letters,” said B.S Murthy, CEO, Leadership Capital, a tech hiring and advisory firm.

He was one of eight 20-somethings on a US team that featured nine players in the world’s top 11 — all gunning to regain the coveted trophy won by Europe in France three years ago. GOAT “This is the greatest team of all time,” Stricker said, saying his youthful line-up represented “a new era for USA golf.” World No. 2 Dustin Johnson, at 37 the oldest member of the team, provided a template for his younger colleagues, his 1-up singles victory over Paul Casey giving him a perfect 5-0 record in a maximum five matches. He became the first American since Larry Nelson in 1979 to go five-from-five. The US took an 11-5 lead into Sunday’s 12 singles matches, the six-point gap more than either team has ever overcome on the final day to lift the trophy. It meant the Americans needed just 3.5 points to win the Cup. Padraig Harrington’s Europe needed nine to retain it.

28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Roy-powered SRH ends losing run||Jason Roy, playing his first IPL game in three years, showed on Monday night what the world's most glamorous cricket league had been missing. The England opener (60, 42 balls, 8x4, 1x6) starred in Sunrisers Hyderabad’s seven-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals, with nine balls to spare, at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Roy could not have hoped for a better start to his innings with SRH; he was given the cap at the expense of the out-of-form David Warner. Skipper Kane Williamson (51 not out, 41b, 5x4, 1x6) was content to play second fiddle during his second-wicket partnership of 57 with Roy, but after the latter gifted his wicket away, he took over and guided his side to what was only its second win of the season. Chasing 165, SRH was given a brisk start by Roy and Wriddhiman Saha, who added 57 in just five overs. But RR captain Sanju Samson's decision to introduce the left-arm spin of Mahipal Lomror in the last over of the PowerPlay paid off. Lomror strikes Lomror's first ball sneaked under the bat of Saha, who had stepped out, and fellow wicketkeeper Samson dislodged the stumps. But Williamson's calm nerves and sweet timing ensured that RR needed to wait for a while before it got another wicket, in the shape of Roy. The opener, not long after hitting Rahul Tewatia for 18 runs and getting dropped in the same over, perished, appearing as though he were giving catching practice to Samson off Chetan Sakariya. Although Priyam Garg followed Roy back to the hut for a duck, Abhishek Sharma (21 not out) played the perfect supporting role to his captain fantastic. Earlier, there was a captain’s innings from Samson, too. Sadly for him, it didn’t prove enough, just as his unbeaten 70 wasn’t against Delhi Capitals on Saturday. He made a fine 82 (57 balls, 7x4, 3x6) and added 56 for the second wicket with Yashasvi Jaiswal (36, 23b, 5x4, 1x6). RR could only manage 21 off the last three overs, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Siddharth Kaul doing a good job at the death. That would prove crucial.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/samson-fires-for-royals-again/article36705373.ece
28 September 2021||London,||Moeen hangs up Test boots||England all-rounder Moeen Ali on Monday announced he was retiring from Test cricket to focus on his white-ball career, saying the format’s “intensity can be too much sometimes”. The 34-year-old scored five centuries and took 195 wickets in 64 Tests, including a top score of 155 not out and five five-wicket hauls. But Moeen felt he needed to abandon cricket’s longest format to prolong his career and rekindle his love for the game. “I want to play for as long as I can and just want to enjoy my cricket,” he said. “I will miss playing against the best in the world with that feeling of nerves but also knowing with my best ball I could get anyone out. I’ve enjoyed Test cricket but that intensity can be too much sometimes. I feel like I’ve done enough of it and I’m happy with how I’ve done,” Moeen said. Moeen began his Test career batting at number six and offering part-time off-spin, scoring his maiden century against Sri Lanka at Headingley in 2014. But his role changed as his improved bowling led England’s management to prioritise his off-spin and move him around the batting line-up from opener to number nine. Moeen finished with 2,914 Test runs at an average of 28.29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/moeen-hangs-up-test-boots/article36705358.ece
28 September 2021||Chennai,||The stunning success of unsung Indian pacers||Scenario 1: The batter goes for the shot but the ball arrives later than he expects. The knuckle ball rattles the woodwork.  Scenario 2: The batter lines himself up for the big blow, but the yorker goes under the bat quicker than he anticipates. It’s a well disguised faster delivery.  Scenario 3: The batter, hustled by the heavy ball, goes for the pull but finds the bouncer pacier than he had bargained for. The ball takes the top-edge for a catch. Some other batters succumb to the slow, craftily concealed, short ball. Pace variations, smart changes in length, exploring different angles and mixing up the yorkers with the hard length balls and the short-pitched deliveries have fired unsung Indian pacers to stunning success in the ongoing IPL. And pitted against formidable names, they have been swinging games big time. Fascinating story The 30-year-old Harshal Patel’s story is fascinating. With 23 scalps in 10 games, he is miles ahead of the pack in this edition’s IPL. He can strike early with his natural outswingers. And he is Virat Kohli’s go-to man at the death with his loopy slower deliveries and the surprisingly quick yorkers. His ice-cool temperament is a major factor in tense situations. The hat-trick against Mumbai Indians on Sunday was well deserved. Then we have the 24-year-old Avesh Khan from Madhya Pradesh. His 15 wickets in 10 matches at an economy rate of 7.55 show he can both contain and strike. This speedster from the MRF Pace Foundation employs his shoulders, hits the bat hard. He also comprehends his release point for his on-target yorkers. And his short-pitched balls have zip. The 22-year-old Punjab fast bowler Arshdeep Singh, who has 13 wickets in eight matches, can outsmart batters in the high-pressure end overs. He is calm, switches pace and length capably, and brings the left-armer’s angles into play. Arshdeep has roared for Punjab Kings. And Rajasthan Royals’ Kartik Tyagi, with his high-arm action and lovely release, is a genuine talent. Precision The yorker outside the off-stump is bowled with precision. He has pace, variety, control, temperament and the ability to bowl in impossible situations like against Punjab Kings the other day. Prasidh Krishna, quick and potent on his day, and left-armer Chetan Sakariya, a clever customer with a bag of tricks, both MRF products, have already represented India. India has considerable bench strength in pace bowling. In the land of spin, these pace bowlers can sting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-stunning-success-of-unsung-indian-pacemen/article36705364.ece
28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||KKR has a score to settle with DC||What compounded Kolkata Knight Riders’ pain at Sunday’s last-ball loss to Chennai Super Kings was the injury to star all-rounder Andre Russell. Considering that KKR has some distance to cover for a place in the playoffs, Russell’s availability assumes paramount importance. The extent of Russell’s injury, suspected to be a pulled hamstring, is not known but KKR would prefer to have him back for its last three games following Tuesday’s clash against Delhi Capitals at Sharjah. DC has twice the number of points as KKR but cannot afford to be complacent against a rival keen to avenge the seven-wicket loss suffered at Ahmedabad. Notably for DC, that win triggered off its current four-match winning streak. Having taken care of the passage into the playoffs, DC’s next goal — like CSK — is to finish first or second in the league. After KKR, DC faces Mumbai Indians, CSK and Royal Challengers Bangalore. For CSK, besides DC, its other rivals are from the lower half — Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings. KKR, first among equals involving teams on eight points, has done well after resuming its campaign. Now, KKR’s in-form top-order faces a severe test from DC’s impressive bowling in the first PowerPlay. DC and KKR will be playing their second successive day-game after weekend clashes at Abu Dhabi. Given a choice, KKR may prefer to bat second considering its last two, comfortable victories came when chasing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kkr-has-a-score-to-settle-with-dc/article36705367.ece
28 September 2021||September 28 2021 00:00 IST,||A must-win game for MI and PBKS||While responding to a query on Hardik Pandya’s fitness, Mumbai Indians bowling coach Shane Bond had stressed last week the franchise was “balancing the needs of our team with Team India as well” ahead of the T20 World Cup. Considering the wobbly form of its middle-order — especially that of Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan — the franchise, and possibly national selectors, would be hoping for a quick turnaround in fortunes to keep its title defence alive. The duo’s performance will be under the scanner as MI takes on Punjab Kings in a must-win affair for both the teams. Forget about setting the IPL stage alight, as they have consistently done for the last three seasons, Suryakumar and Ishan have continued to misfire on either side of the league’s suspension. No wonder the duo’s lack of runs has been a major factor in MI losing three games in a row since resumption and sliding to the seventh spot. While Suryakumar has tallied 17 runs off 29 balls in three innings in UAE, Ishan has scored 33 off 32. While MI would be hoping for the T20 World Cup-bound duo to fire along with the burly hitters in Pandya brothers and Kieron Pollard, K.L. Rahul’s side would be eager to hold on to key moments, as it did against Sunrisers over the weekend and keep itself in the hunt for a Playoff’s berth. If Chris Gayle comes into his element on Tuesday night, it could spell doom for Mumbai Indians, which is yet to win a game in the second leg of IPL 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-must-win-game-for-mi-and-pbks/article36705376.ece

However, in Abu Dhabi, 80 per cent of my deliveries will be quick. I let the situation and conditions dictate my plan,” Harshal said in the post match media interaction. “This is the first time I’ve got a hat-trick in my life. I haven’t done it even in a school game. I’ve been on a hat-trick six times in the IPL. The feeling of getting a hat-trick is difficult to explain. It will take some time to sink in,” Harshal said. The 30-year-old is not part of India’s T20 World Cup, but he is not losing any sleep over it. “Selection matters is completely out of my control. My only philosophy is to make a positive impact for any team that I play for,” Harshal said. On RCB breaking a two match losing streak, Harshal said, “The difficult thing was to overcome the inertia of two losses. We’re not looking at the points table, as this could cause the mind to wander.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/this-is-the-first-time-ive-got-a-hat-trick-in-my-life-harshal/article36705377.ece

The 24-year-old Varinder, hailing from Patiala and employed with Eastern Railway here, is enjoying this upwardly mobile phase of his career. Injury-free “When I was in the 56kg class, I used to cut down a lot of weight for fights. That led to frequent injuries, including fractures in my hand. I have remained injury-free and have started getting results, including the two National titles and the Asian medal, since changing to 60kg in 2019,” said Varinder. “Now I am eyeing a medal in the World championships. I am fine-tuning my technique and improving my fitness. I am watching bouts of my prospective opponents, including those from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Cuba and Russia. There will be some surprises though as several boxers must have changed weights following the revamp in weight categories.” Coming from a humble family, Varinder is thankful to everyone who has played a role in his journey so far. “I rely a lot on my personal coach Harpreet Singh Hundal. I am grateful to my family, friends, all coaches and my department, including the Sealdah Divisional Railway Manager Sheelendra Pratap Singh.” Agile and intelligent According to former National and current Railways coach Jaydev Bist, Varinder has the potential to land medals in big tournaments. “His confidence comes from his hard work. He is agile, intelligent, has strong legs, sharp reflex and good anticipation. He needs to strengthen his neck so that he can take the hard blows. Varinder is one who can give us medals at the highest stage,” said the Dronacharya award-winning Bist.

28 September 2021||HYDERABAD,||Pleased with my performance: Jyothi Surekha||“Winning three silvers at a World championship is no mean achievement,” says archer V. Jyothi Surekha. She was hoping for at least one gold having entered three finals in Yankton (USA). She came off second best in the compound women’s individual, women’s team and mixed team finals. “The target was gold. But, somehow it slipped out of our hands in all three finals. The weather conditions — windy and cold — had a bearing on the outcome,” Jyothi told The Hindu on Sunday. “As in any World championship, the standard of competition was very high. And we were well prepared for it,” said the archer from Vijayawada — an applicant for the Khel Ratna Award this year. There was no pressure of expectations (of bettering the two silvers in the preceding events) on her in the individual event final, she said. “It was just that somehow I failed to shoot as well as I should have. Anyway, I am pleased with the performances,” Jyothi said. She has now set her sights on improving her performance at the senior Nationals in Jamshedpur next month to be followed by the Asian Championship trials. “The big target of course will be winning gold at next year’s Asian Games,” said the archer. A World Cup gold — she has five bronzes and a silver so far since 2018 — is another feather she wants in her cap. “That is one gold I am desperate to win,” she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pleased-with-my-performance-jyothi-surekha/article36705668.ece
28 September 2021||KOCHI,||Include non-campers in relay team but put them in Registered Testing Pool: Usha||For years, the quartermilers have enjoyed special status in Indian athletics. They have also been sent for long camps abroad frequently, to countries like Turkey, Poland and the Czech Republic. That’s because the Athletics Federation of India had been harping for years that the 4x400m relay team, especially women, have a chance to win an Olympic medal. Unable to enter a team Now, three years after India won the women’s mile relay gold at the Jakarta Asian Games, the squad has virtually been destroyed at the national camp. India could not even put together a women’s 4x400m team and withdrew from the World Relays in Poland in May and also failed to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics with prominent runners, including V.K. Vismaya, M.R. Poovamma, Jisna Mathew, Anjali Devi and Kiran Pahal, either injured or in poor form. Bengaluru’s 18-year-old Priya H. Mohan is the country’s fastest quartermiler this year but she was not sent to the Olympics as she was not a national camper. However, she ran the relays at the Nairobi under-20 Worlds in August, after a 10-day national camp in Patiala, and won bronze in the mixed event and finished fourth in the women’s relay. The calendar is packed next year with the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, Worlds and under-20 Worlds and the search for promising quartermilers will also be on in the under-23 Nationals, now underway in New Delhi Time for change in rule So, is it time for the AFI to change the rule that only national campers be allowed in relay teams for international majors? Should non-campers be included too? “If they are in the National Anti-Doping Agency’s registered testing pool (RTP) and if they are tested regularly during off-season, then they can be considered for the relay team,” P.T. Usha told The Hindu . “If they are not brought under RTP and if out-of-competition tests are not conducted regularly, it will be a big risk. Either their performance will be down or they will be caught.” There have been some very impressive performances in recent weeks and Usha felt that the net should be cast wide to catch the dope cheats. “In juniors and seniors, athletes who come up with extraordinary performances should be included in the RTP, giving their whereabouts and tested frequently. “After that, if their performances are considered for the relay team, then we need not be worried about them. “Not just the relays, even athletes in other events who come up with sudden, impressive performances should be in the RTP. “And in the national camp, the 4x400m relay men and women should all be in the RTP, also the 4x100m relay runners.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/include-non-campers-in-relay-team-but-put-them-in-registered-testing-pool-usha/article36705472.ece

28 September 2021||Chennai,||Team MRF takes the honours||Team MRF Tyres clinched the Finnish Rally Championship (Ralli SM) after Emil Lindholm and Reeta Hamalainen dominated the final round of the season in the SM KokUA 60-v Juhlaralli event on Sunday. Going into the final round, it was a winner-take-all scenario with the top three drivers separated by just seven points. Team MRF was on the pace from the first of the 10-stage competition with Lindholm winning the Skriko stage. He ended the first day of action on Saturday in first place, but with a lead of just 2.9 seconds. The pressure was intense for the four Sunday stages that featured 74km of action, However, Lindholm was in form, never relinquishing his lead. “It is a great feeling to have won the championship. It is a great reward for the all the hard work at Team MRF Tyres. I have learnt a lot by participating in this year’s championships. “To survive in Finland the tyres have to tackle different conditions like snow, ice and composition from different gravel roads. This victory is a result of some great team work,” said Lindholm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/team-mrf-takes-the-honours/article36705428.ece
28 September 2021||LONDON,||Messi and Guardiola set to reunite||There was a time when a reunion between Lionel Messi and Pep Guardiola looked distinctly possible, but on Tuesday they will be on opposite sides again when Paris Saint-Germain plays Manchester City in the Champions League. Messi has played just three games for his new club and is yet to score. He has sat out PSG’s last two matches with a knee problem but the feeling is that coach Mauricio Pochettino has been saving him for City. After being held 1-1 by Club Brugge in its opening game, PSG needs a positive result against City to stop its rivals taking control of the group. Desperate to win This time the expectation is both City and PSG will progress from their group and both Messi and Guardiola are desperate to win the Champions League again. While the world waits to see how Messi’s move to Paris turns out, Guardiola continues to regret the absence of a prolific centre-forward as the final piece of his jigsaw at City. “The club needs in the next years a striker. When it’s not possible, it’s not possible, we move on with the fantastic squad we have,” he said. PSG, of course, has more than one such player. Kylian Mbappe has been the top scorer in France in each of the last three seasons. Nobody knows Messi’s game better than Guardiola, but nobody knows better than Pep that there is no stopping Messi when he is at the top of his game.  Tuesday’s matches Ajax v Besiktas, Shakhtar Donetsk v Inter Milan, AC Milan v Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund v Sporting Lisbon, FC Porto v Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain v Manchester City, RB Leipzig v Club Brugge, Real Madrid v Sheriff Tiraspol||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/messi-and-guardiola-set-to-reunite/article36705429.ece

28 September 2021||KOLKATA,||Md. Sporting in final||Mohammedan Sporting found two goals in the extra-time against a 10-man FC Bengaluru United (FCBU) for a 4-2 score-line in the first semifinal of the Durand Cup football on Monday. The teams were locked 2-2 at the end of regulation time. FCBU found the lead with barely 20 seconds on the clock with its Spanish forward Pedro Manzi doing the finishing after being set up by his upfront colleague Luka Majcen of Slovenia. Stunned by the reverse, Sporting re-grouped and quickly turned on the heat. Trinidad and Tobago’s Marcus Joseph’s fine solo helped it draw parity in the ninth minute. He dribbled past three defenders before finishing with an angular left footer. This charged up Sporting to go for more and the FCBU citadel fell again in the 38th minute when Faisal Ali made the most of a Joseph assist. FCBU came alive late in the second half when it found the equaliser off Kingshuk Debnath in the 78th minute.  FCBU suffered a set-back in the added time of the second half when a frustrated Manzi used his fist to divert home a Pradhan free-kick and was marched off with the second booking of the match. Sporting used its numerical superiority to find goals through substitute Brandon Vanlalremdika and midfield hero Nicola Stojanovic, who scored from the spot.  The result (semifinal): Mohd. Sporting 4 (Marcus Joseph 9, Faisal Ali 38, Brandon Vanlalremdika 103, Nicola Stojanovic 110-pen) bt FC Bengaluru United 2 (Pedro Manzi 1, Kingshuk Debnath 78) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mohammedan-sporting-makes-the-final/article36705424.ece

28 September 2021||GUWAHATI,||Two held for inciting violence during Assam eviction drive||The Criminal Investigation Department of the Assam police has arrested two persons for allegedly inciting violence during the eviction drive near Sipajhar in Darrang district on September 23. The two arrested on Sunday are Hasmat Ali, former president of the Bajnapathar panchayat, and Shan Mahmood, president of the Sanowa panchayat. “They were arrested for instigating the people to attack the police during the eviction drive. They are being kept at the Sipajhar police station,” a district police officer said. Two persons, including a minor, were killed in police firing and a dozen others were injured during the eviction. Nine of the injured were security personnel. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma blamed the violence on the Popular Front of India, a radical Islamic organisation. He also requested the Centre to ban the organisation. The State Congress accused the BJP-led government of ruling the State through the barrel of a gun since the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December 2019. State Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah also demanded action against the Darrang Deputy Commissioner and the SP. “We are not against the eviction of encroachers but the killing of farmers cannot be accepted. Nothing can justify the shooting of people in cold blood,” party spokesperson Partha Pratim Bora said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/2-arrested-for-inciting-violence-during-assam-eviction/article36705332.ece
28 September 2021||Mumbai,||Change alignment of railway corridor, Uddhav writes to Modi||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting to change the alignment of Mumbai-Hyderabad High Speed Rail Corridor (HSR) via Jalna-Nanded instead of Pune and has suggested a new HSR route between Pune and Aurangabad. Mr. Thackeray pointed out that the State will accommodate the Mumbai-Nagpur HSR within the Right of Way (RoW) of the under construction Samruddhi expressway between the two cities. The Chief Minister in his letter added that if that happens, the proposed Mumbai-Hyderabad HSR can be planned via-Jalna, which stands on the expressway. “GoM have already approved an expressway between Jalna and Nanded. Further, NHAI have already planned an expressway from Nanded to Hyderabad. If the same logic of accommodating the HSR within the RoW of an expressway is applied, as is proposed by the HSR between Nagpur and Mumbai, the Mumbai-Hyderabad HSR can also be planned along Mumbai-Nanded Expressway via Jalna and further within the RoW of proposed expressway between Nanded and Hyderabad,” the letter said. The central government has proposed development of Nagpur-Nasik-Mumbai and Mumbai-Pune-Hyderabad HSR corridors in Maharashtra for which National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) has been entrusted to undertake final location survey, feasibility study and DPR of the proposed corridors. On March 15, 2021, NHSRCL presented alignment study to Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation which is executing the Nagpur-Mumbai Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg which is an access controlled greenfield expressway project of 701 km in length with 120 metre-wide Right of Way (RoW). While suggesting to plan the Mumbai-Hyderabad HSR via-Jalna instead of Pune, the Chief Minister has pitched for an HSR route between Pune and Aurangabad. ‘Anchor of auto industry’ “It should be noted that Mumbai-Nagpur connects Mumbai-Nashik-Aurangabad. Mumbai-Hyderabad present alignment connects Mumbai to Pune on HSR route. GoM have planned a semi-HSR between Pune and Nashik. A HSR connectivity between Pune and Aurangabad will complete that quadrilateral which is the most important industrial corridor and the Pune-Nashik-Aurangabad triangle is already an anchor of auto industry in the State,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/change-alignment-of-railway-corridor-uddhav-writes-to-modi/article36705756.ece
28 September 2021||Kannauj,||Two girls gang-raped in U.P. cybercafe||Two girls were allegedly held hostage and gang-raped in a cybercafe in this district when they had gone to get some documents photocopied, the police said on Monday. Four men took the two girl students hostage at the cafe on September 13 and one of the accused also recorded the act, the police said. One of the accused also made a video of the act and handed it over to his brother-in-law who extorted Rs. 10,000 by threatening to make it viral, the police said. Superintendent of Police Prashant Verma said a case was registered at Sadar Kotwali on Sunday against six people, including a woman, based on the complaint of one of the girls.  Stole money from house The 17-year-old student in her complaint said she had gone to the cybercafe along with her friend at noon on September 13 when four people, who were already present there, raped them. The girl said she and her friend stole money from their houses to give it to the accused, the police said. It was the missing money which alerted their family members after which the incident came to light, the police said. The girls have been sent to the district hospital for medical examination. The police are raiding all possible places, the SP said, adding that in the initial investigation, the police have found signs of prostitution from the cafe. Signs of prostitution The victim had said that after the incident, the wife of one of the accused made her phone calls pressurising her into prostitution and some neighbours have also spoken about presence of young girls there, he added. The Superintendent of Police said efforts are on to nab the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/two-girls-gang-raped-in-up-cybercafe/article36705753.ece
28 September 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Experts call for elephant-friendly ramps||After an elephant recently got stuck in the swollen Mahanadi river in Odisha and perished after failing to move out, environmentalists have demanded animal-friendly public infrastructure. “We have observed that the trapped tusker had made at least two attempts to climb out of the river by walking to the end of the barrage spillway and the shore towards a suitable slope,” said Biswajit Mohanty, who heads the Wildlife Society of Orissa, an environmental pressure group that works on elephant conservation. “Unfortunately, for more than 100 feet, there is a sharp straight and tall concrete wall to protect the river bank from scouring, which prevented the elephant from climbing. Had there been an eight feet concrete or stone ramp, the elephant could have climbed up,” he said. “Building a ramp does not compromise the safety of the river bank and hence this measure can be considered a mitigation plan,” he noted. “To prevent the elephants from drowning, we suggest construction of elephant or animal-friendly ramps at the point where the barrage ends on either sides of the Mahanadi” suggested Mr. Mohanty. “Similar ramps can be built at the Naraj barrage and other places where river-crossing by elephants is recorded,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/experts-call-for-elephant-friendly-ramps/article36705766.ece
28 September 2021||Mumbai,||Show-cause notice to Akhtar||A magistrate’s court on Monday issued a show- cause notice against lyricist Javed Akhtar for comparing “Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to Taliban.” Early this month, during his interaction with a news channel, Mr. Akhtar had said, “there is an uncanny resemblance between Taliban and those who want a Hindu Rashtra.” He had also commented that “Just like the Taliban want an Islamic State, there are those who want a Hindu rashtra . These people are of the same mindset — be it Muslim, Christian, Jews or Hindus.” ‘Completely wrong’ Soon thereafter, the Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece Saamna had said it was “completely wrong” to compare the two. Vivek Champanerkar, a social worker filed a suit before the Thane court that said, “Mr. Akhtar statements were well-planned and calculated and were made to defame the RSS and discourage, disparage and misguide the people who have joined the RSS.” He had sought a compensation of Rs. 1 towards the damages and an injunction. Additional chief judicial magistrate issued the show cause notice to Mr. Akhtar on Monday and adjourned the matter till November 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/court-issues-show-cause-notice-to-javed-akhtar/article36705584.ece
28 September 2021||New Delhi,||Cancer patient seeks Covaxin shot after Covishield first dose||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Centre to respond to a petition by a cancer patient seeking permission to take Covaxin as the second dose as advised by the doctors instead of Covishield which was administered to him as the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Justice Rekha Palli asked the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to submit its stand on the petition while considering it a case of special need. “He is a cancer patient and has special needs. Experts should also consider this,” the High Ccourt said while posting the case for further hearing on October 28. Madhur Mittal, in his plea, said that in September last year, he was diagnosed with cancer (stage four renal cell carcinoma) and was advised urgent operation for removal of the infected organs, that is, kidney and lymph nodes. In October 2020, he underwent the operation. Covishield as first dose On March 13 this year, he got his first dose of Covishield vaccine, and soon after, he developed a severe reaction and had to be hospitalised for four days. Mr. Mittal said he has been advised to get himself checked from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre, New York, U.S.A., for cancer treatment and he approached the institution for an appointment. Mr. Mittal said he wanted to get both the doses of the COVID-19 vaccination, and as per the doctor’s advice and prior complications of Covidshield vaccine, he wants to take Covaxin as the second dose. His plea said when he tried to book a slot for Covaxin as the second dose on the COWIN website, he was unable to do so as the application only books slots in the same category of the vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cancer-patient-seeks-permission-to-mix-jabs/article36705600.ece
28 September 2021||Mumbai,||Antilia bomb case: NIA opposes Waze’s house arrest petition||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday urged a special court here not to permit house custody for dismissed police officer Sachin Waze, arrested in the Antilia bomb scare and businessman Mansukh Hiran murder case, as he may abscond. The NIA filed its affidavit in response to Mr. Waze’s application seeking to be placed under house arrest for three months for recovery after undergoing a bypass surgery in a private hospital on September 13.  All facilities in jail’ “It is submitted that great prejudice would be caused to the case of the prosecution as there is every possibility that the applicant accused (Waze) will abscond if house arrest is granted,” the NIA said, adding that Taloja jail was aided with all modern facilities to take care of Mr. Waze’s health. Special NIA Judge A.T. Wankhede on Monday perused the affidavit and sought a report from the private hospital on the medical condition of Mr. Waze. The court will hear the matter further on September 29. Mr. Waze, in his application, said he underwent a complex cardiac surgery with five grafts and there was a high possibility of contracting infection in a non-sterile environment, and sought that he be placed in house custody for a period of three months. The dismissed police officer was arrested in March this year for his alleged role in the Antilia bomb scare case and the killing of businessman Mansukh Hiran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/antilia-bomb-case-nia-opposes-wazes-house-arrest-petition/article36705760.ece
28 September 2021||Bengaluru,||JD(S) continues tirade against Siddaramaiah||As political parties start gearing up for the 2023 Legislative Assembly elections, Congress leader Siddaramaiah and Janata Dal (S) leaders are back to attacking one another over their “secular credentials”. A day Mr. Siddaramaiah described the JD(S) as a party without secular principles and one unable to form a government on its own, former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda hit back at his former party colleague. Mr. Gowda accused him of “spreading misinformation” and sought to remind him of his origins in the JD(S). “We will respond to those humiliating us [now] in the 2023 elections,” the former Prime Minister told party workers on Monday after inaugurating ‘Janata Parva 1.0’ and ‘Mission 123’, a four-day workshop to revitalise the regional party. The JD(S) has set a target of winning 123 Assembly seats to form the government on its own in 2023. As many as 200 party leaders, including legislators, former legislators, and defeated candidates in the 2018 Assembly elections, participated in the workshop. The participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire with 61 questions about their poll preparations in their constituency, while the challenges and chances of the party were discussed. Backstabbing Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who had attacked Mr. Siddaramaiah on Sunday, continued his tirade on Monday as well. “The Congress has been responsible for the growth of the BJP. We did not allow the BJP to implement its hidden agenda when the JD(S) formed the government with it. The Congress backstabbed the JD(S) and tried to break the party. Congress called us the B-team of BJP only to cover its lapses,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said. Interestingly, Mr. Kumaraswamy said that some of party leaders and those who stood second in the last Assembly elections were not invited to the workshop since they had evinced interest in joining other parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/jds-continues-tirade-against-siddaramaiah/article36705346.ece
28 September 2021||GUWAHATI,||Activists oppose mining leases in Meghalaya||The granting of mining leases for three coal blocks in Meghalaya has made some green activists in the State see red. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had in April 2014 banned rat-hole coal mining that was deemed hazardous to people and the environment. While transportation of extracted coal was allowed, mining continued illegally in remote areas. Labour Lyngdoh and Dapmain Shylla, two residents of the State’s East Jaintia Hills district had on September 24 issued a statement thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma for rekindling hopes across Meghalaya’s coal belt. They said that the Union Coal Ministry had granted leases for three coal blocks between them. The two are associates of coal barons Nehlang Lyngdoh and Thomas Nongtdu. They heaped praise on Mr. Sangma for “working very hard in lifting the NGT ban” on coal mining, which they said displaced and impoverished thousands of families. On September 26, the State’s Rajya Sabha member and National People’s Party leader W.R. Kharlukhi said: “We are happy that we have kept our election promise by about to restart coal mining.” ‘Govt. can do anything’ “We are not sure how the coal blocks have been leased since we don’t have the documents. The government can do anything for profit and it seems they are rushing to extract since the peak time for coal mining has been from November to April,” Shillong-based activist Angela Rangad said. Anti-mining activist Agnes Kharshiing said: Resumption of coal mining will be for political gains. There is no blueprint for feasible coal mining in Meghalaya. It will invariably be rat-hole mining and will lead to human trafficking again,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/activists-oppose-mining-leases-in-meghalaya/article36705798.ece
28 September 2021||JAIPUR,||Experts highlight polio eradication to deal with vaccine hesitancy||Amid reports of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, experts at a policy dialogue here laid emphasis on the experience of polio vaccination, which has succeeded in the elimination of the virus. An effective social mobilisation strategy could be evolved in Rajasthan to deal with misgivings and rumours, said the experts. The vaccine hesitancy, reportedly mainly from the rural areas because of misinformation, trust deficit and indifference, could be managed by removing apprehensions and building trust in the State government’s health system, the participants said. Technical advances in the choice of vaccines could also play an important role. The policy dialogue was organised by the Indian Institute of Health Management Research (IIHMR) University’s School of Public Health. Experts felt that the lessons learnt from polio eradication campaigns, with India having been declared polio-free in 2014, would be beneficial for COVID-19 vaccination with the innovations in the programme implementation strategy and delivery. IIHMR University’s chairperson S.D. Gupta said working on the structural barriers to vaccination, changing the behaviour of hesitant persons and increasing vaccine confidence would help remove complacency and make the process convenient for the target groups. ‘107 block plan’ Svea Closser of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, U.S., said India’s “107 block plan” for polio had helped in removing vaccine hesitancy by adopting a broader approach. The communication strategy included information on routine immunisation, oral rehydration solution, breastfeeding and handwashing. School of Public Health’s adviser D.K. Mangal said about 6 billion COVID-19 vaccines had so far been administered across 184 countries. The lower uptake of vaccines because of hesitancy would adversely affect the efforts to contain the pandemic and generate immunity against the virus, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/experts-highlight-polio-eradication-to-deal-with-vaccine-hesitancy/article36705754.ece
