However, many rural and semi-rural places recorded a sharp spike in infections in the past week. At the start of this year, 50% of the cases were from urban centres such as Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata. However, the share reduced to 35% by Wednesday. In contrast, the share of cases from rural areas increased from 6% at the start of the year to 12% by Wednesday. In the same period, the share of cases in semi-rural areas increased from 15% to 25%. In the first five days of the year, rural and semi-rural areas recorded only 58,000 cases collectively. In the latest five days, the areas recorded 2.12 lakh infections, a 266% increase. In the same period, cases in urban and semi-urban areas increased from about 1,80,000 to 6,00,000 cases, a 233% increase, slightly lower than rural counterparts. India recorded 2,59,291 new cases on Thursday, the highest single-day rise in the ongoing wave. Also, 18.86 lakh tests were conducted on Wednesday, the results of which are made available on Thursday. This is the highest number of tests in a single day in the ongoing wave. 12.5 lakh active cases The figures are based on the State bulletins released until 10 p.m. on Thursday. Jharkhand and Tripura had, however, not yet released data for the day. The cumulative cases in India have reached 3.65 crore and the cumulative death count has reached 4,85,376. The active cases stand at 12.5 lakh. As of Thursday, India has fully vaccinated 63.6% of its eligible population (15+) and partially vaccinated 88.6%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rural-cases-up-after-urban-surge/article64949999.ece

While Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar was leaving for lunch on Wednesday, he and other personnel saw a man giving a chase to another in Nehru Maidan, opposite his office. The Police Commissioner told his colleagues to see what was happening. Assistant Sub-Inspector Varun and other personnel gave a chase to the two and brought them to office. On inquiry, one of them told the police that the other, along with his accomp- lices, had snatched his mobile phone and was running away. The accused was identified as Shamanth, a resident of Attavar. The snatched mobile phone was with his accomp- lices. The police asked Shamanth to call his accomplices and tell them to come to Mangaluru Central Railway Station. As the police followed Shamanth near Hampankatte, one of his accomplices, Harish Poojari, sensed danger and made an attempt to flee by boarding an autorickshaw. Immediately, Varun gave chase to the autorickshaw and pulled Poojari out. The suspect got off the vehicle only to flee from the spot. Varun then pursued him and pinned him down. He asked passers-by to help him secure the suspect. Mangaluru South Police have registered a case of robbery and are on the look-out for another accused, Rajesh, a resident of Ullal, who is said to be part of the gang. Complimenting the personnel led by Varun, Mr. Shashi Kumar announced a cash reward of Rs. 10,000 for them on Thursday. He said that the arrest of the gang members will help the police crack cases of robbery in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-arrested-after-dramatic-chase-in-city/article64950252.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy at his camp office here on various issues related to the Telugu film industry are widely expected to yield a positive outcome for all stakeholders. Among the topics discussed was the government’s decision to reduce cinema ticket prices that has kicked up a major controversy. Addressing press persons after his meeting, which was kept under wraps till Thursday morning, Mr. Chiranjeevi said he had a fruitful interaction with Mr. Reddy who was receptive to the points raised by him. Mr. Chiranjeevi said the Chief Minister heard his views patiently and he was confident that he would amicably sort out the issues that confront producers, exhibitors and, most importantly, the huge number of workers whose sweat and toil gave a cinema its final shape. “The tinsel town appears to be glamorous, but it is not so rosy inside. There are many leading a hand-to-mouth existence”, the ‘Megastar’ observed. Mr. Chiranjeevi said Mr. Reddy told him that he would refer the issues to the committee appointed by the government, and a G.O. would be released after yet another round of talks. “If the Chief Minister wants me to come again alone, I will go, and don’t mind taking a delegation if allowed,” he said. Mr. Chiranjeevi said there was a feeling of insecurity in the film industry and some rash statements precipitated the recent crisis. “Let us not have apprehensions. I have taken the problems faced by all stakeholders to the Chief Minister’s notice.” The government’s decision to fix cinema ticket prices antagonised a section of the producers and exhibitors, and it peaked in the run-up to director Ram Gopal Varma’s meeting with Minister for Cinematography Perni Venkatramaiah. Mr. Varma’s argument was that the government could regulate but not fix the price of cinema tickets,which should be left to the discretion of producers and others involved in the film-making process. A delegation of producers and exhibitors had discussions with Mr. Venkatramaiah and the likes of Dil Raju met him separately some time back last year. But, the crisis only deepened owing to the exchange of words between the two sides. Amidst all this, there was a spat over alleged violations of licensing norms by the theatres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/chiranjeevi-holds-talks-with-jagan/article64950005.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 05:08 IST,||Ensure least inconvenience to road users if NH 75 is being closed: KCCI||Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) on Thursday expressed serious concern over the reported closure of National Highway 75 between Donigal and Maranahalli in Hassan district for six months to facilitate road widening. In a letter to Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra, KCCI president Shashidhar Pai Maroor quoted media reports as saying that the National Highways Authority of India’s contractor has sought closure of the 10-km stretch for six months to facilitate four-lane work. He demanded that an independent committee be constituted by the Dakshina Kannada and Hassan district administrations to assess the methodology and time required to complete the work. The NHAI and the contractor should be made accountable for any lapse in completing the work, he said and added that the NHAI should be asked to complete the work in four months instead of six. Mr. Maroor also sought permission for cargo movement whilst the NHAI executes the work on the stretch. KCCI noted that National Highway 75 has been the lifeline of the coastal districts connecting them with the hinterland. The coastal region had taken a hit several times in the past when the highway was closed for repairs and upkeep. The proposed closure for another six months will severely affect trade and commerce in the region, Mr. Maroor said. On the other hand, alternative routes, including Sampaje Ghat and Charmadi Ghat, too cannot accommodate cargo traffic due to restrictions imposed on movement of heavy vehicles. Therefore, the administration should ensure minimum inconvenience to road users while facilitating construction of four-lane work between Donigal and Maranahalli, Mr. Maroor said. NHAI has reportedly sought complete closure of the stretch because of the sharp curves and the non availability of additional space to permit vehicular movement while executing the work. The work is part of National Highway 75 four-laning project between Hassan and Maranahalli via Sakleshpur that is being executed by the NHAI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ensure-least-inconvenience-to-road-users-if-nh-75-is-being-closed-kcci/article64950254.ece

Addressing presspersons in Hubballi on Thursday, KCCI president Vinay Javali, secretary Praveen Agadi, joint secretary Shankar Koliwad, vice-presidents B.S. Satish, Sandeep Bidasaria and the former vice-president G.K. Adappagoudar shared their views on leading the representative body of traders and merchants. Mr. Javali said that after the implementation of GST especially, members of KCCI had faced problems for no fault of theirs because of the harsh penalties incorporated in the GST rules and regulations. “A senior advocate and a former bureaucrat have voluntarily come forward to guide us. While we already have a taxation sub-committee, this proposed legal cell will help in addressing the issues at the appropriate level so that the members are not put to inconvenience because of the rule book attitude,” he said. Petition likely On the steep hike in property tax in the twin cities, Mr. Javali said that the KCCI is contemplating whether to implead itself in the existing PIL (Public Interest Litigation) petition in the High Court of Karnataka or file a fresh such petition. “We are collecting documents from all local bodies on property tax rates. Such has been property tax hike in twin cities that in some cases, the hike is around 900%. We will fight legally to get it reduced,” he said. On the weekend curfew and possible lockdown, Mr. Javali said that the KCCI is of the opinion that weekend curfew should be imposed only in places where there are more number of cases. Especially in cities such as Hubballi, which is a hub for distribution, such measures will affect the supply chain itself resulting in further hardships to the general public. Lockdown should be imposed only in an emergency situation, he said. On the silence of the KCCI over the flyover issue after initial opposition, Mr. Javali clarified that the new body will stand by the decision of the previous elected body which had said that it will welcome the flyover project but that it should be executed after making modifications so that it helped all citizens and the city. To a query, Mr. Adappagoudar said that the office-bearers will take up lacunae pertaining to the modified plan with the elected members and make efforts toprevail upon them to see that further modifications are made. Mr. Javali said that soon a multi-purpose exhibition centre will be inaugurated after some redevelopment works. A city improvement sub-committee will also be constituted to take up civic issues and find solutions through collective efforts, he added. Mr. Satish clarified that the KCCI stood by its earlier decision that the amendments to APMC Act should be repealed as they will create disparities among merchants operating at APMC Yards and outside. The efforts to convince the government of the need to repeal them will continue, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/karnatak-chamber-of-commerce-and-industry-plans-to-set-up-gst-legal-cell/article64950217.ece

Seventy of the 97 people who died were unvaccinated and 19 had taken only one dose of the vaccine, while only eight had taken both doses of the vaccine. Many patients who are either on ventilator or oxygen support in hospitals are also not fully vaccinated, according to doctors. “Vaccination is not going to protect you from getting the infection or transmitting it, but it will protect people from serious illness or death due to COVID-19. So everyone should get vaccinated,” said Dr. Nandini Sharma, Director Professor (Community Medicine Department) of Maulana Azad Medical College. She said unlike the second wave, the hospital is not seeing deaths of those without any pre-existing health conditions. Most of the patients dying now are people with comorbidities, she said. “Cases in Mumbai have probably already peaked. In Delhi, cases will be going down probably in two weeks and the peak will be even before that. In this wave, it is a milder disease and the recovery is also faster than the second wave, so the wave will also ebb faster,” she said. 28,867 fresh cases The upward trend in COVID-19 cases in Delhi continued on Thursday with 28,867 fresh cases being reported in the past 24 hours, according to a Delhi government bulletin. This is the highest since the beginning of the pandemic, overtaking the 28,395 cases reported on April 20 last year during the second wave of the pandemic. The test positivity rate (TPR) also increased to 29.12% from 26.22% a day earlier. This is the highest TPR in more than seven months. Of the total 15,433 hospital beds, 84.29% were vacant on Thursday. No lockdown: Jain There will be no lockdown and migrant labourers need not panic, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday. He also said the rate of patients admitted in the hospital has stabilised and sufficient number of beds are available in hospitals. According to the audit of the Death Committee, the highest number of deaths due to COVID are in those patients who were admitted due to some comorbidity, the Minister said. “Despite the surge of new cases daily for the last few days, the number of patients admitted to the hospital remains the same. This could be a sign that the peak of corona has now arrived. I hope people get relief from this outbreak,” Mr. Jain said.

Stalin has set his priorities on attracting big-ticket investments while simultaneously battling the global novel coronavirus pandemic. He is pushing for a ‘Dravidian model’ where economic development is inclusive.  “Our goal is equal economic development that will be in tune with social justice. It has taken root since the days of the Justice Party government [in pre-Independent India]. I have explained this as Dravidian model,” Mr. Stalin told The Hindu in an interview on the occasion of the launch of ‘Tamil Nadu in focus’, The Hindu ’s special weekly section showcasing the southern State’s history, culture, heritage and progress in key sectors.  The first-time Chief Minister, who gained rich experience as administrator in his past roles of Mayor, Minister and Deputy Chief Minister, is planning for the long term on the basis of a 10-year vision he unveiled in Tiruchi in the run-up to the last Assembly election. “I had requested the people to give the next 10 years to the DMK to rescue the State, which lagged behind during the AIADMK rule. They have given us the first five years. As per the seven promises made in Tiruchi, we are focussing on economy, agriculture, water resources, education-cum-health, urban development, rural infrastructure and social justice,” he said, exuding optimism that the people would come forward to give him another five-year term in 2026.. Mr. Stalin said big industrialists in India and global investors now felt Tamil Nadu had a favourable investment climate. Such faith by the industry had helped the government take income-generating measures without affecting the economic infrastructure in the midst of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/economic-development-with-social-justice-is-our-goal-stalin/article64950001.ece

This is part of their strategy for containing the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Following the advisory of “test, track, and treat”, the testing target has almost been doubled in Mysuru. Long queues are being seen outside testing centres in the district. The test positivity rate in Mysuru jumped to 7.58% on Thursday with 695 people testing positive. One death was reported and as many as 150 patients were discharged. Another cluster has been reported here with 12 testing positive at the Madhwa hostel of the National Institute of Engineering. The death toll rose to 2,431 with an 87-year-old male from Mandya, who was admitted with SARI symptoms at a private hospital here on January 10, succumbing to the infection. Another worrying factor is the rising infections among those aged between 0 and 17, especially in Mysuru city. The cases in this age group have been increasing from last week with the infection rate particularly high in the 11-17 age group. Eighty cases, including 36 alone in Mysuru city, were reported on Thursday. Two cases in the 0-5 age group, eight cases in the 6-10 age group, and 70 cases in the 11-17 age group were reported. The number of daily cases breached 500 mark in Mysuru city on Thursday. Also, cases are seeing a surge even in the taluks, with double-digit cases being reported in five taluks which used to see cases in the single digit till recently. Out of 695 cases, 505 were reported from Mysuru city, 44 from Mysuru taluk, 30 from Nanjangud, 17 from Periyapatna, 53 from T. Narsipur, 21 from K.R. Nagar, and 16 from Hunsur. T. Narsipur and Mysuru taluk have been reporting cluster outbreaks. The rising cases have driven hospitalisation figures up — 131 people have been admitted in government hospitals and 26in private hospitals so far.

The notification for revising the fine amount was issued on January 12. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain offences were declared as compoundable under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act 1939 in 2020, and not wearing of masks in public places, was one of them. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said that till now, roughly about Rs. 108 crore has been collected infines for violation of COVID-19 norms in the State. “There is a genuine concern among people about the increase in COVID-19 cases. But this is not translating into the right kind of behaviour and adherence to public health measures. The basic requirement is to wear masks and maintain physical distance,” he said. Masking was a public health measure to prevent the spread, he said. “We found that despite monitoring and enforcement, the compliance was poor. So from now on, people can be fined if they do not wear masks properly. Officers, who are authorised to impose fines, have been told to collect the revised amount,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/not-wearing-a-mask-you-will-now-be-fined-rs-500/article38270318.ece

The farmers were upset over the sudden decision to reduce the power supply duration from seven hours to three hours, which affected their schedule to irrigate their farmland. The protesting farmers said that there is only lip sympathy for farmers and no genuine efforts to resolve their demands. All of a sudden, the officials reduced power supply to villages from seven hours to three hours. And, as a result, they have been not able to irrigate their farmland. Already, floods caused a lot of damage in the kharif season and now, when water is required for the next crop, HESCOM officials are further creating problems, they added.

Mr. Modi chaired a meeting with the Chief Ministers and the Lieutenant Governors to review public health preparedness to tackle the pandemic and the national vaccination progress. He said safeguarding the economy and the livelihood of common people while framing COVID strategies was vital. Cautioning that the Omicron variant was infecting the general public many times faster than the earlier variants, the Prime Minister said that irrespective of variants, vaccination remained the most potent way to deal with the pandemic. “We have to be alert, be careful, but we also have to take care that there should be no panic situation,” Mr. Modi said. Addressing the meeting, the Prime Minister noted that to defeat the virus, the country needed to keep its readiness ahead of every variant. “Along with tackling Omicron, we need to start preparing for any future variant from now itself, ” he said. The Prime Minister added that India’s battle with the biggest pandemic of 100 years had now entered its third year. “Hard work is our only path and victory is our only option. We, 130 crore people of India, will surely emerge victorious against coronavirus with our efforts,” he said. Expand infrastructure Mr. Modi stressed the need to keep on expanding the medical infrastructure and lauded the States for using the Rs. 23,000-crore package given earlier to revamp the health infrastructure. Under this, more than 800 paediatric units all over the country, 1.5 lakh new ICU and HDU beds, more than 5,000 special ambulances and more than 950 liquid medical oxygen storage tank capacity had been added, said a release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office. Vaccine coverage At the meeting, Mr. Modi said made-in-India vaccines were proving their superiority all over the world and noted that it was a matter of pride for every Indian that today the country had given the first dose to about 92% of the adult population. The coverage of the second dose had also reached around 70%, he said.  Highlighting that within 10 days, India had vaccinated about 30 million of its adolescents, Mr. Modi said the sooner the precaution dose was given to front line workers and senior citizens, the more the capacity of our healthcare system would increase. “We have to intensify the Har Ghar Dastak campaign for 100% vaccination,” the Prime Minister said and stressed the need to counter any misinformation about vaccines or the practice of wearing masks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/better-to-focus-more-on-local-containment-modi-tells-cms/article64949975.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:44 IST,||BJP finalises sharing of seats with allies in Uttar Pradesh||After Ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government, Swami Prasad Maurya and Dara Singh Chauhan, quit the BJP, the party moved fast to bring seat-sharing talks with existing alliance partners, the Apna Dal and Nishad Party, to a close. A formal announcement is expected soon. While Mr. Chauhan has joined the Samajwadi Party (SP), Mr. Maurya is set to follow suit. Broad contours In a late-night meeting between Home Minister Amit Shah and leaders of the Apna Dal, Union Minister Anupriya Patel and her husband Ashish Patel, and Sanjay Nishad of the Nishad Party, the broad contours of the seat-sharing agreement were finalised. The Apna Dal will be fighting 10 to 14 seats and the Nishad Party 13 to 17. Both these parties are important in the non-Yadav Other Backward Classes space in Uttar Pradesh, especially in the eastern region of the State, and Mr. Maurya and Mr. Chauhan also belong to this section and have influence over. Sources in the BJP said that some candidates of the Apna Dal and the Nishad Party will also be fighting seats largely in eastern Uttar Pradesh on BJP ticket as well. The BJP’s speed in locking up these alliances reflects the equal alacrity shown by Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav to conclude as many tie-ups with parties claiming influence over non-Yadav OBC groups. His party has already said it was entering an alliance with the Suheldev Party led by former Uttar Pradesh Minister Om Prakash Rajbhar, and with Mahaan Dal. It was the BJP’s chipping away of the old Mandal support base of OBC plus Muslims, by drawing away non-Yadav OBCs (making up 35% of the vote in the State) that led to its successive electoral victories in Uttar Pradesh. With these alliances in the bag, the BJP feels it may overcome the setbacks of the last few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-finalises-sharing-of-seats-with-allies-in-uttar-pradesh/article64949978.ece

The accident occurred around 5 p.m. soon after the train left the New Domohani station. Officials said at least six persons had died and many were injured. Forty-five injured passengers have been rescued and admitted to the State-run health facilities at Maynaguri and Jalpaiguri. The railway authorities fear that the number of casualties may rise. There were 1053 passengers onboard the train at the time of the derailment. Rescue underway  Divisional Railway Manager, Alipurduar, Dilip Kumar Singh said preliminary reports suggested several coaches had derailed and one had overturned. One particular coach was seen partially on top of another. A spokesperson of the Northeast Frontier Railway said relief trains have been rushed to the site. The spokesperson said the Railways have announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 5 lakh for the family of each of the deceased, Rs. 1 lakh for the severely injured and Rs. 25,000 for passengers with simple injury. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said senior officers of the State government are supervising the rescue and relief operations. “Those injured will receive medical attention as early as possible. Situation being closely monitored from the State HQs,” she said on social media. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said 12 coaches had derailed near Maynaguri and rescue teams with gas cutters have reached the site of accident. The Minister is likely to visit the site of the accident. A high-level inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety has been ordered. Railway officials said the passenger train was not going at a high speed and the passenger load was also not high because of the COVID-19 situation. The accident occurred at a remote location and rescue operations were initially hampered due of lack of proper lighting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/5-dead-as-bikaner-guwahati-train-derails/article64949990.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:44 IST,||‘Priyanka has lit a spark in U.P., Congress cadres should take it forward’||Arguing that the Congress still rules the Opposition space in India, former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and current president of the party’s State unitKamal Nathspeakson the significance of the upcoming Assembly elections in five States and their impact on both the party and the Opposition .  What is the significance of the upcoming Assembly elections for the Congress and for the Opposition? Every election is significant. The question, however, is to what context we should look at these polls. The Lok Sabha elections are still a good two-and-a-half years away. There will be many lessons to be learnt. And I believe the results of these elections will be surprising. Today, we have, largely, a very enlightened electorate, [which is] very different from what we had 10 or 20 years ago. I am confident this electorate can see for themselves that no section of society is happy. How do you see Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s role in Uttar Pradesh? Will she be able to galvanise the cadres and voters alike? I recently visited Uttar Pradesh and I think she is doing fantastic work. She has managed to light a spark within the Congress and it is now for the Congress cadres to take it forward. There is a dissident group within your party that wants systemic change in the party’s structure. Isn’t the Congress worried that if the results are not favourable, it would once again bring the leadership question into focus? I wouldn’t call them dissidents. They are a group with a different opinion, and a difference in opinion alone does not make you a dissenter. These people have not laid down any conditions. They are only saying that in finality, something must be done to improve the party’s internal functioning and electoral performance. Listening to all voices, the party has already announced a schedule for elections. Right now, we are undertaking a membership drive, which has to precede the internal elections as per the party’s constitution. Your name too has been discussed as a potential party president in the last couple of years. Do we see you coming to Delhi for a national role? I am in Madhya Pradesh and I want to remain there. Elections are just 20 months away in the State and to shift to Delhi at this point of time, in any capacity or role, would mean that I ran away from my State and my responsibility. Even if internal elections are held, do you think a fair contest between the Gandhis and whoever decides to stand for the leadership position is possible in the Congress? We have had internal elections in the past and they have been fiercely fought. But if anybody from the Gandhi family is there, then it’s obvious that the people will prefer them. For the better part of post-Independence India, the Congress has been the ruling party but within seven years of being out of power, many other political parties are competing with you for the position of the primary Opposition force. Your comments. Every Opposition party in the country has certain regional pockets of strength. There is no cross-State party as yet apart from the Congress and, to a certain extent, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party). And I would only reluctantly give this status to the BJP because it managed to get a majority on its own only in three States while in the others, they manufactured a majority to grab power. It is essential that all Opposition parties come together on the common national problems and take a position in their respective States.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:44 IST,||India, China agree for more LAC talks||India and China on Thursday agreed to “stay in close contact and maintain dialogue” to work out a “mutually acceptable resolution” of remaining issues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), although the latest round of talks between military commanders did not yield an immediate breakthrough. While there was no agreement as yet to disengage in the three remaining areas of difference — on the agenda this week was Hot Springs, while differences in Demchok and Depsang are more pronounced with the prospects of an early resolution there unlikely — exchanges between the two sides during the 14th round of Corps Commander level talks, held on the Chinese side of the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point, struck a more positive note that the previous round, officials said. In October, the 13th round failed to yield a joint statement with both sides trading accusations, with India saying that China failed to offer any forward-looking suggestions while China described India’s proposals as unrealistic. A joint statement released on Thursday in New Delhi and Beijing indicated that progress had been made but that further work was needed to arrive at a resolution. The statement said the two sides “agreed to stay in close contact and maintain dialogue via military and diplomatic channels and work out a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest” and “also agreed that the next round of the Commanders’ talks should be held at the earliest”. New commanders The 14th round saw two new commanders from each side leading the talks, with the Indian delegation led by Lieutenant-General Anindya Sengupta, who has taken over as General Office Commanding (GOC) of the Leh-based 14 Corps. The Chinese side was led by Major-General Yang Lin, the new head of the PLA’s South Xinjiang Military District (SXMD). The joint statement said the two sides agreed “to work for the resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest” and that “this would help in restoration of peace and tranquility along the LAC in the Western Sector and enable progress in bilateral relations”. “The two sides also agreed to consolidate on the previous outcomes and take effective efforts to maintain the security and stability on the ground in the Western Sector including during winter,” the statement said. The statement acknowledged the need to resolve remaining issues “at the earliest”. Of the remaining disputes in Hot Springs, Demchok and Depsang, the expectation of a solution in the near-term is likely at Hot Springs. Both sides disengaged from Pangong Tso in February 2021 and from Patrolling Point 17 in the Gogra area in August. The Chinese side in earlier rounds were not willing to discuss proposals to disengage in Demchok and Depsang. On Wednesday, Army chief Gen. Manoj Naravane said there had been partial disengagement but added that a threat level remained and the Chinese had put in place a lot of infrastructure in forward areas. He said “it remains to be seen whether they will permanently station themselves there or whether they will be amenable to some kind of de-induction in the times to come”. Unconstructive remarks Asked by a foreign media outlet for a response to the Army chief’s comments, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, “China and India are in dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military channels to ease the situation at the border.” “We hope that certain individual on the Indian side would refrain from making unconstructive remarks,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-agree-for-more-lac-talks/article38269968.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:45 IST,||Not possible to demilitarise Siachen||We are “not averse” to demilitarisation of the Siachen glacier but the pre-condition is Pakistan has to accept the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL), Army chief General Manoj Naravane said on Wednesday, raising a fresh debate over the world’s highest battlefield, with experts saying it may not be ideal in the backdrop of the stand-off in eastern ladakh and the Chinese build-up. In contrast to the present comments, the Army chief had two years ago termed Siachen as a point of “collusive threat” between Pakistan and China and so “we should keep control”. However, with the stand-off in eastern Ladakh and massive build-up and expansion by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in sub-sector north which is very close to the Karakoram range and Soltoro ridge, several serving officials and experts noted that it would not be possible for India to vacate the crucial positions on the glacier. At the annual press conference, Gen. Naravane said, “Pakistan has to accept what are their positions and has to accept what are our positions.” He said the situation had occurred due to a unilateral attempt by Pakistan to change the status quo. The Line of Control (LoC) had been delineated to a point called NJ 9842, and thereafter, the understanding was that it will remain unoccupied. But Pakistan had made an attempt to occupy territory and “we were forced to take our countermeasures”, Gen. Naravane said. Siachen and Sir Creek have long been termed “low hanging fruits” in the past for resolution between India and Pakistan and the two countries have held 13 rounds of Defence Secretary-level talks on Siachen, the last one in June 2012. Former Northern Army Commander Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda said the Indian Army has not been averse to a disengagement at Siachen but it has not happened due to a reluctance by the Pakistan Army to accept the positions that are occupied by the Indian Army.  “Now the situation has completely changed with the PLA aggression in the sub sector north in eastern Ladakh. With the Siachen sector facing threats from both west and east, there is perhaps no question of any disengagement from Siachen,” he told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/not-possible-to-demilitarise-siachen/article38269973.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:44 IST,||Mother of Unnao rape victim, anti-CAA activist in Cong. list||The mother of the Unnao rape victim, an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) activist and an activist ASHA worker are among the 50 women candidates in the Congress’s first list of 125 candidates for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly election. Releasing the list at an online press conference on Thursday, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said it sends a “new message” that those “who face injustice have the power to fight back for their rights”. “The Congress party in U.P. will give you this power, support and help you in every possible way so that you can fight your battle. Come into politics, fight for your rights by being part of the power structure,” Ms. Vadra said. Asha Singh, mother of the rape victim, has been fielded from the Unnao Assembly seat and anti-CAA activist and party spokesperson in Uttar Pradesh, Sadaf Jafar, from the Lucknow central seat. The 2017 Unnao gang rape incident had made headlines as a former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar was not only convicted for sexually assaulting the 17-year-old victim but was also found to be involved in the death of her father. ASHA worker and activist Poonam Pandey, who fought for the rights of these workers, has been fielded from Shahjahanpur and Ram Raj Gond, a tribal leader who fought for the rights of the Adivasis in Sonbhadra, from the Ponga constituency. Ms. Vadra said the Congress is making a new beginning by fielding 40% women candidates while another 40% are youth.  “I don’t see this as creating new vote bank of young women. I see this as empowering women to ask for their rights and stand up for themselves. They are 50% of the population, and frankly, it is absolutely their right to participate in politics,” Ms. Vadra told The Hindu when asked if the Congress was creating a new constituency of women voters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mother-of-unnao-rape-victim-anti-caa-activist-in-cong-list/article64949981.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:45 IST,||Forest, tree cover in India up by 2,261 sq. km in two years||Forest and tree cover in the country has increased by 2,261 square kilometres since the last assessment in 2019, according to the India State of Forest Report-2021 released on Thursday. Releasing the report, Environment and Forest Minister Bhupender Yadav said the total forest and tree cover was 80.9 million hectares, which accounted for 24.62% of the geographical area of the country. The report said 17 States and Union Territories had more than 33% of their area under forest cover. Mr. Yadav said the Narendra Modi government’s focus was to enrich the forests qualitatively. The report found that there had been a 1,540 sq. km increase in forest cover and 721 sq. km increase in tree cover since the last report in 2019. Top 3 States “Increase in forest cover has been observed in open forest followed by very dense forest. Top three States showing increase in forest cover are Andhra Pradesh (647 sq. km) followed by Telangana (632 sq. km) and Odisha (537 sq. km),” a Ministry statement said. Madhya Pradesh had the largest forest cover, followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra. The top five States in terms of forest cover as a percentage of their total geographical area were Mizoram (84.53%), Arunachal Pradesh (79.33%), Meghalaya (76%), Manipur (74.34%) and Nagaland (73.90%). Mangrove cover The total mangrove cover in the country had increased by 17 sq. km, to reach 4,992 sq. km. The total carbon stock in forests was estimated to be 7,204 million tonnes, an increase of 79.4 million tonnes from 2019. The Ministry said the survey used mid-resolution satellite data, followed by “rigorous ground truthing” and information from other sources. “The accuracy level achieved in the current assessment is significantly high. The accuracy of forest cover classification has been assessed 92.99%. The accuracy of classification between forest and non-forest classes has been assessed 95.79% against internationally accepted accuracy of classification of more than 85%,” the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/forest-tree-cover-in-india-up-by-2261-sq-km-in-two-years/article64949973.ece

But their claim of a “first in the world” surgery made him wish India, Assam to be precise, was more appreciative of his medical experiments much ahead of their time. Dr. Baruah transplanted a pig’s heart, lung and kidneys to Purno Saikia, a 32-year-old end-stage organ failure patient on January 1, 1997. Jonathan Ho, a Hong Kong-based doctor assisted him in the transplantation at his research centre. But Sakia died a week later, triggering an uproar. The two doctors were arrested on January 10 under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, booked for culpable homicide and imprisoned for 40 days. “He is hurt but what he did 25 years ago is now past. He is now working on Baruah Genetic Engineering, where a number of diseases can be cured with biomolecules isolated from medicinal plants of India’s Himalayan region, without the need for any surgery or xenotransplantation,” S. A. Achrekar, a senior scientist at Dr. Baruah’s research institute in Sonapur said. The 72-year-old Dr. Baruah lost his voice after undergoing throat surgery some time ago. He spoke via Dr. Achrekar. “The U.S. surgeons are first in the way that they used a genetically modified pig. It is not easy for a human body to accept the organs of a pig. Time will tell whether the human body will accept the organ of a genetically-altered pig,” he said. “The wounds are healed but the scars remain,” Dr. Baruah said. But the fact that the patient survived for seven days implied xenotransplantation could be a reality, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-pig-heart-transplant-in-assam-in-1997/article38269964.ece

Mr. Gonsalves, the former MLA from the Santa Cruz Assembly constituency, was inducted into the Trinamool’s fold in the presence of MPs Mahua Moitra (the party’s Goa in-charge) and Sushmita Dev. The ex-Congressman said that Ms. Banerjee was the only person who could be projected as a credible alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Congress party has been sidelining its loyal workers…furthermore, there is no real ground work being done in any constituency. They are fast losing the people’s trust,” said Mr. Gonsalves.  According to sources, the real reason for his resignations appears to be the induction into Congress of former BJP Cabinet Minister and ex-Calangute legislator Michael Lobo. Mr. Lobo’s induction has also led to intense resentment within local Congress ranks, leading to the Calangute Congress block members resigning en masse .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/victor-gonsalves-joins-the-trinamool-in-goa/article38269938.ece

The BJP said the demand, made by the JD(U)’s parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha, had “no significance”. “Even in the last State Assembly poll and Parliament elections, the seat distribution between both alliance parties [the JD-U and the BJP] was more or less on a 50-50 formula. So, in the upcoming council poll too, this formula of equal number of seats should be applied,” Mr. Kushwaha had said. However, senior State BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Tarkishore Prasad rejected the demand and said “it holds no significance”. “The top party leadership of both the allies will decide on the seat distribution formula,” he said. State BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal added, “It is the BJP’s central parliamentary committee that will take a final decision on the issue.” Out of the 24 seats falling vacant, 13 are currently with the BJP, eight are held by the JD(U), two are with the RJD, and one seat is with the Congress.

They have given us the first five years. As per the seven promises made in Tiruchi, we are focussing on economy, agriculture, water resources, education-cum-health, urban development, rural infrastructure and social justice,” he said, exuding optimism that the people would come forward to give him another five-year term in 2026. Mr. Stalin said big industrialists in India and global investors now felt Tamil Nadu had a favourable investment climate. Such faith by the industry had helped the government take income-generating measures without affecting the economic infrastructure in the midst of the pandemic. While setting a mission to make Tamil Nadu a trillion-dollar economy, the Chief Minister did not believe in organising ostentatious global investors’ conference “for propaganda as done by the AIADMK government”. Instead, his government believed in providing infrastructure that instil confidence in investors along with transparent governance and expeditious clearance for projects.

The Jamiat, in its letter, said that the Dharam Sansad to be organised in Aligarh on January 22-23 or on any other dates at other places when the election process is on, be prohibited. It sought action against persons “habitually” indulging in hate speech and unlawful behaviour, and stated that it is the primary responsibility of the Election Commission to ensure peaceful and fair elections. “These persons are clearly organising the Dharam Sansad to bring communal invective into the public discourse during elections and they must be stopped,” the Jamiat letter said. A group of citizens led by former president of Aligarh Muslim University Students' Union Salman Imtiaz had also last week asked the district authorities not to allow the Dharam Sansad event in Aligarh which they claimed could vitiate the atmosphere in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. Sanatan Hindu Sewa Sanstha has proposed to hold the Dharam Sansad in Aligarh on the theme of role of seers in present politics.

Mr. Saini, an MLA from Saharanpur, follows the path of Swami Prasad Maurya and Dara Singh Chauhan, both OBC leaders who resigned from the Yogi Adityanath Cabinet over the last two days, accusing the BJP government of disregarding the OBC and Dalit people and their leaders. Also, BJP MLA from Shikohabad in Firozabad Mukesh Verma and Vinay Shakya from Auraiya resigned from the BJP accusing it of neglecting leaders and elected representatives from the Dalit, OBC and minority communities. BJP ally Apna Dal MLA Amar Singh Chaudhary from Shorathganj in Siddharth Nagar also quit the party, so did Bala Prasad Awasthi of Lakhimpur Kheri. Mr. Maurya is the “voice of the oppressed,” said Mr. Verma, a statement echoed by Mr. Shakya. “He is our leader. I am with him,” said Mr. Verma, a day before Mr. Maurya is scheduled to announce his next step amid a strong possibility of either joining the Samajwadi Party or entering into an alliance with it. In recent weeks, more than a dozen BJP MLAs have joined the SP or its ally RLD in an indication of support for their alliance. These include Dara Singh Chauhan, Radha Krishna Sharma, Swami Prasad Maurya, Dharam Singh Saini, Rakesh Rathore, Bhagwati Sagar, Madhuri Verma, Mukesh Verma, Avtar Singh Badhana, Roshan Lal Verma and Bhagwati Sagar. Amid the exodus of the OBC leaders to the SP, the BJP is trying to reclaim the OBC space it has dominated for the past few years. Party State chief Swatantra Dev Singh played up Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has often used his OBC identity to connect with voters, as the guardian of the backward sections. Mr. Modi keeps the poor, Dalit, deprived and backward sections in his heart, said Mr. Singh, himself an OBC. Mr. Modi embraced, empowered, honoured and considered his own those sections of society whom the Opposition only exploited, he said. Taking a dig at the BJP MLAs who quit the party in favour of Mr. Yadav, he said those who did not get a ticket in the “double engine train” were given tickets on black by “Tipu Sultan” for his rickety vehicle. Social representation  No government had given as much social, economic and political representation to the OBCs as the BJP did, Mr. Singh said. For us ‘P’ means uplift of “ Pichda ,” for some ‘P’ means “ Pita-Putr-Parivar ,” he said.  The defection of MLAs from the BJP, in particular the ones from the OBC castes, is bound to provide a boost to the bargaining power of its two allies — Nishad Party and the Apna Dal. The SP has already stitched a formidable caste alliance with half-a-dozen smaller OBC-based parties as it aggressively pushes to expand its base for the upcoming poll.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-suffers-another-blow-in-up-as-minister-quits/article38269953.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:44 IST,||Cong. will come a cropper if it contests alone: Sena||Frustrated in its attempts to create a tripartite anti-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition in Goa, similar to the one in Maharashtra, an upset Shiv Sena told the Congress it would not reach double digits in the upcoming Goa Assembly election if the party contested on its own. Such was the political scenario in the coastal State, Shiv Sena MP and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut, the prime mover behind creating a Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA)-like coalition in Goa, said on Thursday. Election to the 40-member Assembly will be held on February 14. The Sena, the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) share power in Maharashtra’s ruling MVA government. “The Congress has merely two MLAs in Goa, a majority of its legislators having defected to the BJP… We [the Shiv Sena and the NCP] had offered to support the Congress in these trying times. But I do not know what the Congress is thinking. It cannot cross the single-digit mark if it contests alone,” Mr. Raut said in New Delhi. The Sena MP, who had apparently held discussions with the All-India Congress Committee (AICC)’s Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao, the Congress’s Legislative Party (CLP) leader in Goa Digambar Kamat, and Goa Congress chief Girish Chodankar, said he had placed a proposal that the Congress contest in 30 of the 40 Assembly seats and leave the rest to its allies. According to Mr. Raut, these 10 Assembly seats, which could be allotted to the Sena, the NCP and the Goa Forward Party (GFP), were areas where the Congress had not won elections in the past several decades. The Congress already has a pre-poll alliance in Goa with the Vijai Sardesai-led GFP. Mr. Raut said while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was favourable to the idea of an alliance, the local Congress leadership took a different view. The Shiv Sena was ready to back the candidature of Utpal Parrikar, son of BJP leader and late Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, should he decide to contest. Mr. Utpal, who has expressed interest in contesting from Panaji, has been disenchanted with the current BJP leadership under Pramod Sawant for some time now. Mr. Raut said the Sena had supported the family of Independent Lok Sabha member from Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Mohan Delkar, who was found dead in a Mumbai hotel last year. Mr. Delkar’s wife Kalaben Delkar had later won the Lok Sabha bypoll as a Shiv Sena candidate. On Wednesday, the BJP’s Goa in-charge Devendra Fadnavis had dismissed speculation surrounding Utpal Parrikar’s candidature, remarking that the party could not grant a ticket to him just because he was Manohar Parrikar’s son. Meanwhile, Mr. Fadnavis, who is on a four-day tour of Goa, poked fun at the Sena. “They are contesting to win at least one seat where they can save its deposit,” said Mr. Fadnavis. It was competing against the NOTA (None of The Above) vote share, the BJP leader said. “It has been seen in the past that the Sena has never been able to get more than the total votes polled under the NOTA category,” Mr. Fadnavis said. The BJP, he said, was confident of forming the next government in Goa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-will-come-a-cropper-if-it-contests-alone-sena/article64949988.ece

In the first wave, it took around 10-12 days, while the doubling time was eight days during the second wave. But in the third wave, cases are doubling every two or two-and-a-half days, said Health and Family Welfare Minister K. Sudhakar on Thursday. Dr. Sudhakar pointed out that between January 1 and 11, there were 62,641 active cases across Karnataka. Around 6% of the people who tested positive were hospitalised, while 1% were in COVID Care Centres. The remaining 93% were in home isolation, said the Minister. For comparison, he presented the caseload on December 28, 2021, when Karnataka reported 356 cases, of which 269 were in Bengaluru. “By January 5, we had 3,605 cases in Bengaluru and 641 in the rest of the State. On January 11, we had 10,800 cases in Bengaluru alone and 3,673 in the rest of the State,” he said. Within a fortnight, the cases increased by 32.64% in Bengaluru Urban, 32.65% in BBMP, and 36.44% in the State. Increase testing Explaining the plan of action, Dr. Sudhakar said that currently at least 2 lakh samples are tested every day. “We will increase it further. There are around 265 labs operational in the State and nine genomic labs. We have a capacity to sequence 1,875 samples in one batch,” the Minister said. Amidst fears of children contracting COVID-19, 30% of the beds in district and taluk hospitals have been reserved for children with COVID-19.

As part of our efforts to revamp the food and beverages business, we are looking for a name for our restaurants,” Minister for Tourism M. Mathiventhan, told The Hindu .  The restaurants are being renovated with new furniture and better lighting to improve the ambience. “We are looking at our menus too. Some items that are popular among customers are being included and some old ones being dropped,” he said. Mr. Mathiventhan said a specialist manager in food and beverages had been appointed to train staff, including the chefs. TTDC Managing Director Sandeep Nanduri said the organisation, which was in its 51st year, was taking a re-look at it’s food and beverages business. “One of the main things is to train the manpower and bring our people up to industry standards. The F and B manager will provide them continuous training,” he said. The Corporation has tied up with online food aggregators and has conducted a trial run for supply of food through online mode. “We did this at the drive-in restaurant. We now plan to start this service from outlets in places like Madurai and Coimbatore too,” he said. R. Rangachari, a long-time industry insider, said the F and B business was the backbone of all hotels. “Stays will be only for a few days. But people like to eat out more than they stay. It brings in steady income,” he said. An industry watcher said that change of attitude of TTDC staff was the first step. “They should always understand that guests and the organisation too should benefit from their service, not just themselves. Most of TTDC properties are situated in beautiful locations, unless the staff too buck up, it won’t benefit the organisation. Restaurants and hotels run by governments of Goa, Kerala and Odisha are good. If we try, we too can make it work,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restaurants-under-ttdc-to-be-revamped/article64950057.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:22 IST,TAMIL NADU||Marginal, yet steady rise in ICU admissions||There is a small but steady rise in the number of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU) in hospitals in Chennai. Old age and co-morbidities are the main factors pushing up these admissions, say doctors. Many of these patients were also not vaccinated. According to hospitalisation data in the daily bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, the number of ICU admissions have gradually risen from 82 on January 1 to 256 on January 13. Doctors across hospitals observed that only the elderly with co-morbidities were admitted to ICUs as of now. While some said there could be a mix of patients with Delta and Omicron variants in the ICU, which cannot be confirmed without sequencing of samples, a few pointed out that there were no significant findings of lung involvement in chest CT as of now. S. Chandrasekar, professor and head, Department of Medicine, Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, said persons who were not vaccinated had more severe disease. “Age and multiple co-morbidities play a crucial role. Here, 80% of patients are aged above 60 and have uncontrolled co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, renal ailments and cancer. They have a more severe form of disease,” he said. ICU team strengthened While Omicron is known to cause mild disease, he said: “It has still not replaced Delta variant, which is in circulation. Given the rise in the number of cases, ICU admissions will be more. So, we are prepared and have strengthened the ICU team with recent management and triaging patients in the wards through a six-minute walk test to ascertain the severity of the disease and identify patients who are deteriorating early. All 19 patients in ICU admission now had significant elevation of C-Reactive Protein and D-Dimer on admission, which are immunological markers for severity of the disease.,” he said. One of the main reasons for steady rise in ICU admissions was co-morbidities, with diabetes, hypertension and obesity being the main ones, according to E. Theranirajan, dean of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. “Many of them are aged above 70 and are not vaccinated.,” he said. Of the 172 patients in admission, 19 were in the ICU. Some were seeking medical help late and there were instances of referrals from private hospitals as well. K. Narayanasamy, director of Government Corona Hospital, said the number of ICU admissions was slightly on the rise. At any given point of time, there are 10 to 15 patients in the ICU of the hospital. “Nevertheless, they required minimal oxygen of two to four litres. There are no young or middle-aged persons in the ICU. Age and co-morbidities are the key factors. “We are admitting only those who require oxygen support and drugs,” he said. “When compared to the second wave, the number of ICU admissions is less now. When we take overall hospitalisations, the number of persons requiring oxygen support and ventilatory support is very less when compared to the previous wave of Delta variant. So, there is a clear difference between Delta and Omicron variants on the severity of disease,” said R. Ebenezer, senior consultant and head, Critical Care Services Apollo Speciality Hospitals, Vanagaram. It was the elderly with immuno-compromised conditions and not vaccinated who were becoming sicker now. “This is a small number. Omicron is rapidly replacing Delta variant,” he said and added that in the observation of radiologists, there was nil or minimal lung involvement found in chest CTs. “In the second wave, if we took 10 CTs, eight found lung involvement. This has almost reversed now. Almost every CT is negative for lung involvement or has minimal involvement,” he said. Dr. Chandrasekar pointed out there was no significant findings in CT scans now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/marginal-yet-steady-rise-in-icu-admissions-across-hospitals/article64950117.ece

Stalin on Thursday said he had cleared 2,619 of the 2,683 files that came to him since he assumed office in May last year. Giving a break-up, Mr. Stalin said he had cleared the files he received in May (144), June (220), July (227), August (241), September (422), October (450) and November (559) last year. Except for 64 of the 420 files he received in December last, which were in various stages of discussion, the rest were cleared, he said. In a recorded video released by the State government, Mr. Stalin said, “The speedy clearance of files is indicative of an efficient government.” He has also advised his Cabinet colleagues to clear files expeditiously, and has been monitoring the same. “I have been leading a government under which files do not stagnate. I am not a Chief Minister who sits at the Secretariat and keeps issuing orders. I am among those who have realised their thoughts and implemented them as Chief Minister,” he said. The DMK government will not only implement the schemes it had promised in its election manifesto, but also go beyond them, he said, adding that 49 government orders had been issued, as against 66 announcements made in the Governor’s address to the House.  During the past eight months, 1,641 announcements were made, including those in the Governor’s address, the Budget, the Agriculture Budget and suo motu statements in the Assembly. Of them, government orders had been issued for 1,238 announcements, accounting for over 75%, Mr. Stalin said.  Assuring the people that the status of the remaining announcements will be made known in his next speech, Mr. Stalin said, “One thing is certain. I will implement all the promises I have made. There is no need for anyone to doubt it.” Recalling his visits to places across the State, he said he had visited a COVID-19 ward, water-logged streets, vaccination camps, ration shops and police stations, among others. He said his government had cleared within 100 days over 2.5 lakh petitions he had received during his electoral campaign. Over 2.15 crore families had received COVID-19 relief assistance of Rs. 4,000 each, he said. While 2.15 crore families had received the dry rations distributed by the government as part of the COVID-19 relief kit, 50 lakh people had benefited from the Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam scheme, he noted. Under the Illam Thedi Kalvi scheme, 80,138 centres were set up, and 1,73,792 lakh children who dropped out of school were identified and re-enrolled, he said. The Dearness Allowance for over 18.30 lakh State government employees, teachers and pensioners was increased, and gold loans were waived, benefiting 13.50 lakh families, the Chief Minister said. Loans to the tune of Rs. 2,000 crore, obtained by women’s self-help groups, had been waived, and 4,482 individuals had benefited from the Innuyir Kaapom scheme. Pongal gift hampers were being distributed to 2.15 crore families, he said. “Above all, we have provided to several crores of women the right to travel in buses without having to pay a fare, which would benefit them every day,” Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-releases-govt-report-card-says-2619-files-have-been-cleared/article64950081.ece

The Association of Indian Universities recently signed an agreement to this effect with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Under the agreement, the students will visit 10 agricultural universities in the country, in batches of 25 each. The batches will tour the agricultural universities for three days. At the end of each day, a student representative will share their experience and perspectives. The project duration is for a year. Book and film At the end of the exercise, a book and a film on agri-tourism will be made. “The aim is to familiarise students with agriculture. Most students in the cities do not know what agriculture entails. We have to educate the students about the difficulties the farmers face. We have to orient them. For this purpose, we have developed a scheme for non-agricultural students to visit agricultural universities,” said Secretary-General of AIU G. Thiruvasagam, one of the signatories to the agreement. The scheme will benefit 1,500 students and the ICAR will identify 10 agricultural universities for the visit.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 04:04 IST,TAMIL NADU||CMWSSB working on 24-hour water supply||The Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) is planning to implement a round-the-clock drink-from-tap water supply in core parts of the city instead of supplying to storage sumps in houses. The water board is preparing a detailed project report to identify deficiencies in the water distribution network and chalk out improvement plans. The 24x7 facility has been implemented in cities like Puri in Odisha where water can be used directly from the tap for drinking and cooking, the officials said. The pipelines made of cast iron or PVC in most areas are more than three or four decades old. This often led to problems in water reaching houses in the tailend of the network, besides causing leaks and contamination. At present, most pipes get choked as water supply is intermittent. Officials said there were plans to improve the existing distribution system in core parts of the city such as Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Anna Nagar, Teynampet, Kodambakkam and Adyar. This would be done as part of the project to set up a 400 million litres a day capacity desalination plant at Perur on the East Coast Road. With an aim to provide round-the-clock equitable water supply, the water board plans to replace old pipes and provide additional ones in uncovered streets. Overhead tanks “We will construct overhead tanks and divide core parts as district metered areas (DMA) where boundary valves will be closed and pipes to neighbouring areas will be disconnected. This will help monitor the flow and leaks, water supplied and consumed and reduce non-revenue water,” said an official. Only a few areas like Kilpauk, K.K. Nagar and Valluvar Kottam have the concept of supply from OHTs. However, as the supply is done only for limited hours and water is stored in sumps, consumers in the tailend areas of the network may not get sufficient quantities. Drinking water pumped into lines may flow to adjacent areas. In the new system, more overhead tanks will be built and water supplied to only a particular ward after disconnecting all interlinked pipelines. Besides fixing flow meters in the pipelines, all the households will be provided with metered connections to tally supply and consumption. The system has been designed to cater to the city’s projected population in the year 2055. The existing pipelines run for about 5,000 km in core areas. The CMWSSB has engaged a consultant to study the condition of pipelines, length of pipes to be replaced and the requirements for converting the existing system into a 24x7 water supply system. Once the detailed project report for some core areas is completed by March, work will commence in the coming fiscal. Project report for the remaining areas will be completed by the year-end, the officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cmwssb-working-on-24-hour-water-supply/article64950344.ece

With their partnership on the project coming to an end next month, WIA is preparing to submit their policy recommendations and strategy for climate action to the government. “While we are quick to speak about climate change and jump into relief work once natural disasters occur, there should be a lot more conversation, both nationally and at the State-level, about climate policies in the long run. Gender and climate change in particular needs special attention — women and other vulnerable groups are severely affected during such events,” said Padma Venkatraman, President, WIA. The core of the project, WIA said, is the deeper examination and analysis of the existing State-level and national-level climate change policies through the gender lens. As part of their project with GUCCI, Ms. Padma said they carried out several awareness campaigns and training programmes for women belonging to different sections in the city. Workshops Stakeholder workshops with government officials, NGOs and academicians to discuss climate action policies for gender sensitivity were also held. “An area of special focus for us was working with the women from the fishing community, who reside near the Marina Loop Road in Chennai, for over four months. “We engaged with them on sea safety, hygiene, sanitation and climate change, and also conducted waste management and skill training programmes. They were also encouraged to form self-help groups,” Ms. Padma said. Greening initiatives such as tree planting and raising vegetable gardens were carried out, and the local community hall was equipped with solar panels. To help the women have a steady source of income when it is not the fishing season, they were guided on selling seafood pickles and fish manure. Based on the inputs received throughout the course of the project, policy recommendations will be prepared and handed over to the government. Focus “The focus was on bringing the community together and working on adapting and mitigating the effects of climate change. Our efforts to build climate resilience in the city and sensitize the public to the gender dimensions of climate change will continue post the completion of the project,” Ms. Padma added.

Cows, bulls, goats and sheep that appear tired and unable to walk would be brought in by their owners. “There will be around 20 animals in our college. Veterinary dispensaries in other areas also receive animals with similar symptoms. This means they are extremely sick owing to SARA — Subacute Ruminal Acidosis — and if such animals are not treated immediately, they may die,” said P. Selvaraj, Professor of Medicine, Madras Veterinary College. He explained that Ruminal Acidosis was caused by excessive feeding of Pongal, rice and other sweets on the day of ‘Maattu Pongal’. “These sugary foods that reach the cow’s stomach get fermented in an abnormal way and cause a health issue in the cows and other ruminant animals; this is called SARA. In severe cases, it is called Ruminal Acidosis. If too much acid is produced owing to excessive sugary items in the stomach, it may even turn fatal,” he said, advising people to feed the animals with hay and ‘agathi keerai’ . When an animal is brought in for treatment, veterinarians will collect the rumen fluid and examine it for their microbial status. Appropriate treatment will be given based on the cow’s stomach health. But the animal will take days to recover; during the period of recovery, the milk yield will come down drastically. Festival-related Ruminal Acidosis, however, is mostly found in cattle in urban areas where people cross the limit while feeding the animals with sweet. It is not just the owners but also others who offer food to the animals on the occasion. Cows, bulls, goats and sheep roaming the streets of urban areas fall prey to the culture of feeding sweets on the day of ‘Maattu Pongal’. Animals become sick because Ruminal Acidosis destroys millions of microbes, consisting of a variety of tiny organisms called protozoa, bacteria and other microbial organisms, that reside in their stomach. These microbes help the cattle digest hay, grass and other feed and enable them to produce the tasty milk, said Dr. Selvaraj. “Give them the lowest possible amount of sweets and a lot of paddy straw or green fodder. This fodder helps in better digestion and good milk yield. Fodder items provide a substrate for the millions of microbes to act on them and maintain the stomach in very good health. A good stomach is essential for good health,” Dr. Selvaraj said. He also advised people to avoid feeding cows with leftover food from functions or marriages and low-priced rice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/too-much-sweet-pongal-not-good-for-cows-veterinarians/article64950258.ece

A special bench, comprising NGT Chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, three judicial members and an expert member, also directed statutory authorities to take appropriate action with respect to the construction already completed. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change submitted to the Tribunal that no approval was sought for the project. ‘Needed for fishermen’ The Collector submitted that the facility was needed by fishermen even if it was not permissible under the CRZ regulations. The Bench noted that the stand of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) was that there was confusion whether the area fell under the CRZ. As per the status report filed by the Tamil Nadu Nadu Coastal Zone Management Authority, the construction was not permissible, and it was the responsibility of the District Coastal Zone Management Authority to enforce the regulations, the Bench noted. “The counsel for the State fairly stated that even though, strictly speaking, the construction may be in violation of the CRZ Notification, 2011, it was undertaken bona fide in the interest of fishermen,” the Bench noted. The counsel submitted that since there was apprehension that there could be unauthorised development due to the construction of a road, the Bench could pass appropriate directions. “Having given due consideration to the matter, we are of the view that even if according to the State the activity is in the interest of the fishermen, the same cannot be done by violating the law. No illegality can be justified,” the NGT said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ngt-directs-govt-to-stop-work-on-fish-landing-centre-in-thoothukudi/article38270383.ece

Palaniswami on Thursday criticised Health Minister Ma. Subramanian over his statement that the government had stopped sending samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune to confirm cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. In a statement, Mr. Palaniswami recalled that at the time of the outbreak of the first wave of the pandemic in March 2020, when his party was in power, there was only one testing centre in the State, located at the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy. But by the end of April 2021, 265 testing centres had been set up. Hence, the State government should start taking steps to establish testing centres for the Omicron variant in every district. The former Chief Minister observed that when the disease was spreading fast, the Health Minister should not have issued a statement that there was no need for a major lockdown. Demanding that the government be transparent with the data on the prevalence of the disease, Mr. Palaniswami said it was the primary duty of the government to provide proper treatment to those affected. Disinfection measures In a separate statement, AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam said there had been reports that the spraying of disinfectant and the application of bleaching powder had not been carried out since the beginning of the year, even though cases were on the rise.  Contrasting the current situation with how the previous AIADMK regime handled the pandemic, he contended that the measures taken by his party while in power had helped contain the spread of the disease. The measures included the spraying of disinfectants in government offices on Saturdays and on buses of the State transport corporations, and supplying kabasura kudineer, a herbal concoction for boosting immunity, and tablets.  Pointing out that it took two to three days to get the reports on the COVID-19 tests conducted by agencies of the local bodies, Mr. Panneerselvam called for the early preparation and presentation of the reports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eps-slams-decision-not-to-send-samples-to-niv-for-omicron-testing/article38270343.ece

The Corporation Council had recently passed a resolution approving the appointment of a project management consultant to manage and supervise the Rs. 79.30-crore work, which involved development of the canal for the 3.30 km starting from Mettupalayam Road. The Corporation had obtained administrative and technical sanctions from the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration in February last year. The Corporation sources familiar with the Sanganoor Canal project said the civic body had planned to execute the work in two phases – Phase I for Rs. 49 crore and Phase II for Rs. 30.30 crore. And, both the phases covered only the 3.30 km stretch of the canal between the Mettupalayam Road and Sathyamangalam Road. For the first 200 m or so, the Corporation would build gabion wall on the canal’s banks and thereafter construct reinforced concrete walls. The sources said there was also an idea to lay concrete on the canal’s bed for the 3.30 km stretch, but the civic body was yet to take a call. The work also involved removing encroachments on the canal banks. In the Corporation’s estimates there were more than 500 houses to be evicted. The Corporation was working in close coordination with the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board, which had identified the families living there and readied alternative accommodation at its various projects. The sources also said that the Corporation had started the work near Mettupalayam Road sometime ago but stopped because of monsoon. It hoped to complete the project within one-and-a-half years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corporation-to-start-sanganoor-canal-work-soon/article64950329.ece

Selvakumar (63) of Roja Nagar in Chennimalai was running the farm luring investors of huge returns. He collected Rs. 5,56,55,000 from 140 investors, but refused to return their money in 2013. As investors demanded their money, he went into hiding. Investors lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) and a case was registered. A search was on to nab Selvakumar, but he could not be traced. Later, an arrest warrant was also issued against him. The Special Court under the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interests of Depositors (TNPID) Act in Coimbatore declared him as an absconder.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 05:06 IST,TAMIL NADU||HC ruling on legal heirship certificate||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has held that when a brother or a sister apply for legal heirship certificate of their deceased brother or sister who died without leaving any Class - I heir, then the same can be examined by the Tahsildar. The legal heirship certificate can be issued if there are no rival claimants. Justice C.V. Karthikeyan observed that though in law, a brother or a sister would only be a Class - II legal heir, but if the deceased died a bachelor or a spinster or after marriage had died issueless and the spouse had also predeceased him/her, then forcing a party to go to a civil court, particularly when there is no defendant to contest the claim, would only be encouraging a legal fiction to be created. The judge observed that the suit would only be a mockery as it would still be a plaint filed by a plaintiff with no defendant and the court would also proceed only on the basis of the facts pleaded and pass an order in accordance with the relief sought. A judicial proceeding may not always be the proper forum to check the bona fide of an application seeking legal heirship certificate. Tahsildar or Village Administrative Officer would know the details of the family and would be in a better position to examine whether the applicant has come forward with a bona fide application or not. There cannot be a shifting of this burden to the civil court in all cases and the revenue authorities have a duty to discharge in this regard, the judge said. Disposing of a batch of petitions, the court referred to the judgments passed in this regard by the High Court and issued a set of directions to the Tahsildars. The judge said that if the deceased had two wives during his lifetime, the parties will have to approach the civil court seeking legal heirship certificate. If it is an issue of claiming legal heirship certificate for a deceased brother or sister and when there are no rival claimants, Tahsildars have to make necessary enquiry and proceed to issue legal heirship certificate. If there are rival claimants, even among Class - II legal heirs or the status of the applicant is disputed, then the Tahsildars have to direct the parties to resolve the issues before the civil court, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-ruling-on-legal-heirship-certificate/article38270642.ece

The court was hearing the petition filed by T. Muthu of Madurai, whose 13-year-old son, M.S. Manoj Kumar, was electrocuted as he touched an electric pole while crossing a lane during rain in 2017. The family sought compensation from authorities, claiming that the death was due to their negligence. The authorities submitted that electricity passed to the pole due to rain and that the boy died due to the ‘act of God’. Justice C.V. Karthikeyan expressed strong condemnation after the Chairman and Managing Director of TNEB, CMD of Tangedco and the Superintending Engineer, Tangedco, Madurai, failed to file their counter affidavits. “May be, since they are holding the posts of Chairman and Managing Director of TNEB and Tangedco and Superintending Engineer, they are of the opinion that it is below their dignity to put their thoughts in writing with respect to a claim seeking compensation for the death of a young boy of 13 years over whom they are not directly bothered,” the judge observed. ‘No sense of duty’ They appeared to have no sense of duty either to a citizen or to this court and this court could state that the officials had lost their right or authority to continue in their particular offices. As public servants, they had a duty to discharge to every citizen of the country. They might deny the contentions raised in the petition, but they could not hide behind a counter filed by the Assistant Engineer, Karuppayoorani, Madurai, the judge said. Here, the facts were very clear. The boy died of electrocution on touching the electric pole. Negligence was apparent on the face of the records, the judge said. The authorities agreed to pay the compensation amount.  May be they think it is below their dignity to put their thoughts in writing ... for the death of a boy over whom they are not directly bothered Justice C.V.

The duo had murdered the woman in her house and stole her jewels. A Division Bench of Justices S. Vaidyanathan and G. Jayachandran upheld the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Mahila Court in Madurai in 2018. The court dismissed the appeals filed by the convicts, V. Shyamala and her friend R. Ramesh. Shyamala, a tailor, and her friend Ramesh, a driver, who were in need of money, conspired to murder K. Pavithra. Shyamala used to stitch clothes for Pavaithra. On the day of murder, Pavithra was alone at home. The duo took advantage of the fact that Pavithra’s mother-in-law would leave for work. They went to the house under the pretext of delivering stitched clothes. Pavithra offered them tea. During the course of conversation, suddenly Shyamala and Ramesh attacked Pavithra. They tried strangulating her and then stabbed the woman with knives. Pavithra died of injuries. They stole jewels from the house. Pavithra’s husband was working in Dubai and she was to join him shortly. Based on a complaint lodged by N. Kumaragurubaran, father of Pavithra, the Madurai police registered an FIR. The two were arrested and following investigation a charge sheet was filed. The Mahila Court sentenced them to life imprisonment for the murder. Dismissing the criminal appeal filed by the convicts, the judges held that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the convicts beyond any reasonable doubt and the findings of the trial court regarding the guilt of the convicts was well fortified by the evidence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/life-sentence-imposed-on-two-upheld/article38270636.ece

The case against her was booked in 2016. During the 2016 election campaign in Tirunelveli, Premalatha Vijayakanth is said to have told the public that if anyone offers them cash for votes, they should demand payment of Rs. 1 lakh per person. Following the speech, the Tirunelveli police registered a case against her for offences under the Indian Penal Code and the Representation of the People Act. The case was investigated and a final report was filed. The case was taken on file by the Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner sought to quash the proceedings. Quashing the proceedings, Justice G.R. Swaminathan observed that the petitioner’s words can never be understood as interfering with the free exercise of any electoral right and she was not casting any undue influence on the voters. The judge observed that the speech must be taken as throwing a challenge on those who were indulging in such acts of disbelief of manpower. That apart, a degree of exaggeration and margin must be permitted in such election speeches. The court said that the offences were non-cognisable offences. Therefore, the Tirunelveli police could not have registered the First Information Report on their own.

Officials in Nagapattinam district from which Mayiladuthurai was carved continue to hold additional charge for departments of Employment and Training, Fire and Rescue Services, District Industries Centre, and a few other departments. According to representatives of public welfare organisations, the process of shifting the remaining departments must be expedited in the interests of the public. The very purpose behind formation of the new district with Mayiladuthurai as headquarters was the distant location of Nagapattinam town. For the public in Mayiladuthurai, an entire day would be required to travel to Nagapattinam to secure important certificates and to get back. Not all departments have started functioning; and out of those that have shifted, many function out of rented buildings. According to official sources, the process of registration of land for construction of a modern collectorate complex has been completed, paving way for the Public Works Department to go ahead with the construction work. Tender floated Last year, the PWD had floated a tender for the Rs. 114 crore project on a 21-acre site belonging to Dharmapuram Adheenam. The land transfer process has been carried out, sources said. Completion of the Collectorate Complex will enable the district administration to house almost all departments in the new buildings. Though the Collectorate Complex will be a little away from Mayiladuthurai town, the government had no option left since such a large land parcel was not available in the town. An order from the Commissioner of Revenue Administration is awaited for formation of an additional division with Sirkazhi as headquarters. A public hearing for this purpose was conducted on July 30, 2021. Mayiladuthurai district was formed with Kuthalam, Mayiladuthurai, Sirkazhi, and Tranquebar taluks. Demands for creation of two new taluks with Kollidam and Sembanaarkovil as headquarters have also been raised by the public. Public satisfied By and large, there is a sense of satisfaction among the public after formation of the new district, R. Seyon, Chief Coordinator, Federation of Advocates for Mayiladuthurai district, said. Most departments in the new district have started functioning and the remaining ones would be shifted as soon as the new Collectorate Complex is constructed, he said. The Public Works Department, sources said, it will require at least a year for readying the building infrastructure for the Collectorate Complex.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 05:50 IST,TAMIL NADU||‘Establish a modernised slaughterhouse in U.T.’||Veterinarians have stressed the need to set up a modernised slaughterhouse that could meet ISI standards in the Union Territory, considering the growing concern across the world over zoonotic diseases. The growing demand for meat had led to the mushrooming of unregulated slaughterhouse-cum-meat stalls across Puducherry. Veterinarians said that during French rule, the Union Territory had a robust system in place where only meat from a licensed slaughterhouse would be allowed for sale. “In fact, the French took great care of animal health. In 1935, the French Administrator created a cell in the Public Health Department for treatment of animals. A law was promulgated in 1937 under the authority of the mayor of the municipality to look after public health. The law made it mandatory for staff to inspect slaughterhouses regularly. Meat was sold only from a licensed slaughterhouse. Now, anyone could slaughter the animal at any place and sell meat then and there. If this goes on unchecked, it will have serious public health ramifications,’” a government veterinarian said. It is common knowledge that open air slaughtering of animals for the purpose of meat is a threat to the environment and public hygiene. During the French regime, closed door and licensed slaughterhouses alone were permitted to do business, it was pointed out. There used to be close monitoring of slaughterhouses from the point of public health. Separate sales centres were also introduced so that there would be no inconvenience for shoppers, and there was no mix up of mutton stalls with the other wings of the trade and business. “With Puducherry’s rapid development necessitating quick establishment of housing colonies, public hygiene should be kept in mind without interference from any quarters,” said another veterinarian. “A hygienic slaughterhouse with close monitoring is the need of the hour. Apart from the public health angle, the region is fast emerging as a major tourist destination. It will not augur well for the Union Territory to allow people to slaughter animals on roadsides, especially on Sundays when weekend tourists swell the town,” the veterinarian added. According to an official, the Government in 2016 was on the verge of signing an agreement with a private player to establish a modern slaughterhouse at Attupatti.  “The plan was to modernise the existing slaughterhouse at Attupatti with all facilities as per ISI standards. The Union Ministry of Food Processing Industries had agreed to provide a grant for the construction. It did not take off due to various reasons, including opposition from certain people in the locality. Now, we are planning to have a modern slaughterhouse under the Smart City Project, near Thengaithittu. It is important to have such a facility to guard against the public health and environmental hazards caused by the open slaughtering of animals,” a senior official told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/establish-a-modernised-slaughterhouse-in-ut/article64950201.ece

The padayatra , seeking implementation of the Mekedatu project was a “success”, the party said, adding that the present move to suspend it is temporary.   The over-100 km march, themed “ Namma Neeru Namma Hakku ” (“our water, our right”) and previously scheduled to culminate at Bengaluru on January 19, was stopped here by the party on the fifth day of the padayatra . The march will be resumed and the “remaining distance” covered after the relaxation of restrictions with the fading of the third wave of the coronavirus, the party said.   The State’s main Opposition party announced its move after Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai appealed to the Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D. K. Shivakumar to suspend the padayatra . Mr. Siddaramaiah said his party was concerned about the health of the people.   “It is our responsibility to see to it that COVID doesn’t spread because of our padayatra . We don’t want people to feel that we are responsible for a worsening COVID situation,” he said. The party has hence decided to “temporarily halt” the padayatra here, Mr. Siddaramaiah added.   The KPCC chief said public opinion was sought before the party decided to put the padayatra on hold. The decision to call off the yatra was taken at a meeting of senior Congress leaders here, reportedly in consultation with the party brass.   The government had on Wednesday night prohibited inter- and intra-district movement of vehicles and people. The Karnataka High Court had questioned the State on the Congress party’s padayatra held in violation of COVID-19 curbs. The police have filed three first information reports (FIR) against Congress leaders, including Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Shivakumar for defying curbs.   The padayatra , demanding the implementation of the Mekedatu project, witnessed the participation of hundreds of party workers and supporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-halts-mekedatu-padayatra/article64950082.ece

Sivankutty met Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Thursday morning to take stock of the situation with regard to functioning of schools, conduct of SSLC and Plus Two examinations, and vaccination of students. After talks with the Chief Minister on whether schools should be closed or not, it was decided that a final decision would be taken at a review meeting on Friday after considering the opinion of experts. The government has been keeping a close watch on the COVID-19 case graph. Last week, Mr. Sivankutty had said the State was not looking to close schools as the Omicron situation was under control. He had ruled out any postponement of SSLC and Plus Two examinations. However, the sharp increase in the number of new cases has prompted a relook at the situation. With the government reiterating time and again that children’s health is its top priority, the General Education department is mulling a partial switchover to online classes. It is exploring if physical classes for students in higher grades can continue with the existing restrictions while rest could return to online lessons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/decision-on-school-closure-after-todays-review-meet-minister/article38269983.ece

Traders did not face any problem until the State government was distributing a piece of sugarcane along with Pongal hampers to ration cardholders as people would buy a full sugarcane in the markets to celebrate the festival. Though the distribution of gift hampers had begun a week ago, many chose to get their hampers on Wednesday and Thursday and many were apparently satisfied with that. “Customers generally buy a pair of sugarcane adhering to tradition. But several customers just bought one sugarcane this year as they already have one cane that they had received from ration shops in the hamper, It has had its impact in the market,” said M. Balasubramani, a seasonal trader, who set up a temporary sugarcane stall in Bheema Nagar. However, the phenomenon has not caused a slump in the prices of edible sugarcane. While a piece of sugarcane (good quality) was sold at Rs. 40 in Uzhavar Sandhai at Thennur, it was being sold for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 by seasonal traders at other places. Small sized sugarcane were being sold at Rs. 30. Supermarkets too stocked up sugarcane. A sugarcane of medium size was being sold at Rs. 28 a piece at a private supermarket in the city. The price was said to be marginally higher than last year. It went up by Rs. 20 a pair on average. Traders attribute the price rise to shortage in supply, rise in transportation cost and sharp rise in overhead expenses. “I have paid Rs. 420 for a load of 1,000 canes. The actual cost of each cane is Rs. 42. I need to sell at the rate of Rs. 60 a cane to make a decent profit,” said Shanmugam, another seasonal trader at Bheema Nagar. Similarly, price of turmeric bunch has gone up by Rs. 10 this year. Traders quoted a good quality turmeric bunch at Rs. 25 to Rs. 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pongal-gift-hampers-blamed-for-dip-in-sale-of-sugarcane/article64950120.ece

However, traders expect the prices to cool down over the next few days due to closure of temples as part of the restrictions imposed to check the spread of COVID-19. “There was 30 to 40% increase in prices of flowers. But the prices are expected to come down from Friday as temples are to be closed till this weekend. The start of the wedding season will see a rise in the prices again,” said V. Varadharajan, president, Srirangam Flower Dealers Association. On Thursday, samanthi poo was being sold at Rs. 140-160 a kg and vritchika poo at Rs. .180 a kg. Sambangi was selling at Rs. 120 a kg, Mr. Varadharajan said. As it was not the season for jasmine there was less arrival.

Nehru on Thursday instructed officials to expedite the works on erection of an aerator near Ayyalamman Padithurai near Kambarasampettai. The aerator is being established at a cost of Rs. 5 crore in a bid to reduce iron content in the water that is pumped from the Kollidam riverbed. Mr. Nehru inspected the progress of the work along with senior officials on Thursday. The Corporation supplies 135 million litres a day (MLD) from the Cauvery and Kollidam rivers, through 136 overhead water tanks (OHTs). There have been complaints that the water pumped from Collector Well 3 of the Kollidam Drinking Water Scheme, supplied though 11 OHTs in K.Abhishekapuram zone, was discoloured. Responding to complaints from the public about the reddish colour of the water, engineers and experts from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board had conducted a detailed study and suggested the construction of a multi-level aerator on the banks of the Cauvery to treat the water and reduce the ferrous content. The multiple-tray aerator will bring the riverbed water into contact with air through a fountain-like structure during which atmospheric oxygen will oxidise the high iron content. Senior Corporation officials said that the project, which was launched in September 2021, was scheduled to be completed within 12 months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expedite-water-aerator-project-minister/article64950121.ece

Oxygen demand in COVID-19 patients came down by at least 66.6% within 48 hours of receiving LDRT, as per the final results of a phase II study taken up by a city hospital. The final results of a Phase II study LDRT as a treatment for COVID-19 conducted by Tiruchi-based HarshaMitra Super Speciality Cancer Centre and Research Institute has been published in the Journal of Radiotherapy and Oncology. The institute began studying the usage of LDRT in 2021. There was rapid relief from respiratory distress and a potential reduction in mortality rate, the researchers found. A total of 61 patients were recruited for the Phase II study from November 2020 to May 2021. The initiative was taken up following a pilot study conducted by All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi showing 90% efficacy in a sample of 10 patients with LDRT. The doctors at Harshamitra also conducted a pilot study, after which Phase I was conducted by a team of 13 doctors and researchers. According to the researchers, 25 patients had rapid improvement in oxygenation status within 48 hours of receiving a single dose of radiation treatment. The recovery rate was 88 % they claimed. Explaining the procedure, G. Govindaraj, surgical oncologist and principal investigator of the study said that LDRT works as an anti-inflammatory response. Radiotherapy helps soothe the inflammation caused by COVID-19, he explained. For all the recruited cases, standard government protocol for treatment was followed, and one single dose of LDRT was given. However, the treatment has to be given at an appropriate time- which is when the lungs are affected, lest it would not be effective. "There needs to be inflammation for the anti-inflammatory effect to work. We identify this by monitoring the patient's blood oxygenation levels. If the patient requires oxygenation, they can be given radiotherapy," he said. Mr. Govindaraj clarified that 0.5 gray of radiation is used in LDRT, while for cancer patients, at least 50-60 gray is used. Because of this, the radiation is not harmful, he said. "There are numerous studies which have studied the effects and have proved that the effect is negligible. We have quoted them in our papers," he said.  However, a few practical concerns were flagged by the oncologists' community. Speaking to The Hindu , a senior radiation oncologist in Tiruchi said that all hospitals will not have access to the equipment required for radiotherapy. Further, all equipment including the machine need to be sterilised after treating a COVID-19 patient before it is used again. "At a cancer-treating facility, at least 70-100 patients are given radiotherapy in a day. We will be compromising on their needs if we provide it to COVID-19 patients," the doctor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/low-dose-radiotherapy-reduces-respiratory-distress-in-covid-19-patients-study/article38270768.ece

The panchayat president S. Ramya and ward members have reached out to the public welfare organisations seeking their support to the local body for complying with the State government's lockdown measures in letter and spirit. Pongal festival every year is marked by conduct of several sports events in the panchayat that also encompasses large urban settlements close to Tiruverumbur town. Citing the steady rise in COVID infection cases in the State and the district, Ms. Ramya said in a written appeal to the public, circulated through Whatsapp groups, that their support was vital for the local body to comply with the goverment's lockdown measures. The closure of schools in view of the rise in cases was a clear indicator of the gravity of the extent of spread, Ms. Ramya said. "There was nothing wrong with the idea of conducting sports events as such. But, the situation is not conducive, as public gatherings for the festivities could danger many lives," she said, urging the people to make it a point to celebrate the festival indoors this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/celebrate-pongal-indoors-krishnasamudram-panchayat-tells-residents/article38270455.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 04:32 IST,TAMIL NADU||Not many welcome postponement of odd-semester exams||The indefinite postponement of the odd semester examinations for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes by the government, due to the COVID-19 situation, has not gone down well with a substantial section of students as well as teachers, going by the observation of college heads. Students who were in the midst of serious preparation for the offline exam, as per the earlier plan (after January 20) say they are disillusioned. "The sense of seriousness that was infused into the examination system after the government was determined to conduct it offline now seems diluted; the indefinite postponement is unwarranted. It is now difficult to say if we would take the next schedule of examinations seriously, be it online or offline," an undergraduate student of a city college said. On their part, teachers, by and large, say the determination of the State Government to conduct offline exam for the students was well-intended. According to them, the struggle the students had faced in writing internal exams in offline mode after a lengthy gap of nearly two years was a warning signal that the consequences of continuous online exams will be disastrous. They are aware of the indications that employers are wary of recruiting candidates who had passed out through online exams during the COVID-19 period. It was in this context that many teachers opine that the schedule of the odd semester examination, which was to have begun during the first week of December, 2021, need not have been postponed in the first place. " Why is it that the government, the political set up, the media and the legal system take it for granted that institutions must be closed whenever there is a scare of infection, and do not seem to be bothered about the confluence of people in unsafe conditions in marketplaces, malls and showrooms? No doubt, the pandemic must be addressed with safety protocols in place. But, entirely closing down institutions and paralysing the higher education system should never be an option at all," the college principal said. “Had the government taken the views of academicians on an even keel with that of administrators, a balanced decision could have been taken,” a senior professor said. "Given the exigency, the government could well consider conducting the odd-semester exam in offline mode in a staggered manner. The exams must first be conducted for final year UG and PG students necessarily, so that they will be able to pass out at the end of the academic year at an ideal juncture for pursuing further studies or taking up jobs," the senior professor said requesting anonymity. There will be enough time to handle students in first and intermediate years with flexible approaches. But, the interests of the final year students must not be compromised, he emphasised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-many-welcome-postponement-of-odd-semester-exams/article38270410.ece

All markets in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai were heavily crowded on Thursday as shoppers thronged these places to complete their ‘Pongal’ shopping. Only about 30% of the people were seen wearing masks while physical distancing norm was not followed at all anywhere. Vehicular traffic around the Kamarajar Vegetable Market was thrown out of gear as the sale of vegetables moved to top gear. A bundle of 10 sugarcanes was sold at Rs. 450 and the buyers had to shell out anywhere between Rs. 100 to Rs. 150 for a bundle of 25 palmyra tubers, another inseparable farm produce of ‘Pongal’ celebration. Since the arrival of banana was less this year due to the heavy downpour in November last but the demand was quite high, the price was unprecedented in the vegetable market. “While the demand for banana for Pongal is around 400 tonnes, the arrival from farms around Thoothukudi was only 100 tonnes. We had to buy them from Sathyamangalam, Theni, Chinnamanur and even from Andhra Pradesh,” said a banana traders. Consequently, ‘Sevvaazhai’ was sold for Rs. 900 and ‘Kozhicode’ at Rs. 600 for a bunch. The plantain leaf price also shot up to Rs. 1,100 a bundle. The vegetable price in the markets dipped a bit on Thursday following increased arrival. The price will come down further on Saturday, the traders said. Over 3,000 policemen will be deployed in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Tenkasi districts as part of the security arrangements besides deployment of special teams to conduct vehicle check in the night.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:28 IST,TAMIL NADU||Tirunelveli district ready to face third wave||Even though the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing during the ‘third wave’ of the pandemic, the district has been comfortably placed as adequate medical infrastructures have been created in advance, Speaker M. Appavu has said. Speaking to reporters here on Thursday after visiting the COVID-19 Control Room functioning at the Collectorate, he said the government hospitals including the medical college hospitals across the State had lacked adequate infrastructure facilities to neutralize the ‘second wave’ of the viral infection when Chief Minister M.K. Stalin assumed office in May last. However, the actions taken by the government after assessing the gravity of the situation had ensured the incorporation of adequate medical infrastructure including medicines, doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, diagnostic labs, medical-grade oxygen etc. in GHs and medical college hospitals. The government expedited the vaccination drive, which had ensured the vaccination of over 81% while 53% people had received both the doses in the State. Moreover, the vaccination of teens in the age of 15 and 18 had neutralized the adverse impact of the viral infection. “The Tamil Nadu government’s multi-pronged strategy has yielded positive results and there is no need for panic about the ‘third wave’ by strictly following COVID-appropriate behaviour even after vaccination,” he said. He said the ‘triaging centre’ established by the Collector V. Vishnu, the first-of-its-kind facility in the State, for segregating COVID-19 patients based on their health parameters, was so effective in determining the line of treatment to be followed for every individual. “The ‘triaging centre’ established at Gandhimathi Ambal Higher Secondary School opposite the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital has significantly reduced the burden of the TVMCH doctors. When the COVID-19 patients coming to this centre have mild symptoms, they are given medicines and allowed to be in home isolation for two weeks while others with high fever and other health issues are hospitalized. Those who are in need of aspiration assistance are admitted in the hospitals with oxygen-supported beds. With this well-defined system in place, we are comfortable now,” he said adding that over 3,000 beds including 1,500 oxygen-supported beds were ready in the district. He informed that the district had recorded 78% vaccination of first dose and 50% of the qualified group had received both the doses. “We’ve intensified vaccination drive in the rural areas also through the mega camps being ogranised on Saturdays and the mobile units,” Mr. Appavu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tirunelveli-dist-ready-to-face-third-wave-speaker/article64950096.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 04:30 IST,TAMIL NADU||A tribal women-led initiative to ensure fair price for forest produce||Nine tribal women entrepreneurs have taken the first step towards ensuring sustainable livelihood for their families through the sale of minor forest produce at fair price at Nelakottai in Pandalur taluk. The women, members of the Kattunayakan community in Achchutham Moola in Kottayamedu, started the Nelakottai Kattunayakan Women’s Cottage Industry Co-operative to sell minor forest produce, including honey, greens, yams, spices, vegetables and medicinal herbs that they harvest from the forests in which they have relied on for many generations.  Speaking to The Hindu , B. Sujatha, a 30-year-old woman belonging to the community who is a part of the initiative, said that they have been taken advantage of by various non-governmental organisations and private entities, who would purchase produce from the community at very low prices. “As many male members of our community are addicted to alcohol, the forest produce the community harvested, including honey, was sold at extremely cheap rates to private individuals,” said Ms. Sujatha.  “As women from the community wanted to earn a livelihood and not depend on our spouses to spend on running the house and supporting our families, we decided to set up the co-operative to ensure that we have collective bargaining rights so that the produce our community gathers receives a fair price,” she added. Sobha Madhan, a tribal activist from the Kurumba adivasi community, who is also a district co-ordinator of the Nilgiris Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (NPVTG) Federation, along with conservation NGO, Arulagam, is assisting the community in setting up the initiative. “Previously, the community of honey hunters and gatherers of forest produce would be given around Rs. 200-Rs. 300 for a kg of honey. With the setting up of the co-operative, they stand to make around Rs. 1,000 for a kg of honey, with the benefits being shared with the community,” she said. The members, who have launched the initiative hope that it eventually benefits all 58 families living in the hamlet. They added that they will have strict control on the amount of forest produce they gather each year to ensure that the community’s resources are not exploited. “We have set up the initiative with an aim to ensure that all produce harvested from the forest is done sustainably, and not on a commercial scale. Many times, private entities which collect honey from the forest-dependent communities over-exploit the resources, which we want to avoid at all costs,” said Ms. Sujatha. On Thursday, officials from the Revenue Department in Gudalur, including the RDO, Saravana Kannan, and Pandalur tahsildar, D. Kuppuraj, inaugurated the project. They assured the members of their assistance in marketing the products in Eco-Development Committee shops across the Nilgiris.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-tribal-women-led-initiative-to-ensure-fair-price-for-forest-produce/article64950311.ece

Ramki, 28, seldom forgets to take two things — a thermoscanner and a log book — before he leaves his house in Karukaputhoor village, near Vellore. He rides a moped to the police housing quarters near Circuit House, a posh neighbourhood in the town. The quarters is his workplace. His job is to take the temperature and other health details of the occupants before putting them down in his log book, twice a day. Mr. Ramki is among 17 policemen, mostly constables, who have been on the job since Monday to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among police personnel and their families. The infection is also on the rise among police personnel, with many having reported mild symptoms earlier this month.  In fact, many personnel in the Sathuvachari, North Vellore town, Pallikonda, South Vellore town, Gudiyatham town police stations have reported mild symptoms over the past few days. This has necessitated such an initiative. “With this, we monitor the health status of our police personnel and their families on a daily basis. The feedback helps us to attend to any health emergencies to our personnel,” S. Rajesh Kannan, SP (Vellore), told The Hindu . Divided into teams of four, the policemen take care of at least 60 families in the housing quarters. Each housing quarters, on an average, has at least four blocks with more than 100 housing units each. Most of these quarters are alloted to constables and sub-inspectors of various wings, including the Armed Reserve, law and order, traffic and crime. More than 1,200 families stay in the quarters, which are spread across the district in Gudiyatham, Katpadi, Pallikonda, Vellore Old Town, K.V. Kuppam and Tiruvalam.  “We ensure our safety by wearing masks, gloves and maintaining physical distancing during health surveys in the quarters. On an average, it takes at least three hours to cover 60 houses in the quarters,” said S. Arun, a constable from the Gudiyatham town police station. The assigned policemen for the job have to check the temperature of all family members, including the children, in the quarters. Apart from personal details, they have to check for symptoms like cough, cold, fever and sore throat and record it in their log books. These details are kept track of in a separate WhatsApp group created by the District Police Headquarters. The chief surgeon and a team of doctors at the Police Hospital in Vellore also get a copy of the data on a daily basis to monitor the status of the police personnel and their families. The infected individuals are home quarantined as necessary. The district administrations in Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Ranipet and Tirupattur have issued an order increasing the fine for not wearing masks in public places from Rs. 200 to Rs. 500. Special teams have been formed to ensure compliance to the guidelines in public places. Vegetable traders staged a road roko in Tiruvannamalai town against a move to relocate them to the playground of the Government Boys Higher Secondary School as a temporary arrangement to prevent crowding during the festival weekend. Tiruvannamalai SP A. Pavan Kumar Reddy and officials spoke with the protestors and allowed them to run their shops in the existing spot only on January 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/constables-turn-health-assistants-in-vellore/article64950085.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:33 IST,TAMIL NADU||‘Our industrial policy opens doors for investors without their having to knock’||Declaring that Tamil Nadu’s industrial policy has been drafted in such a manner that “doors are open for investors without knocking”, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in an interview to The Hindu says the DMK government has created infrastructure that instils confidence in investors and ensures transparent governance and expeditious clearance. The State is committed to maintaining law and order and ensuring industrial peace. Excerpts:  What is your vision for the development in the next five years? Are you planning to bring about reforms in governance to ensure efficient delivery of services and benefits to people? Not just for five years. I announced the vision for 10 years at Siruganur in Tiruchi before the Assembly election. I requested people to give the next 10 years to the DMK to rescue the State which lagged behind during the AIADMK rule. They have given us the first five years. As per the seven promises made in Tiruchi, we are focussing on economy, agriculture, water resources, education-cum-health, urban development, rural infrastructure and social justice. The government is functioning with the objective of inclusiveness on the basis of an integrated and sustainable development. We have fine-tuned the administration in such a way that the government can reach out to people. I have gained experience as an MLA, Mayor, Local Administration and Industries Minister and Deputy Chief Minister and I know the expectations and aspirations of people. The government has ensured speedy and transparent services to the liking of people. The speed will continue consistently and prudently for five years in such a way that people will come forward and hand over another five years to us. For the first time an Economic Advisory Council to the Chief Minister has been set up. In what way has it helped you shape economic policies? Our goal is equal economic development in tune with social justice, which took root during the Justice Party government. I call this the Dravidian model. We constituted an Economic Advisory Council comprising internationally renowned economists, since there is a need to evolve an economic development to suit the current situation. We are getting their advice for the sustainable development of Tamil Nadu. I elicit their opinion through webinars whenever possible. We have divided our task into short-term and long-term, and travel with the objective of improving the economy by implementing them within the time frame. With the onset of the third wave of COVID-19, how are you planning to ensure that the economy stays afloat and the livelihood of people is not affected? When we assumed office, the impact of the second wave was very severe. The steps to control it was launched immediately and even before the formation of the government. Oxygen production and medical facilities increased. We speeded up the integrated functioning of various departments. Vaccination was organised as a movement, which produced the desired results. The arrangements already in place are handy to deal with the spread of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus now. Since the government is very particular that the livelihood of people should not be affected, we distributed Rs. 4,000 during the second wave despite the severe economic crisis. Now we are distributing the Pongal gift hamper. On the day of launching the booster vaccine dose, I also inaugurated the conference of the Indian Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Parks and Business Incubators Association. We have divided investments into small and big and are creating infrastructure accordingly. Big industrialists and global investors are holding talks with us. They feel Tamil Nadu has a favourable climate for investment. It helps us to take income-generating measures without affecting the economic infrastructure at the time of the pandemic. We will also continue to press the Union government for Tamil Nadu’s share of the Goods and Services Tax. Under the current conditions, what will be the reasonable time period for the State to hold the next Global Investors Meet? There is no need to organise ostentatious investors’ conference for propaganda as done by the AIADMK government. Investors expect infrastructure that inspires confidence, transparent governance and expeditious clearance, and we are providing them now. When we announced the goal of a trillion-dollar economy for Tamil Nadu while launching the investors conference in Guindy, MoUs were signed for 49 projects worth Rs. 28,508 crore to create 83,482 jobs. At CODISSIA in Coimbatore, 59 MoUs were signed last month for projects worth Rs. 35,208 to generate 76,795 jobs. Foundation was laid for 13 projects on the day itself. We have achieved projects with investments to the tune of Rs. 13,413 crore to generate 11,681 jobs. The FinTech Policy 2021 for industrial development has been released. We have achieved a leap forward through projects such as creation of a financial city in Chennai, Neo-TIDEL parks in second and third tier cities and a fully digitised single window portal 2.0 to help investors. There are complaints of anti-social elements causing trouble to industrial units in Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts... The government is committed to maintaining law and order without any compromise and ensure protection of individuals, organisations and industrial peace. Immediate action is taken on complaints about anti-socials in districts where more industries are located. Senior officials and Superintendents of Police have already issued orders to ensure the safety of industries by taking immediate action on complaints against anti-social elements. The government is committed not only to the protection of industries but also to the relationship with workers and their protection. When workers of Foxconn unit protested recently, the Collector, the superintendent of police, the Minister for Industries and the Minister for Rural Industries visited the spot and dispelled their fear. We are also implementing far-sighted schemes for workers. There is a view that protests against industries and projects — Sterlite and hydrocarbon exploration, for instance — may affect the industrial climate. Your comments... The government’s policy is to promote industrial development without affecting the environment and with the whole-hearted support of people. People object to industries causing damage to the environment since these industries also pose a danger to their health. As far as our government is concerned, we will not allow any project that will mortgage people’s lives. At the same time, we will grant approval for industries that will contribute to Tamil Nadu’s economic development and generate employment. We will encourage investment and people’s welfare and protection without one affecting the other. What is your message to investors? The industrial policy of the government is such that the doors will open for investors without knocking. It is my introductory message to the investors. Tamil Nadu has achieved laurels in medical and engineering education but lacks centres of excellence for humanities and arts and science. Is there any proposal to set up such institutions?  Uniform education is the fundamental policy of the DMK. New courses will be launched in schools and higher educational institutions to meet the changing times. Computer education was introduced during Kalaignar ’s rule. Visual communication courses were started in colleges. Now there is an awareness of social sciences, arts and literature. Special attention is paid to them since these courses are connected with Tamil Nadu’s unique cultural identity. Anna [former Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai] said the history of the Indian Union should be written from Tamil Nadu and it is also the policy of the DMK government. The new findings from the Keezhadi and Adichanallur excavations have kindled the youth’s interest in art and literature. An education policy will be evolved to encourage studies in epigraphy, archaeology, literature and anthropology. Decisions will be taken at an appropriate time to launch universities and educational institutions for the purpose.   The government is functioning with the aim of inclusiveness on the basis of an integrated and sustainable development. The administration has been fine-tuned to reach out to people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/our-industrial-policy-opens-doors-for-investors-without-their-having-to-knock/article64950071.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:34 IST,TAMIL NADU||Tools to test ties with the past||Archaeological excavations at Keeladi and last year’s carbon dating analysis of rice with soil found in a burial urn at Sivakalai, which indicated the Thambirabarani civilisation dates back to 3,200 years, have reignited an interest in the ancientness of Tamil civilisation. The State is now using scientific methodologies, along with literary evidence, to ensure the findings are irrefutable and stand intellectual scrutiny globally. “Normally, the process would be to excavate, exhibit, and corroborate with literary sources. Usage of technology to prove the authenticity of findings is an important step undertaken in the past few years...We want to prove the findings so it would stand intellectual scrutiny,” said T. Udhayachandran, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister and former Commissioner of Archaeology. DNA lab being set up “An ancient DNA lab is being set up at Madurai Kamaraj University in collaboration with international agencies. Samples are being sent to Florida for carbon dating... We are looking at the best institutes to use their expertise and validate our results,” he added. This year, three sites will be added to the excavation list —Tulukkapatti and Vembakottai to validate the cultural significance of Adichchanallur and Sivakalai; and Perumbalai that is on the erstwhile Kongu Nadu border.Efforts are on to undertake under-sea explorations through a reconnaissance survey at Korkai, an ancient port. This will be a multi-modal agency operation involving the National Institute of Ocean Technology and the Indian Maritime University. “Excavations have been happening in Tamil Nadu for the past 50 years... We are covering the period from prehistory to historical period. Geographically, we plan to cover the entire Tamil Nadu,” said Prof. Rajan, former professor of History, Pondicherry University, and academic and research adviser, Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department. In the Vaigai and Porunai river valleys, the focus has been on the delta region; in the future, the basin region — the catchments — would be covered, he said. Efforts are on to incorporate the findings with much focus on ancient science and technology in the school syllabus. “We have given details of the Keeladi and Porunai river valley findings to be included in the Social Studies subject for Class IX. We have done the proofing and submitted it to the School Education Department,” said R. Sivanantham, Commissioner, Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department. Long-term projects According to Shanti Pappu of Sharma Centre for Heritage Education, whose research team is working on the prehistory of Tamil Nadu for long, the government’s interest in and support for multidisciplinary long-term projects will help to address many aspects of the State’s heritage. “To study the rich heritage, we require problem-oriented and interdisciplinary long-term strategies to address multiple questions. The answers do not lie only in one site or region, so research has to be spread across the State, at multiple sites, to address questions of interest,” she said. Mr. Udhayachandran said that among the major potential was to explore the use of Artificial Intelligence and training people and [coding] the machines to decipher inscriptions and identify changes that occur over a period of time on the inscriptions. Experts can then be called to adjudicate on the findings.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:34 IST,TAMIL NADU||A blooming movement and two GOs||The recent Supreme Court order permitting 27% quota for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the all-India quota for admissions to the undergraduate medical courses has been hailed by almost the entire political spectrum in Tamil Nadu as a milestone in the history of social justice. The words, ‘social justice,’ may even sound clichéd to some but a look at the evolution of the reservation system reveals how the idea is an important chapter in the contemporary politics in Tamil Nadu. It all began with a decision taken at a meeting at the Victoria Public Hall in Chennai in November 1916 to form an organisation to voice the grievances of non-Brahmins. Among those present were T.M. Nair and P. Theagaraya Chetti. The meeting paved the way for the establishment of the Justice Party. A month later, the leaders unveiled a document, called ‘Non Brahmin Manifesto’. Thus began the campaign for getting a rightful share of the non-Brahmins in public life and in government services. Four years later, the Justice Party came to power in the elections to the Legislative Council, which was how the legislature was called. It had its moments of success in September 1921 and August 1922 when two government orders (GOs), famously called “Communal GOs”, were issued.  In his  Politics and Social Conflict in South India, the Non-Brahman Movement and Tamil Separatism, 1916-1929 ,’ American historian Eugene F Irschick mentions the party “pursued its demands doggedly, for it realised that the implementation of Government Orders to redistribute government appointments in favour of non-Brahmans [sic] would fulfil some of the party’s first-articulated ideas — administrative power, social position and economic security.”  In the first GO, six broad classifications — Brahmins, Non-Brahmin Hindus, Indian Christians, Muhammadans (Muslims), European & Anglo Indians, and Others — were created. The second GO pointed out that non-Brahmin Hindus constituted 48% of the new appointments made in the six months ending December 1921. Six years later, when P. Subbaroyan was the Chief Minister, a scheme of quota was designed under which non-Brahmins would get 5 out of 12 posts (41.67%) and Brahmins, Anglo Indians-Christians and Muslims 2 each (16.67%). Depressed Classes, now called Scheduled Castes, would get 1 out of 12 (8.33%).  This development was described by R. Kannan, UN diplomat, in his book Anna: The Life and Times of C.N. Annadurai , as the basis for the present scheme of reservation. Three months after Independence, when Omandur P. Ramaswami Reddiar of the Congress was the Chief Minister, an exclusive category — Backward Hindus — was created, with 14.29% of the seats earmarked for them.  After the Constitution was adopted in 1950, the Madras High Court and then the Supreme Court quashed the scheme of reservation on the grounds of violation of the principle of equality. Agitations organised by Dravidar Kazhagam founder ‘Periyar’ E.V. Ramasamy Naicker and pressure exerted by K. Kamaraj, a towering figure of the Congress, on the Central government made possible the first constitutional amendment. In September 1951, the Scheduled Castes (SCs)/the Scheduled Tribes (STs) were provided with 15% and the BCs with 25%. Kamaraj, as Chief Minister, had got ready the list of ‘More Backward’ among the BCs after a study. A GO issued in January 1957 stipulated that on a par with those of the SCs, educational concessions alone need be granted to 58 communities identified in the list. Thirty-two years later, when DMK leader M. Karunanidhi was the Chief Minister, this list became the basis for the creation of the category — Most Backward Classes (MBCs) — which got 20% out of 50% for the BCs. Following the recommendations made by the first Backward Classes Commission (1969-70), headed by A.N. Sattanathan, Chief Minister Karunanidhi, in May 1971, announced 31% quota for the BCs and 18% for the SCs/STs. In February 1980, the AIADMK government, led by M.G. Ramachandran, which had unsuccessfully tried to introduce the creamy layer concept among the BCs, hiked the quantum of reservation to 50%. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s verdict in 1992 in the Mandal Commission case, the State’s 69% quota system had to get a constitutional safeguard, which became a reality in 1994 owing to the efforts of the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa (AIADMK) and Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao (Congress). During the fifth innings of Karunanidhi as Chief Minister (2006-11), Arunthathiyars and Muslims were given internal quotas of 3% and 3.5% within the overall quota for the SCs and the BCs respectively. Agitations by PMK Subsequent to the agitations by the PMK, the AIADMK government, headed by Edappadi K. Palaniswami, got a law enacted in February 2021 providing 10.5% quota for the Vanniyars within the total of 20% for the MBCs and De-notified Communities. However, the legislation was quashed by the Madras High Court nine months later. The Supreme Court is hearing a batch of appeals, including one by the DMK government. In his response to the Supreme Court’s latest ruling on the all-India quota, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin reiterated his party’s demand for reserving 69% seats, including 50% for the OBCs. It also has been the stand of his government that States be empowered to fix the quantum of reservation based on their needs.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:34 IST,TAMIL NADU||Heritage structures back in shape||When a fire in 2014 destroyed a portion of the 246-year-old Humayun Mahal, which exemplifies the Indo-Saracenic architecture, there was a proposal to demolish it and construct a new structure. The Grade-I heritage structure building, which is part of the Chepauk Palace, built by Muhammad Ali Wallajah in 1768, would have vanished from Chennai’s landscape but for the efforts of the Public Works Department. After seven years and completion of 80% of the conservation work, the once-crumbling structure has emerged with its old charm. As many as 35 heritage buildings under the PWD are receiving a new lease of life after the creation of a heritage division in the PWD in 2017 for conservation and restoration. “We have 85 registered public buildings under our maintenance. Work is in progress to restore 35 buildings, and more will be added to the list. The fund allocation for the current year is Rs. 150 crore,” said R. Manikandan, Executive Engineer of the division. Chennai lost many heritage buildings because of neglect and lack of awareness. While a public campaign saved the DGP House facing the Marina Beach from demolition, the Admiralty House, once the headquarters of the CB-CID, was razed. The idea of conservation gained momentum after the Madras High Court constituted a heritage committee to deal with petitions connected with conservation of buildings of historical importance. Its directions and orders saved many heritage structures, including 35 court buildings. Age is a factor that decides the heritage status of a building. It should be over 75 years old. Its association with historical events and style of construction are also taken into consideration for the heritage statues. The heritage division, adhering to traditional conservation methods and techniques standardised by organisations such as INTACH, has made a difference in terms of quality and aesthetics. It even brought two Kangeyam bulls to grind the lime mortar in a traditional grinder for making “authentic paste” used for plastering of the walls of the Humayun Mahal. Earlier, historical buildings were repaired and altered without sensitivity. The Madras-type ceiling of the Khalas Mahal, adjacent to Humayun Mahal, was replaced with concrete. Similar blind renovation methods were adopted to the Travancore-style building of the Sethu Lakshim Bai Government Higher Secondary School in Kanniyakumari district. Here, a portion of the roof made of Mangalore tiles over teakwood frames was destroyed. Mr. Manikandan said cement had no place in traditional conservation. “We are not using M-sand either as it will not match with lime mortar used for repairing and plastering. As river sand mining is not allowed in Tamil Nadu, we are getting it from Andhra Pradesh, where some quarries are in operation. There will be two layers of plastering: base and a final cover over it.” Quality control is strictly followed for the construction materials. The teak woods meant for roofing is sourced from Sengottai where the Forest Department sells it through auction. “The load-carrying capacity of the teak wood should be between 6,000 and 7,000 megapascal. The moisture of the wood is also checked. The advantage with the Madras-style roofing is that the building will remain cool during summer and warm in winter,” Mr. Manikandan said. But what remains a challenge to restoration is shortage of skilled masons. Just 10 masons worked for the restoration of Humayun Mahal for the last two years and it delayed the work. “We select skilled workers, depending on the nature of the work. Workers are available in Athankudi itself for laying Athankudi tiles. We get workers from Nagercoil for restoration of wooden ceiling. A lot of skilled workers are available in Virudhunagar district, particularly at Elayirampannai. There are also workers from north India,” said Rajesh, manager of Kadal Constructions, a company involved in conservation works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/heritage-structures-back-in-shape/article64950062.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:33 IST,TAMIL NADU||Robust growth in foreign direct investment||The foreign direct investment (FDI) in Tamil Nadu grew about 18% to Rs. 8,364 crore in April-September 2021, from Rs. 7,062 crore in the same period last year, according to data from the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Pooja Kulkarni, MD and CEO of Guidance Tamil Nadu, the nodal agency for investment promotion, said the State had shown a strong and resilient growth in the face of uncertainty and disruption brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. “The State’s economy grew at a real rate of 1.42% in FY 20-21, while India’s real GDP contracted by 7.3% in the same period. This resilience is what has continued to drive domestic and global investors to repose trust and invest in Tamil Nadu,” she said. Standing fifth Ms. Kulkarni pointed out that Tamil Nadu ranked the fifth among the States in FDI inflows, having received Rs. 32,807 crore between October 2019 and September 2021. The FDI inflows have seen an increase of 8% in FY 2020-21 vis-à-vis FY 19-20, noteworthy considering the negative impact of the pandemic. The key sectors which attracted significant FDI investments are construction, financial services, manufacturing (auto, electronics, machinery), retail and information technology services, she added. On the State’s low share of 4% in the total FDI flows into India, compared with the other bigger States like Maharashtra, Ms. Kulkarni contended that traditionally strong regions — Mumbai and Delhi — have several corporate offices. “This led to two issues. FDIs meant for States such as Tamil Nadu get accounted for in Mumbai and Delhi where their corporate offices are located. Second, FDIs in major merger and acquisition deals are driven through these regions, especially in sectors such as telecommunications,” she explained. Not fully captured Besides, the current method of measuring FDI does not capture foreign investment from multinational companies completely. “For instance, marquee FDI investors such as auto OEMs, which invested in the State, have ploughed back the profits made by their local subsidiaries and reinvested it into the State in expanding their capacities. This reinvestment of MNCs through their local subsidiaries does not get captured. Other States, which see first-time FDI investors, do not face this issue.” Tamil Nadu’s improving investment climate has led to increased domestic investments, indicated through reports by independent agencies, such as CARE Ratings and Projects Today, which have declared Tamil Nadu the leading investment destination, Ms. Kulkarni said.  The FDI inflow shows it is an inspiring momentum towards the State Government’s ambition of a $1 trillion economy by the end of FY 2030-31. Tamil Nadu as a business destination has become immensely attractive and the population is witnessing a constant influx of professionals from other Indian states. This only means the State is progressing in the right direction.    With companies looking to exit China or have an alternate strategy, Tamil Nadu is well poised to tap the opportunity. Some of the measures like relooking at the provisions of the Factories Act to suit the current environment would help in progressing faster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/robust-growth-in-foreign-direct-investment/article64950069.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:57 IST,KARNATAKA||It’s a long road ahead for civic body||The city’s roads that are not already dug up by various civic agencies or taken up for development mostly have potholes, much to the chagrin of motorists and pedestrians alike. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which is the custodian of all roads and footpaths in the city, has till March 31 to complete the ongoing works. This comes after a recent review of development works by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. At the meeting, which was attended by Ministers and MLAs, the CM directed the civic body to complete the works on a war footing. In an internal circular, BBMP’s Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta has directed officials to complete white-topping on 50 km of roads and TenderSURE development of 30 km that is under progress by the end of March. That apart, the deadline for the ongoing development of 183 km of arterial and sub-arterial roads, and remodelling and strengthening of 30 km of stormwater drains is the end of February. The civic chief has also directed officials to ensure that no road-cutting permission is given to anyone, including civic agencies such as Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), Bengaluru Electricity Supply Company (Bescom), and Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. (KPTCL). Work in 110 villages Meanwhile, senior civic officials said that 2,845.61 km of roads in 110 villages coming in the newly added areas have been dug up by the BWSSB for laying drinking water and underground drainage pipelines. For the repair and development of the dug roads, the State Government has already released Rs. 998.32 crore. The civic body has already floated tenders and issued work orders to some contractors. While 717.25 km of road has been repaired, according to sources, they need attention due to unseasonal heavy rains last year. Now, Mr. Gupta has directed the Special Commissioner (Projects) and chief engineer concerned to draw up Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the redevelopment of these dug up roads. Other roads Of the 470 arterial and sub-arterial roads measuring 1,344.84 km, the Department of Road Infrastructure is maintaining 392 roads measuring 1,109.85 km. Of these, 315 roads measuring 870.42 km are said to be pothole-free. However, the remaining stretches on 77 roads measuring 239.44 km are in a bad condition, more so after the heavy rains that lashed in October and November. Mr. Bommai has given the BBMP 15 days to fill potholes across the city. Sources claimed there were potholes and bad reaches on 10,927 roads measuring 2,586.48 km. Sources said that until December 31, 2021, officials filled potholes on 7,793 roads. Work on potholes and bad reaches on the remaining 3,134 roads are pending||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/its-a-long-road-ahead-for-civic-body/article64950354.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:03 IST,KARNATAKA||North Karnataka districts have the lowest TPR in Karnataka||Although the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) had said that North Karnataka districts will be the worst hit by the third wave as these districts have been lagging behind in vaccination from the beginning, the rate of infection continues to be low in these districts. While the seven-day average TPR in Bengaluru Urban remains the highest at 11.63% as of January 11, Mandya, Mysuru, Tumakuru, Bengaluru Rural and Kolar have a TPR hovering around 5%. North Karnataka districts — Haveri, Bagalkote, Yadgir and Koppal — have the lowest seven-day average TPR of less than 1%. Experts, who said this is a good indicator, asserted the need for these districts to sustain the low TPR by increasing testing. Karnataka had been consistently maintaining TPR of less than 1% for the last four months. The seven-day average TPR was on a steady decline since August 15 when it touched 1.01%. It reduced to 0.63% in a month by September 15 and 0.26% on November 15. Although TPR slightly increased to 0.42% by November 30, mainly due to clusters reported across the State, TPR again declined to 0.36% on December 9 and remained less than 0.5% till December 30. In terms of daily TPR, 16 districts — including Mandya and Bengaluru Urban that have the highest TPR — have recorded a TPR of above 10% as of Wednesday. North Karnataka districts — Yadgir, Haveri, Gadag and Koppal — have recorded the lowest daily TPR at 0.88%, 1.09%, 3.52% and 3.55% respectively. TPR, which is a vital marker in assessing the spread of an outbreak, is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. According to epidemiologists, a high positivity rate indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission in the community. Worried over the high transmissibility of Omicron, the TAC had on December 30 advised the Government to impose stricter curbs if the weekly TPR goes above 2% as an early measure of mitigation. While recommending weekend and night curfews if the WTPR is between 1% and less than 2%, the TAC has said lockdown should be considered if the WTPR goes above 3%. If it’s between 2% and 3%, educational institutions will have to switch to remote learning, and offices to work from home. The committee had earlier fixed the threshold for lockdown as 5%. Although the government had imposed night curfew, weekend curfew and 50% capacity restrictions for malls, hotels, cinema halls and all other activities, it has not taken any decision on total lockdown. TAC chairman M.K. Sudarshan, who attributed the low rate of infection in North Karnataka districts to low rate of testing, said the infection is yet to spread from Bengaluru to other districts. “People are not able to travel from Bengaluru to their native places due to weekend curfew and other restrictions,” he said. Stating that the TAC has recommended an increase in daily tests to two lakh, Dr. Sudarshan said that 1.3 lakh tests should be done in Bengaluru and the remaining in the rest of Karnataka. ”Following this, the Chief Minister has directed officials to increase testing,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said rate of infection is high in Bengaluru and surrounding districts mainly because movement is high here. “What we noticed during the last two waves is that there is always a lag period of 3-4 weeks between Bengaluru and other districts,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/north-karnataka-districts-have-the-lowest-tpr-in-karnataka/article64950182.ece

Events and gatherings at club houses or community halls should be avoided The advisory also makes clear the containment strategy. If there is a single case on a floor, individual flats on that floor shall be declared as a containment zone. If there are three cases in one floor, the entire floor shall be a containment zone. If there are 10 cases in a tower, either single on a floor or on multiple floors, the entire tower will be deemed a containment zone. In instances where there are 50 cases in an apartment complex of 50-100 households, or fewer than a hundred cases in a complex with less than 100 households, the entire complex will be declared as a containment zone. Once declared as a containment zone, all residents within the area should be tested, while all households will be surveyed for the health of the vulnerable population, stated the advisory. While testing of primary and secondary contacts is advisable, it is mandatory if the contacts are symptomatic. Contacts should also remain under quarantine till the test results are declared. The society or RWA has to ensure that those under home quarantine remain indoors. Vendor services, couriers and delivery services should be limited to the main gate. The exceptions to this are services listed as emergency or necessary, such as medical visits, plumbing and electrical works, and delivery of cooking gas and water supply.

The Prime Minister appreciated the high rate of testing and vaccination in the Statewhich is higher than the national average,” he said. The Prime Minister was also apprised of measures initiated to ramp up medical infrastructure. “I sought Central assistance to raise the oxygenated beds and oxygen plants,” Mr. Bommai said. The Prime Minister praised the use of technology for monitoring the health ofthosein home isolation, he said. Mr. Modi instructedto make all preparations based on the experience of the first and second wave of COVID-19 as the pandemic is expected to peak in February. During the third wave,over 94% infected are in home isolation. Therefore, the Prime Minister wanted to give priority to ensuring supply of medicines, appropriate care and measures to instill a sense of confidence among the infected, Mr. Bommai said. The Union Government has suggested ramping up testing, purchase of ambulances and improving medical infrastructure under the Rs. 32,000 crore package it has provided, the Chief Minister said. The Union Government has providedRs. 32,000 crore for States after the second wave to raise the health infrastructure. Many States have so far not utilised it. States too need to chip with their own share of resources to improve the health infrastructure like ICU, oxygen plants, oxygenated plants and purchase ambulances to make best use of the project, Mr. Bommai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/modi-appreciates-states-handling-of-covid-19/article64950204.ece

Both the parties had sparred over the padayatra raising political dust in the past week. While the Congress did not want to be seen as backing off from its announcement, the State Government was walking a fine line by merely filing FIRs without taking any action to prevent the congregation on the ground fearing sympathy for the Congress. Eventually, it was the High Court’s observations on Wednesday that precipitated the decision. Though the BJP had been attacking the Congress for the padayatra amid the raging pandemic, it was also under pressure to act by its own leaders as the Government was being seen as going slow on the rampant and large-scale violations of COVID-19 norms, while the common man was being penalised. In four days, the padayatra had covered about 70 km and another about 100 km was to have been covered. On the other hand, the Congress sources said that the party high command was increasingly worried about gathering public outrage owing to the padayatra when the COVID-19 numbers were spiking. It was particularly worried about providing a handle to the BJP to attack ahead of the elections to five crucial States, sources said. “Any large spike in COVID-19 cases could be used by the Government to blame the Congress. This would leave Congress in an adverse situation nationally,” sources said. While a section of the Congress leaders were interested in continuing the padayatra by limiting the number of participants, it was found not feasible and with the PIL plea coming up for hearing in court on Friday, the Congress did not want to take a chance, sources said. The party, it is learnt, also considered the growing number of leaders who participated in the padayatra turning positive. On Thursday, Congress leader in Rajya Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge announced that he had contracted the virus. Earlier, veteran leader M. Veerappa Moily and former Minister H.M. Revanna had also tested positive. “Concerns were expressed about more contracting the virus,” sources said. Sources said that despite curtailing the padayatra, the Congress had managed to get a good response and it is expected to boost the morale of party workers in Old Mysuru region in the coming days. “It helped galvanise workers and the party will definitely relaunch the padayatra to sustain the momentum when the pandemic comes under control,” sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fear-of-bad-publicity-made-cong-rethink/article64950209.ece

Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar passed the order while disposing of over 50 separate petitions filed by Manmohankumar V.C. and others, all dependents of dealership holders. The petitioners had questioned the amendments made to the KECPDS (Control) order in 2017. The petitioners had termed as arbitrary the condition that the spouse, son or unmarried daughter of the dealer should have passed class 10 to become eligible to seek transfer of dealership to them if the dealer dies before the age of 65. The petitioners had also questioned the limit of five years fixed for the eligible family member of the deceased dealer to retain the dealership after it was transferred to them. The court, however, accepted the Government’s contention that extension of dealership is “similar to that of appointment on compassionate grounds.” “The State Government is entitled to frame policies in the case of commodity distributions like in the case of compassionate appointments wherein the employers are entitled to frame the policies,” the court said. The condition of ‘pass in class 10’ is a reasonable condition, and the Government was right in contending that a person who deals with commodity distribution is required to have basic knowledge in arithmetic, banking and liaison with public offices, the court said. The court also took note of the fact that the Government, during the pendency of petitions, had increased the period of extension of dealership to the eligible family members to 10 years. However, the court granted one-time relief, not to be treated as a precedent, to the petitioners asking the Government to consider their application for transfer and extension of dealership in their favour without applying educational qualification as some petitioners had benefited from such interim orders granted by court earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-court-upholds-new-criteria-on-transfer-of-fair-price-shop-dealership/article64950205.ece

Renukacharya have all attended public functions that attracted thousands. Though no action was taken against them, the Government wanted to stall our padayatra and lodge FIRs. The BJP is responsible for the rising numbers,” he told reporters while announcing suspension of padayatra temporarily. Stating that the Congress cannot be blamed for increasing COVID-19 cases in the State, he said that the rising cases reflect the trend in the third wave witnessed worldwide. “We are a responsible party and we are concerned about the health of people. Padayatra should not lead to a surge in the numbers. We are not scared of action by the government. We decided to temporarily halt padayatra in the interest of the public,” he added. Insisting that the Congress is committed to the water issues of the State, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar said: “We are suspending the padayatra to honour the feeling of people and the observations of the court. Though initially we thought that only two of us would walk, people joined.

Two-wheelers will be barred from NICE Road from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. starting January 16. Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprise Ltd, the firm which runs NICE Road, said the ban was issued on the directions of the city’s traffic chief keeping in mind the safety of commuters. Sources in the Bengaluru City Traffic Police said the direction was issued after observing a rise in fatal accidents involving two-wheelers. Most of the accidents took place at night. Two major accidents were reported on NICE Road over the last one month, but neither involved two-wheelers. Four persons were killed in a serial accident involving a truck last week and three women were killed when they were run over by a car in the first week of December. However, senior traffic police officials from the area said, on an average, at least one case involving two-wheelers is reported almost every week. Traffic police say the lack of adequate street lighting may be causing many of these accidents. “In our analysis, the lack of adequate lighting on the road is one of the major contributors to accidents at night. But when we raised this issue, the firm pointed to guidelines of highways which don’t stipulate street lights. The problem is NICE Road has large traffic volumes of trucks and mega carriers during the night, and drivers in these vehicles often cannot even see a two-wheeler on the road in the darkness. Many accidents have been caused because of this. To avoid this, we have directed the firm to bar two-wheelers at night,” explained B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner (Traffic), Bengaluru. Traffic police have also observed a few youths indulging in wheeling and racing on the highway, though more often than not, this occurs during the day. However, the road is not entirely free of the menace at night either, say motorists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ban-on-two-wheelers-on-nice-road-at-night/article64950353.ece

Patil said here on Wednesday. The Government will allocate Rs. 9.8 crore for setting up the cold storage with a 5,000 tonne capacity. Addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone for the proposed farmers training centre building at Kotnoor D Village on the outskirts of the city, Mr. Patil said that farmers are facing great difficulty in the absence of cold storage, especially after harvesting. Farmers ended up throwing vegetables and fruits on the road after finding it difficult to sell their produces during the lockdown and such units will help them in preserving their produce for a longer period, he added. The Minister said that tender for the establishment of the cold storage has been floated. The foundation stone for the unit will be laid tentatively by next month and the unit is likely to be thrown open for usage by the end of this year. He said that the BJP-led Government is committed to protecting the interests of farmers. The Centre and the State Government have given compensation for crop losses suffered by farmers due to rain and floods last year. Both the State and the Centre have released a sum of Rs. 6,800 each per hectare of rain-fed land. For irrigated land, the Centre has given compensation of Rs. 13,500 per hectare and the State Government has given Rs. 11,500 per hectare.

As such, 40 m on either side of any National Highway should be maintained as construction-free zone, the department has said. In one such recent letter to the Municipal Commissioner of Udupi City Municipal Council, the Assistant Executive Engineer of National Highways Sringeri Sub-Division brought to his attention an order by the High Court of Karnataka passed on September 7, 2021, that confirmed the department’s stand on the issue. Two National Highways pass through Uudpi CMC limits — the Kochi-Panvel National Highway 66 and the Malpe-Tirthahalli National Highway 169A. No licence should be issued to construct buildings within the specified limits of these highways, the Assistant Executive Engineer said in the letter. He also noted that the High Court had categorically stated that action should be initiated against officials concerned if buildings are permitted to be constructed within the construction-free zone. Asked whether buildings on either side of National Highway 169A that cuts through Udupi and Manipal towns were located beyond 40 m from the centre line of the highway, an engineer responded in the negative. He said that there could be very few. He did not comment on the fate of the buildings that have come up in violation of the rule. The letter, however, was written to ensure that the local bodies do not issue licence for building construction within the prohibited zone at least in future, the engineer said. The High Court has in many instances upheld the Government’s stand on the construction-free zone for National Highways and State Highways (40 m from the centre line of the highway) and directed the demolition of buildings that have come up in Padubidri Gram Panchayat limits (August 2021) and Uppunda Gram Panchayat limits (July 2021). The Government laid down the rules on April 1, 2002 specifying construction-free zones for National Highways, State Highways and Major District Roads (25 m). After the recent court orders, the Additional Chief Secretary to Government, Public Works Department wrote to all chief engineers of construction wings on December 13, 2021, to strictly adhere to the specifications failing which engineers concerned will be held responsible for violations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dont-allow-buildings-within-40-metres-of-highway-centre-line/article64950250.ece

Hegde from Manaki near Kumta, Uttara Kannada, has said that the State Government should allow Yakshagana performances to go on without hindering the plans already made by troupes, in view of the COVID-19 situation. If troupes are asked to stop their performances, it will hit the livelihood of hundreds of artistes and others who are indirectly dependent on Yakshagana, he said.  Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Hegde, who will take charge on Friday, said that the government can impose restrictions on the number of people to be allowed at performances to prevent crowding. But a blanket ban on performances during the season is not welcome. “The show must go on,” he said.  Mr. Hegde said that he will take forward the initiative of the immediate past chairman of the academy, M. A. Hegde, who passed away on April 18, 2021, to bring out an encyclopaedia on Yakshagana. “Yakshagana deserves an encyclopaedia,” he added. He said that the academy intends to publish a book to introduce the life, achievements and contributions of artistes who have passed away. The future generation should know the contributions of such artistes and their achievements should not be pushed to the annals, he said. Mr. Hegde said that the academy in Bengaluru does not have its own library which is an urgent requirement. In addition, he intends to set up a Yakshagana museum in Bengaluru. “Plans are many. But I am not sure whether all can be realised within the remaining short period of my office,” Mr. Hegde, who retired as a professor of Kannada from AV Baliga College in Kumta on May 31, 2019, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yakshagana-performances-should-go-on-says-hegde/article38270655.ece

Material recovered from dry waste sourced from 43 gram panchayats nearby will be stored, segregated and sent for recycling at the facility. No wet waste will be stored and processed in the facility. Dry waste mainly comprises low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene materials, which will be segregated and sent for recycling. The project, coming up on 5.75 acres at a cost of Rs. 2.50 crore, has 10,000 kg per day processing capacity. SAAHAS Zero Waste Pvt. Ltd. will provide technical assistance to the Rural Drinking Water and Sanitation Department to set up the facility. Earlier, the panchayat had proposed to set up the facility at Ganjimutt on two acres of land. The move was shelved due to opposition to the project by local residents. In addition, the land allotted was not suitable due to a slope, he said.  Mr. Kumara told The Hindu that this facility is among five such sanctioned for the State under the mission. The others are in Udupi, Ramanagaram, Ballari and Bengaluru. The facility for Udupi was commissioned at Nitte last year.  In addition, the government has sanctioned three faecal sludge treatment plants, which will come up at Golthamajalu, Ujire and Uppinangady. The plants at Golthamajalu and Ujire are being built at an estimated cost of Rs. 81 lakh and Rs. 82 lakh, respectively. Construction of the plant at Uppinangady at an estimated cost of Rs. 68 lakh will begin shortly. In addition, it has been proposed to build two more such plants at Sullia and Puttur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/material-recovery-facility-coming-up-at-tenka-edapadavu/article38270656.ece

Addressing mediapersons in Udupi on Thursday, president of the forum Divakar Sanil said that imposing weekend curfew and night curfew is not a solution to curb the spread of COVID-19. ‘‘When political and religious events are taking place without such restrictions, putting restrictions on trade and commerce activities is not fair,’’ he said. Several businessmen are yet to recover from the losses they suffered during the previous two lockdowns, he said and added that some have even ended their lives. Mr. Sanil said that the government should have thought about the impact before announcing weekend and night curfew. It will force many shopkeepers and traders to reduce the number of people they employ, which, in turn, will lead to another socio-economic problem. He said that more crowds at shopping malls could lead to the spread of COVID-19, but not in shops of small traders and businessmen who can implement COVID-19 protocol easily. But small shopkeepers are unable to recover from the losses they incurred during the lockdowns due to the restrictions on business activities. The government should come to the rescue of traders, he said and demanded that weekend curfew and night curfew be withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/weekend-night-curfew-opposed/article38270650.ece

The Mayor appeared besieged and cornered with no support even from her own party (BJP) many of whom have sought a revision of the works. The crux of the issue revolves around the utilisation of Mayor grants for road repairs and this has left the elected representatives divided over the identification of specific streets to be taken up with the funds. They have questioned the rationale behind the choice of roads and have written to the Deputy Commissioner to withhold the amount pending a revision of the plan. Ms. Sunanda Palanethra said she was piqued over the attitude of the elected representatives including those from her own party for stopping the works. “I had sought Rs. 50 crore against which Rs. 25 crore has already been released. The remaining amount was slated for release after finalisation of tenders but there are objections to the works and hence even the Rs. 25 crore released may lapse’’, she said. ‘’It has been almost 2 years since any major works have been taken up by the MCC due to COVID-19 and I was hopeful of sprucing up the roads. These works were besides the repairs being taken up by the MCC on its own’’, according to Ms. Palanethra. But it is unfortunate that the elected representatives have written to the DC and have asked him to withhold the funds which is demoralising, the Mayor added. The roads in Mysuru are riddled with potholes due to incessant rains that lashed till the first week of December. The MCC on its part delayed the repair works citing inclement weather but now that the rains have ceased, politics have erupted over funds utilisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mayor-councillors-clash-over-funds/article64950192.ece

Speaking to media persons here on Thursday Mr. Simha said at a time when the third wave of the pandemic was sweeping across the country, the Congress has betrayed its “irresponsible behaviour’” and its ‘’unbridled thirst’’ to come to power at any cost. ‘’We have seen students contracting the virus enmasse and as many as 400 staff in Parliament have tested positive. In Karnataka classes in educational institutions have shifted from offline mode to online mode due to spiraling number of cases and yet the Congress has gone about gathering people through padayatra.’’ He said the Mekedatu project was conceived decades ago and Mr. Siddaramaiah was the Chief Minister and KPCC President D.K. Shivakumar was the Minister for Power from 2013 to 2018. What prevented them from implementing the project during their tenure, questioned Mr. Simha. The people are able to see through their gameplan. This is nothing short of drama, said Mr. Simha and accused Congress of misleading the public. He said Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Shivakumar fancied themselves to be the next Chief Minister and were trying to outdo each other. He alleged that Mr. Siddaramaiah had ensured the defeat of the then KPCC president G. Parameshwara to thwart him from becoming the Chief Minister in 2013. “Today, Mr. Shivakumar is the KPCC chief and Mr. Siddaramaiah was trying hard to scuttle his chances but in the process the people of Karnataka who are suffering.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-desperate-attempt-for-political-gains-simha/article38270682.ece

On cases rising in Mysuru, she said in her statement that barring weekends, a gathering of up to 200 persons is allowed during weekdays. “Doesn’t the infection spread on weekdays? All gatherings should have been banned on all days. What purpose does the night curfew serve? Isn’t there more crowd during the day than at night? Many experts have expressed that night and weekend curfews are unscientific. When gatherings are allowed for certain functions and political events, it beats the purpose of all the restrictions imposed. Common people are subjected to economic hardships for nothing. People follow orders only when they are scientific,” she argued. The AAP Mysuru president said the government must realise that strict weekend restrictions are hurting the daily labour class and small shopkeepers, for whom the weekend earning is the main sustenance. Maintaining social distance, use of masks and sanitizers must be made mandatory and weekend trade should be allowed but rules should be framed in such a way that crowding does not occur at any time at any place, she suggested. Fines and caning is common for ordinary people for even minor violations of rules but no action is being taken even if the BJP and Congress leaders gather people in large numbers. “When leaders like D.K. Shivakumar, Siddaramaiah, Renukacharya gather crowds, an eyewash case is registered, which will be quietly withdrawn later, but they are not arrested. Are there different sets of rules for the general public and VIPs?” she asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aap-blames-unscientific-rules-political-events-for-covid-rise-questions-purpose-of-weekend-curfew/article38270509.ece

Titled Return to Roots, the calendar has different variety of tubers and roots displayed in every page of the month coupled with benefits and the culinary delights that one could dish out using them. Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samrudha pointed out that these roots and tubers are still used by indigenous tribes and not only are they less water intensive but are also nutritious. Promoting their cultivation and consumption can lead to a more sustainable planet and agricultural practices to benefit the farmer. “Though many tubers are on the verge of extinction they can still be revived only if we can create a demand for them and the desktop calendar is an attempt to kindle public interest in this unique heritage which is all but lost’’, said Mr. Krishnaprasad. India is home to a number of tuber crops - cassava, sweet potato, taro, tannia, yams, foot yam, yam bean, arrowroot etc. They can overcome adverse weather conditions and can be cultivated by farmers to shore up their income provided there was a market for it. Sahaja Samrudha in collaboration with NABARD has rolled out the Roots and Tuber Calendar 2022 as a unique effort to popularise the use of roots and tubers cultivation. The calendar is an effort to popularise roots and tubers and conserving them.

The webinar was about consumption of safe microbial food products from microbial fermentation, microbial metabolites as nutrition, fermented foods and their benefits, and mushroom production by zero-waste technology. Sridevi Annapurna Singh, Director, CSIR-CFTRI, Mysuru, who inaugurated the webinar, was accompanied by Prakash Halami, Head of the Microbiology and Fermentation Technology Department, CSIR-CFTRI, and other staff members. In her inaugural session, the CFTRI director said: “Though we have a high crop production, it is not sufficient to meet the demands of the population. Food-grade microorganisms are a better alternative as they require less water and land than crops and have lowered ethical issues”. Briefing about the programme, Dr. Halami said the webinar’s theme is apt as it addresses a highly relevant issue of nutritional security. “The inclusion of food-grade microorganisms in our diet can enrich the nutritional value of the food and can be a potential solution to many disorders, including malnutrition,” he explained. In the lecture session, Gayathri Devraja, Professor, Microbiology Department, Davangere University, emphasised the use of lactic acid bacteria for solving celiac disease because it enhances the epithelial barrier and destroys multiple epitopes on gliadin. Sumana K., Assistant Professor, Department of Microbiology, JSS Academy of Higher education and Research, Mysuru, stressed how microorganisms are a rich source of dietary lipids, amino acids, ethanol, organic acids, hormones, enzymes, and antibiotics. The talk by Subrota Hati, Assistant Professor, Dairy Microbiology Department, Kamdhenu University, Gujarat, addressed the antihypertensive and anti-oxidative compounds in camel and goat milk fermented with potential lactic cultures.

Patil laid the foundation stone for a girls hostel to be constructed at a cost of Rs. 4.11 crore on the Agriculture College premises in Bheemarayanagudi, Shahapur taluk of Yadgir district, on Wednesday. He said that farmers should switch to crops that will bring double income while protecting the quality of soil by adopting a comprehensive agriculture system. “Farmers should choose different crops based on the changing climate because growing the same crops will adversely affect the soil. This is what agriculture scientists are advising farmers often. They should switch to different crops to make agriculture a benefit-oriented vocation. Therefore, farmers should adopt the new system and grow crops to get more benefit,” the Minister said. Mr. Patil said that farmers dependent on the Upper Krishna Project are getting sufficient canal water. Therefore, they should not give more importance to growing paddy which obviously requires more water but [they should] prefer crops that require light irrigation. “Also, farmers should make use of the benefits provided by the Union Government under the Atma Nirbhar Scheme to establish food processing units,” he added. Stating that technical education is facing tough competition from agriculture education, he said that 10 per cent seats in agriculture education are reserved for students from agricultural families and each student from all communities are getting Rs. 11,500 scholarship under the Vidyanidhi Scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-urged-to-switch-to-profitable-crops/article64950214.ece

The surge in cases among this age group may be due to their frequent movement in public spaces compared to the other age groups, including the elderly. With most of them having taken two doses of the vaccine, they may have visited crowded places or attended public functions, especially at the time of Christmas and New Year celebrations, said Dr. V. Jayashree, District Medical Officer. However, there has been no sudden increase in hospitalisation of people in the 30-45 age group despite the increase in the number of persons getting infected in the category. Dr. Jayashree said the Health department was ready to set apart around 1,000 beds in government hospitals and provide facilities to tackle a possible surge. “We could scale it up to about 1, 500 as per requirement by including beds in private hospitals,” she added. The assessment by the health authorities showed that the number of non-COVID-19 cases had shot up over the last few days. They included dengue incidence and viral fever. Among hospitalisations reported among those infected by SARS-CoV-2, a majority have co-morbidities. Only those in need of urgent medical help are being admitted to hospitals at present. The Health department said the earlier strategy of home isolation for mild cases would continue. This was necessary, as the possibility of a further spike in cases cannot be ruled out, it said. Local bodies have been told to step up monitoring to check violation of norms. 2,394 new cases A total of 2,394 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Ernakulam district on Thursday.

That the around 20,000 sq.ft. structure is tucked in between the row of the iconic Chinese fishing nets, regarded as the ‘Taj Mahal of Kochi’, is in itself unpalatable, said Biley Menon, national vice president of the Institute of Urban Designers and co-convenor of INTACH, Kochi Chapter. “The size, aesthetics, and location of the jetty will hamper the operation and existence of the nets, whose pictures adorn the cover of any tourism brochure on Kochi or even a power-point presentation. The nets that were first set up 500 years ago and gave a brand identity to Kochi as among the top 10 international must-visit places in the world, should be protected at any cost. The massive structure that would protrude on the beachfront, its shallow sloped roof, covered terrace, and elements like openings, columns, arches, and gables are inconsistent with the rich Portuguese and Dutch colonial heritage of Fort Kochi,” he said. Above all, it blocks the view of the sea mouth, a historical feature of Fort Kochi, where people have for centuries watched ships passing in and out of the harbour. In addition, the proposal for a restaurant at the first-floor level, right at the sea mouth, is in violation of CRZ norms. On the safety front, the proposed jetty falls within the sea mouth and ship channel of the harbour. The hydrodynamics at this point is quite tricky to berth vessels at the jetty. All these aspects could have been averted had a more compact jetty complex been built at Kamalakadavu, located 200 metres away, where the dilapidated and ill-maintained corporation and tourism jetties share space, Mr. Menon said. The project makes a ridicule of heritage conservation and the Kerala Art and Heritage Commission, said Jose Dominic, who owns popular heritage hotels. Kochi Metro Rail Limited officials did not comment on the merits of the issue, citing an ongoing litigation regarding the demolition of three heritage buildings to make way for the jetty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-metro-jetty-at-odds-with-heritage-norms/article64950277.ece

The directive came on a petition filed by Anoop K.A. and Subin Paul, president and secretary of the All Kerala Truck Owners Association, arraying, among others, the Transport Secretary and the Transport Commissioner as respondents in a contempt of court petition. The court in November had sought details of goods vehicles and drivers against whom enforcement agencies had taken action for carrying overload. It had also sought details of the action taken against such vehicles that operated without displaying registration number, on a similar contempt petition filed by the truck owners’ association. Violations on the rise The court intervention comes even as violation of rules are on the rise, says a senior Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) official. “They include manifold safety issues, including danger to pedestrians and other motorists, and the damage caused to roads by such illegally altered goods carriers, mainly tipper lorries. We hope the enforcement drive will gain momentum in the wake of the court intervention.” MVD officials say they are often forced to go slow on action against rule violations as many operators have politicians supporting them, who in turn will malign the officials leading the drive. “Some also prevail on the lorry operators who have been challaned not to pay the penalty amount,” they say. There have been instances of tipper lorries permitted to carry 15 tonnes carrying 30 tonnes or even more of cargo. They thus deny business to other operators, they say. Penalty issues Rule violators, sometimes, target MVD officials as the police mostly impose a much-lesser penalty of Rs. 250 for overload, whereas MVD personnel impose penalty on the basis of every additional tonne that a lorry is found carrying, which often goes up to Rs. 25,000 or sometimes even more, it is learnt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mvd-set-to-act-firm-against-overloaded-goods-carriers/article38270629.ece

The representatives of the forum, who were asked to turn up at the Mount St. Thomas in Kakkanad where the synod of the Syro-Malabar Church was progressing, said in the evening that they could not meet the members of the synod despite getting a clear assurance in the afternoon. “We have decided to remain here on a fast demanding that the members of the synod meet us,” they said. Representatives of the ‘Almeya Munnettam,’ a collective of lay people, staged a torchlight protest in front of the church headquarters. The differences over the celebration of the Mass had widened after 100-odd priests staged a fast in front of the residence of Cardinal George Alencherry, head of the Syro-Malabar Church, in the city on Wednesday to reiterate their demand that the archdiocese be allowed to continue with the tradition of celebrating the Mass facing the congregation the whole time and be given permanent exemption from a directive of the synod issued in last August in this regard. The forum leaders had said earlier that any attempt to impose uniform Mass would be resisted. The situation had aggravated amidst the progress of the 30th synod of bishops of the Church at Mount St. Thomas in Kakkanad. The community of priests had earlier submitted a memorandum to the synod raising the same demand. The 30th synod, which began on January 7, will conclude on January 15. ‘Synod should quit’ Almeya Munnettam reiterated its demand that the spirit of the Second Vatican Council be preserved and the synod should quit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/row-over-mass-priests-seek-meeting-with-synod/article64950140.ece

Ramachandran Pillai (SRP) has said the ongoing campaign against China in India is aimed at thwarting the CPI(M). Inaugurating a delegates’ meeting of the party Kottayam district conference here on Thursday, Mr. Pillai emphasised the need to oppose these campaigns aimed at turning the public sentiments against the party. “China has become a moderate prosperous country now. They have also eradicated poverty to a great extent and even made significant contributions towards the global programme for eradication of poverty. With China emerging as a superpower to question the hegemony of the U.S., there is an organised campaign against the country globally. This is against the backdrop of China developing relations with as many as 109 countries and supplying COVID-19 vaccine to 116 countries,” he said. He launched a scathing attack against the Union government for attempting to divide people in the name of religion and cited the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir as a case in point.

The interim order by Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan V. on Thursday follows a petition filed by Mohammed Noufal, a native of Moonniyur in Malappuram district, who urged the court to direct the university to make the appointments from the rank list for university assistants prepared by the Kerala Public Service Commission (KPSC). Mr. Noufal is an engineering graduate. It was reported that 100 persons were proposed to be appointed on a temporary basis for jobs such as false numbering of answer scripts and packing of question papers. Applications had been invited from residents of three grama panchayats around the university campus, who are aged below 36 and are graduates, and a rank list was prepared. The petition pointed out that though the institution had claimed that they were temporary appointments, their tenure was likely to be extended. The university had decided to regularise the services of people appointed on temporary basis earlier. Mr. Noufal said non-teaching staff were being appointed on contract basis, because permanent appointments to such posts could be made only through the KPSC. George Poonthottam, senior lawyer, appeared for the petitioner. Dissent expressed P. Rasheed Ahammed, UDF-aligned Syndicate member, had expressed his dissent during the meeting that discussed the issue. He had also written to the Governor, who is also the Chancellor of universities, to cancel the move and stop the appointments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-stays-posting-of-assistants-at-calicut-varsity/article38270572.ece

COVID first-line treatment centres (FLTCs), which had been inactive after the infections saw a dip in the past few months, would be revived, said a senior Health department official on Thursday. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan recently directed district collectors to ensure that at least one FLTC is functional in each district. At one point, there were around 30 such centres in Kozhikode district, where asymptomatic infected persons and those with mild symptoms were admitted. With the government prioritising home isolation strategy and the dip in total number of cases, the number of people going there came down. Another plan is to have more tests to detect the infection early. There was a time when over 20,000 tests were conducted in the district in a day, including those at mega camps and through mobile medical units. As the government’s testing strategy changed, the number of tests also came down. Right now, more reliance is on RT-PCR tests, which is time consuming, but more accurate. The health official indicated that the State’s testing strategy might change in tune with Central guidelines. TPR 19.92% Meanwhile, 1,274 people tested positive for the virus in the district on Thursday. The daily test positivity rate rose to 19.92%. Only 6,497 samples were tested. Active caseload from the district rose to 6,992. The only source of relief is that very few people are seeking hospitalisation now. Seventy five people are undergoing treatment in various government hospitals and 163 others are in private hospitals. This number could, however, go up if the total number of cases surge again. The surveillance dashboard of the COVID Jagrata portal is yet to upload details on the intensive care unit beds and oxygen availability in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-gears-up-to-tackle-spurt-in-covid-19-cases/article38270573.ece

The Senate of the varsity is expected to discuss a proposal to introduce rotation of these posts after a two-year term, at its meeting scheduled for January 17. According to sources, a new statute (14.A) is likely to be introduced after Statute 14 of Chapter 2 (Conditions of Service of Teachers in Private Colleges) of the Calicut University First Statutes, 1979, in tune with Statute 18 of Chapter 3 of the Calicut University First Statutes, 1977. The move follows a directive from the Kerala High Court to consider a representation by K.V. Arun, Senate member, and Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science, Sree Kerala Varma College, Thrissur, and “take an appropriate decision”. Mr. Arun had earlier raised the issue with the Syndicate and the academic council as well. Statute 18 (Head of a Department) in Chapter 3 (Teachers of the University) of the Calicut University First Statutes, 1977, has a sentence “… The Syndicate shall nominate the senior most Professor as the Head of the Department for a period of two years and at the end of two years, the next senior most Professor shall be nominated…” The amendment is to change it as “…The Department Council shall nominate the senior most professor as the Head of the Department for a period of two years or retirement of the incumbent, whichever is earlier, and after expiry of the term, the next senior most Professor shall be nominated…” In departments which have no professor or associate professor, the senior-most assistant professor (in-charge) shall be nominated to the post. No statutory provision In his representation to the Vice Chancellor, Mr. Arun had pointed out that the post of the head of the department was an important administrative one in a college or university. Almost all universities and institutions of higher learning follow a system of rotation of headship in departments. The departments in the University of Calicut too have this. However, its affiliated private colleges still follow a system based on seniority, as there is no statutory provision. Mr. Arun claimed that introducing rotation in headship would help all teachers get the benefit of being involved in the administrative activities of colleges. It is important, as administrative experience is mandatory for appointments to higher academic posts, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rotation-of-headship-likely-in-aided-colleges/article38270575.ece

The 29-year-old has turned a star, having conducted at least a dozen exhibitions in the past few years and having walked the ramp many a time. Unlike many with Down Syndrome, Anita is not “affected” by the condition but has gone past it to be an artist and model. Anita owes her success to her parents Ramdas and Usha who have supported her in every way possible, being her strength and voice. Anita does not speak much, yet exudes confidence in her behaviour, quite befitting modelling, the career of her choice. She has been the brand ambassador of several brands in Chennai and Pune, where she lived for years, until the COVID-19 outbreak. However, such opportunities are scarce in Kerala, Mr. Ramdas noted. A chartered accountant, Mr. Ramdas has spent a greater part of his career in West Asia, before the family settled down in Pune and the pandemic brought it back to its roots at Kallai, Kozhikode.

The unfortunate incident at the Idukki Government Engineering College, following a conflict during the union elections on Monday, came as a shock when Kerala was still reeling from the twin political murders in Alappuzha last month. Aggressive stance The Congress, which has become aggressive after K. Sudhakaran took charge as Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president, was heading towards a semi-cadre setup, determined to put the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front government in a spot on various issues in the State. However, the murder has now left the Congress with egg on its face, especially since its leaders have been accusing the CPI(M) of its involvement in political violence in the State. The statement of Mr. Sudhakaran that “the martyrdom was asked for” and the reaction of the Congress national spokesperson Shama Mohamed to the murder as “Karma” on Twitter became controversial and gave enough political ammunition for the CPI(M) leadership. No wonder Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in his public address in Kozhikode used the opportunity to attack the Congress asking its leaders “where did the culture of piercing the heart come from?” Congress leaders, irrespective of factional dynamics, were compelled to rally behind Mr. Sudhakaran. The KPCC president’s defiant attitude appears to have prompted a section of the rank and file of the party to toe his line to take on the CPI(M) politically. Actor’s car vandalised But the justification of the Congress for trying to emulate the competitive politics often practised by the CPI(M) has earned a bad press in recent times. The newly adopted belligerent style of the Congress saw its workers vandalising actor Joju George’s car amid a protest over fuel price hike on the national highway in Kochi recently.  K. Sudhakaran’s response to the killing drew criticism and Congress leaders, irrespective of factional dynamics, were compelled to rally behind him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dheeraj-murder-puts-congress-in-a-spot/article38270559.ece

Microchips in cows She said that Kerala was working towards developing new varieties of pedigree cows. The Kerala Livestock Development Board (KLDB) has tied up with the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram. The government is also introducing a scheme of implanting microchips in cows so as to store their complete information. The project will begin in Pathanamthitta, she said. She called upon Milma to create awareness among farmers about its latest energy supplement named Ksheeravardhini Bypass Fat. Milma has prescribed it for high milk yielding cows in both advanced stage of pregnancy and early stage of lactation. 70% subsidy Milma Chairman K.S. Mani said that Ksheeravardhini Bypass Fat was being sold to farmers at 70% subsidy as an introductory offer under the farmer support scheme. Mr. Mani lauded the government efforts to control the spiralling prices of cattle feed. V.K. Sreekandan, MP, delivered the keynote address. Milma managing director Patil Suyog Subhashrao said that dairy sector had returned to normalcy much faster than other areas after the COVID-19-induced lockdown. District panchayat president K.

The State-run transport utility launched six to-and-fro services to Pallichal, Nemom and Pravachambalam, which will shuttle along the route from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on all days. The buses will pass each stop in the direction in intervals ranging from 15 to 30 minutes. More suburban services Transport Minister Antony Raju, who presided over the inaugural function, said more suburban services would be launched in routes connecting Mudavanmugal, Malayinkeezhu, Karakulam, Vattappara, Kazhakuttam, Sreekaryam, Kaniyapuram, Pothencode, Akkulam, Anayara, Veli, Kulathoor, Kovalam and Poovar. A majority of the city services would transition into green fuels within six months. Fifty electric buses would soon be rolled out in Thiruvananthapuram. Besides, half of the 300 CNG buses that were being procured by the KSRTC would be allotted to the city, Mr. Raju said. Circular services The city circular services that plied along seven routes clockwise and anti-clockwise had been witnessing an increasing patronage, he said. Nearly 17,000 passengers currently depended on the services. The success had prompted the KSRTC to extend the introductory offer of Rs. 10-Good Day tickets that allowed travel throughout the day until March 31. Using the Today ticket, launched on Thursday, passengers could travel unlimited on shuttle and circular services for 12 hours. Monthly cards that would provide considerable discount for frequent travellers would be launched, the Transport Minister said. Flagging off the shuttle service, General Education Minister V. Sivankutty said plans were on to launch shuttle services connecting schools. The proposal would be considered after the Omicron-induced restrictions were lifted. KSRTC chairman and managing director Biju Prabhakar, Thiruvananthapuram Corporation councillor Soumya and KSRTC zonal traffic officer Jacob Sam Lopez were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-launches-six-city-shuttle-services/article64950153.ece

The incumbent district committee is sitting pretty. It has emerged stronger after the party’s good show in the local body and Assembly elections. Under district secretary Anavoor Nagappan, the Left Democratic Font emerged victorious in 13 Assembly constituencies in the district. It also maintained its traditional sway in the prestigious Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) lost only the Kovalam Assembly constituency to the United Democratic Front. Notably, the district CPI(M) “closed the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) sole account” in the State in the Nemom Assembly segment. General Education Minister V. Sivankutty trounced Congress and BJP heavyweights K. Muraleedharan, MP, and Kummanam Rajasekharan respectively to recapture Nemom. V.K. Prasanth’s victory from Vattiyurkavu, despite the perceived pro-Congress tilt of the dominant Nair Service Society (NSS), was touted as a feather in the district committee's cap. A party insider speculated that the district meet would endorse the leadership of Mr. Nagappan for a second term. He also postulated that the meeting could make a few changes to the 47-member district committee. More youths, women The conference is likely to pull out a few workers aged above 75 years from the committee and include more youths and women. By one account, the meeting would only minimally change the make-up of the district secretariat. The district committee is likely to draw flak for organising a 500-member Thiruvathira presentation ahead of the conference, in brazen violation of the COVID-19 protocol. The allegedly embarrassing spectacle caused some reputational damage to the ruling party. CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and Mr. Sivankutty disavowed the event. The elevation of Arya Rajendran as Thiruvananthapuram Mayor and her “style of functioning” allegedly caused some rumble in the CPI(M) in the district. It is a matter of conjecture whether such issues would figure at the district conference. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the conference at Parassala at 10 a.m. on Friday. Mr. Nagappan will present the report. The delegates will debate the report and elect the new secretary and district committee on January 16. The same evening, Mr. Balakrishnan will inaugurate a public meeting as part of the meet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/surprises-unlikely-at-cpim-meet/article38270752.ece

The SHM is introducing the Arka Vertical Gardens where all you need is just 1 sq m of sunlit space. Designed by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research-Indian Institute of Horticulture Research (IIHR), the vertical garden structure is being introduced in the State through the SHM under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH). The cost of a single unit is Rs. 24,000. Of this, 75% will be provided as subsidy under MIDH. The remaining 25% has to be met by the beneficiary. Minister for Agriculture P. Prasad formally launched the scheme, christened ‘Adukkalakkayi Adukku Krishi,’ on the Secretariat campus on Thursday. On wheels A big attraction of these vertical gardens are that they they provide urban population easy access to safe-to-eat vegetables. Since the structure is fitted with wheels, it can also be easily moved around. In an urban scenario, the vertical garden structure can be accommodated in sunlit utility area, balcony or rooftops of flats. Apart from vegetables, it can also be used for growing medicinal and flower crops. The structure has three major components — a base frame, a main central support and the supporting arms for placing pots and grow bags. Pots suitable for growing different vegetables, flowers and medicinal plants can be used with soil or a soil-less (cocopeat) growing medium. A 25-litre plastic container placed at the top of the structure with necessary drip laterals, microtubes and drippers are also provided to water the plants. In the first phase, the SHM is planning to install 340 units in urban locales in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Kozhikode and Kannur districts. Of this, 10 units will be set up free of cost at government offices for generating awareness. A total of 330 units will be supplied to the public via the subsidy scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/grow-all-your-veggies-in-all-of-1-sq-m-space/article64950148.ece

With seemingly little regard for the forceful resurgence of the COVID-19 pestilence, the CPI(M) district committee had organised the nearly 500 all-women event in violation of the pandemic protocol. The party had organised the event soon after the government limited attendance at marriages, funerals and social events to a maximum of 50. Without masks News channel images showed that CPI(M) Polit Bureau member M.A. Baby and CPI(M) district secretary Anavoor Nagappan were among the audience. The footage revealed that many of the participants were without masks. The CPI(M)’s critics took to social media in strength to condemn the ruling party’s “unabashed disregard” for public health. The Thiruvathira display also triggered a torrent of viral memes lampooning Mr. Vijayan and the CPI(M). It also did not help the CPI(M) that the televised event had occurred on a day when the party was mourning the murder of Kannur-based Students Federation of India leader Dheeraj in campus violence in Idukki. The Opposition immediately latched on to the prevalent public sentiment. Congress leader K. Babu, MLA, pointed out that the Thiruvathira rendering was replete with cloying praise for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He compared the song to the anthem of the erstwhile princely State of Travancore, which eulogised the king. He said the CPI(M) had repeatedly denounced excessive public admiration for leaders, irrespective of their social standing or political stature. However, the party rules did not seem to apply to Mr. Vijayan. The Chief Minister seemed unwilling to discourage attempts to lionise him, Mr. Babu said. The Congress pointed out that the CPI(M) had censured Kannur ‘strong man’ P. Jayarajan for purportedly heading a personality cult. Leaders disavow event Meanwhile, the CPI(M) has attempted to swiftly put the controversy to rest and move on with its district, State, and national conferences. CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the party should have avoided organising the event. General Education Minister V. Sivankutty echoed a similar sentiment. However, Mr. Baby declined to comment.  The Thiruvathira rendering was replete with cloying praise for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan K.

Mr. Balakrishnan said on Thursday that the Centre's decision was a repudiation of the State's secular and progressive values and an insult to the memory of the social reformer. Guru’s message The Guru and his message of oneness was an anathema to the Hindu majoritarian and divisive BJP. The party had done a historical wrong by publicly rejecting the Guru. By doing so, the BJP had reaffirmed its adherence to its revisionist feudal values, including the outlawed and condemnable practice of untouchability, which the seer had opposed vehemently. Vignettes of Kerala life Mr. Balakrishnan said the State’s float for the Republic Day parade highlighted the vignettes of Kerala life. It depicted the snakeboat race, landmark structures and women empowerment theme. Kerala submitted a new model with the image of the Guru. However, the Central government insisted that the float prominently display the image of Sree Sankaracharya.

Aswasanidhi was launched in December 2018 in the wake of the State Crime Records Bureau reporting an increase in crime against women and children in the period from 2008 to June 2018. A need was felt to provide immediate financial assistance to women and children who had survived sexual assault, acid attacks, gender-based violence, domestic violence and other such crimes. Sanction was given to utilise Rs. 3 crore from the plan fund for complaints related to sexual assault of minors registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act, grievous physical or mental injury owing to domestic violence, in case of pregnancy on account of rape, miscarriage or loss of fertility as a result of assault and so on. The minimum and the upper limits of the compensation to be given have also been stipulated by the government. Full amount disbursed Since the project was rolled out in December 2018, this is the first time that full amount sanctioned for aid has been disbursed. In 2018-19, with only a few months left after the project launch, Rs. 48.5 lakh was disbursed. In 2019-20, Rs. 59.3 lakh was given, and in 2020-21, it rose to Rs. 58 crore. This financial year, the disbursal has touched the sanctioned amount, courtesy the improved information, education and communications campaigns that resulted in better outreach, says Nirbhaya Cell State coordinator Sreela Menon. Ms. Menon says they have requested for Rs. 4 crore for the 2022-23 fiscal for Aswasanidhi.

Banana exporting companies had not been taking the entire produce of farmers. However, following the consistent intervention of the department, they agreed to buy the remaining lower grade produce also at a different price. “Recently, the price of bananas came down to Rs. 1 and Rs. 2 per kg, but with our intervention, it is improving now,” Mr. Satish claimed. The Horticulture Commissioner had taken note of the issue raised in the news report and sought information on the ground reality. Officials in Anantapur agreed that the involvement of middlemen was reducing the total price earned by farmers and to change the situation. They advised the growers to form into Farmer Producer Organisations so that they could process, store and market their produce without losing money to other intermediate operators. “We have been asking the companies and the farmers to be in touch and deal without anyone in between, but in practice, it is not happening. If the farmers in a particular area with a common interest come together, they could reap advantages of various subsidies from the Central and State governments. They could resort to value-addition, marketing, and constructing cold storages to ward off price fluctuations,” Mr. Satish added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fpos-will-help-ryots-overcome-middlemen-price-fluctuations/article64950046.ece

The announcement by the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah that the padayatra would be suspended temporarily came after party leaders huddled at the district Congress committee office in Ramanagaram to discuss options before them. The push for the announcement also came from the party high command, which sources said, was worried about gathering negative optics. The Congress also considered the pandemic situation, which could be later blamed on the padayatra, sources said. “The padayatra will commence from where it was stopped and will culminate where it was decided once the COVID-19 fears die down and norms are eased. The decision was not made due to threats from the Government but keeping the health of the public in mind. The Congress is a responsible party,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said with KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, who spearheaded the padayatra, by his side. The 11-day padayatra to Bengaluru, which commenced on Sunday, seeking implementation of the Mekedatu drinking water project, had attracted thousands, raising fears of COVID-19 spread while several Congress leaders, who attended the padayatra testing positive. Even while party leaders were confabulating on the future course of action, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai in a letter to Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Shivakumar appealed to them to stop the padayatra owing to pandemic concerns and drew their attention to the development in the High Court. He said the Mekedatu project could be taken forward with cooperation from all once the pandemic threat subsides. However, Health Minister K. Sudhakar in Bengaluru blamed the Congress padayatra for the rising COVID- 19 numbers in the State. In the run-up to the decision was also developments that had taken place after the State Government, which was also under pressure from the High Court observations, issued an order banning the movement of vehicles and people for participating in the padayatra on Wednesday. In a late-night development, after Mr. Shivakumar refused to accept a notice to stop the padayatra, Ramanagaram district officials stuck the notice on the wall of his residence in Kanakapura town. Meanwhile, tightening the movement of vehicles and people, the police prevented Congress workers and leaders from entering Ramanagaram district, which made it impossible for several people to join the padayatra that was to start from the town on the fifth day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-halts-mekedatu-padayatra/article64949957.ece

At the peak of the #MeToo movement, actor Shruthi Hariharan had posted a note on her social media handles alleging Mr. Sarja, her co-star in Vismaya , misbehaved with her while shooting. As the actor’s fans and others came down heavily on Ms. Hariharan for making the allegations, the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce tried to intervene but failed.  While Ms. Hariharan filed a police complaint against Mr. Sarja at the Cubbon Park Police Station, he filed a defamation case for Rs. 5 crore against her.

The Tirupati Municipal Corporation limits saw 366 cases, followed by Chittoor corporation with 124. The six municipalities of Srikalahasti, Puttur, Nagari, Palamaner, Punganur, and Madanapalle witnessed 121 infections, and the rest was spread over 60 mandals in the rural areas. The highest tally in the New Year baffled the medical and health department officials as the graph took a phenomenal rise to 932 from just 13 cases on January 5. The reason is attributed to the free movement of the public on the inter-State routes, particularly on the pilgrimages and unchecked congregations at public places, and violation of the COVID-appropriate behaviour. Despite the instructions from the medical and health officials, the protocol of wearing facemask is largely ignored. Crowds in cinemas During the last week, the public movement in vegetable, fish, and meat markets has been on the rise. Revenue officials said the facemask rule remained completely ignored in cinema halls during the last two months, with crowd thronging the theatres. They deplored that despite cautioning the theatre owners, no steps were initiated to enforce the COVID guidelines. An official said that at present the number of tests conducted in the district centres remained at 5,000 a day and the emerging COVID graph had only turned worrisome with a high positivity rate. “At present there is no clarity on the variant, and we are expecting the daily cases to cross 2,000-plus after Sankranti. Unless the creation of micro containment zones and partial lockdowns are enforced, the situation is likely to go out of control,” the official said. Jallikattu Meanwhile, preparations for the Chittoor-district version of Jallikattu (bull race) are in full swing at several villages in Kuppam, Ramakuppam, and Gudupalle mandals, bordering with Tamil Nadu. On January 8, the village of Vepurimittapalle witnessed a frenzied bull race event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/daily-covid-19-count-touches-932-in-chittoor-district/article64950052.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:45 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Allow use of water for Srisailam canal project’||Telangana Government has requested the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to allow it to utilise 45 tmc ft of additional dependable water in tune with the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal award in lieu of Andhra Pradesh’s diversion of 80 tmc ft water from Godavari to Krishna Basin from Polavaram project. In a letter addressed to Chairman of the river board M.P. Singh on Thursday, Engineer-in-Chief (General-Irrigation) of Telangana C. Muralidhar said that Telangana wants to utilise such water for Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) project. He brought to Mr. Singh’s notice that Telangana has been requesting the Centre for the same for long and it has also written five times to the board. As per the agreement of AP before GWDT in August 1978, the water in lieu of diversion of 80 tmc ft from Polavaram project to Krishna Delta system shall be utilised within the Krishna Basin and that too upstream of Nagarjunasagar or in Telangana. Further, in 2007 the then AP Government had enhanced the ayacut under SLBC from 3 lakh acres to 4 lakh acres without enhancing water utilisation correspondingly from 30 tmc ft to 40 tmc ft. A State-level technical advisory committee of AP had recommended in 2013 that SLBC may be allocated 30 tmc ft assured water out of 45 tmc ft water available for utilisation above Nagarjunasagar in lieu of diversion of Godavari water from Polavaram project to Krishna Delta. The same committee had also recommended lifting of 16.5 tmc ft of water from the foreshores of Nagarjunasagar at Akkampalli to meet the drinking needs of chronically fluoride-affected areas in Nalgonda district and Hyderabad City. Together, the water requirement of SLBC to meet ayacut and drinking water needs would be 45 tmc ft. Further, KWDT-I had also stipulated that inside basin uses should be given preference while allocating water for future needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/allow-use-of-water-for-srisailam-canal-project/article38269975.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:46 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Will fight until fertilizer hike is rolled back’||The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has alleged that the BJP-led government at the Centre has deceived the farming community again by increasing the prices of fertilizer by 50% or more and that the party would continue its fight until the hike is rolled back or absorbed by the Centre as subsidy or otherwise. Speaking to newspersons here on Thursday, Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Errabelli Dayakar Rao, legislators M. Gopal, L. Ramana and V. Gangadhar Goud said the farm sector was ruined by the policies of both the BJP and Congress-led governments at the Centre and the present hike in fertilizer prices in addition to increase in petrol and diesel prices would further burden farmers badly, who are already hit by poor minimum support price and procurement policies. Stating that better justice is being done to the farming community under the TRS rule in Telangana led by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao compared to leaders known for supporting farmers such as Devi Lal and Charan Singh, Mr. Dayakar Rao said it is only the TRS government that spent over Rs. 2.71 lakh crore on agriculture and allied sectors over the last seven years. The PR and RD Minister said while the TRS government is helping farmers with several schemes such as 24×7 free power supply to agriculture, irrigation projects, farm loan waiver, Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima and others, the BJP government at the Centre is working against farmers’ interests in different forms.. He stated that spending of agriculture is much higher in Telangana than what it was in combined Andhra Pradesh under Congress rule. He pointed out that as a TDP leader, the present TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy had fought against the anti-farmer policies of the Congress, but he is now supporting the same policies. Mr. Dayakar Rao also criticised the Centre for not linking the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to reduce the burden of cultivation costs on farmers in spite of suggestions from different sections. He pointed out that Telangana Assembly had adopted a resolution in support of linking MGNREGS to farming but it was overlooked by the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/will-fight-until-fertilizer-hike-is-rolled-back/article64949949.ece

Venu Gopala Krishna is curating a unique exhibition on the ‘life of a toddy tapper and his occupation’ in his hometown of Ramachandrapuram in East Godavari district. The exhibition commenced on Thursday and will remain open till the end of the Sankranti celebrations. A few palm trees have been translocated to the exhibition site. The Minister himself has been involved in developing the exhibits by preparing the toddy collection pots and tying the pots to the trees. The visitors are being allowed to spend time designing the rope that enables the tapper to climb the tree. The toddy tappers, who still eke out their livelihood from toddy tapping, will demonstrate their occupation to the visitors. The exhibition is an attempt to throw light on the vocation of toddy-tapping. Demonstration  “I have joined our team of volunteers to design the exhibition to highlight the changes in the life of the toddy tapper. We will display how a toddy tapper does his task of toddy collection, climbing a tree, toddy collection methods,” Mr. Venu Gopala Krishna told The Hindu .  “The exhibition will show the changes of life of the toddy tapping community in all aspects in the past three generations. The community has witnessed changes in the toddy tapping methods. Once lived in the thatched huts, the community now lives in better houses”, observed Mr. Venu Gopala Krishna. Minister’s initiative The Minister feels proud to hail from the community of toddy tapping, an occupation in which one slip could spell death for the toddy tapper. Mr. Venu Gopala Krishna himself will demonstrate the visitors on the toddy tapping during the Sankranti festival.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-unique-exhibition-on-toddy-tappers-life/article38270691.ece

The wood-boring, tiny mollusc species has been named Xylophaga nandani after Prof. Bijoy Nandan, dean, faculty of Marine Sciences, Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat).  The discovery is also significant in that this is the first time that a member of the genus Xylophaga is being recorded from the Arabian Sea, according to the researchers.  A paper on the findings by Jayachandran P. R. and Jima M. from the Department of Marine Biology, Microbiology and Biochemistry, CUSAT, and Marcel Velasquez from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, has been published in the scientific journal Marine Biodiversity .   The mollusc was spotted off the Karwar coast. Specimens of Xylophaga nandani analysed by the team are tiny - with shell valve length of around 2.2 mm. It is quite possible that they are juveniles, Dr. Jayachandran said.  Members of the family Xylophagaidae are deep-sea dwellers, their presence recorded even at depths of 7,000 metres. Commonly found on wood that plunge to great depths, rarely they are also found on wood drifting on the ocean. As such, much of their lifestyle habits remain a mystery. However, what is known is that they use their shells to cut wood into tiny grains and use it as a source of energy. ''The word 'xylophaga' itself denotes 'wood eating','' said Dr. Jayachandran. They are also close relatives to members of the family Teredinidae, a common species of wood-boring clams (shipworms) found in coastal waters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-species-of-rare-deep-sea-mollusc-found-in-arabian-sea/article64949954.ece

Entry will be allowed through this portal for 10 days. The devout started gathering atop the hill town from Wednesday afternoon and filled up every inch of available space for the ‘V-Day’. Clad in the traditional yellow robes, donning ‘Govindamala’ and observing ‘Deeksha’, it is an annual practice for many to embark on a holy trek from their native town to reach Tirumala ahead of the auspicious day. ‘Uttara Dwara Darshan’ started at around 7.30 a.m, when the beeline of devotees entered the shrine. As part of the festivities, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) organised a ‘Swarna Ratham’ (golden chariot) procession. The sight of the glittering chariot gliding slowly in the fog-covered temple backdrop turned out to be a visual treat for the devout. Around 200 women, mostly employees of the TTD, pulled the bedecked chariot along the four streets. Spiritual ecstasy gripped the devotees seated in the galleries arranged on either side of the Mada Streets, who shouted ‘Govinda Govinda’ to their heart’s content. Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy announced that the decision to provide slot-based entry for the VIPs as well as the ‘Sarvadarshan’ devotees obviated the need for unnecessary waiting in the queue lines. Five lakh additional ‘laddus’ had been kept ready in anticipation of a heavy crowd on the occasion. The TTD, which had built Sri Venkateswara temple in several weaker section colonies, arranged darshan for the residents. As per the Central Government guidelines, double vaccination certificate or COVID-19 negative test report are mandatory to enter the shrine. The TTD Health Department got the entire temple vicinity sanitised and fumigated in view of the COVID-19 situation. The TTD’s in-house security wing and the traffic police regulated the traffic. Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech founder Chairman Krishna Ella and Suchitra Ella donated Rs. 2 crore to S.V.

The seemingly inconsequential issue had started with the airport officials allegedly denying pass to a few civic body officials during the arrival of Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana at the airport on January 9. The authorities remained tough in their stand citing rules, notwithstanding the involvement of Deputy Mayor Bhumana Abhinay Reddy, who is also the son of MLA Karunakar Reddy, forcing the delegation to extend a ‘low-key’ reception to the Minister. However, the airport complex in Renigunta as well as the staff residential quarters located in the city limits experienced suspension of water supply the following day for ‘technical reasons’. The airport officials, disillusioned as they were with the unexpected turn of events, remained tight-lipped when contacted by the media. Municipal Corporation of Tirupati came up with a clarification that the water supply had to be disconnected in the area due to complaints of contamination reported from the vicinity. Commissioner P.S. Gireesha also attributed it to a glitch in the Telugu Ganga pipeline bringing water to the city. However, the social media is agog with stories condemning the political involvement in the the airport’s affairs. ‘Issue resolved’ Meanwhile, airport Director S. Suresh Kumar clarified that the water supply had been restored and that the “issue is resolved.” After the local TDP and BJP leaders raised a hue and cry, Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao shot off a letter to Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, terming the incident as an instance of political highhandedness of the YSRCP government. He demanded a high-level probe into the “deliberate disruption” of water supply to the airport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/disruption-of-water-supply-to-tirupati-airport-deliberate/article38270709.ece

As of now, the TDP may have to enter the election cauldron in 2024 without any alliance with the JSP or the BJP. JSP president Pawan Kalyan has asserted that the party’s tie-up with the BJP is intact. “Let’s not get embroiled in the mind games of other political parties with regard to the alliances. For now, the focus is and should be on strengthening the party,” Mr. Pawan Kalyan has said while interacting with the party cadres recently. Mr. Pawan Kalyan’ s assertion comes in the wake of TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s comments that the “political alliance cannot be a one-sided love affair.” Mr. Naidu was reacting to a party worker’s suggestion at Kuppam recently that the TDP can have an alliance with the JSP. Mr. Naidu further suggested that all the political parties have to come onto a common platform to save Andhra Pradesh from the “autocratic and destructive rule of the YSRCP government.” ‘Mind game’ “I advise all of you not to become pawns in the mind games of others. With regard to the alliance, I will not act unilaterally, but will take a collective decision,” he said. The actor-politician has further advised the party rank and file not to react to the comments on the alliances by outsiders. BJP State president Somu Veerraju too has reacted to Mr. Naidu’s observation in an acerbic way. “Mr. Naidu is an expert in loving anyone to forge alliances as political gain is the only motive behind his decisions,” Mr. Veerraju alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-takers-for-naidus-overtures-on-alliances/article64950034.ece

Last year, the district police booked close to 40 cases, arrested over 100 organisers and punters and seized close to 50 roosters that were used for the fight and betting. To begin with the campaign against the blood sport, this year the district police have already bound over a number of organisers. “We have already bound over close to 200 organisers and the main kingpins who have been organising such events and indulging in betting,” said superintendent of police, Visakhapatnam district, B. Krishna Rao. Apart from binding over a number of key organisers, the district police had embarked on an awareness campaign, days before the festival. “Our teams have been going around villages and towns, where this sport is predominantly organised and creating an awareness campaign on the consequences with the intention of dissuading them from organising the blood sport,” said the SP. According to Mr. Krishna Rao, special teams have been formed who have already started intensive patrolling and this apart even the Mahila Police teams have been told gather information on cockfights. “This apart we also have got information on bull racing and are probing into it,” he said. Not only in Visakhapatnam district, cockfights are also organised in the other two north coastal districts such as Vizianagaram and Srikakulam, said a senior police officer. Huge Money Though the stakes are not that high in the north coastal districts, it goes up phenomenally in the districts of East and West Godavari and in Krishna and Guntur. As per a conservative estimate by the police, the business transacted during the four or five days of the Sankranti festival crosses the Rs. 1,000 crore mark.The fighting rooster breeds are also on demand and their price can range from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 50,000. They are acquired at least a year ago, fed a scientific diet and trained by trainers, said a rooster breeder in Visakhapatnam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/district-police-gear-up-to-curb-cockfighting-during-sankranti/article64949964.ece

Despite a ban on the sale of the synthetic/glass-coated manja, these traders continue to sell manja clandestinely heedless of the danger posed by the synthetic kite strings coated with powdered glass to human beings and birds as well as environment. There have been consistent demands from various quarters for stepping up awareness and enforcement drive against the sale of the banned manja. Meanwhile, some volunteers engaged in environmental conservation have embarked on an awareness campaign in the coal town of Kothagudem by circulating posters earlier released by the government on ban of synthetic/glass-coated manja and its ill-effects. According to sources, the volunteers sought the cooperation of the officials concerned of the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) and the Forest Department in spreading awareness against the banned manja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/manja-sale-continues-clandestinely-in-state/article64950177.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:09 IST,TELANGANA||Bandi challenges KCR for an open debate||State BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar has challenged Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to an open debate on agriculture related issues on Thursday. In an open letter to the Chief Minister, a copy of which was released to the media, he asked if the Chief Minister is ready to resign if he found that not even a single farmer had a meter fixed for the agriculture pump sets. The BJP leader charged Mr. Chandrashekar Rao of not fulfilling the promises given to the farmers but “resorting to cheap politics and gimmicks” in making “baseless charges’‘ against the Centre on its agriculture policies. At a time when farmers, employees and teachers are agitating against GO 317 zonal transfers, lack of job notifications for two lakh vacancies and so on, the CM’s latest missive against the Centre is only meant to “divert the people’s attention and misled them,” he maintained. “This is also to cover up the fact that the Centre is getting ready to take action against Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao’s corruption in various projects like Kaleshwaram, Mission Bhagiratha, Palamuru-Rangareddy and others,” he claimed. Admitting that fertilizer prices had increased, he claimed the Centre has been delivering the products at old rates only whereas, the TRS government had promised free urea in April 2017 but had done nothing since then. Similarly, crop insurance scheme and soil testing were not taken up. Apart from Rythu Bandhu other schemes have been frozen. The Chief Minister never attended the Bankers Meeting or the Crop Plan meeting which exposes his involvement in farmers issues, he said. The Centre is committed to doubling farmers income and has already taken steps as per the Swaminathan Committee by enhancing the minimum support price often, making it applicable for 23 crops, doubling or more in the last seven years, explained Mr. Sanjay Kumar.In Telangana alone, it has spent Rs. 85,000 crore for procurement ever since the NDA government came to power bearing expenditure for the entire process, including gunny bags, labour, transport and so on, yet the government here had “inordinately delayed” the procurement, and farmers dues are to the tune of Rs. 2,626 crore.Other States have been giving bonuses of Rs. 200 to Rs. 600 per quintal but not a single penny from the government here,he said. The CM should explain why farmers are continuing to commit suicide with TS having the dubious distinction of being fourth in the country on that count. Free urea, one lakh loan waiver uniformly, bonus of 500 for every quintal to every crop, soil testing across the State, subsidy for mechanisation, crop insurance scheme, subsidies for poly houses, drip irrigation and so on are among the other demands he put forth to the CM. “We will wait till Telugu New Year of Ugadi for the government to initiate steps or will take up a massive agitation,” he warned in his communication.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bandi-challenges-kcr-for-an-open-debate/article64950165.ece

Especially empty were the roads in certain pockets teeming with migrants from outside the city. Several areas in the western part of the city, including Hi-Tec City, Madhapur, Gachibowli, Kondapur and others, which otherwise would be teeming with vehicular traffic 24x7, were desolate, thanks to the consecutive holidays. “Also, many of us have been given ‘work from home’ option owing to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. This too has kept many people off the roads, and several employees have taken this opportunity to go back to their native places,” Jairaj Kanodia, an IT employee said. Other localities too displayed less traffic than usual, owing to absence of regular commuters. During peak hours too, no crowds were seen in the RTC buses and metro rail. NH 65, the arterial road which takes maximum burden of home-bound vehicles, was relatively less crowded, as there were no regular commuter or office goers. RTC buses too were deployed to take passengers to Vijayawada, which speaks of the festival rush.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/exodus-of-sankranti-crowd-leaves-certain-pockets-desolate/article64950179.ece

Chandrashekhar Rao is making his political moves to play a key role in national politics by meeting leaders of CPI(M), CPI and RJD, TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao dropped enough hints that it may be a possibility. During an interaction ‘#AskKTR’ session on Twitter with the netizens, the IT Minister said that none can predict what the future has in store when a participant asked him whether the Chief Minister was serious about national politics. The Minister left the answer open-ended leaving the netizens to discuss and debate on it rather than jumping to some conclusion. During the hour-long interaction, Mr. Rao left no opportunity to target the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticising both the national and State leadership. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of Rs. 15 lakhs in everyone’s account as - Jhumla of the century. He said the BJP’s narrative of religious politics is to divert attention from its failures in the last 7 years of rule. “Obviously they can’t speak much about the kind of work they’ve done as they haven’t done any,” he remarked. He said the TRS will put barriers of BJP’s strong efforts to gain power in Telangana by focussing on good governance and development. After all, people want peace and stability. He also termed “Silly political stunts” on the BJP trying to sell the idea that Hyderabad would be renamed as Bhagyanagar. Mr. Rao ruled out his entry into national politics saying he is happy serving in Telangana. This was his response to a netizen who said he wanted him to see as the country’s IT Minister. The Minister responded on the Uttar Pradesh elections saying the party will take a call soon after consultations when someone asked about his campaign plans. On several BJP Ministers resigning from the government in UP, he said the trends seem to be in favour of the Samajwadi Party as of now. The Municipal Minister was sarcastic to a question on whether he would accept the open debate challenge by TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy on agriculture development. “Let him debate MLA Elvis Stephenson Garu. I don’t get into debates with criminals and 420s like him.” When asked about how his party will tackle hate propaganda, KTR stated that the people of Telangana are smart enough to understand what is real and who works for their State. Moving away from serious questions, Mr. KTR described actor Suriya as a “Fabulous Actor” when one of his fans asked him to describe the actor. When stand up comedian Kunal Kamra tweeted, “Respected Minister, thanks for extending solidarity to stand up comedians,” Mr. KTR replied “Welcome Kunal Ji.” When a participant described the chat as a PR stunt, he replied, “Glad you chose to participate.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcrs-national-political-entry-is-a-possibility-ktr/article64950296.ece

The inner chambers of the 350-year-old palace of Miyan Mishk was covered in soot after the civic workers lit up the waste there. The massive palace complex in Attapur, off the road near pillar number 137 of PVNR Expressway, remains littered with liquor bottles, building debris and domestic trash that the nearby residents dump every day. “There are snakes on the ground floor and that’s why, we don’t go there. During Sankranti, we climb to the terrace and fly kites,” said Zaheer Khan, a Class IX student, who lives in the neighbourhood. The two-storied palace has a staircase in the middle to take visitors to the upper storey and terrace. According to historical accounts, the palace was built by Abyssinian general of the last Qutb Shahi king Abul Hasan. While the masjid built by the general on a land grant in 1674 is in a good condition near Purana Pul area, the palace has become rundown in the absence of maintenance. Not a protected site The Miyan Mishk Masjid is among the list of 27 sites that the State government is planning to protect and carry on conservation effort. However, the Miyan Mishk Mahal doesn’t find a place in the present list of protected sites.The building is a Grade-I protected site under the HUDA Heritage Regulation 13, which has been upheld by the Telangana High Court in its ruling on the Irram Manzil case.A 2004 satellite image shows how the palace was protected by a walled compound enclosing 10-acres before a road was laid from one end to the other breaking the symmetry of the complex. Now, it is an asphalted road with heavy traffic. While a razor wire fencing used to protect the site earlier, now it’s a free-for-all dumping site as well as an open toilet that gives a lie to the city’s Outdoor Defecation Free status. Construction material, agriculture equipment, trash and even large rocks have been dumped around the site. Despite the absence of any conservation effort, Miyan Mishk Mahalretains traces of its glory with delicate limestone stucco work that has survived centuries. It remains to be seen how long the palace remains intact despite the creeping encroachments all around it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/miyan-mishk-mahal-is-a-picture-of-neglect/article64950176.ece

Just like Kondapochamma and Mallannasagar oustees, who were bodily lifted out from their respective villages using police force, the same fate might be in store for Gudatipally oustees as well.

The BJP will stand with the oustees till their problems are addressed,” said Mr. Rao adding that the issues would be raised in the Assembly in budget session of February.

Pronouncing the verdict in a PIL petition challenging some rules relating to location of liquor shops and permit rooms, a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N. Tukaramji also made it clear that no liquor shop should be permitted near hospital, religious institution or school. Disposing of the PIL petition, the bench said the exercise of the audit pertaining to location of all liquor shops must be completed in two months. A compliance report in this regard should be presented to the HC Registrar General, the bench said in its order. There was no no reason to declare Rules 25 and 26 of the Telangana Excise (Grant of License of Selling by Shop and Conditions of Licenses) Rules-2012 as contended by the petitioner, the verdict said. The bench, however, made it clear that the government should “ensure that consumption of liquor does not take take place outside the permit rooms or outside the bar which causes inconvenience to public at large”. The government must strictly comply with all the provisions of the Excise Act and Telangana Excise Rules. Excise Rules allowed permit rooms attached to liquor shops. But there were no conditions or stipulations regulating sale or consumption of liquor in such permit room, the petitioner stated. Persons purchasing liquor were consuming it outside permit rooms creating law and order problems in residential localities. They were also causing difficulties to women, children and elderly persons, the petitioner argued. The bench noted that the petitioner had not brought to its notice location of any liquor shop in any residential area. “This court cannot conduct a roving enquiry in respect of all the shops in the State,” the bench observed. If a licence was granted to a liquor shop in any residential area causing inconvenience to the public, the petitioner can move the court by filing a writ petition, the bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ensure-there-is-no-liquor-shop-in-residential-locality-hc/article38270535.ece

While some have managed to find a solution or sorts to their predicament, others point to their more distressing circumstances. One such case is that of Nadiya Mariyam, an Afghan from Panjshir, now living in Amberpet with her four children. Her husband Sayed Mahboob, who was a student at Osmania University, and completed his masters in business administration recently, had to return to Afghanistan on account of visa issues, and is unable to return, she said. While Mr Mahboob is doing whatever he can in his capacity to reunite with his family, the Indian government has not yet issued him a visa, she said. This has been compounding problems for the family here. “He is doing whatever he can for us. But he is unable to get a visa. He is now in another country from where he will apply for a visa,” she said. While her eldest child is 13-years-old, her youngest, who was born in India, is barely one. It is her third child, a three-year-old, who developed an infection and needed immediate medical attention, she explained. She continues to remain unwell. With little or no support, she finds herself in a tough situation. However, neighbours and those in the know of her situation have come forward to help. “The people of the neighbourhood are very kind and helpful. They did a lot to help me. But there should be some solution for my husband to get a visa to come here,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/visa-issues-keep-afghan-family-apart/article38270542.ece

Moreover, paddy was not procured by the government so far, which has also been damaged now, he said. He said farmers have lost hope in the government as not a single rupee was paid as compensation for crop damage in the last 7 years of the TRS rule.

Giving the views of Telangana on Thursday on the installation of sensor-based real-time date acquisition system at the off-take point suggested by Andhra Pradesh at a virtual meeting held on December 23 last with Krishna Basin States and Tamil Nadu for measuring water release to Chennai, Engineer-in-Chief (General-Irrigation) of Telangana C. Muralidhar said AP had located the off-take point in violation of letter and spirit of the agreements in the matter. Sending Telangana’s views through a letter to KRMB Chairman M.P. Singh, the ENC pointed out that the inter-State agreements of 1976 and 1977 the Krishna riparian States had agreed to divert 15 tmc ft water from Srisailam reservoir to Chennai for drinking needs during July-October flood period through an open-lined channel from Srisailam to Penna with designed discharge not exceeding 1,500 cusecs with the stipulation that the system shall be utilised only for water supply to Chennai and for no other purpose. However, in total violation of the agreements the then AP government had located the off-take point at Chennamukkapalle near Penna river, about 175 km away from Srisailam reservoir. In the process, the channel for 175 km was constructed with discharge capacity of 11,150 cusecs and for the remaining 3 km from Chennamukkapalle to Penna river with 1,500 cusecs, Mr. Muralidhar explained. Later in 1981, 19 tmc ft water was re-allocated from AP’s total share for Srisailam Right Bank Canal (SRBC) project to be drawn during the flood period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/prp-should-be-chennai-water-supply-off-take/article38270550.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 05:30 IST,||BJP banks on roads, power for Assembly poll win in Manipur||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), bolstered by defections, is upbeat about retaining power in Manipur despite a perceived divide between the Hindu-dominated Imphal valley and the tribal Christian-majority hills around. Behind the optimism of the Nongthombam Biren Singh government is a network of roads constructed in the last five years and improvement in the State’s power scenario, aided by the sun to a large extent. Central leaders of the BJP said the grassroots workers of the party and sister organisations have been working overtime to ensure a better result in the upcoming Assembly polls than the 21 seats won in 2017. The focus is particularly on 12 seats where the margin of defeat in the last election was narrow. In nine of these constituencies, the BJP candidates lost by less than 1,000 votes, the lowest being 19 in Sagolband. The margin of defeat in the remaining three seats was a little above 1,000 votes. “We have worked out our strategies by analysing why we lost narrowly in these seats. We hope our government’s push for better surface connectivity and supply of electricity to the homes in the remotest parts of the State would present us in good stead,” said Manipur’s Public Works and Power Minister Thongam Biswajit Singh. He said the government constructed, repaired or improved 1,560.26 km of roads during 2017-2020, apart from strategic bridges that have cut down travel time for people in the remote areas. Mr. Singh also claimed the Manipur State Power Distribution Company Limited increased the average supply of electricity from less than 18 hours a day prior to 2017 to round-the-clock by 2021. “Power supply is interrupted only during planned or emergency shutdown for line maintenance,” he said. Solar succour Investing Rs. 115 crore in solar projects since 2017 has gone a long way in improving the State’s power scenario, officials of Manipur Renewable Energy Development Agency (Manireda) said. Till September 2021, the State had an installed capacity of 8.24 megawatts comprising 5.5 MW of on-grid and 2.74 MW of off-grid solar systems.  “Electrification of 98 remote or difficult villages in nine hill districts covering 3,028 households was done through 606 kilowatts of solar home lighting systems. Solar lighting systems were also provided to 7,078 registered weavers in Manipur,” Mr. Singh told The Hindu from State capital Imphal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-banks-on-roads-power-for-assembly-poll-win-in-manipur/article64950233.ece

Officials said the 36-hour bandh called by the All Nyishi Youth Association (ANYA) from 5 a.m. was by and large peaceful but about 100 activists were taken under preventive detention. “There were no reports of any untoward incident,” Talo Potom, the Deputy Commissioner of the Itanagar Capital Region district said. The region comprises Itanagar, Naharlagun town and other adjoining areas. The district’s Superintendent of Police, Jimmy Chiram, said the police were trying to find out what role the detained people played in the bandh. The district authorities had suspended mobile Internet services for 48 hours since Wednesday evening after reports that some people might be mobilised through social media. In keeping with a Gauhati High Court order, the authorities had declared the bandh illegal. The ANYA, accusing Mr. Khandu of involvement in scams worth more than Rs. 2,000 crore, had submitted a memorandum to the government on December 10, with a 15-day deadline demanding clarification on the charges. After the expiry of the deadline, it asked the Chief Minister to quit. Mr. Khandu had rubbished the charges as “politically motivated” and asked the outfit to take him to court if it had any evidence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/arunachal-group-seeks-cms-ouster/article38270596.ece

She was found bleeding and was admitted to the district hospital in Alwar, from where she was referred to Jaipur on Tuesday night. No arrest has been made so far in connection with the case, as the police were clueless about the identity of culprits and were scanning CCTV footage of the area for clues. The 15-year-old mentally challenged girl, who is unable to speak properly, has been unable to provide any clue that could help the police. Health Minister Parsadi Lal Meena said the girl was out of danger after her surgery, which lasted two-and-a-half hours. The victim received deep injuries in her internal organs, which were apparently caused by a sharp object, according to the surgeons at Sir Padampat Mother and Child Hospital, where she was operated upon. The Opposition BJP has mounted attack on the Congress government, accusing it of failure to protect women despite its claims, and appointed a four-member committee to probe into the incident and “seek justice” for the victim. The members were BJP national secretary Alka Singh Gurjar, Dausa MP Jaskaur Meena, Mahila Morcha president Alka Mundra and Chomu MLA Ramlal Sharma. Stages dharna The police stopped a five-member delegation of BJP outside Ranthambhore National Park in Sawai Madhopur district when they wanted to meet Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra seeking her intervention in the matter. Ms. Vadra had arrived in Ranthambhore on Wednesday on a personal visit. The BJP leaders staged a dharna and raised slogans asking Ms. Vadra to go back. The Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission has taken cognisance of the case and directed the Alwar Superintendent of Police to arrest the culprits without delay, besides asking the hospital’s Superintendent to provide the best possible treatment to the girl without any negligence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/alwar-rape-victim-stable-after-surgery-no-arrest-yet/article64950220.ece

The drive will benefit rabi crops with its extension to the works during the winter season’s rainfall. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has approved a proposal to make an additional provision of Rs. 302 crore for the Rajiv Gandhi Jal Sanchay Yojana (RGJSY), as part of which the activities for watershed area treatment have been taken up during the last two years. Farm ponds, check dams, field bunds and water harvesting and storage structures have been built under the scheme. The additional funds will be released to Zila Parishads in all districts, which will spend the money on the works in their respective areas. While the RGJSY’s first phase ended in August 2021 with the creation of water harvesting infrastructure in over 3,900 villages, the additional allocation has been made under the head of the Water Conservation Cess Fund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rainwater-harvesting-drive-launched-in-rajasthan/article38270673.ece

Over the past few days, the party general secretary has been calling for increased testing and better COVID-19 management in the Diamond Harbour subdivision of the South 24 Parganas, a constituency he represents in the Lok Sabha. On Wednesday, he shared on social media that more than 50,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted in the constituency. “We promise to continue our efforts towards bringing down the positivity rate further, which is at 2.16%,” the MP, who is the nephew of party chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said on social media. The case positivity rate in West Bengal on Wednesday was 30.86%. At a time when the government has agreed to go ahead with the Ganga Sagar Mela and the polls to four municipal corporations, Mr. Banerjee has been calling for a complete ban on religious and political meetings. “The situation is very bad across the country and there should be no religious or political meetings,” he said. On Thursday, Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh tried to dispel the controversy by saying it was not one model versus others. “The government is trying its hardest to combat the pandemic. The public representatives are always doing their best in their own area. Diamond Harbor MP Abhishek Banerjee has started a fight against COVID-19 in his constituency,” Mr. Ghosh told journalists. However, the Opposition did not miss the opportunity to target the government. “ If the Diamond Harbor model is a success, then the State government model of tackling COVID-19 is a failure. So, if the nephew has passed then aunt has failed and the Mayor of Kolkata has failed miserably,” CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said. State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said if 50,000 tests can be conducted in Diamond Harbour, what fault have people from other parts of West Bengal done that they are being denied basic health infrastructure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/abhishek-puts-govt-in-a-spot/article64950231.ece

It is long over. It has outlived its utility,” said a Bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani. The court was hearing the petition by NGO, Manushi Sangathan, on the issue of redevelopment of the Chandni Chowk area and creation of lanes for non-motorised vehicles. The NGO, represented through advocate Indira Unninayar, submitted that the case has been going on for the last 15 years and repeated orders have been passed reflecting tardiness, reluctance and non-compliances of the authorities or government agencies with several cases of contempt. The petitioner’s counsel further said that the purpose of the PIL has not been achieved at a broader and holistic level. The NGO feels the case has outlived its purpose and seeks that it be wound up as it does not have the bandwidth and energy to pursue the matter any longer, the counsel said.

In an office memorandum issued on Wednesday, the CPWD asked its zonal offices to review the claims to see if there had been any fraudulent practices. The CAG report cited in the memo found that employees of the CPWD and the DDA, both of which come under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, were paid higher reimbursements for air travel on forged tickets and misrepresentation of facts. Since the fraudulent claims, which resulted in employ- ees getting Rs. 8.19 lakh more than they were entitled to from 2014 to 2017, were detected during a “test check” in 2018, the possibility of similar cases could not be ruled out, it added. The report said the matter was brought up with the DDA and the CPWD in June 2018 and August 2018, respectively, and the CAG recommended a review of all claims. However, the two organisations failed to submit details of any review. The report said the CAG then raised the matter with the Ministry in November 2020. “The above facts indicate that despite the suggestion of audit to review all LTC claims paid from 2012-12 by the DDA and 2010-22 by the CPWD, neither auditee has carried out any review exercise,” the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cpwd-to-review-staffers-ltc-claims-from-2010-11/article38270443.ece

The family has written to the Prime Minister and the Delhi Chief Minister seeking an investigation. In his letter, Viney K. Joshi, the son of the deceased, called the hospital’s conduct “unethical” and “unprofessional”. “He died due to them [Max Hospital team] and I will fight against them so that no one else will have to face this,” said Mr. Joshi, who works as a doctor in Australia. When contacted, Max Hospital said in a statement that the patient was attended to by a team of very senior doctors, including a cardiologist, a neurologist and a neurosurgeon, along with critical care specialists. “We strongly refute allegations of delay in the treatment,” the hospital added. Mr. Joshi said his father was brought to the hospital around 5 p.m. on December 31, after he suffered a stroke, but he was not operated upon till about midnight. “Time wasted here was directly responsible for his ultimate demise. Time is of the essence in managing a stroke,” he said. Responding to Mr. Joshi’s concerns, Max Hospital said: “The patient with known complications of chronic kidney disease, cardiac issues, hypertension, diabetes and poor lung condition, was rushed to the hospital’s ER on December 31 evening in an unconscious state and was immediately intubated and put on ventilator support.” The hospital said all necessary scans were run in less than an hour after the patient’s arrival.

The party’s official campaign song DonFulanchoKaal,GoenchiNaviSakal promises the ushering in of “a new dawn in Goa”.  The song, which runs a little over three-and-a-half minutes, features a montage of the verdant Goan countryside intercut with clips of Ms. Banerjee campaigning, while contrasting the promises of the Trinamool with the allegedly ‘failed’ promises of the current BJP government. The song speaks of the BJP’s alleged failure to provide jobs, the rising crime and environmental degradation while assuring that the Trinamool would remedy the allegedly dismal situation in the coastal State.  “Goa is chanting in one voice ... DonFulanchoKaal,GoenchiNaviSakal . Presenting to you the official campaign song of Goa Trinamool Congress, Goa Election 2022, GoenchiNaviSakal . This song celebrates Goa and the Goenkar spirit, getting set to usher in a New Dawn in Goa,” the Trinamool tweeted earlier this week.  Putative schemes  Ms. Banerjee’s party has launched a ‘blitz’ of putative schemes for Goa — from the ‘Griha Laxmi’ card to empower women financially to the MhajeGhar,MaalkiHakk (‘My home, My right’) which aims to give housing rights to people who have been residing in Goa before 1976.  The Congress has been dismissive of these schemes. Cong. dismissive Senior Congress leader and former Union Minister P. Chidambaram, who is the party’s senior election observer for the Goa polls, had earlier mocked the Trinamool’s Griha Laxmi scheme by remarking that it was “a math that deserves the Nobel Prize for Economics.” “A monthly grant of Rs. 5,000 to a woman in 3.5 lakh households in Goa will cost Rs. 175 crore a month. That is Rs. 2,100 crore a year. It is a “small” sum for the State of Goa that had an outstanding debt of Rs. 23,473 crore at the end of March 2020,” Mr. Chidambaram had tweeted last month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/tmcs-song-promises-a-new-dawn-in-goa/article64950219.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 05:31 IST,||Cong. cannot defeat BJP in Goa on its own: TMC||Chiding the Congress for sitting on its “high horse” and refusing to awaken to its “depleted strength” in Goa, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) said the need of the hour was for the Opposition parties to come together and try to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Remarking that the Congress’ leaders were not the “emperors of India”, TMC MP and Goa in-charge Mahua Moitra on Thursday said had the party performed well in Goa, there would have been no need for the TMC to enter. Ms. Moitra’s statements were a direct riposte to senior Congressman and former Union Minister P. Chidambaram’s remarks that the electoral battle in Goa was a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP and that the entry of the TMC and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would only serve to fragment the anti-BJP votes. “Despite winning the mandate [after the 2017 election], the Congress had failed to form the government. This time, too, the Congress alone is incapable of defeating the BJP. The TMC is asking all anti-BJP forces to come together to oust the BJP in Goa…the anti-BJP forces in Goa today are the Congress, AAP and TMC. None of them can stake a claim that we are the only ones in the fray,” Ms. Moitra said. Mr. Chidambaram, who is party senior election observer for Goa, had said in an interview to a news agency that the Congress had been “dismayed” when the TMC “lured” Congress MLAs into its fold. In response, Ms. Moitra said the Congress had no right to speak on defections as they had recently inducted former BJP Minister Michael Lobo and his wife, BJP leader Delilah Lobo, as well as ex-Minister and sitting BJP MLA Carlos Almeida in their party. “I would like to remind the Congress that all those people who find it impossible to have a fighting platform in the Congress are the ones who are coming to the TMC…By the Congress’ definition, even [TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister] Mamata Banerjee and Andhra Pradesh CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy are ‘defectors’. But these are the people who are Chief Ministers and running their States. It is high time that the Congress woke up to its depleted strength and realise that they are not emperors of India,” she said. The TMC leader said the party had inducted all those Congressmen who wanted a fighting platform against the BJP which the Congress had been unable to provide. Ms. Moitra said the TMC was not harbouring “an inflated ego” about joining forces with the anti-BJP allies. “We are calling everyone to come and talk on the table because this is the need of the hour,” she said. Speculation of a broad “anti-BJP” front of the Opposition parties was sparked after Ms. Moitra’s tweet last week which said the TMC “will do everything possible to defeat BJP in Goa”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cong-cannot-defeat-bjp-in-goa-on-its-own-tmc/article64950230.ece

In a 47-page research paper, the State Department’s Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs said China had no basis under international law for claims that have put Beijing on a collision course with the Philippines, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian nations. “The overall effect of these maritime claims is that the PRC unlawfully claims sovereignty or some form of exclusive jurisdiction over most of the South China Sea,” the paper said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “These claims gravely undermine the rule of law in the oceans and numerous universally recognized provisions of international law reflected in the Convention,” it said, referring to a 1982 UN treaty on the law of the sea ratified by China — but not the U.S. Releasing the study, a State Department statement called again on Beijing “to cease its unlawful and coercive activities in the South China Sea.” China hit back on Thursday, claiming the report “distorts international law and misleads the public.” “The U.S. refuses to sign the treaty but portrays itself as a judge and wantonly distorts the treaty,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a briefing. “In seeking its own selfish interests it uses multiple standards to carry out political manipulation.” The paper is an update of a 2014 study that similarly disputed the so-called “nine-dash line” that forms the basis for much of Beijing’s stance. International ruling In 2016, an international court sided with the Philippines in its complaints over China’s claims. Beijing replied by offering new justifications, including saying that China had “historic rights” over the area. The State Department paper said that such historical-based claims had “no legal basis” and that China had not offered specifics. It also took issue with geographic justifications for China’s claims, saying that more than 100 features Beijing highlights in the South China Sea are submerged by water during high tide and therefore are “beyond the lawful limits of any state’s territorial sea.” Beijing cites such geographic features to claim four “island groups,” which the State Department study said did not meet criteria for baselines under the UN convention. The report was issued as the U.S. increasingly challenges China on the global stage, identifying the rising communist power as its chief long-term threat. The South China Sea is home to valuable oil and gas deposits and shipping lanes, and Beijing’s neighbours have frequently voiced concern that their giant neighbour was seeking to expand its reach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-denounces-chinas-maritime-claims/article64950110.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:25 IST,||China charges top security official for corruption||A senior security official in China who was previously purged and accused of challenging the Communist Party leadership under President Xi Jinping was on Thursday charged with “taking bribes” as well as the more unusual accusation of “illegal possessing of guns”. Thursday’s charges against Sun Lijun, who was until April 2020 a Vice Minister of Public Security and one of the senior-most officials in charge of the police forces in China, were the latest in an already long list of serious accusations. The sudden downfall of Mr. Sun, who had only in early 2020 been dispatched by Mr. Xi to Wuhan to oversee the handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, had sparked debate about the loyalty of the police force and whether Mr. Sun was fomenting internal opposition to Mr. Xi. Expelled from party In September last year, Mr. Sun was expelled from the Communist Party and accused by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) of "issuing groundless criticisms of the Party's policies, and spreading political rumours”. The CCDI, which had been investigating him for more than a year, said Mr. Sun "displayed extremely inflated political ambition and very poor political integrity" and had "seriously undermined the unity of the Party and endangered political security.” Upholding party “unity” generally refers to supporting the central leadership of Mr. Xi. Mr. Sun’s purge followed the removal of another senior security official, Meng Hongwei, who was removed in 2018 at a time when he was serving as the head of Interpol. He was subsequently sentenced to 13 years in prison. ‘Illegal gun possession’ The filing of charges on Thursday paves the way for Mr. Sun’s trial. The prosecutors accused him of “illegally accepting extremely large amounts of money and properties” and “violating gun management regulations by illegally possessing guns”. Mr. Sun was previously accused of “deserting his post” during the pandemic while supervising the COVID-19 response in Wuhan, although the details were never spelled out. He was also accused of “selling official posts, accepting a large amount of money and property, attending banquets and high-end entertainment activities, and indulging in a luxurious lifestyle for a long time.” The CCDI under Mr. Xi has removed hundreds of security officials ostensibly for corruption, and in the process, observers have said, it has eliminated many of Mr. Xi’s political rivals and strengthened his direct control over the powerful internal security forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-charges-top-security-official-for-corruption/article64950111.ece

The study also noted that the booster dosage of Vaxzevria also increased the immune response to Beta, Delta, Alpha and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants. The results were observed among individuals previously vaccinated with either Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine. The CEO of Serum Institute of India, which manufactures Covishield, Adar Poonawalla, said in a tweet: “This is encouraging news, as per Professor Sir Andrew J Pollard, chief investigator and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, new data from ongoing Astazeneca/Oxford vaccine trials has shown that three doses give good protection against Omicron.” “Vaxzevria has protected hundreds of millions of people from COVID-19 around the world and these data show that it has an important role to play as a third dose booster, including when used after other vaccines,” Mene Pangalos, executive vice-president (biopharmaceuticals R&D) of AstraZeneca, said in a statement. Mr. Pollard said, “These important studies show that a third dose of Vaxzevria after two initial doses of the same vaccine, or after mRNA or inactivated vaccines, strongly boosts immunity against COVID-19.” “The vaccine is suitable as an option to enhance immunity in the population for countries considering booster programmes,” Mr. Pollard added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/covishield-booster-effective-against-omicron-astrazeneca/article64950109.ece

Anwar Raslan, 58, was found guilty of overseeing the murder of 27 people at the Al-Khatib detention centre in Damascus, also known as “Branch 251”, in 2011 and 2012. He sought refuge in Germany after deserting the Syrian regime in 2012. Prosecutors had accused him of overseeing the murder of 58 people and the torture of 4,000 others at the centre, but not all of the deaths could be proven. Presiding judge Anne Kerber said the Syrian regime had resorted to “violence” and “the heavy use of munitions” to suppress protests that erupted in March 2011. Victims held in the regime’s detention centres were not only “tortured but also starved and deprived of air” in unsanitary, crowded cells where they could not sit or lie down, she said. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch, which provided some of the evidence, said in Geneva the verdict was “really historic”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/germany-convicts-syrian-ex-colonel-in-torture-trial/article38269935.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:32 IST,||How will the five State elections influence national politics?||Assembly elections are due in five States: Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa. In a conversation moderated byVarghese K. George, Yamini Aiyar and Manish Tiwari discuss the national implications of these Assembly elections. Edited excerpts: Let’s start with an overview. Is the incumbent on the defensive in all the States — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in U.P., Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa; and the Congress in Punjab? Manish Tiwari:Incumbents are always on the defensive because people have high expectations. Not only the general public, but party workers also become very ambitious and also anxious. All the incumbent governments are facing a lot of challenges because they are unable to fulfil not just the general public’s expectations but also the expectations of the party cadre. In U.P., Brahmins are said to be unhappy with the BJP and now the OBC [Other Backward Classes] leaders are also leaving in herds. In Punjab, the Congress removed Amarinder Singh unceremoniously from chief ministership, and that has put a lot of strain on the party structure. In Uttarakhand, the BJP, which changed its leadership twice, faces similar challenges. In Goa too, if we look at MLAs and party leaders leaving the BJP, it appears that the ship is going to sink. The Congress has an uphill task and the BJP has the maximum stability only in Manipur. Yamini, do you think policy and political issues such as the farm laws, the citizenship law and the management of the pandemic will be discussed in these elections? Yamini Aiyar:This is the million-dollar question that is linked to your previous question on incumbents. These questions confront the incumbents. There is economic distress as a consequence of COVID-19. The farm laws exposed how we think about the challenge of agrarian reforms, the role of the farmer, the farmers’ political capacity to mobilise in some ways. The farm laws and the agitation brought the farmer to the centre of the political debate. And this creates its own challenges for the incumbents. In U.P., the BJP has a ‘double engine’ growth narrative. There is a distinction that the voter is increasingly making between national elections and State elections and that is very sharp in U.P. The Congress in Punjab is in a better position to handle the farm question, but it has not articulated an alternative. Are there alternative narratives to the options available for agricultural reforms? We are walking into an election with significant fault lines in society, economy and politics. I think a lot will depend on the extent to which political parties are able to provide voters with alternatives. Incumbent governments and parties often manage to deflect from these issues and try and add an emotive flavour to a campaign. So, in this case, there are various issues at play. There is a thrust on Hindu consolidation that the BJP is trying. There is a Punjabiyat narrative that perhaps the Congress is trying, but there is also a Sikh religious politics that is active in the State. There is an OBC politics that the Samajwadi Party (SP) is trying to reinvent. There is also a new alternative politics that is being proposed by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab. In all this, would emotional appeals to identity politics overwhelm policy debates? And if that is the case, which identity politics is going to be stronger — caste, religion or region? YA:Oh, you’ve hit the nail on the head. Despite the voters coming out to vote against the backdrop of the significant challenges that they are confronting, they are going to be confronting an election campaign and potentially even making electoral decisions on the back of an emotive campaign. I think of this as an ideological election. After all, U.P. in particular is the site of much of the ideological contestation that India has experienced, and it’s continuing to unfold and unravel in many different ways. And the economic challenges, the issues of policy, welfare are all going to be part of the election narrative. These are at the heart of the debates that we are having as a nation and are therefore naturally going to shape how the voter is going to choose to vote. What I do want to emphasise also is that, in many State elections, and we've seen this template play out, especially after 2019, State-level Opposition parties have found a template that works at the State level and that effectively manages to, in some senses, blunt the overall popularity of the BJP. And that template is very much about local issues, local governance and regional identity rather than an articulation of an alternative ideological narrative to what the BJP is presenting. And to my mind, that is ultimately at the heart of the challenge. Is the Opposition going to be able to present a viable, logical alternative? There could be resentment against the Yogi Adityanath government, but still the BJP has one thing going for it — Hindutva, right? MT:The Hindutva card has been successful for a long time. But this time, it is going to be a test for Hindutva. The BJP has got such a majority after a long time on the plank of Hindutva, which it doesn’t hesitate to showcase. Look at the Kashi project, that is how they are playing the Hindu card. Now, the question is, how long or how far will it work. Swami Prasad Maurya defected from the BJP. This is a kind of test case. The BJP has been claiming to be a party of the OBCs — now, managing the OBC claim and Hindutva together appears to be difficult. Mr. Maurya claimed, while leaving the party, that he helped the BJP come back from its 14-year vanvaas. If the OBCs stop subscribing to Hindutva, it will very difficult for the party to remain in power in most of the places. Barring the 2015 Bihar Assembly election, this amalgamation of Hindutva and social justice has worked perfectly for the BJP since 2014. With these latest defections and the unrest among the OBC factions and leaders in U.P., do you think that phase of the BJP is now facing the most serious challenge since 2014? MT:The challenge had already become apparent when Shivraj Singh did not win the majority in Madhya Pradesh. In Bihar, the BJP’s win was marginal. The BJP’s claim that it has more support of OBCs maybe true of its national leadership but for the regional leadership, it may not be so. This is the reason that the BJP is facing a serious challenge of keeping the OBC base intact in the name of Hindutva. To bring together all the OBCs in the name of Hindutva does not always work because ultimately, society is much more diverse and segregated. The kind of exodus that the BJP is seeing in U.P., if it continues, will spiral in other States too. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Dalit party, appears to be on a terminal decline. Initial reports suggest that the BJP is the beneficiary of the decline of the BSP. Do you concur with that view? And related to that is a question on Punjab, where the Congress is trying to consolidate Dalits by appointing a Chief Minister from the community. Will that work? MT:Dalits as a category is also not monolithic. A large section of non-Jatav Dalits in U.P. was already voting for the BJP. Now, the young among the Dalit supporters of the BSP are looking for political options. They aren’t going to vote for the BSP when it’s not a winnable option. My take is that the BSP, this time, would come down to a single digit in vote percentage in U.P. In Punjab, by picking Charanjit Singh Channi as the first Dalit Chief Minister of Punjab, the Congress is not just addressing a large section of the Punjab population of Dalits but also their counterparts in different States. I have been speaking to a lot of them. Many are happy supporting the Congress even though they know that the Congress will not win. Yamini, AAP has emerged as a potentially viable alternative in Punjab. Can it provide a viable alternative to both the Congress and the BJP? YA:There’s no doubt that AAP has energy around it, and in Punjab in particular. AAP is certainly seen as a significant political opposition to the Congress. And it has been able to keep that momentum going. The AAP has also been able to build on what it did in Delhi, of governance and welfare that is local and responsive to voter demands. But it doesn’t add up to an effective challenge to the BJP at the national level. The BJP has effectively been able to bundle in elements of what have been part and parcel of Indian elections and the voter-politician compact, particularly welfare and aspects of governance (along with its ideology). And you will see pockets of good governance and significant pockets of weak governance across the country. A national-level challenge to the BJP doesn’t exist, which the governance narrative, the welfare narrative is not collectively able to articulate effectively. There is this view that Indian democracy is facing some serious challenges, and for good reasons. How crucial are these elections for democracy? YA:Elections are always a test of democracy. Even though the Indian voter stands up to this test effectively by coming out in great enthusiasm and casting their vote, politicians never come out with flying colours. We have long struggled with challenges of campaign finance and the quality of campaign. In the last few years, the challenges have been exacerbated because of the combination of centralisation of financing, the role of the media, and the ability of money and media to come together. And the weakness of institutions in ensuring fairness and equity and following rules have all further undermined the sanctity of the electoral process, even though the voter is coming out now in even more enthusiasm than the past to cast their vote. I think what is going to be particularly unique about this election is, in many ways similar to the elections of April and May last year, the voter is going to be asked to cast their vote against the backdrop of a raging pandemic. Manish, we started off by asking whether the incumbent was on the defensive. From another perspective, one could argue that the incumbent has all the advantage because the incumbent has the power and the money. So, does the BJP have an upper hand by virtue of being in power? MT:It definitely looks like it but the reality is not always what it looks like. We were all doubting whether the elections would be held or the government would impose President’s rule in the States for a few months in the name of COVID-19, but the Election Commission announced the elections. It has announced a lot of restrictions regarding rallies and campaigning. Yes, the ruling party has the advantage in the form of a largely favourable media, but ultimately the people of the country have their own minds. Even today, there are so many checks and controls.  The Hindutva card has been successful for a long time. But this time, it is going to be a test for Hindutva.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:32 IST,||An epidemiologically sound testing strategy||On January 10, 2022, the Indian Council of Medical Research released an ‘Advisory on Purposive Testing Strategy for COVID-19 in India’. The advisory (Version VII; https://bit.ly/31UtJ7F) provides details on ‘Who may be’ and ‘People who need not to be’ tested. It proposes that ‘asymptomatic individuals in community setting’ and ‘contacts of confirmed cases of COVID-19, unless identified as high risk’, amongst others, need not be tested. The latest COVID-19 testing strategy replaces the previous advisory (Version VI), released on September 4, 2020 (https://bit.ly/3GsAexi) and inter alia , had the provision of COVID-19 testing on demand for ‘all individuals who wish to get themselves tested’. Clearly, there are a few paradigm shifts in the testing strategy.  Understandably, the revised strategy has now created a flutter and divided epidemiologists and clinicians, pandemic ‘experts’ and television channel commentators, in two halves — of those strongly supporting or vehemently opposing it. So, is the new advisory on COVID-19 testing a right approach? Let us deep dive. Strategies in sync with stages When the novel coronavirus pandemic began, the virus was new to any setting and every country including India followed a ‘containment strategy’ to stop the virus spread and prevent community transmission. This required aggressive testing to detect every infection and ‘trace and test’ every possible contact of confirmed cases. ‘Test, test and test’ — as it was colloquially referred to — was an approach recommended and followed by all countries across the world. India, following this approach, ramped up COVID-19 testing capacity and two years on, India has set up nearly 3,100 laboratories conducting COVID-19 testing with daily capacity of nearly two million RT-PCR tests. Over the last many months, additional testing approaches and kits such as rapid antigen test (RAT) and home kits for antigen test have been approved. The aggressive testing approach seems to have worked — to a large extent and till recently. Yet, no country can claim that it has detected every COVID-19 infection. A few high income countries are estimated to have identified one in every two or three infections. In India, based on the fourth round of the COVID-19 national sero survey between June 2021 and July 2021, only one in every 30 infections has been detected. Clearly, an aggressive testing strategy was useful but not enough. The emergence of Omicron (B.1.1.529) as a variant of concern now has changed the situation drastically. So there is Omicron, with a three- to four-fold higher transmissibility (when compared to the Delta variant) and also a large majority of new infections being asymptomatic. Along with very high new infections in a short period of time, the testing capacity in nearly all countries has been stretched. Countries are revising testing strategies, mostly with the focus on ramping up testing with the use of RATs and home testing kits. The approaches for other public health tools such as contact tracing, isolation and quarantine are also being reviewed and revised. Testing with purpose Any diagnostic testing — especially in outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics — has two broad objectives: of individual and public health benefits and tracking the extent of infection. At the individual level, early COVID-19 testing can help in a suitable modification in clinical management. However, with a decoupling of ‘infection’ from ‘moderate to severe COVID-19’ and a better understanding of disease epidemiology, it is known that for most asymptomatic or even mild symptomatic individuals (i.e., fully vaccinated, young adults, or those without comorbidities), a confirmatory COVID-19 testing would not alter the treatment. Therefore, testing asymptomatic or majority of mild symptomatic would burden the laboratory capacity with almost no individual benefit in treatment. Second, the testing of asymptomatic cases would have the public health benefit of reducing transmission (if every infection can be detected at the earliest). However, with Omicron, it is neither feasible for any system nor required as transmission is already widespread and a majority cases are asymptomatic. As the COVID-19 testing capacity has been overwhelmed in even high resource health-care systems, countries are resorting to expanding RATs. However, with the low sensitivity of RAT kits, in a hypothetical scenario of even every infected individual undergoing a COVID-19 test, nearly half of them will be missed. Clearly, at this stage of pandemic, the individual and public health benefits of testing contacts and asymptomatic individuals are very limited, if not zero. Promoting the use of self-purchased RATs has an equity dimension as well. This is in addition to it not being a very effective public health tool. A ramping up of RATs may be useful in a setting where every member of society has equal access by free of cost availability to such kits. However, in India, as per the Government announcement, 800 million Indians are eligible and dependent on free ration during the pandemic; they cannot be expected to purchase testing kits and are not likely to use them. Therefore, promoting RAT kits is unlikely to be a solution in India as well as in many other low and middle income countries. In public health challenges such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, every health intervention should be deployed to offer the maximum benefits to most citizens. The available laboratory capacity and the testing kits need to be used efficiently, optimally and intelligently. Testing asymptomatic people has a very limited marginal benefit and can overburden an already stretched testing system — which could essentially mean a delay in the COVID-19 test report for those with a high risk of getting moderate to severe disease. Finally, the argument that testing should be ramped up to get better COVID-19 data is on weak footing. We need to remember that any data collection is a byproduct of public health interventions and not the primary objective. If we can use data being generated currently, even that would be enough to answer most policy questions and guide interventions. Then, in the end, in every country across the world, the final numbers of the pandemic will always be determined by the estimates. A right epidemiological move The public health tools need to be suitably modified and calibrated at every stage of the pandemic. Two years into the pandemic, there is limited relevance of continuing with the same old strategies for contact tracing, testing and isolation. India’s pandemic response has received criticism for being guided by clinical experts and being medical care-oriented with excessive attention on hospital beds and intensive care unit facilities and with a focus on care of the sick. The recent advisory on COVID-19 testing is a hint towards a shift toward the public health approach. There appears to be more attention on a pandemic response guided by local epidemiology and the principles of public health. In addition to testing strategy, in the recent weeks, COVID-19 home isolation guidelines and hospital discharge policies have also been revised. COVID-19 testing has to be used as a public health tool to benefit the most and not as a medical care tool. When the benefit of testing has become limited, as is the case in the current stage, targeted COVID-19 testing — to protect the vulnerable — is the right approach. Public health strategies have to be designed based on local context and cannot and should not be merely ‘copied’ from other settings. There are a few additional things that call for attention. There is a need for developing detailed COVID-19 hospital admission criteria and ensuring a better adherence to COVID-19 treatment guidelines, to prevent unnecessary admission and avoid unproven therapies that are not recommended. To respond to the current surge, there is a need to bring epidemiology and public health approaches to the forefront and ignore the ‘opinion’ of ‘mushrooming experts’ vocal and visible on television and ‘omnipresent’ on social media. India’s latest advisory on COVID-19 testing is bold, pragmatic and epidemiologically sound. More importantly, it shifts the balance of India’s pandemic response from a ‘treatment oriented’ to a public health focused approach. It is another opportunity to bring science, data, debate, dialogue, evidence, epidemiology and public health in shaping India’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised COVID-19 testing approach, arguably, is a pandemic strategy in which the rest of the world is likely to follow India.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:32 IST,||Liberal economics creates illiberal societies||A surging tide of nationalism and authoritarianism has imperilled democracy globally, and within presumptively democratic nations — the United States, India, the United Kingdom, and the European Union — too. Economies are not doing well. The benefits of growth are being sucked up to the 1% on the top; ‘trickle down’ to those below has diminished. With every global crisis — the financial crisis of 2007-08 and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis — the rich get richer while millions at the bottom fall off the ladder. Inequalities of wealth have increased around the world and India is becoming one of the world’s most unequal countries. Political, economic symptoms Like the COVID-19 virus, whose origins scientists are struggling to understand, another disease has been crippling the well-being of nations for 30 years. Political symptoms of the disease are the weakening of democracy and secularism. Its economic symptoms are inequities within economies and an unsustainability of economic growth. The socio-political and economic pathologies are inter-related. Economic despair is feeding the rise of authoritarianism, nationalism, and identity politics. Liberals who continue to advocate for more liberal economics must understand how their ideas have caused the rise of anti-liberal societies and governments which they lament. They can no longer have their cake and eat it too. Opening national borders to free trade became an ideology in economics in the last 30 years. Taxes of incomes and wealth at the top were also reduced. The ideological justification was that the animal spirits of ‘wealth creators’ must not be dampened. Otherwise, the pie will not grow and there will not be enough to share. With higher taxes until the 1970s, the U.S. and many countries in Europe had built up their public health and education infrastructure and strengthened social security systems. The rich are now being taxed much less than they were. The pie has grown larger but the richest few have been eating, and hoarding, most of it themselves. On ‘privatisation’ Governments are hamstrung without resources to provide public goods. ‘Privatisation’ of everything became another ideological imperative in economics by the turn of the century. Selling off public enterprises raises resources for funds-starved governments. Another justification is efficiency in delivery of services, setting aside ethical questions of equity. When ‘public’ is converted to ‘private’, rich people can buy what they need. In fact, they can buy more with their higher incomes even if the services become more expensive — better health care as well as better education for their children at the world’s best schools. The children of wealthier people with better education have greater access to opportunities in the future also. The gaps between the haves and the have-nots become larger. Return of history With not enough in the present, and receding hopes of better conditions in the future, people lose faith in their governments. History shows that whenever hopelessness spreads in societies, they are fertile grounds for messianic saviours who whip up pride in citizens’ identities to distract them from their woes. History has not ended, even though Francis Fukuyama said it had when the Soviet Union collapsed. With it, he suggested, the idea of totalitarian governments as saviours of the people had been debunked; and the idea of public ownership of property, which the communists had taken to an extreme by abolishing all private property, had failed. History has returned. Authoritarian governments are now being democratically elected by people seeking a way out of the morass. The U.S., the leader of the Cold War against the Soviets, built the “Washington Consensus” around a starkly “unsocialist”, capitalist ideology which swept across erstwhile socialist countries of Europe and India too. Socialism seems to be back in U.S. politics now with Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and young Democrats. Liberal economists, promoting free markets, free trade, and privatisation, are worried by nationalism and authoritarian governments. They rail against “populist” policies of governments that subsidise the poor and adopt industrial strategies for self-reliance and jobs for their citizens. Liberals must re-examine their ideas of economics, to understand their own culpability in creating authoritarian and identitarian politics. The property problem  Thomas Piketty’s Capital and Ideology traces the ideology of “property” rights and its encounters with evolving ideas of “human” rights over the last three centuries. In proprietarian societies, it is just that he who owns more must have a greater say in the governance of the enterprise. In truly democratic societies, human rights must prevail, and every person, billionaire or pauper, must have an equal right to determine the rules of the game.  Democratic and capitalist principles were becoming reconciled with “socialist” ideas in Europe and the U.S. after the World Wars, and in developing countries such as India after the collapse of colonialism. The socialist era ended with the collapse of communism and the resurgence of neoliberal economics around the world afterwards. While communism had lifted living standards, and the health and education of masses of poorer people faster than capitalism could, communism’s solution to the “property” question — that there should be no private property — was a failure. It deprived people of personal liberties. Capitalism’s solution to the property problem — replacing all publicly owned enterprises with privately owned ones (and reducing taxes on wealth and high incomes) has not worked either. It has denied many of their basic human needs of health, education and social security, and equal opportunities for their children. The private property solution has also harmed the natural environment. The belief that private owners will husband natural resources sustainably for all has proven false. When natural resources, and knowledge converted into “intellectual property”, become the property of business corporations, they will use them for the purpose for which a business corporation is created — which is to increase the wealth of its owners. The ecological commons are harmed, and social equity suffers. Communism and proprietarian capitalism carried too far have both failed. Climate change and political rumblings around the world are both warnings that capitalism needs reform. Economic policies must be based on new ideas. Thought leaders and policymakers in India must lead the world out of the rut of ideas in which it seems to be trapped. Principles of human rights must not be overpowered by property rights. A new form of “Gandhian” democratic socialism, powered by cooperative economic enterprises, is required in the 21st century, to create wealth at the bottom, not only at the top, and save humanity and the planet.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:32 IST,||Space for dreams||This year, the harvest festival brings a change at the helm for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), with S. Somanath who heads the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) at Thiruvananthapuram taking over as its chairperson. He succeeds K. Sivan, who also came to head ISRO after having led the efforts at VSSC. Mr. Somanath is the third consecutive chairperson of ISRO to have a master’s degree in engineering from the Indian Institute of Science. The organisation thus sees a continuation of the recent trend of being led by engineers. It is to be seen if Mr. Somanath’s specific expertise in leading innovations in rocket engines, the cryogenic engine, for instance, will shape future developments at ISRO. If earlier the Mars Orbiter Mission, which broke the records for expense by costing just Rs. 7 per kilometre, and Chandrayaan 2, had kept anticipation high, the new chairperson will oversee the unfurling of the human space flight programme — Gaganyaan. Another long-awaited mission is Aditya-L1. This has morphed and grown into what will be India’s grandest investment in space dedicated to science, specifically, solar physics. The aim to take a space observatory to the Lagrangian point one (L-1) to study the Sun offers yet another frontier for ISRO to breach. Mr. Somanath will also lead a transition in the stance of ISRO towards privatisation. Until a few years ago, ISRO had remained largely preoccupied with deriving socio-economic benefits from space technology and applications that were used by the Government of India and some international collaborations. Of course, these ventures had a strong industry participation, but privatisation reforms have been pursued hard recently. The first announcement came in 2019, with the NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) being floated in March, and the commercial arm of ISRO was more firmly established. Apart from building and launching satellites, the company will provide launch services, build customised launch vehicles, provide services of Earth observation and communication through satellites and also transfer technology to Indian industry. As a sequel to the establishment of NSIL came the announcement of the creation of the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center, in June 2020 — a channel through which non-governmental private enterprises can carry out space activities. The country’s imagination to get up to speed with other competing nations would be put to the test under the new leadership. ISRO and its sister organisations have much to offer in the form of spin-offs and technology transfer. Underlying these questions is the anticipation which stems from the very nature of space science; it not only contributes to immense learning and perspective but also unfolds the very horizon, enhancing universal feelings of oneness.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/space-for-dreams/article38269922.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:32 IST,||A welcome probe||An impartial inquiry into a politically contested incident is always welcome. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s convoy was stranded on a flyover near Ferozepur in Punjab for about 20 minutes. Treating this as a serious security lapse, and taking note of the potential for partisan inquiries, the Supreme Court has appointed its former judge, Justice Indu Malhotra, to lead an inquiry. Other members of the probe committee comprise the DGP of Chandigarh, a senior officer of the National Investigation Agency, the additional DGP (security) of Punjab, and the Registrar-General of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The court official has already secured the records related to the Prime Minister’s tour programme on that day. One hopes the probe, which has been constituted only to avoid one-sided inquiries at the instance of either the Union government or the State government, will give a quietus to the raging political controversy. None will disagree that once the matter was taken to the apex court, only an inquiry of this nature will steer clear of partisan politics, especially in the backdrop of the incident emerging as an exploitable issue in the elections to five State Assemblies. The Union government’s show-cause notice to the Chief Secretary and DGP of Punjab, demanding a response within 24 hours, evoked some resentment from the Bench. Initial inquiries ordered by both governments have been put on hold. However, there is something disquieting about the way an isolated lapse in the Prime Minister’s security is being used to raise the political temperature and garner electoral dividends. It is unfortunate that the attempt on the part of the ruling BJP to fix the blame on the Punjab government, and the Congress which helms it, is continuing even after the Supreme Court appointed an independent committee to probe the incident. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has made some crude and unwarranted remarks on his Punjab counterpart, Charanjit Singh Channi, demanding Mr. Channi’s arrest and alleging a conspiracy to kill the Prime Minister. It is clear that a divisive narrative is sought to be built by key functionaries of the BJP, as though they have been asked to milk the issue as much as possible in the run-up to the Assembly elections. The petition, which the Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, N.V. Ramana, agreed to hear early, seemed to be an exercise to put the Punjab government in the dock. However, the Supreme Court has managed to emancipate the litigation from its political overtones and preserve the scope for a dispassionate inquiry. It would be in the fitness of things if the Court took note of the attempts to use the incident for electoral propaganda and restrained political parties from the resort to needless rhetoric.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-welcome-probe/article38269915.ece

A telegram has been received from the Pakistan Government requesting the Union Ministry of Communications to arrange for delivery of mail from that country to Bangla Desh. The official telegram uses the word “Bangla Desh” which only shows that Pakistan has come to recognise the reality of the situation. Ever since hostilities broke out between India and Pakistan, and for several weeks earlier, there has been no mail service between West Pakistan and Bangla Desh. Islamabad has now sent a frantic request that the Indian Government should offer facilities in this regard. Enquiries show that pressure had come from three directions which prompted the Pakistan Government to make this request. First, several Bengalis living in West Pakistan had been insisting on the Pakistan Government seeking such facility so that they could correspond with their kith and kin in Bangla Desh. Secondly, influential businessmen of West Pakistan had asked their Government to seek such facilities so that they could re-establish business contacts with Bangla Desh. Thirdly, the prisoners-of-war in Bangla Desh can write to their people in West Pakistan only when postal communications between the two countries are restored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mail-for-bangla/article38269923.ece

Despite the Government’s clarification about these companies (‘Business’ page, “Vodafone Idea, Tata Tele won’t become PSUs: DoT”, January 13), the development will inevitably focus the spotlight on the dismal track record of managing BSNL and MTNL. It also will draw attention to the privatisation ‘strategy’ of many a public sector unit, which could have been turned around. The telecom sector confronts many problems which can be attributed to the taxation and fee structure. In the end, tax-payer money is also at stake.

About 7,764 new projects were announced in the first three quarters of the current fiscal. This accounted for growth of almost 47% compared with the same period in 2019-20 (pre-COVID year) indicating recovery in capital expenditure. In April-December 2021, the private sector announced 3,357 new projects worth Rs. 8.70 lakh crore accounting for 174% growth from a year earlier and almost double the investment of Rs. 4.28 lakh crore announced in April-December 2019-20, according to a survey by Projects Today. On the other hand, the public sector investments grew 12.3% from a year earlier to Rs. 4.06 lakh crore across 4,407 new projects. Compared with the pre-COVID period of FY20, the figure is lower by 7.8%. “At present, the private sector is pedalling forward the capex cycle. To sustain this and to pep up private investment further, the government has to step up its investment in infrastructure, both transport and social, on a large scale,” Shashikant Hegde, CEO at Projects Today said. ‘Worrying trend’ He added that while most of the key sectors had shown net gains over the pre-pandemic levels, the worrying factor was the noticeable contraction in fresh investment plans by the public sector units during the first nine months of the current fiscal. “Most of the critical infrastructure sectors, other than roadways, saw lesser fresh investment proposals vis-à-vis pre-pandemic levels.” The survey showed that private investment in real estate increased 43.9%, and anticipating increased demand for their produce from the roadways and real estate sectors, cement and steel companies too announced large-scale capacity building plans. Increased capex plans were also seen in petrochemicals, plastic products, electronics and automobiles. The decline in public sector investment was mainly because of the cut in fresh investment by State government agencies, whose new proposals fell 32.7% from a year earlier. The pandemic had impacted revenues and spurred expenditure on the healthcare and social fronts. Irrigation and water supply projects were the most hit because curtailed capex plans, Mr. Hedge added. Based on the net increase in investments compared with April-December 2019, the State of Tamil Nadu topped the charts, attracting additional fresh investment of Rs. 1,07,610 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/private-sector-drives-fresh-investments/article64950014.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:25 IST,||India extends $900 mn aid to Sri Lanka||India on Thursday confirmed a $400 million currency swap with Sri Lanka while deferring another $500 million due for settlement to the Asian Clearing Union (ACU), in a move aimed at helping the island nation witnessing an unprecedented economic crisis. In a tweet on Thursday, the Indian mission in Colombo said High Commissioner Gopal Baglay met Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal and expressed “India’s strong support to Sri Lanka” in the wake of the Reserve Bank of India extending facilities of $900 million over the last week. “Had an excellent discussion with Indian High Commissioner to #SriLanka HE Gopal Baglay at my office this morning where he confirmed the #SAARC #SWAP by RBI and other forms of bilateral cooperation,” Mr. Cabraal said in a tweet. India’s assistance follows a request from Sri Lanka during Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa’s visit to New Delhi in December, for emergency financial assistance, including Lines of Credit for importing essentials and a currency swap to boost Sri Lanka’s draining foreign reserves. Sri Lanka is facing a severe dollar crunch that economists say might lead to a default on external debt and create a food shortage in the imports-reliant nation. Colombo must service over $7 billion outstanding debt in 2022, including bond repayments of $500 million in January and $1 billion in July. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has expressed confidence about paying off the foreign debt. Ruling out an IMF bailout, Governor Cabraal on Wednesday said Colombo is in talks with Beijing for a new loan, in addition to the $500 million loan and $1.5 billion currency swap extended by Beijing as pandemic-time support. The request, according to local media reports, was also discussed during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to Colombo last week. Sri Lanka owes China over $5 billion already, and Colombo has requested Beijing to restructure it to provide some relief. The developments have prompted political commentators in Sri Lanka to pit India and China against each other, in providing timely assistance to the island nation. In July 2020, the RBI extended a similar swap facility — of $400 million — to help Sri Lanka cope with the impact of the first wave of the pandemic, and later provided a three-month roll over until February 2021, when the Central Bank of Sri Lanka settled it. Thursday’s announcement on RBI assistance includes deferring the payment of $500 that Sri Lanka owes to the ACU, a regional initiative with the Central Banks and Monetary Authorities of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Significantly, India’s confirmation of the swap comes a week after the two countries signed a long-pending agreement on jointly developing the strategically located Trincomalee oil tank farm along the north-eastern coast of the island. Diplomatic sources had earlier indicated that any financial support from New Delhi to Colombo would have to follow the signing of the deal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-extends-900-mn-aid-to-sri-lanka/article38269937.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:46 IST,||Composed Pant comes to Team India’s rescue||Controlling Rishabh Pant is akin to reining in a wild horse. He can streak to the finish line but also so easily race off the track. At the Newlands, here, on Thursday, Pant was able to balance his aggression with the need to stay at the wicket after the Proteas dented India early on day three. A classic The chunky left-hander’s unbeaten 100 at the Newlands on Thursday was a classic. The pacemen were swatted away with the sort of arrogance that only comes to the gifted. And after India, dismissed for 198, set South Africa a target of 212, the host lost Aiden Markram, edging an away-going delivery from Mohammed Shami. And skipper Dean Elgar, who worked the ball around craftily, departed in the closing moments, caught brilliantly down the leg-side by ‘keeper Pant off Jasprit Bumrah for 30. Keegan Petersen, driving fluently off either foot, and reverse sweeping and cutting a toiling R. Ashwin for boundaries, was at the crease on an unbeaten 48. At stumps on day three of the third Freedom Test, the Proteas were 101 for two. South Africa is on course. India has to strike early on the fourth morning to have any chance. Centre-stage Earlier Pant held centre-stage. Considering the conditions, the quality of the attack, and the situation he walked in, his hundred has to be among the greatest by an Indian batter on foreign soil. And then after his skipper left to an ordinary stroke, the pocket powerhouse put up resistance, landing some punishing blows. His presence was high on entertainment. The bat flew out his hands when he opened his shoulders with only the tail for support. And he attempted to essay the falling shots in the manner of a Rohan Kanhai. Pant is a phenomenal talent. The southpaw picks the length early, gets into good positions and has loads of time to play his shots or pick his spots. And he has a pretty solid defence, when he applies his mind. The Protea seamers were on target in the morning. Left-armer Marco Jansen snared Cheteshwar Pujara with a lifting delivery, an airborne Petersen holding a stunner at leg-slip. Rabada’s delivery of bounce and away movement kissed Ajinkya Rahane’s gloves and flew high to a leaping ‘keeper Kyle Verreynne, who deflected the ball to an alert Elgar at first slip. Kohli and Pant began rebuilding. Pant played his shots. pulling Rabada to the fence. When Ngidi strayed in line, Pant essayed the flick. Duanne Olivier pitched it up and the wicket-keeper batter, stepping out, unleashed a rasping off-drive. Creditably, Pant got himself on top of the bounce when he square-cut Jansen. Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj flighted and Pant jumped out for a six over straightish long-on. A brutal strike. After lunch, Pant sashayed down and eased Maharaj for a straight six. When the left-arm spinner landed a touch short, he travelled deep into his crease and executed the cut. This was good batting. Earlier, Kohli glanced Lungi Ngidi delicately. Against a right-left combination, it wasn’t easy for the Protea seamers to bowl a consistent line. Eventually, against the run of play, Kohli departed, taken out by Ngidi. R. Ashwin did not last long, driving at a fuller ball from Ngidi. Ngidi bowled a spell of controlled hostility, taking the ball away and denying runs. Pant was defiant but the Indian tail did not wag. In the Indian scoreboard, there was Pant’s 100, Kohli’s 29 and then there was nothing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/composed-pant-comes-to-team-indias-rescue/article64949946.ece

By contrast, this was Norwich’s sixth successive defeat without scoring and the Canaries are still three points shy of safety, although a Watford side hovering above the relegation zone has two games in hand. Former Hull winger Bowen’s seventh and eighth goals of the season will bolster the growing clamour for him to get an England call-up. In a match re-arranged from December because of a Covid-19 outbreak in the Canaries’ camp, Tomas Soucek was missing for the Hammers but full-back Aaron Cresswell returned after six weeks out with a back injury. Milot Rashica kept his place for Norwich after scoring the winner in their FA Cup tie against Charlton. Bowen almost put West Ham ahead inside two minutes at the London Stadium when he was found by Manuel Lanzini’s ball into the box, but his shot was too near Norwich goalkeeper Tim Krul. Lanzini went close moments later and Krul was fortunate to avoid conceding a penalty when he clashed with Nikola Vlasic on the goal-line, shoving the forward to the turf by his face. West Ham had the ball in the net in the 35th minute but was disallowed given Vlasic was offside.  The result: West Ham 2 (Bowen 42, 83) bt Norwich 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/west-ham-back-in-top-four/article64950022.ece

On a day dominated by the news of seven Indians testing positive for COVID-19, Malvika hogged the limelight by taking out the former champion, seeded four. Next, Malvika faces Aakarshi Kashyap for a place in the semifinals. With top seed P. V. Sindhu taking on upcoming youngster Ashmita Chahila, the host ensured two singles semifinalists. Sindhu cruised past Ira Sharma and Ashmita, ranked 84th, did not let 71st-ranked French girl Yaelle Hoyaux make much of an impression during the 21-17, 21-14 drubbing. Sruggling Earlier, the seventh-ranked Indian woman in the game, Malvika did enough for Saina to err repeatedly. Saina, returning to action after a knee-injury, struggled to cover the court adequately. Facing a rally-player like Malvika, Saina could execute the strokes well but errors flowed from her racquet as the match progressed. Among the men, after Srikanth’s withdrawal, Indian survivors third seed Lakshya Sen and eighth seed H.S. Prannoy will clash in Friday’s quarterfinals.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:46 IST,||Chennaiyin and Hyderabad split points||Chennaiyin FC and Hyderabad FC played out a 1-1 draw with a goal each in the first half at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here in Fatorda on Thursday. Despite taking the lead in the 13th minute, Chennaiyin FC found itself once again outplayed by its opponents as Hyderbad looked the more impressive side on the park. The former champion will have to consider itself lucky to salvage a point from this match. Chennaiyin started aggressively by pressing high and taking the fight to the opposition with some attacking football. Soon, it went ahead, thanks to a set-piece goal from Sajid Dhot who headed in a free kick from Anirudh Thapa. However, after conceding the lead, Hyderabad regrouped and created numerous chances and if not for some stunning saves from Debjit Majumder, the team could have had more than a couple of goals in the first half. Hyderabad’s persistence though paid off just at the stroke of the break when Javier Siverio headed in an assist from Asish Rai in injury time. Siverio was the star performer for Hyderabad and could have put his side ahead in the 10th minute but could not get his shot wide of Debjit. In the 22nd minute, he fluffed a header on the right post hitting the side-net. After the break, HFC continued from where it left off with Edu Garcia setting up a nice pass to Siverio whose shot was saved by a diving Debjit. Chennaiyin’s best chance in the second half came when Ninthoinganba Meetel produced a good run on the right and hit one straight on target. However, HFC ’keeper Laxmikant Kattimani got his fingertips and the ball bounced off the crossbar and fell out of danger.  The result: Chennaiyin FC 1 (Mohammad Sajid Dhot 13) drew with Hyderabad FC 1 (Javier Siverio 45+3).   On Friday: Goa vs NUEFC; Saturday: ATK MB vs BFC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chennaiyin-and-hyderabad-split-points/article64949947.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:46 IST,||A shot Kohli would love to forget!||This has been, in several respects, a memorable Test for Virat Kohli. He played in tough batting conditions on day one and constructed a technically correct innings of 79, rang in the bowling changes and moved the fielders around with imagination, and took his 100th catch in Tests confirming he is a superb all-round fielder with safe hands. Yet, Kohli, on Thursday, walked back a bitterly disappointed man. He, along with Rishabh Pant, had an opportunity to bat South Africa out of the game. Yet, Kohli, battling 143 deliveries for his 29, and putting together a priceless 94-run stand for the fifth wicket with a rejuvenated Pant, perished to a shot he would want to forget. The delivery from Lungi Ngidi was wide outside off-stump and Kohli chased it attempting a drive. He only managed an edge and a leaping Aiden Markram held the rapidly travelling ball in the cordon. The India skipper had done exactly what he had warned against; giving the opponents the opportunity to sneak back into the game. “The set batsmen need to play on and consolidate,” he would say, and here he was contributing to his own dismissal at a critical stage of the match. Kohli walked back knowing he had not shut the door on South Africa when he had a chance to do so. India could still go on to win the Test but it was a shot Kohli would not want to remember.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-shot-kohli-would-love-to-forget/article38269993.ece

Pereira’s side won its first match under him against Chennaiyin FC in the previous fixture and will look for a similar result against Khalid Jamil’s NEUFC, which beat Goa in the first leg, earlier this season. Two Indian coaches The game will see two Indian coaches opposite one another, with both having a point to prove with faltering ships under their charge. “I am happy that Indian coaches are getting an opportunity to lead. If you give them a bit more exposure they will flourish more and can prove themself in the highest levels,” Pereira said. “The table does not reflect the quality we have. The league is unpredictable but our focus right now is on the next match rather than focusing long term,” he added. Without key players NEUFC, on the other hand, has won just one match since beating FC Goa last December and sits second from bottom, without key players Khassa Camara and Federico Gallego. But Jamil will find solace in the quality of Indian players in the league so far, with SC East Bengal starting an all-Indian side for the first time in the league’s history and nearly getting away with a draw against Jamshedpur FC. “It will be a good challenge for our team,” he said. Deshorn Brown, the Jamaican, will be instrumental in front with five goals to his name in the last two matches for NEUFC. Goa will set its hopes high on Jorge Ortiz, who has scored one goal in each of the last three games, including the winner in its last match. Pereira’s side will have the opportunity to climb four places and go awfully close to the top four if it can pull off a win, while Jamil’s NEUFC, irrespective of the result, will stay second from the bottom in the table.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fc-goa-looks-to-continue-winning-ways-against-northeast-united-fc/article38270687.ece

The fourth-seeded Croatian has had four wins in five matches this year and also reached the semifinals of the first Adelaide International last week before losing to Russia’s Karen Khachanov. Cilic served 14 aces to Paul’s eight and won 84% of first serve points. In the women’s draw, third-seeded Coco Gauff beat Ana Konjuh of Croatia 6-3, 6-4 to reach the last four. At the Sydney Tennis Classic, fourth seeded Anett Kontaveit of Estonia took the first set 6-4 of her quarterfinal against Ons Jabeur of Tunisia before Jabeur was forced to retire with a lower back injury. “I really hope that Ons is going to be fine for next week and that it’s nothing too serious,” Kontaveit said. Kontaveit will now face third-seeded Barbora Krejcikova who beat France’s Caroline Garcia 6-0, 6-2. Karatsev moves up On the men’s side, top-seeded Aslan Karatsev beat fifth-seeded Lorenzo Sonego 6-2, 3-6, 6-2. Former No. 1 Andy Murray, playing on a wild card, advanced to the semifinals when eighth-seeded David Goffin retired at the start of the second set.

The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) will also search for a HPD for women boxers and invite applications through advertisements. That position was left vacant after Italian Raffaele Bergamasco’s contract was not renewed after the Tokyo Olympics, where Lovlina Borgohain was the lone pugilist to clinch a medal. Nieva was given a three-month extension after the Games. The BFI had stated that a further extension for Nieva would depend on a review of the performance in Tokyo where none of the male boxers could go past the preliminary rounds. “It is almost a done deal that Santiago will be retained. The position of Women’s HPD would be advertised for,” a top federation source said. “Santiago would be in another for one year and from now on, it has been decided that all foreign coaches for boxers would be signed as HPDs,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nieva-set-to-be-retained-as-mens-high-performance-director/article64950024.ece

Australia retained the urn with comprehensive victories in Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne and while England managed to halt the juggernaut in Sydney, it was not without a price. Wicketkeeper Jos Buttler’s tour was cut short by a finger injury, while all-rounder Ben Stokes (side) and middle-order batter Jonny Bairstow (finger) were doubtful for the Pink ball Test in Hobart after getting bruised in Sydney. England is ready to play Stokes and stumper-batter Bairstow purely as batters with Sam Billings likely to don the keeping gloves on his Test debut. While England grapples with plenty of problems, Australia’s problem of plenty heightened after Usman Khawaja smashed back-to-back hundreds in Sydney and the batter he substituted, Travis Head, recovered from COVID-19. Australia has accommodated both, sacrificing opener Marcus Harris who will be replaced by Khawaja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-hopes-to-replicate-sydney-resolve/article64949938.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:41 IST,||With drama continuing, where does Djokovic’s Australian visa saga stand?||Novak Djokovic was included in the draw for the Australian Open — but he’s still waiting to learn if he can stay in the country. All eyes are now on Immigration Minister Alex Hawke, who must decide whether to deport the tennis star, effectively overruling a judge who said Djokovic could stay in Australia despite questions about his exemption to COVID-19 vaccination rules. Consequences It’s a decision that has legal, political, sporting and diplomatic consequences. Australia has strict rules requiring vaccination against the virus to enter the country. Djokovic’s case is all about whether he had a valid exemption to those rules. His lawyers have argued that since he had COVID-19 in December, he did. Victoria state government and Tennis Australia, the tournament organiser, approved that exemption, apparently allowing him to receive a visa to travel. Government’s stand But federal government lawyers have argued an infection is only grounds for an exemption in cases where the virus caused severe illness. It’s not clear why he was issued a visa if that’s the case. Tennis Australia has complained that guidelines on exemptions were confusing and changed frequently. The Australian Border Force revoked Djokovic’s visa on arrival. They put him in an immigration detention hotel and intended to deport him. But when the case went before a judge, he ruled in Djokovic’s favor — on procedural grounds, saying the tennis player didn’t get enough time to consult with his lawyers at the border. Hawke’s office will consider the original decision to grant Djokovic a visa. It will also likely consider the fact that Djokovic’s travel declaration form contains errors. Discretion The Immigration Minister has significant discretion in the matter and can revoke Djokovic’s visa again and deport him on public health grounds, character grounds and for a variety of other reasons. While deliberating on the Djokovic case, Hawke is said to have separated his office from other parts of the government to avoid any impression of political interference. What happens if Australia revokes his visa again? Djokovic’s lawyers are expected immediately to seek an injunction. That would send the matter back to Federal Court, and that could take a while to play out. It could mean he’s able to compete in the Australian Open in the meantime. Tournament organisers included him in the draw on Thursday, and he is slated to play fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic next week. But Djokovic also might have to return to a detention facility during the legal proceedings. If he is ultimately deported, he might not be able to reapply for an Australian visa for three years. Djokovic is 34, and such a hiatus might mean he won’t have another chance to win the Australian title.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/with-drama-continuing-where-does-djokovics-australian-visa-saga-stand/article64950028.ece

The German interim boss has steadied the ship since taking over from the sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but United is languishing in seventh place, 22 points behind leader Manchester City. Five-time world player of the year Ronaldo has called for a change of mindset within the dressing room to address United’s poor form, which resulted in a 1-0 loss at the hands of Wolves in its most recent league outing. “Manchester United should win the league or be second or third,” he told Sky Sports. “I don’t see any other position for Manchester United. “In my heart, I don’t accept that our mentality be less than being in the top three in the Premier League, in my opinion. New year, new life “I think to build up good things sometimes you have to destroy a few things. New year, new life, “I hope that Manchester can be at the level people want, especially the fans. We are capable of changing things now. “We can do it better, all of us. I don’t want to be here in the club to fight to be in sixth or seventh place. I am here to try to win, to compete.

Last year, the men from Kochi had finished second from the bottom in the ISL table. Smart record This time around, they are on top at the half-way mark and have been a revelation. After that loss in the opening match, they haven’t been beaten even once in their last 10 games. And in those matches, they conceded only six goals and scored 16. Blasters indeed looks the team to beat now. It has looked so organised, confident and well-equipped in every department, it could go all the way this season, according to former India captain I.M. Vijayan.  “This is undoubtedly the best team Blasters has ever fielded in the ISL,” he tells The Hindu. “Their defence is very solid, and they have an excellent midfield and fine strikers. Their coach, Ivan Vukomanovic, deserves credit. He is a silent killer.”  The Serb has no doubt succeeded in turning Blasters into such a formidable team. Look at the way he has brought the best out of Samad Sahal; his talent has finally begun to translate into goals. “Sahal has been almost unrecognisable,” says Vijayan. “He is basically an attacking midfielder and is dangerous in the final third. Vukomanovic has played a key role in his transformation.” If the coach has plotted the apt moves off the field, on it, Adrian Luna has been making great ones, game after game. The signing of the Uruguayan midfielder has proved a masterstroke for Blasters. He has not just been the best player for Blasters, but probably the best player of the ISL this season. He scored one of the goals of the season against FC Goa, has been the go-to man for set-pieces and produces passes relentlessly. “Blasters is lucky to have Luna,” says Vijayan. Two other foreigners, Alvaro Vazquez and Jorge Pereyra Diaz, have also made a huge impact up front for Blasters. Players like Nishu Kumar and K. Prasanth have shown that the bench is strong, too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/blasters-script-a-remarkable-turnaround/article64950027.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:41 IST,||Indian system ‘not designed’ to produce world champions regularly||The tag ‘Happy Slam’ may have taken a bit of beating for the Australian Open, but former India No.1, Somdev Devvarman, recalled that it was always a “Players Slam’’ with constant upgrade of facilities and friendly atmosphere. “I have had good times Down Under. In 2013, I lost the second round 7-5 in the fifth set to Jerzy Janowicz. He used to shout ‘How many times’ at bad line calls. It became a trend thereafter,” recalled Somdev. Notwithstanding the tough start for Novak Djokovic in Melbourne, and possibly less training and matches in the run-up, Somdev picked the World No. 1 Serb as the favourite for the men’s title. Dozen names Somdev reeled off a dozen names as likely champions in the women’s field, while giving pride of place to Ashleigh Barty to win a Grand Slam on home turf. Interacting with the media while getting ready to share his expertise on Sony Television, the former Asian Games and Commonwealth Games champion, Somdev bemoaned the fact that it was back to relying on Rohan Bopanna and Sania Mirza to fare well in the first Grand Slam of the season. “The singles was disappointing as none of our players crossed the second qualifying round,” he said. Equally, it was “not a huge surprise’’ for Somdev that Bopanna and Ramkumar Ramanathan combined so brilliantly to win the ATP doubles title in Adelaide last week, considering their big game. Somdev was categorical in stating that the Indian tennis system was “not designed”’ to produce world-class champions regularly, and added that he enjoyed the time working with the leading players Sumit Nagal and Karman Kaur Thandi last year. Very challenging “Sumit has the game to be a top-100 player. It will be very challenging for him to come back into the circuit in April, May, after a hip surgery. His talent and experience will help him,” observed Somdev. Saying that it was “very rewarding” both to be a guide for players on court, and share his knowledge with the viewers and players on television, Somdev stressed that tennis was “not like cricket” in the country, as there were ‘’very few opportunities’’. When queried about the forthcoming Davis Cup tie against Denmark in March, Somdev said that it was “not going to be easy,” but would be interesting. “The conditions may help us, and the fact that it will be best of three sets could be more beneficial for us. But, Denmark, with a couple of young players, is going to be tough’’, said Somdev.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 06:46 IST,||Indians vent their ire at broadcaster SuperSport||It was an explosive day at the Newlands where the Indians made public their anger at the South African broadcaster SuperSport. Under focus was the camera work and the employment of technology. The Indians were convinced Dean Elgar was trapped leg-before by off-spinner R. Ashwin with about 40 minutes of play left for the day. It was the 21st over and the Proteas were 60 for one. Ashwin, bowling round the wicket, got the ball to strike the left-handed Elgar on the pads. Umpires Marais Erasmus gave it out. Elgar reviewed. When the ball tracker showed the sphere going over the stumps, the Indians, not behaving well at all and with someone who played the game with great dignity and sportsman spirit, coach Rahul Dravid, watching from the pavilion, blew up. Captain Virat Kohli kicked the air in disgust. Then, Kolhi sauntered towards the stumps and made sure that his voice was caught by the mic. He said, “Focus on your team while they shine the ball. Not just the opposition. Trying to catch people all the time.” Vice-captain K.L. Rahul said, "It's the whole country against 11 guys." Ashwin made a frontal attack on SuperSport when he said, "You should find better ways to win, SuperSport." In fact, umpire Erasmus seemed surprised at Elgar’s reprieve and was heard saying, “That’s impossible.” Ironically, Elgar was finally dismissed by DRS when he faintly nicked Jasprit Bumrah to be caught well down the leg-side by a diving Rishabh Pant. Kohli was heard saying, “Wonder how they are going to show that.” Indian bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said after the day’s play, "We saw it, you saw it. I'll leave that for the match referee to have a look at it.” On comments by the Indian players against the broadcaster, he said, "Every individual out here is trying his best. Sometimes in a moment like this, people do say certain things. It's a game. Emotions do come into play sometimes."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indians-vent-their-ire-at-broadcaster-supersport/article64949943.ece

Djokovic's visa status dominated attention until the moment the draw was conducted Thursday, after a postponement of 75 minutes, to determine the brackets for the men's and women's singles draws at the first major tennis tournament of 2022. He was still in limbo after it. The Australian immigration minister was still considering whether to deport the nine-time and defending Australian Open champion, who is not vaccinated against COVID-19. If he's allowed to stay, Djokovic's bid for a men's record 21st major title could mean a quarterfinal against No. 7-ranked Matteo Berrettini and possibly a semifinal against Rafael Nadal or third-seeded Alexander Zverev. On the women's side, top-ranked Ash Barty and defending champion Naomi Osaka ended up in the same section of the draw, meaning two of the best players in the tournament could meet in a fourth-round match that could have the feeling of a final.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-in-draw-as-visa-saga-continues/article64949941.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 07:28 IST,||Delightful Krishna leelas||There is a verse not part of Srimad Bhagavatam or any of the Puranas, which talks of Yasoda’s reaction when she tried to frighten Krishna away from the butter. As Yasoda was churning buttermilk, Krishna stood by her. Yasoda said, “Do not peer in. There is a demon inside which will swallow You”. Krishna replied, “Then I must swallow that demon before it can eat Me”. Yasoda was delighted with Krishna’s reply, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. Yasoda had to think of innovative ways of keeping butter hidden from Him. Commentator Peria Vachan Pillai says that she kept butter in a container used to store sandal paste. No one would think of looking for butter in a vessel intended for keeping sandal paste. Or so Yasoda thought. But Krishna would eventually find butter. About Krishna’s appetite, Peyazhvar said that He ate mud, drank Putana’s milk, and ate butter and still felt He had not had enough. Pillai Urangavilli Dasar, a disciple of Ramanujacharya, wondered if Krishna’s tummy was like the huge bag which washermen carried to put clothes in. Krishna would have been delighted that Azhvars and Acharyas felt so close to Him, that they teased Him in this manner. To punish Krishna, Yasoda tied Him to a wooden mortar used to pound grains. Once Krishna had used a broken mortar to climb up to reach a pot of butter. So His accomplice in the theft, namely the mortar, also had to take punishment. So Krishna was tied to the mortar. Periyazhvar describes the incident beautifully. Krishna did not use a good mortar because one in use would be missed. But no one would notice the absence of a broken one. The symbolic explanation is that to Him, no one is unnecessary. Even those disregarded by others will be saved by Him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/delightful-krishna-leelas/article38269963.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:48 IST,||Nadiya Moidu and Joju George on working together in Amazon Prime’s ‘Putham Pudhu Kaalai Vidiyaadhaa...’||Many actors across film industries had a quiet last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not Joju George. He was prolific and has been part of eight Malayalam releases including Lijo Jose Pellissery’s eerie supernatural thriller Churuli , Martin Prakkat’s political drama Nayattu , and Mahesh Narayanan’s Malik . Thanks to the recent popularity of Malayalam cinema,Joju is not just an acclaimed Malayalam actor anymore. Last year, he also made his Tamil debut with Karthik Subbaraj’s Dhanush-starrer Jagame Thanthiram .   Meanwhile, missing in action from Tamil films for a while is Nadiya. After Thiraikku Varadha Kathai , a Tamil-Malayalam bilingual in 2016, she has not acted in a Tamil film. “I don’t know why,” she replies when asked about the reason for the long break, “It’s just that I got busy in Telugu. Nothing exciting came my way in Tamil. But I am working on a Tamil-Telugu bilingual film right now.”   Both actors unite for Madhumitha’s short film, Mouname Paarvayaai , in Amazon Prime Video’s Putham Pudhu Kaalai Vidiyaadhaa , an anthology set during the COVID-19 pandemic.  They talk about how they pulled through the pandemic, working together, the difference between a feature film and a short, and more. Putham Pudhu Kaalai Vidiyaadhaa... is about hope. What was your moment of hope from the pandemic?  Nadiya: It kept changing. When COVID first hit, we had to deal with the curfew. When the restrictions lifted, there was a moment of hope. But then came the lockdown. Once the lockdown lifted, things opened up, there was again a moment of hope that things were getting back to normal. Now we are facing more restrictions. So, there is so much uncertainty and you just accept what comes your way and make the best out of the situation.  Joju: I got a lot of work after the lockdown. So, that gave me hope. It felt like going back to school after a vacation.   Nadiya, what made you sign up for Mouname Paarvayaai ?  Mouname Paarvayaai ’s script was very interesting. And, Madhu [Madhumitha] gave it a different treatment. That excited me even more. Just being able to work with Joju and Madhu, whose works I have seen earlier, was a good reason to do it.  Can you tell us more about it? Nadiya: All five films in the anthology deal with hope, love, friendship, and important human emotions. What we have tried to tap on [in Mouname Paarvayaai ] is communication or the lack of it sometimes. It talks about the importance of communication in a relationship. In this film, it is the relationship between a husband and a wife.  Joju, how was it working with a veteran like Nadiya?  For me, Nadiya ma’am was the most exciting aspect of Mouname Paarvayaai before it even began. But once we started shooting, I loved all the other things about it as well. Madhumitha and her team were so good.  In a feature film about a relationship, you have enough time to flesh out the characters and show the gradual progress of that relationship. Can you do the same in just 20-30 minutes? Nadiya: Yes, it is challenging. But it can be the other way around as well, where people say, ‘Oh my god! They just dragged the whole thing.’ So, if the characters are fewer, the smaller the better.  Joju, of late, people across the country have been discovering and praising Malayalam cinema. But how do people in Kerala see Tamil films? Joju: Malayalam industry is small. So, we try to make good content with a small budget. But we are always waiting for Tamil films. We are fans of Tamil actors and directors like Vetri Maaran and Pa Ranjith.  Nadiya: There are so many South Indian films dubbed in Hindi. In Bombay, where I live, people recognise me from these films. And, some of the favourite stars of these people are from South India. This market for dubbed films has been unbelievable in the last few years.  Joju, will you be doing more Tamil films? Absolutely! I know my Tamil is not that great. So, I am trying to improve that. In 2022, I will be doing two-three Tamil films. I have heard a script, wherein I play a character spanning three age groups. It is one of the best scripts I have heard. If it happens, it will be a superb film.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 05:27 IST,||A party in the cowshed||“Come on now, Ponni. Stay still for a moment, will you?” G. Thangavel, a farmer, sighs as his five-month-old calf scuttles about the shed. He has brought her a marigold garland in view of Mattu Pongal and is trying to tie it around her neck. “She was expecting the bananas I fed her yesterday,” chuckles the 62-year-old, who finally succeeds after several attempts. Ponni’s mother, Kaveri, although playful, accepts her garland without protest; so does the other six-month-old Kangayam bull, who Thangavel is yet to name. The harvest festival is the best time of the year for the farmer and his cattle. As the big day approaches, there is a bustle about farms across the State, and Thangavel’s four-acre field in Irugur near Coimbatore is no exception. “Cattle form the base of agriculture,” says Thangavel, a fourth-generation farmer who runs his farm using organic, zero-waste practices. “Those of us who do not use chemicals, use cow dung and urine to make fertilisers,” he says. A farmer hence tends to his cattle like his own children. Maatu Pongal is their day. Their sheds are tidied up and they are given the customary bath early in the morning, followed by some dressing-up, according to the farmer’s taste. At Thangavel’s farm, festivities start at 3 p.m. “We make pongal in a mud pot by the cattle shed,” he says, adding, “once this is ready, we start setting up the place to make the offering.” Thangavel explains that he creates atheppamusing dung on the floor, which is a 2x3 feet rectangular canal-like structure into which he pours water.  The offering consists of pongal, fruits, and coconut, and is placed near the theppam . “All of us at the farm gather around to pray,” he explains. Those tending to the cattle then take the lead. “They walk past the animals asking them to be ready for the feast,” he adds.   There is one other ritual he follows: “We make a rope out of mudakathan shoots (balloon vine), hold it out for a bull calf to cross,” he says. “This is a prayer; we do so hoping that the cattle, and hence the farmer, will overcome all barriers this year.” The animals are then set free. “They are free from farm responsibilities for four days,” smiles Thangavel.  Farmers go to great lengths to give their livestock a Pongal makeover. Some smear turmeric and sandalwood paste on their cattle and garland them, while others tie balloons around the animals’ horns. “I rub castor oil into their horns for their upkeep,” explains Thangavel. Karthikeya Sivasenapathy, the managing trustee of Senaapathy Kangayam Cattle Research Foundation at Kuttapalayam, 80 kilometres from Coimbatore, says that his cattle receive a coating of red soil on the horns, hump, and back. “They also get new ropes,” adds V.M. Parthasarathy, whose farm is located at Pandeshwaram, 34 kilometres from Chennai. Community dinner Some 10 years ago, Parthasarathy recalls how bulls, all decked up, would be lined up and sent on a run along the main village road. “The ones that came first would receive prizes,” he remembers. “People would gather by the village temple following this and sweets would be passed around.”  The festivities are usually followed by a “community dinner”, according to Karthikeya. “Everyone gets together for a meal, irrespective of who they are,” he adds. “This meal is usually served on the leaf of the castor oil plant and consists of pongal with nattu sakkarai (country sugar).”  Meanwhile, at Irugur, Ponni is still cross with Thangavel for not feeding her bananas. He sweet-talks her, and offers her mulberry leaves instead. “They are rich in protein,” Thangavel tells us, his eyes on the calf. She finally walks over to him and he wraps an arm around her neck. The embrace lasts just a fleeting second. Ponni grabs the leaves, pulls away and hop-skips towards her mother, her nose in the air.  Animals of the soil  Tamil Nadu has five native breeds of cattle recognised by the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources:  Kangayam: A sturdy draft animal of West Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode, Namakkal, Salem) Bargur: A hill variety native to hills of the same name in Erode, raised by people from two particular tribal communities in the region Umbalachery: A short breed found in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, and Nagapattinam Pulikulam: Distributed in Madurai, Sivaganga, and Ramanathapuram.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:48 IST,||No hurdle too high||Adhav Kandasamy S was four when his father and uncle took him to Equine Dreams, an equestrian club in Nava India, Coimbatore, for the first time. They wanted to enrol the energetic kid in a new activity. Both were fond of horse-riding. And, they thought little Adhav would like it too. Adhav did — more than his father or uncle had imagined. Nine years since he first sat on a horse’s back, he has close to 50 equestrian medals, including an individual gold and a team silver at the Junior National Equestrian Championship 2021 held in Mumbai. An elite sport Equestrian, especially in India, is considered an elite and obscure sport. Only three Indians — Indrajit Lamba (in 1996), Imitiaz Anees (2000), and Fouaad Mirza (2021) — have managed to make it to the Olympics so far. Fouaad’s participation at last year’s Tokyo Games and the two silver medals he won at the 2018 Asian Games brought some spotlight to this otherwise inconspicuous sport. Adhav cannot recall how he felt when he first sat on a horse. He was at ease, more or less. Adhav’s coach, Saravanan K, reckons he is a natural. “What makes our sport unique is that it involves establishing a connection with an animal. And, Adhav quickly builds a rapport even with the most challenging horses. This ability is important for equestrians,” he says. ‘Naturally gifted’ Adhav has ridden over four horses. The current one, AK, is named after himself. “I did not know what to name him. So, I just used my initials,” laughs the 12-year-old. “I bathe him. I groom him. He likes carrots a lot. So, I feed him that. I talk to him a lot. During competitions, I tell him things like ‘Idhu easy ah dhaan irukkum, bayappadadhe’ (Don’t worry, this will be easy)... I don’t know if he understands everything I tell him.” According to Saravanan, the communication is not just verbal. “Your posture is important. If it is not right, your hands might shake and that can upset the horse. Adhav doesn’t have such problems.” Adhav’s favourite category is show-jumping, wherein the horse and rider are required to jump, usually within a time limit, a series of obstacles. He won the Junior National gold for this event. “I tried dressage. But it’s too slow for me.” Dreaming big He is now targeting the 2026 Asian Games. “We have already started preparations for that,” says his coach, “You need to start very young in this sport and work hard. Adhav travels 15 kilometres every day for his training at 5am. It is not just about him. His success depends on his horse and the support he gets from his parents.” Adhav’s mother, Subathra Sampath, albeit happy about her son’s success, is disappointed it does not bring him any benefits. “Despite his National-level achievements, he neither has a sponsor or even a scholarship. It is an expensive sport. We have to spend for him and the horse. So, we need the support of his school or the Government.” His ultimate dream: an Olympic gold medal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/no-hurdle-too-high/article64950363.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:49 IST,||Bolstered by heritage||“At the Organic Farmers Market (OFM) Chennai, we sold 100 tonnes of 91 different varieties of heritage rice in the last two years,” says Ananthoo, founder, OFM. Radhika Augustus, of the city-based Heritage Essentials, adds that their sales of heritage rice doubled in 2021. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, it has resulted in people making more thoughtful food choices. This Pongal, many traditional farmers are celebrating the city’s growing enthusiasm for heritage rice. Though this surge of interest has been especially visible over the past two years, stakeholders point out that this movement has been almost two decades in the making, across Tamil Nadu and beyond. “The [more recent] shift is due to an increased awareness about the benefits of traditional rice, as well as the general importance given to healthy living during the pandemic,” says Ananthoo. “Farmers are able to meet the surging demand now as they have mastered techniques to cultivate these crops, steadily increasing the yield per acre,” he states, adding that farmers’ collectives have played a significant role in this revival. Radhika describes how Anand Rajarathinam — founder of the organisation Heritage Inspired, of which Heritage Essentials is a part — motivated farmers in the Kumbakonam region to take up traditional farming methods with a promise to buy their produce and take it directly to dedicated customers. “We also started organising cooking sessions on native rice, and have compiled an ebook with recipes, so customers can use heritage rice on a regular basis,” she says. These are not isolated stories. In Thanjavur district alone, for instance, “Around 45,000 farmers shifted to natural farming during the past 15 years,” says R Sriram, of SVR Organic Way Farm Kathiramangalam. He credits environmental activist G Nammalvar, who accelerated the heritage rice revival movement during the past two decades, as well as seed saver Nel Jayaraman, who organised seed festivals all over the State. “Their efforts resulted in a significant increase in the cultivation of native rice as well as widening the area of land that is completely into natural farming. It is the marginal and mid-size farmers who made this shift, and more and more are joining the movement all over Tamil Nadu to cater to the rising demand,” says Sriram. In his 80-acre farm Sriram has since 2008, he revived close to 60 different types of heritage rice varieties. “In the Thanjavur region, which was known as Nerkalanjiyam, there existed 175 or more varieties and we are trying to revive all of them,” he says. In Chennai, Qidhan, a platform that supports natural farming, has worked with farmers to revive and market an ancient rice variety called rakthashali, which was on the verge of extinction in 2018. Qidhan’s founder Harjas Singh, who procures produce from farmers and sells it online, says they have collaborated with farmers in Kerala’s Palakkad region to grow native rice such as the GI-tagged Kerala Matta’s various varieties: Chenkazhama, jyothi and chavalakannan. Currently they have six types of Kerala Matta rice, besides jeerakasala, mappilai samba and thooyamalli. Back in Tamil Nadu’s Odakkanallur village, K Ilayaraja transitioned to natural farming five years ago, focussing on traditional rice. “The transition was beautiful. It is a labour-intensive process, but the financial investment was comparatively less. We have to plough the land well and sow the seed, and ensure good flow of water. The yield may be less compared to commercial farming, but the cost is also minimal, therefore it is profitable,” he says. Farm to home One big advantage of this revival is that the produce is being sold directly to consumers, with help from farmers’ collectives in every region or cluster. “Right now, we farmers cultivate based on the demand or pre-order. Presently, a part of the land is used for native rice cultivation, and I am sure gradually more acres will be utilised,” says Ilayaraja. In Bodi, Theni district, Jayanth Kaaliappan discusses how his ancestors had cultivated a traditional rice variety called puzhudhi nel and adapted traditional farming in the region. “We lost this particular variety, and I am trying to revive it, but I am unable to find the seeds. As there is a huge demand for traditional rice, I leased five acres of land in Karaikkal five years ago and began the cultivation of maapplilai samba, thooyamalli, and karuppu kavuni,” says Jayanth, who has also been involved in the revival of native mango varieties.  “My favorite among them is kalanamak or well-known as Buddha rice and iluppaipoo samba. This light pink Buddha rice is flavourful and aromatic, can be used as table rice or porridge, and even in South Indian tiffin items,” says Sriram.  Ilayaraja adds, “It is such a joy to see our land being rejuvenated. With natural farming, the quality of the soil improves gradually. When we see snails and crabs on the farm, it is an indication that the soil is at its best.”  Popular native rice varieties of Tamil Nadu Mapplilai Samba, Karun kuruvai Thooyamalli Kattuyanam Seeraga samba Kichili Samba Karuppu kavuni Kodaivalai Ponni Poongar Kothamalli samba Garudan Samba   Know your source||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bolstered-by-heritage/article64950362.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:49 IST,||‘I put pressure on Taapsee’||The next few months are crucial for Indian cricketer Mithali Raj. She faces her biggest cricketing test in the upcoming Women’s Cricket World Cup, hosted in New Zealand. All eyes will be on Team India, but more specifically, on Mithali as this will probably be her last big international sporting appearance. For the 39-year-old who made her international debut in 1999, this time — leading to the World Cup — is both “exciting and anxious”. “We are focussed and keen to do well,” says the sportswoman, who was recently roped in as the brand ambassador for Jacob’s Creek, which has long been associated with popular Australian cricketer Brett Lee. Excerpts from a virtual conversation: How is preparation for the World Cup going? lIt is a big event, and all of us have worked hard for it. The 2017 World Cup has been a game changer for women’s cricket in India. We came second then, and now, we have the team to cross that hurdle. As the World Cup is a one-month long event, there will be ups and downs, but we hope to win. Considering the significance of the tournament, how do you deal with the pressure? lYou know the entire world is looking at you and the team. There is a lot of pressure, but I have tried keeping things simple. I am working on keeping a clutter-free mind, because the more clear you are, the better you can execute what you have planned. Shabaash Mithu ,your biopic, is due to hit screens soon. Why did you give a go-ahead for a film based on your life?  lI wanted everyone to know not just my struggles, but also the journey of Indian women’s cricket. Back in the Nineties, if a young girl was interested in taking up the sport, they had to face several challenges. The evolution of women’s cricket from then to now has been phenomenal, especially thanks to the great outing in the 2017 World Cup. A lot of young girls have taken up the sport now as it is becoming more viable. What has hugely helped now is having the matches on television. I don’t have any clippings of my first match to watch and rewind! What were your biggest challenges in the Nineties? lIt was difficult travelling abroad when I was in my teens. Without gadgets, all decisions I used to take were my own. I learnt from those experiences. It made me fiercely independent. These days, we head to the hotel room after a match but back then, touring was more fun, with teammates hanging out together. How did Taapsee become Mithali for the big screen? lI did put pressure on her saying that, ‘Acting might be your profession, but you need to play me in this film.’ She has put in a lot of hardwork to appear as close as possible to what I am in real life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/i-put-pressure-on-taapsee/article64950360.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:48 IST,||Tales from the slithering house||A school in Goa recently had an unexpected student: a feisty, 11-feet long crocodile. It strayed from the river during the rains and stationed itself outside a classroom window. The staff quickly called Goa’s Steve Irwin — Benhail Antao, and Louise Remedios, a couple that is wedding planners by profession and wildlife rescuers by passion. “It’s a crazy life we lead,” laughs Louise over a call from Goa. “On our anniversary we rescued a monitor lizard, took it to the vet, dressed the wound and made sure it healed,” she adds.  The couple’s bizarre wildlife adventures are now captured in Snakes SOS: Goa’s Wildest , a 10-part series by National Geographic. The show also documents the reptile population, techniques used and the contributions made by Louise and Benhail. Together, they have so far rescued leopards, gaur, porcupine and bats.  Benhail has been a wildlife enthusiast since he was a teenager. “We should all know how to respect animals,” he says, adding that when he started out, he would gently catch snakes and take them to the Forest Department. “There was no Internet back then or books to use as reference. I learnt which snakes are found in India.” Goa, he explains, has 25-30 species of snake and all the big four: Russell’s viper, saw scaled viper, krait and spectacled cobra. An expert now, Benhail hosts workshops educating people about reptiles. It is during one such awareness programme that Louise met him. “Our mutual love for wildlife brought us together,” she says. And just like their wedding clients who come from all over the world, they also get requests from people all over the country to help rescue snakes. The couple guides clueless people over long video calls on how to deal with an unexpected “guest” in their house. “We want to be called educators, not just snake rescuers,” says Benhail.  Snakes SOS: Goa’s Wildest will air every Monday and Tuesday, 8pm, in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and Kannada.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/tales-from-the-slithering-house/article64950365.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:49 IST,||Goodness of gud||sample    For over 20 years we have been buying gud ( jaggery) from a farmer at a nearby village who visits the neighbourhood during Sankranti. Guda Mausa (gud uncle) as he is fondly called by regular customers, travels 30 km on his Luna carrying two earthen pots full of gud. . The matkas are covered with a gunny cloth for cushioning and strapped to his luna on either side. The gud in each of these containers is different. One is the slightly softer gud that is used for pithe making, while the other has the regular hard gud that has a longer shelf life. Seeing this mausa in January marks the beginning of the festival. because Sankranti is incomplete without a pithe that involves gud.  Pithe-making during Sankranti is a ritual in every home. As Sankranti draws closer, neighbourhoodsare enveloped in a sweet aroma that wafts from the various pithes made with gud and rice flour. Some common pithas are arisey, monda and gheela. Unadulterated gud of good quality can also be sourced is the Tal Guda Bhavan, a State owned outlet in Cuttack.. Rachit Keertiman is a professional freelance chef    If I don’t know the source, I won’t buy the gud. This arrogance is because, in all my growing years, I have seen gud being prepared in our house in Midnapore. We owned a few date palm trees. The siulis (jaggery makers) used to come home after collecting the nectar and make it in our compound. As the steam from the huge shaltis (the kadhais in which gud is made) (TRANSLATE PLS) rose, the area would be engulfed in a sweet aroma. After the jaggery was ready, it would be packed for home and also for relatives. This nostalgic connection stops me from buying jaggery randomly. I live in a new town, near the airport and thankfully I have discovered siulis who come to a spot to prepare gud and sell to customers. Owing to my Midnapore connection, my food has a bit of Odisha influence. The  gud pithe I make has a lot of similarities with the pithas made by Oriya people; it comprises jaggery, rice flour, ginger and coconut.   Before the discovered the siulis in New Town, I would source gud from an NGO who work with farmers. I love making doodh pithey, pati shapta, choosi payesh, doulla pitha or maera pitha . I source my jhola gud from Birbhum, Shantiniketan.  Sayantani Mahapatra is a Kolkata-based influencer   My grandfather would mix gud with hot water to check for its quality; if there was no residual content at the bottom, it meant the gud is of good quality. We too follow the same method. To date even though I live in Almora, I have always depended on my mother to source the right jaggery. We don’t remember buying it from shops; it is either bought directly from a farmer or a known source. A lot of jaggery makers come to Tezpur where my parents live to make jaggery. Sugarcane farmers sell the juice to these makers or bring the juice to be made into gud. Our relatives based out of Jamugurihat in Sonitpur district, Assam have always ensured we never have to search for good jaggery.  During every Magh Bigu (Sankranti) we get to hear stories of sugarcane fields being a good hideout for Joha Maal/ Bobcats and how while making jaggery they come face to face with humans. My personal favourite snack with gud is the muri laru (puffed rice jaggery laddoo).  Irin Kashyap is an Almora-based influencer who chronicles traditional food of the Northeast and Almora    While the festival calls for pujas, family get-togethers, I look forward to the food. Sankranthi to me means snacks like chegodi, janthikalu, bellam gavvalu, ariselu, paakuundalu, chakkilalu and more. Most of the Sankranthi specials involve jaggery and we make sure the jaggery used is the best. I source my jaggery from our village in Saluru (a village on the Andhra-Orissa border). It is processed locally and called jiguru/jigata/kundabellam and has a distinctive golden brown colour, sharp sweet smell and taste.  It is unadulterated brown jaggery which is hard to break, probably needs a hammer and chisel for that. It is also more viscous, unlike the regular store-bought ones that are light and yellow-coloured. Though these snacks are now available around the year, it is seasonal snacks prepared with jaggery during winters that keep us warm from dipping temperatures. Bharath Suthapalli a Hyderabad-based blogger   As someone who has been giving Mumbai a taste of vegetarian Kerala cuisine for years, I find that my work involves not only cooking, but also sometimes educating my clientele about the names and significance of certain dishes. Appam, for example, is not just that fluffy thing you eat with chicken curry. A host of items are referred to as appams: the word essentially means ‘soft’. Another significant part of my work involves sourcing authentic, local ingredients from farms across Kerala. This includes my favourite Marayur jaggery. The Marayur region is in Kerala’s Idukki district. I source unrefined Marayur jaggery from small-scale farmers who are based there and use it in most of my sweet dishes. The jaggery comes in big clumps, and once grated and melted it has a beautifully creamy texture. It has a cloying flavour that is not overly sweet, and it blends beautifully with coconut milk. IS sarkara jaggery or sugar or sugar candy? Give translation in brackets  So many of my dishes involve Marayur sarkara (as we call it in Malayalam), not just the payasam . I use it to make sweet little uniyappam s, an important dish during Onam.  At the moment, Mumbai is preparing for Sankranti with all its treats. For people in Kerala, however, the next big celebration will be Vishu, in April. Till then, I will go on cooking what I usually cook, with plenty of jaggery from Marayur. Marina Balakrishnan is chef and founder of the experiential dining brand Oottupura .     Jaggery is associated with good tidings in Gujarat.Whenever there is auspicious news, we say gaud dhana kariye , do the Guad dhanna ritual, which is the distribution of a jaggery coriander mix among friends and family. One of my earliest memories related to jaggery is my mother’s repeated admonishment when as kids we had the Khatiawada or Kutch thali, with its delicious gaud na dephna (jaggery balls).My mother would say, “Eat something besides the gaud na dephna ; this was her constant refrain through the meal.”The jaggery balls resembled little pebbles and were broken from a freshly pounded five to ten-kilogram jaggery ball.Freshly made balls were brought to our village home in Vallabhipur, near Bhavnagar in Kathiawad, in clay pots or oil tins.   Jaggery is used in almost all our preparations from the iconic khati-meethi dal (sweet-sour lentils), which has gaud (jaggery) and imli (tamarind), to bhakri roti (short-crust bread) slathered with ghee and sprinkled with jaggery shavings and is eaten as comfort food. Sukhdi is the Gujarati version of an energy bar made with roasted wheat, ghee and grated jaggery. “ Sukhi kare sukhdi ” meaning Sukhdi makes one happy is commonly said about this preparation, which is now part of mid-day meals at schools.   S heetal Bhatt is an Ahmedabad based social worker and has been documenting Gujarati food for two decades    I associate jaggery with Punjab’s biggest harvest festival, Lohri. It marks Uttarayan when the sun travels North and ushers in warmer days. gud or jaggery is one of the five foods on the Lohri plate, along with sesame seeds, peanuts, gajak (dry sweet) and corn.   Come winter and we have the masala gud or spiced jaggery in our homes. I have restarted the making of masala gud, a tradition that was discontinued.It is a mix of melted jaggery, ginger powder, fennel, ajwain, chironji, almonds, melon and pumpkin seeds to which is added ghee. It is set and cut into rectangular shaped burfis . An interesting jaggery recipe I came across during my research for my TV show Lost Recipes was in Puducherry that used to have a thriving French communityby virtue of being a French colony. Some of the soldiers came back from Vietnam, a French colony, with Vietnamese wives who would make a pork preparation using lots of jaggery. I met a Tamil Vietnamese woman in Puducherry who still makes the Tit -Koh, which uses fish sauce and jaggery.

In a couple of weeks, the tail healed and Chewy decided to help the others. Into the river Excitedly, he nibbled a tree trunk and carried it carefully to where the other beavers were, setting logs and binding them with clay to build a strong dam. But little Chewy could not manoeuvre himself in the river. His tail wouldn’t move. Suddenly, there was a gush of water and he was carried away by the currents. “Help! Help!” he screamed. All the beavers stopped and, realising what was happening, rushed towards Chewy. Luckily, there was a flat area where the flow of the water was not strong. The beavers caught him and helped him ashore. Mummy comforted him and said, “Looks like your tail is damaged. So you must not go out into the middle of the river.” “But how will I help build the dam?” asked Chewy. “You may cut the logs and pass them to us. That’s an important job too,” Mummy suggested. A new skill Sadly, Chewy agreed. Every day, he helped a little but often just hung around by the riverside. One day, as he sawed on a tree, he stopped when he realised that the log resembled his mother’s face. Elated, he worked on it for a few more days and carved out the details till the log looked like a replica of his mother. Everyone admired it and encouraged him to continue carving. As days passed, he made replicas of trees, squirrels and birds. One day, he saw a huge tree and decided to sculpt his family: mom, dad, his two siblings and himself. The winters were fast approaching and the beaver community was frantically rushing to build the dam. One day, he overheard his uncles talking to his father, “Winter is here early. We have already had the first snowfall. The water in the river will freeze soon and we haven’t finished the dam yet.” That night, there was more snow and the temperature dipped further. The next morning, it felt as if the beavers and the weather were racing with each other. Finally, just one piece had to be fixed. But the beavers were exhausted. Only Chewy was left. Realising that the others couldn’t move, he looked around for a log to use as the final piece. But there was none left, except his sculpture. He gazed it, noticing the intricacies he had spent so much time on. Then he picked it up and carried it to the river. “Let’s put this in, as we do not have much time. The top layer of the river has already frozen” he said. His relatives protested but Chewy was firm. So the sculpture became the final piece to complete the dam. “Hurray! Thanks, Chewy, for sacrificing your sculpture,” shouted all the beavers. Now the community was safe. The lake formed by the dam was deep and the water didn’t freeze, saving the beaver community and their nests during the cold winter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/the-beavers-sacrifice/article64949936.ece

I can even see the bump on the head that you ‘earned’ when we were playing cricket.” “Get down. If you fall from that height, you’ll break quite a few bones and mum will break the rest.” “Don’t be scared. I am not clumsy like you. Now quickly catch the mangoes when I chuck them.

You have improved. Looks like my agility has rubbed off on you.” “What do we do with them?” Aniket asked, ignoring her wisecrack. “Eat them, of course.” “Without washing! If mum comes to know, we have had it,” Aniket said. “But why should she know? We’ll finish 10 between us and hide the rest in the garage where mum will never look.” The twins sat down to polish off the mangoes. *** Aniket opened the gate of their house and entered. Ankita followed. Their mum, Madhavi, was standing there smiling. In trouble But her expression changed when she saw them. “Just look at you, Ankita? Is this the way to come back from school? I really don’t know when you’ll grow up!” Whenever her mother said ‘Ankita’ instead of ‘Anki’, it meant trouble. Ankita looked down and kept quiet. “Can’t you hear me?” “I am sorry, mum. It won’t happen again.” “There you go again, with the same chant. It has no meaning at all. Tomorrow you’ll invent new ways of irritating me.” “Actually, it had rained heavily and a number of puddles had formed. So we started a competition to decide who could jump in the biggest puddle and splash the maximum.” “I think I know who invented this game. I need not worry about your future. When ‘puddle jumping’ becomes an Olympic sport, you’ll surely win the gold for India!” And Madhavi stormed back into the house. “Anki, you better lie low for a few days or you have had it,” Aniket whispered.

The most amusing and impressive courtship displays can be found among the birds, especially the males who show off by singing, dancing, performing gymnastic feats, offering gifts of food, putting on a new garb of attractive feathers, among other strategies. From the descriptions below, see if you can identify the bird: 1.This male bird sings lustily early morning and late afternoon, punctuating its song with a cocky upward jerk of its white-fringed tail. 2.The males of this species, which resembles an ostrich, fluff out their wings, cock up their tails, inflate the yellow sac called gular near their throat until it looks like a balloon and bellow loudly. 3.The male performs a strange dance, springing up constantly over and above his cover of the tall grass. Each jump is accompanied by a guttural croak as the bird floats down with his tail fanned out. 4.This tiny fellow calls ‘cheewit-cheewit’ excitedly while raising his wings to expose the tufts of reddish orange feathers in his ‘armpits’. 5.The male and female spend their courtship days playfully grappling each other’s enormous beaks as if exchanging kisses. The male brings bugs and berries and the two pass them back and forth before they look for a tree with a hollow to nest in. 6.The birds partner for life and perform a spectacular dance during courtship, prancing with outspread wings, leaping and bowing like ballerinas. 7.Their thrilling aerial courtship comprises calling each out shrilly locking talons in mid-air and spiralling dangerously towards the ground. 8.Among these birds, the male makes a retort-shaped chamber from reeds, which the female has to approve of and choose.

Though the Sun appears larger than any other star, there are many that are bigger. The Sun looks so big to us because it is much closer to us than other stars. The Sun is actually only an average-sized star. Some examples of stars larger than the Sun are Mu Cephi, which is around 1,500 times bigger; Betelgeuse, which is around 900 times larger; or Antares which is around 530 times the size of our Sun. How are clouds formed? A cloud is a collection of water droplets or ice crystals. When water evaporates from land, the moist air moves upwards. As it rises, it gathers more moisture and becomes colder till the it cannot hold all the water vapour. Some of moisture condenses and forms tiny water droplets, which are collectively called a cloud. When the same thing happens on ground, it is called a fog.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article64949931.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:46 IST,||Ode to love||One of the most well-known dance dramas by Rabindranath Tagore, Shyama traces its origin to his long poem, ‘Porishodh’, which, in turn, was based on a story in the book, The Sanskrit Buddhist Literature of Nepal, by Rajendralal Mitra. Like most of Tagore’s women, the eponymous heroine - the lead dancer in the royal court - is a flawed but richly rounded character, who commits a wrong to find fulfilment in love. The songs in the play trace the entire gamut of emotions experienced by the characters, from peaks of elation and ecstasy to the pits of shame and guilt.   We grew up listening to Shyama on LP played on my mother’s HMV Fiesta record player and attended a few performances too. But most of them, save one, were productions by Bengali groups. So the announcement that Shyama will be staged as part of the 68th Annual Art Festival of Kalakshetra Foundation at Bharata Kalakshetra Auditorium, gave me a pleasant thrill of nostalgia mixed with eager anticipation. I was not disappointed.   According to eminent Tagore scholar Abu Sayeed Ayuub, though Shyama is ultimately a tragedy, the running theme is romance, between Shyama and the young merchant, Bajrasen, or the unrequited pining of Shyama’s young admirer, Uttiya. After watching a performance, Ayuub had called Shyama a geeti natya (musical) rather than a nritya natya (dance drama), since he felt that the dance was superfluous compared to the powerful lyrics.  Ayuub might have changed his opinion had he watched Rukmini Devi’s choreography in the Kalakshetra production. Monali and Hariprasad, who handled all the singing, changed the styles subtly with each character. If Hariprasad as Bajrasen spoke with an accent, that is alright – in the play, he is a videshi after all. The accompaniment was superb, especially the flute by Sashidhar that lingered on. The dancers were nonpareil, as expected, but Jayakrishnan as Kotal deserves special mention. Kotal (kotwal) is the police officer, who orders the beheading of Uttiya. The story For the sake of Shyama, Uttiya takes the blame for a crime Bajrasen is (falsely) accused of. Shyama repents, after agreeing to Uttiya's sacrifice, driven by her passion for Bajrasen. When she runs to Kotal asking to be punished for her sins, he pushes her away since he is under pressure to close the case. Uttiya is beheaded. At this critical juncture, Saakshi’s dance as Shyama, with superb lighting and Monali’s singing from the heart, were one of the most powerful elements in the show. Haripadman’s Bajrasen was especially touching towards the end, when he laments not only the loss of Shyama but also his inability to forgive her.  I hope Shyama becomes a regular part of the Kalakshetra repertoire. The thoughtful English surtitles made the drama accessible to all.  The writer is a professor of electrical engineering at IIT-M.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/ode-to-love/article64950374.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:48 IST,||A touch of novelty||Rama Vaidyanathan’s Bharatanatyam recital was a studied effort, if a little subdued. The senior dancer chose a few compositions outside the Bharatanatyam repertoire, and presented them in her distinct style, while retaining their integrity. The music, recorded with senior musicians such as Sudha Raghuraman (vocal), G. Raghuraman (flute), Dr. S. Vasudevan (nattuvangam), and Manohar Balatchandirane (mridangam), was of a high order, notwithstanding the patchy recording. The opening Shabdam, ‘Thillai ambalam’, ragamalika, misra chapu, by Thanjavur Arunachalam Pillai, was stretched to afford further scope to the dancer. Simple nritta patterns set to music alternated with passages of the nayika yearning to be with Nataraja, the dancing god of Chidambaram. Rama took artistic liberties to spice up some pieces. Syama Sastri’s ‘Samini rammannave’ (Anandabhairavi), the only piece in which the composer deals with madhura bhakti, was the centrepiece. In this composition, the pallavi loosely translates as, ‘Please ask my Swami to come here’, and Rama‘s creativity in presenting the lines as, ‘Please bring him to me; I cannot say his name, I will give you clues…’ enhanced its appeal. Similarly Rama’s artistry shone when she portrayed the Charanam line, ‘I cannot take Kama’s love darts any more’. Clever delineations Some clever delineations marked the segment where the nayika asks her lotus-eyed friend why she is being as indecisive as a pendulum instead of carrying her message to Varadaraja. She repeated the sequence at the end of the varnam, threading the composition together. Another arresting part was the Garuda Sevai in the anupallavi. In ‘Sati ninnu gelichenu’ (tuned by Sathiraju Venumadhav in Karnaranjani, khanda chapu), Rama added a plausible context to Annamacharya’s words, ‘The lady wins over you… Find it in you to praise her…’ The imaginative dancer interpreted it as the poet counselling Venkateshwara after his tiff with Lakshmi. Rama had her fill of rhythmic challenges in the khanda jathi-ata tala varnam that had a delayed eduppu. The jathis (Subodh Sridhar) were just right, with a ‘thakadimi thakita’ thread running through them, especially in the trikala jathi. Rama executed them with perfect timing, footwork and agility. ‘Vittala namachi shala bharli’, an abhang by Jagadish Kebuthar, tuned by Sudha in Sohini, Adi, concluded the well-planned concert. The Chennai-based writer reviews classical dance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/a-touch-of-novelty/article64950369.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:48 IST,||Layered with emotions||There are moments in any artistic pursuit when retrospection often throws light on the evolution and transformation the art has undergone over the years. One experienced this while watching Nartaki Natraj’s performance at the Music Academy’s digital festival this year.  The ata tala khanda jathi, Kamboji raga tana varnam, ‘Sarasijanabha’, composed by the Thanjavur Quartet, was Nartaki’s piece of choice. She performed it to the accompaniment of a 30-year-old recording, with her guru Kittappa Pillai singing and doing the nattuvangam. The guru’s rendition had power and azhutham that came from deep within, unlike the frequently heard melodious renderings in recent times. How important it is for a dancer to express the bhava through her dance could be felt in Guru Kittappa Pillai’s musical rendition, where every emotion was chiselled out by his nuanced singing.  The singing of the entire swara passages of the pallavi, anupallavi, and chittaswaram before embarking on the sahitya was delightful. It also gave scope for nritta explorations to set the pace for the varnam. The sounds of the cymbals fusing with the rendition of sollukattus, the clarity of footwork in the theermanams, and the classical adavu patterns made the nritta segments lively. Vivid portrayal Nartaki’s elaborate visualisation of the lotus, on which Padmanabha rests, and the various anecdotes of Ahalya, Hanuman, Vibishana, and Bharatha, which a devotee recalls while offering his prayers, was engrossing. The ‘Gajendra moksham’ episodes were presented with subtlety, without exaggerating the story. The devotional feel lingered in the Rabindra Sangeet, composed by poet Nazrul Islam, where a devotee prays for redemption from the bondage of life. With prayers to the mother goddess, the dancer captured the mood in a very sensitive manner, aided by a beautiful vocal rendition. “Are you speaking to an innocent girl like me for a romantic dalliance,” asks the nayika in the Natabhairavi raga, Kavadichindu, ‘Arumugane Vadivelavane’, composed by Annamalai Reddiyar. Nartaki’s portrayal brought out the varied emotions of innocence, mischief, and coquetry of a young woman experiencing the first flush of love convincingly. The singing of each line alternately in slow and fast tempo ideally suited the folk flavour of the dance movements. Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar’s Kapi raga javali, ‘Sarasamulade’, gave ample scope for the dancer to explore the various similes for love like intertwining creepers, cooing birds, and the heroine’s own feelings in a poetic manner. Nartaki’s experience and penchant for abhinaya aided the representation of a mature heroine in this composition with ease. A vibrant thillana in raga Khamas was a fitting finale to an evening of artistic merit rooted in classicism.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:47 IST,||Celebrating the musical genius of Karukurichi Arunachalam||To celebrate the birth centenary of the well-known nagaswaram vidwan Karukurichi P. Arunachalam, the Music Academy hosted a lec-dem on his life and music. Dividing the lec-dem into two segments — one part as biography and the other music — Lalitharam Ramachandran, spoke about the musician with passion and involvement. The prayer song ‘Thyagaraja Mahadhwajaroha’ in Sriragam, rendered by Magizhan Paridhi, a student of Advanced School of Carnatic Music, The Music Academy, Madras, which clearly mentions the name of the instrument as ‘nagaswara’ and not ‘nadhaswara’ as it is commonly known , formed a prelude to the interesting lecture . At a time when most nagaswaram vidwans hailed from Thanjavur, Arunachalam came from Tiruneveli, and did not hail from a traditional nagaswaram family either. Arunachalam’s father, Palavesam Pillai, wanted to become a nagaswaram vidwan, and later inducted his son into the art. “Arunachalam’s tutelage under maestro T.N. Rajarathinam Pillai was an interesting incident when the guru chose his sishya instead of vice-versa,” said Lalitharam, adding that it was an incredible journey for the student, who started his career in nayyandi melam and became a nagaswaram artiste. Talking about the period of Arunachalam’s ascent to fame during the 1950s, Lalitharam recalled an incident, when Jawaharlal Nehru, present at the inauguration of a cement factory, declared that he knew that the crowd gathered there was only for Karukuruchiyar’s nagaswaram recital that was to follow. The dynamic style Lalitharam interspersed his talk with excerpts chosen from many recordings to bring forth Arunachalam’s aesthetics and virtuosity in playing the nagaswaram. The lec-dem began with a clipping of Karaharapriya raga alapana, and later when the recording of a five-minute-long alluring Vachaspati raga exploration was played, the viewers had the chance to enjoy the different dynamics of the instrument and the karvais combining the vaadi and samvaadi phrases without repetition. With a clip from a recording that resonated with the incandescence of Husseni raga with the original Carnatic flavour, Lalitharam pointed to the panchamam in the lower octave that forges imagery of the brass section of an orchestra, which is referred to as the ‘bomb sound’ among nagaswaram artistes. While raga elucidation formed the major part of Arunachalam’s repertoire, Lalitharam highlighted the clarity of sahitya when he played, which closely replicated the vocal music, including the discipline of playing each sangati twice. Though the presenter could not find any recording of the maestro playing a Mallari , he quoted Meenakshi Kambar, a nagaswaram player, who had heard the ‘ther mallari’ during the deity’s procession at Tiruchendur temple, where Arunachalam used to play nagaswaram every year on the 7th and 8th day of the annual festival. Explaining the style of free-flowing raga display, Lalitharam shared a snippet of Mohana raga that was neither an alapana nor a kalpanaswaram, but as one which came between the pallavi and anupallavi of a kriti. Talking about the musician’s immense creativity, he referred to a series of concerts at the family wedding of Vedaranyam Vedamurthy, another brilliant nagaswaram vidwan of the time, where Arunachalam was the last of the vidwans to play, and how he elaborated the lines ‘Kannaththil mutthamittal’ in the popular Bharatiyar song, ‘Chinnachiru kiliye.’ In the sample piece for a kalpanaswaram, Lalitharam chose a portion of Shanmukhapriya from a recording that did not conform to any particular speed but was in a fluid style. A clip from the recording of a short Anandabhairavi that gets back to the main raga Thodi, illustrated the style of playing ragamalika swaras seamlessly. Lalitharam also spoke about Karukurichi M. Arunachalam, who accompanied the genius; the duo was referred to as ‘Karukurichi Brothers’ in their times. Karukurichi M. Arunachalam, who stopped playing nagaswaram after the demise of his musical companion in 1964, was equally adept in the art. Lalitharam also talked about the maestro’s efforts to set up a music school in Kovilpatti, which has not materialised to date, and hoped that it might come up in this centenary year . The lec-dem also had references to Karukurichi Arunachalam’s proximity to the film world, where he rose to fame with the song, 'Singara velane' (where singer S. Janaki sang in tandem with Arunachalam's nagaswaram). Lalitharam concluded the lecture by playing Karukurichiyar’s Chenchurutti thillana from the same movie with a folk slant. The lec-dem was a fount of information for those who are interested in the life and music of Karukurichi Arunachalam. It is available for viewing on the YouTube channel of The Music Academy Madras at https://youtu.be/7wNolayLuBM The writer specialises in Carnatic music.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/celebrating-the-musical-genius-of-karukurichi-arunachalam/article64950372.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:47 IST,||A fine aptitude||Vivek Sadasivam deserves compliments for his confident approach to manodharma in raga alapana and in the display of swarakalpana. While his Thodi alapana was full of grace, his swara phrases for the Kannada raga kriti with variations in nadai had zest and speed. He began the concert with Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar's 'Kamalambike mamava' in Naatai. The sahitya with a madhyama kalam in the anupallavi as well as in the multiple charanam line set the tone for a vibrant concert. The singer dressed it up with kalpanaswaras in the pallavi as well as in the phrase 'nata raga priye.' After a brief sketch of Kannada raga, he took up Muthuswami Dikshitar's rarely heard creation 'Palayamam parvatheesa'. Thoughtfully preceding it with lines from the Umamaheswara stotram, 'Namah sivabhyam', which states the oneness of Shiva and Parvati, he presented the kriti with the chittaswaram and appended with kalpanaswara phrases, also with interesting variations in gait. Vivek should also be lauded for his choice of kritis for the one-hour concert. His composed rendering of Arunachala Kavirayar's 'Eppadi manam thunindhadho’ in Husseni with clear diction made a telling impact. A quick and neat 'Samana rahite', G.N. Balasubramaniam's Saranga Tarangini composition, followed with its in-built short chittaswaram. Expansive Thodi In the fairly expansive elucidation of Thodi with gamaka-rich sancharas, he showed fine aptitude. In the build-up of sangatis, one could hear the clarity in phrases that are characteristic of veena playing. The niraval at the charanam line 'Rama Sri Tyagaraja' and the chain of kalpanaswaras had a balance of plain and briga notes and a sprinkle of rhythmic finesse. Sandeep Ramachandran on the violin followed the kritis, swaras and the gati variations diligently. His Thodi version was crisp and snappy. G.S. Nagaraj on the mridangam picked up an enjoyable khanda nadai in the tani avartanam and presented an enjoyable session. The concert concluded with Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri's 'Bharata samrajya sikhi' in Desh. The flow of ideas and a good patantaram complimented Vivek's performance. It is also important that he concentrates on using his voice without exploiting the capacity of its range.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/a-fine-aptitude/article64950373.ece

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:45 IST,||Are community dogs made for gated communities? A tale with a twist in the tail||The first family to move into Groovy Woodz is a family of dogs. That is hardly a scurrilous statement, just a four-pawed fact. And it is also something Lata Prakash likes to woof about. Lata is a resident of this villa-based gated community in Kazhipattur. Even more pertinently, an inveterate dog lover. In bullet points, she introduces the seven community dogs on the premises with the fastidiousness genealogists might reserve for a treatise on royal lineages. The sketch details the idiosyncrasies of the seven in a tone best set down as doting. Kasthuri Prasad, a committee member of Groovy Woodz Owners’ Association, brings a contrasting perspective to the picture, dissecting the phenomenon of canine families commingling with human families within gated communities with the freezing-cold, unforgiving knife of hard-nosed logic. Being pragmatic and dispassionate about the issue allows her to bring to the powwow observations that underline the uncomfortable adjustments that ought to be made to make community dogs feel at home. Let us hear Kasthuri out at the end. Before that, a potted history of the canines at Groovy Woodz as presented by their enthusiastic spokesperson, Lata. At nine, Tiger — brindled, and hence the name — is the oldest of them all.He has had the harrowing experience of living through the C-word and surviving it. Diminished in body but not spirit, the cancer survivor still has the imposing air of an ageing tribal chief. He forms an inseparable pack with Black Maama — who balances out the gender power dynamics with her majestic bearing —and Howie, who incidentally was born to the two of them. When the villas were under construction, the workers smuggled Tiger and Black Maama into the project. Beyond their term of labour, the four-legged duo ensconced themselves in the affections of dog lovers in the community. Lata notes that the band of animal lovers would not hesitate to loosen their purse strings for these dogs’ care. “A few residents who are animal lovers take care of these seven dogs’ food and medical needs. Tiger recently underwent an operation for the removal of a tumour.” She mentions Srinivasan Thiagarajan, a committee member, for how he epitomises this concern — “he unfailingly feeds them at night, and attends to their medical health. He has seen these dogs right from the time they were puppies to what they are now. He is the first person who initiated the process of caring for these community dogs, and we are following his example.” The 2015 floods washed more paws into the community. Harry came as a puppy, having been rescued from the surging waters. Lata says that in the years that followed, she enriched the community further by bringing her puppies — Brownie, Blackie and Whitey — into it. Tiger, Black Maama and Howie are dubbed “The Three Musketeers” for sticking together, and even coalescing into a fighting unit when the situation demands it, especially when a snake slithers into view, reveals Lata. Lata on how useful the dogs are to the community: While the pack led by Harry have their ears perked up at the scent of strangers and alert the residents, The Three Musketeers keep at bay snakes, notably cobras. The trio catch large bandicoots that rest on car tyres and chew on car wires. Harry and her tribe make a pack of four that asserts its territorial rights over an entire street. The trio have their own turf — another street all to themselves. Lata remarks that with all the dogs undergoing animal birth control procedures, their population stands frozen at seven — some were vaccinated and sterilised by the Blue Cross and the others at private veterinarian clinics. A contrarian view Kasthuri recalls that even before her family settled down in the villa they had bought at Groovy Woodz, they had to adjust to the idea of sharing the address with a family of canines: two packs of them. And the effort was hardly easy. “My villa was unoccupied for a while before we started living in it. And the dogs were using my villa and car park as a place for them to relieve themselves. When they found a place that nobody was using, and was dusty and run over with junk, they were impelled to use it for this purpose. I used to come over the weekend — this was nearly two-and-a-half years ago — to see how things were, and what I would actually get to see would not be pleasant to the eye,” recalls Kasthuri. She would get hopping mad, but would put up with this unfortunate weekend routine, philosophising that this too would pass. “We thought we would be able to manage it when we moved in,” reveals Kasthuri. They could not have been more mistaken. “Even after we moved in, the dogs would invite themselves to our home and relieve themselves.” All seven of them? “No, particularly three of them.” That is The Three Musketeers: Tiger, Black Maama and Howie.  “They would try to use this space and we would shoo them away. As we would often be unable to spot them in time, the practice continued. This was the first phase where I termed them a nuisance, as I would have to clean up the place.” To rub salt into the injury, the trio would “literally chase me away when I would enter their street during my morning walk. Each of the two packs has its street. The pack — with Tiger, Black Mamma and Howie — were a tad more territorial and clearly the dadagiris of this place, and they would treat me as a stranger. Till I left the street, they would be barking; and once I left, they would settle into a self-satisfied silence.”  That sure was a galling cut, unkind and ungrateful. My reaction to all of these things was: ‘These are street dogs — why are they inside the community? I started posting my views on the community’s WhatsApp forums, asking why should we put up with them. Why not chase them away? ‘My neighbour also faced the same challenges, and we would ask why would we need them here anyway. Why not shift them to a shelter? Others in the community would tell me that it was illegal to move them out. As community dogs, this place belonged as much to them as it did to us. One of the neighbours related how the dogs tore apart the seat and tyres in their new scooter parked outside — but chose to ignore the slight. It slowly dawned on me that this place was theirs too — in fact more theirs than ours, as these dogs had arrived before all of us did — and we had to learn to live with them. Deep down, it was more resignation to my lot than an appreciation of a fact. I was like: let them stick to their streets, and I would to mine.”The pandemic augured in new thinking. It provided Kasthuri with enough space for her to extend her family with the addition of a pet dog. The last time she had a pet fog was well over two decades ago. “I adopted an Indian mongrel, and after RJ (named after her pet dog from 20 years ago) grew up a little, he would try to make them feel unwelcome around this place. He was displaying his territorial instinct. Of course, the three would still come and try to intimidate him — RJ however would manage to hold his own. Now, they do not show up.. On rare occasions when they do, RJ, aged one and a half now, is successful in chasing the trio away.” That is hardly the end of the tale: There is an unlikely twist in the tail. “Now, incredible though it may sound, I have developed a friendship with the trio — Tiger, Black Maama and Howie — and it a feeling that they have spontaneously reciprocated. When I go around their street, I pat them, and they wag their tails and come to me excitedly. They do not bark at me anymore.” Kasthuri has progressed to a level of understanding that prompts her to discuss how animal lovers can work together to make sure these seven community dogs are well-fed and cared for. Lata observes that RJ has much do with Kasthuri’s change of heart about the community dogs. A heart-warming story of reconciliation indeed: Or, is there a better way to describe this?  The 2015 floods washed more paws into the community. Harry came as a puppy, having been rescued from the surging waters   They would try to use this space and we would shoo them away.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:45 IST,||The path to an inclusive beach||When the temporary pathway created on the sands of the Marina Beach to enable people with disabilities to enjoy the sea is dismantled, volunteer groups and civic authorities will have a lot to brainstorm about. Each of their observations and suggestions would be important and might go a long way towards determining the kind of permanent pathway that would be installed at the Marina. Recently, Chief Minister M K Stalin announced that the beach would have a permanent pathway to benefit the differently-abled. Volunteers, who are helping persons on the wheelchair experience the waves, point out that the trial study for the permanent pathway is under way. As per members of Disability Rights Alliance (DRA) — Tamil Nadu, which has been working closely with the Greater Chennai Corporation, the idea is in the design stage and various factors including coastal regulations and the materials to be used will have to be considered before executing it. The temporary pathway was made of wood for 200 metres from an access point on the road up to the beach. This was covered with a layer of sheet. At the drop point, carpets have been placed. The cloudburst of December 30 put the pathway to the acid test. Jai Krishnan MS, a volunteer with DRA who coordinates between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., says some of the wooden planks in the middle of the pathway got displaced and the sheet got almost washed out in the rain. “Later, GCC fixed the displaced planks and provided a new layer of cover,” says Jai Krishnan. The rainwater that had collected around the pathway was pumped out. Iftikhar Zia, another DRA volunteer, says that with the wind blowing and sand sifting, the ramp has suffered wear and tear. “Sometimes, motorcyclists using the pathway, and when this happens, we volunteers intervene and request them to step down,” says Zia. He says it is important that the pathway is built in such a way that a person can manage using it on their own. “Not everyone comes with a caretaker, so the path should be sturdy for a person with disability to use it alone,” says Zia. The volunteers feel that with the help of GCC and police they have been able to provide safe access to many wheelchair users since December 27 when the pathway leading to the beach was opened up. “Once the permanent facility comes up, we would need GCC to deploy manpower to regulate the stretch. Or dedicated staff to guide people to the shores,” they say. Zia say before restrictions were imposed on the beach due to rise in COVID-19 cases, hundreds of people were visiting the Marina and the temporary ramp was a symbol of greater awareness. “Just like we want the wheelchair users to experience the waves first-hand, we also need the crowd to understand the difference a ramp is making to people’s lives. It goes a long way towards building an inclusive society,” says Zia. He says amphibious beach wheelchairs need to be procured; life guards need to be deployed at the water front; and a space reserved to keep beach wheelchairs and other equipment with information made available for visitors. We need more communities to maintain and make the space a point of inclusion and socialisation for persons with disabilities, adds Zia. Along with accessibility, which is the primary responsibility of a permanent facility, providing for better sanitation and public safety such as toilets, lifeguard and medical first aid services are features that must be kept in mind. Inclusive sign boards are required, say volunteers.  Not everyone comes with a caretaker, so the path should be user-friendly to the point that a person with disability can use it alone||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-path-to-an-inclusive-beach/article64950384.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:45 IST,||Feeding out of murky waters||A residential neighbourhood in Karapakkam, River View Residency hosts civilisation and wilderness. Vacant plots between apartments stage a light-and-sound show overrun with gleaming typha, carpeted with duckweed, and pulsating with chirrups and croaks. At its western end lies River View Residency 7th Street, straddling the entire length of the compact neighbourhood on the one side. And on the other, it presents a picture that is stark of civilisation. It overlooks a vacant patch of land whose topography birders know as well as the lines on their binoculars-and-camera-holding palms. On this swampy patch lying right outside the tall bund of the Pallaikaranai marsh, a passel of bird species — resident and migratory — hang out. But, civilisation is still present, insidiously, having seeped into its soil. Sewage flows freely into the patch, being disgorged into it through big-sized concrete pipes. The network of channels and the pipes together constitute a stormwater drain mechanism: Given the water-retaining nature of the soil, it is absolutely necessary to drain the water quickly, especially after a bountiful monsoon. Only that sewage pops into the picture and mars it — for the civic-minded. For some of the avians though, this seems to be just what the bird-dietician ordered. There is a clear pattern to what is most sighted at this patch, which seems to suggest a link between certain species and a taste for what the murky water would sluggishly wheel onto the avians’ dining table. Any birder frequenting the patch would note that among the sandpipers, the wood sandpiper is usually the dominant presence. At the height of the migratory season, the species would send a tail-bobbing greeting the birder’s way, from almost every turn. The patch is also known for sightings of common snipe and the greater painted snipe, suggesting that these birds also luxuriate in this environment. Birder and eBird reviewer Gnanaskandan Keshavabharathi makes an observation: “There is one section of the Karapakkam patch, where the water is nothing but undiluted sewage, and I was surprised to find the wood sandpiper and the green sandpiper parked right on it.” Gnanskansan continues, drawing a parallel from a patch in the Pallikaranai marsh. “If you look at it, in places that are dirty and polluted, the greater painted snipe and the wood sandpiper would be found. A few years ago, at a small patch of the Palliakaranai marsh bang opposite NIOT, the murky water would have wood sandpipers and greater painted snipes in remarkable numbers. Filled with debris, this tiny patch does not host birds anymore, but that image stays with me. Based on these two observations, I can see these species are able to sustain themselves in such environments.” Taking just the sandpiper family into consideration, do the wood sandpipers have a greater predilection for stomping around in sluggish sewage-coated swamps? To illustrate the difficulty in answering that question, a sweeping statement that suggests the marsh sandpiper sticks to cleaner waters would be ludicrous. It does not line up with the true state of sandpiper affairs. Ornithologist V Santharam elaborates: “The marsh sandpiper does come to areas characterised by flowing and stagnating sewage. Decades ago, when Adyar was much cleaner than what it is, but still had sewage and was murky in some parts, the marsh sandpiper would still be there. It probably prefers waters that are a little more saline and brackish. The marsh sandpiper does come to freshwater also, but it is not icky about sewage-ridden patches.” Even at the sewage-ridden Karapakkam patch, marsh sandpiper sightings are possible, but significantly fewer than those of the wood sandpiper — a point emphasised by Gnanaskandan. Santharam says: “Apart from the question of sewage preference, one of the things that have to be considered is the depth of the water. Marsh sandpipers have longer legs which allow them to wade into deeper waters, and therefore they do gravitate towards environments that provide that. Marsh sandpipers do come to shallow areas, but not so much in Karapakkam, because the waters are not so deep — that may be another reason. “In comparison, the wood sandpipers have legs that are not long enough. Therefore, when the shallows are less shallow, that may not find them to their liking and convenience.” A precautionary note: Do not misconstrue what follows as a defence for letting sewage run free. “Sewage areas are probably more productive in terms of food that can be generated because a lot of nitrogenous waste comes in from the sewage that is being released. Being shallow in some parts, sewage areas are probably more suited for the wood sandpiper,” says the ornithologist. Gnaskandan notes that unlike the wood sandpiper and the marsh sandpiper, the common sandpiper and the green sandpiper do not flock — they are usually solitary, and sometimes found in twos — and they are also widespread, therefore their presence might not as readily register as that of the former duo. For the past few days, the green sandpiper has been putting in an appearance at the Karapakkam patch. Reveals Gnanaskandan, “On Friday (January 7), I saw three green sandpipers at that patch.” Says Santharam: “Birds are basically very adaptive and they look out for what is available and try to adapt to the situation.” The conclusion of the matter: While all sandpipers may dip their beak in sewage, the wood sandpiper may have it wedged in there, as it does love it, even sewage as thick and murky as black lava, much more than their cousins do.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/feeding-out-of-murky-waters/article64950390.ece

Lata Prakash, a dog lover and part of a group that cares for seven community dogs at Groovy Woodz, a villa-based gated community in Kazhipattur, Old Mahabalipuram Road, notes that the point of conflict pops us when pet parents walk their dogs through what are the community dogs’ territories. She explains: One cannot get around the fact that dogs are by instinct territorial, and that is something pet parents have to live with when they are amidst community dogs. “We advise them to carry a stick with them just to scare away the community dogs when the latter react to the presence of the pet dog in their territory.” Toilet-trained, dogs know where they should not poop. Even otherwise, Lata remarks, they develop a sense of propriety in this matter as they grow up. “They mostly poop only in the deserted corners or in the villas that are still under construction. Very very rarely would you find them having pooped in the middle of the road or any prominent common area. Even if it does happen, the housekeeping staff are pretty sweet to clear it — they know how we treat and value these community dogs.” How children feel around community dogs is a key factor in determining how the latter are viewed. “Earlier, some children would scream and get scared at the sight of these dogs. And then we started educating them about these dogs, their friendliness and how to stay calm. The children cycle and play cricket in the evening and they are pretty comfortable with these dogs.” Dogs are particularly drawn to moving vehicles — have there been complaints on that count? “When they see a familiar face, they do not chase the vehicle. The community dogs with us may chase a car, but not a motorcycle or cycle. If a visitor comes in, they may chase their vehicle as they are territorial, but they do it in a harmless way. Besides, these community dogs do not bite at all, and we are focussed on the fact that they get duly vaccinated.” Besides, Lata draws attention to the fact that these dogs are spayed and neutered, and therefore, their community dog population would not increase, “unless the community as a whole decides to adopt any more dogs”. Lata underlines that Groovy Woodz does not have a pet policy on paper, but the decisions relating to pets are taken organically in a spirit of accommodation and understanding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/pet-peeves/article38270154.ece

A request to MTC from Velachery residents dwells on a similar problem — having to board two buses to reach Broadway from Velachery. Madipakkam residents seem to be slightly better off, as they still enjoy the benefit of one service, 45A, which takes then to a pont (Vivekanandar Illam) not too far from Broadway, heading out of Madipakkam — if that is any consolation. In contrast, their counterparts in Velachery find themselves divested of the only convenient service years ago — 21L which was connecting Velachery and Broadway plying via Adyar, Santhome, and Foreshore Estate. According to R. Rajendran, a resident of Madipakkam, 45A is the only service that is being operated from the MTC terminus in Madipakkam. “The terminus is a spacious facility. Until a few years ago, 51E (to T.Nagar) and special services to the Secretariat in Fort Saint George were operated from the terminus. However these services have been withdrawn, leaving residents with just 45A. Therefore, the terminus is misused as a parking lot for private vehicles. We need more MTC services providing connectivity to various parts of the city especially to Koyambedu, Egmore, Chennai Central, and Ennore and the terminus to be put to optimum use. We do not have an issue about 45E being withdrawn as the route has been revised and it is plying as V51 providing connectivity to Tambaram West and T. Nagar via Madipakkam. We need to acknowledge that its frequency is good,” says Rajendran. Woes in Velachery “We board A51 (connecting Broadway and Tambaram West) or E51 (connecting Broadway and Ottiyambakkam) at the Vijayangar bus-stop in Velachery. By the time it reaches the Vijayangar stop, the bus is crowded. So, many choose to go to the bus terminus at the Guindy Industrial Estate and some take the MRTS trains. We have given several petitions in this regard to the MTC. But, the remedial steos have not been taken yet,” says A Parthiban, a resident of Velachery. Further, residents also seek the extension of the following services — 51B (Saidapet to Karanai), 51A (T Nagar to Tambaram East), V51 (T Nagar to Tambaram West), and M51V (T Nagar to Kolathur) ply via Velachery to Broadway. “These services enjoy good patronage and their frequency is good. We suggest that some of the buses on these routes be extended to Broadway,” says Parthiban.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/velachery-madipakkam-residents-narrate-the-ordeal-of-reaching-broadway-by-bus/article64950391.ece
14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:44 IST,||Green patch comes up along road in Valmiki Nagar||Cactus and oleander plants growing out of empty water cans line a section of New Balakrishna Road at Valmiki Nagar in Thiruvanmiyur. The road also sports a small garden with flowering plants. Two years ago, this 40-metre-wide and 200-metre-long road which runs along the compound wall of the CMWSSB’s (Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board) water distribution station presented a contrasting picture. The wide road would be occupied by parked commercial vehicles and there would also be piles of garbage.  It was then that Abhilash Kumar Bhattaram, a resident, decided to bring about a change. “This road suffered from parking of commercial vehicles, mainly trucks, and it was also being misused for alcohol consumption. Further, an LPG cylinder agency located elsewhere used to keep some of its cylinders on this road. Sometime in early 2019, I sensed the smell of leaking gas while returning from office by eleven p.m. I had to call the police and the cylinders were removed from the road. Likewise, there were a few occasions when I had to call the police to drive away some inebriated drivers who were creating problems on the road. Another issue plaguing the road was garbage found littered around the bins. People, mainly vendors, would throw the waste from a distance. I had to take up this issue because most of the other residents are senior-citizens,” says 39-year-old Abhilash.  He considers ensuring installation of “no parking” boards by the traffic police, along the road, as his first accomplishment. “Each time, I had to call the police to complain about alcohol consumption on the road or parking of vehicles. As the problem kept recurring, I requested the police to install “no parking” boards. After follow-ups with the traffic police, the boards were installed by the end of 2019. But nobody paid any heed to those boards. Parking of vehicles continued. I kept taking up the issue with police and with their frequent patrolling the issue of parking gradually came to an end. However, there were a handful of vehicle owners who reside nearby and requested me to allow them to park their vehicles here. I also agreed to it but I told them they can park just one of their vehicles and should ensure that the place is kept clean and should not be misused for liquor consumption,” says Abhilash. He handled the problem of the garbage litter by sprucing up the road.  “Since May 2021, I am maintaining a garden along the road with the permission from Greater Chennai Corporation. I buy empty water cans from scrap shops to be used as pots — as these are low-cost items, they do not get stolen. Cactus varieties and oleander are chosen so that cattle do not feed on them. Saplings of vembu , arasa maram and badam have been planted and fenced. Some saplings were bought from nurseries and some were donated by neighbours. GCC rendered its full support to my initiative by ensuring the garbage bins are cleared at regular intervals. I have also hired a someone to water the plants every day. With contributions from my neighbours a sum close to Rs. one lakh has been spent on this entire exercise. The garden does serve as a deterrent to irresponsible disposal of garbage at the spot,” says Abhilash who has been a resident of this road since 1994.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/green-patch-comes-up-along-road-in-valmiki-nagar/article64950393.ece

The road was laid a decade ago by the promoters of Tranquil Acres, a gated community located along Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road in Periya Kovilambakkam. The protruding stones on the road make motoring a challenge. In August 2021, Tranquil Acres Owners Association Phase 1 and Phase 2 with the support of the residents pooled in money and levelled two major potholes with debris as a quick-fix measure. However, during the heavy rains in November, the road had knee-deep stagnant water. Five motors, each with a capacity of 5 BHP, were pressed into service to pump out water. “In October, when we took up the issue the Kovilambakkam Village Panchayat, we were informed that the funds had been sanctioned and the road would be relaid. Besides, the Association submitted a petition to the Chengalpet District Collector, Rahul Nath, in November. During the canvassing for the St. Thomas Mount Panchayat Union local body polls in November, candidates promised to do the needful. However, after the elections, the elected representatives say that they are unable to address the issue,” says L. Muralidharan, secretary, Tranquil Acres Owners Association Phase 1.

But the road ahead is not easy, say experts.  In 2018, Alappuzha beach in Kerala announced that it is disabled-friendly where various organisations with the presence on the beach, including the District Tourism Promotion Council, constructed ramps, accessible restrooms, wheelchairs and also offered sign language in Braille. A few users  The Hindu spoke to said the ramp did not lead a wheelchair user directly to the place where the rolls into a gentle waves.  “It is a concrete ramp and the wheelchair users are sometimes lifted so that they can experience the waves,” says Rajeev Palluruthy, general secretary, All Kerala Wheel Chair Rights Federation. “So you cannot call it wheelchair-friendly in the true sense of the term but it was a good starting point,” he says. Lijo Abraham, secretary, District Tourism Promotion Council, Alappuzha, agrees the ramps do not lead to the sea for the wheelchair users to enjoy the waves but it was a big step towards inclusiveness. “We placed a lot of emphasis on other aspects that would make beach user’s experience memorable. Accessible washrooms is among them. We started with two wheelchair-friendly toilets and now the third is getting ready, being designed as per international standards,” says Abraham. Cleanliness is another aspect that is given utmost priority. “We have Kudumbashree units (self-help groups run by women) deployed as ‘destination cleaners’ to ensure upkeep of the ramps, toilets and other amenities in and around the beach,” says Abraham. On why the ramps were not extended up to the beach, Abraham says initially it was felt that any structure when placed there would break the serenity of the beach. “In the last three years, I can say these amenities have drawn many differently-abled people to the beach and it is a continuous work where we are trying to adapt to emerging situations,” he says. Talking about the challenges, he says the ramps cannot accommodate many wheelchair users but this is just the beginning and we hope to make it better.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/lessons-from-disabled-friendly-alappuzha-beach/article38270158.ece

With residents of more than 50 homes displaying their creativity with intricate pulli kolams and rangolis drawn in front of their houses, a festive mood prevailed in the layout.  Andal Rajaram, vice president, Sea Shore Town Association, says it was an inclusive event as drivers, domestic help and residents came together to sign up as teams. For many, it was an opportunity to showcase their talent in this traditional art.  The competition came with a time frame, as also rules and regulations with regard to the size of the kolam and other details. Judges went around to select the top three in each category, both in kolam and rangoli.  “Sea Shore Town is spread across 13 avenues and a good number of the avenues were coloured with huge designs. We followed all COVID-19 guidelines,” says Andal. Winners and participants walked away with cash prizes and gifts.

14 January 2022||January 14 2022 03:45 IST,||A community works on a stray idea||Feeding of animals is bound to divide feeders and non-feeders — particularly so in residential areas. At L&T Eden Park, a gated community in Siruseri with over 600 families, the residents’ association along with resident volunteers have taken a middle path, spelt out in their pet/stray policy. Last year, around September, when some residents started feeding strays inside the community, a few volunteers, who identify themselves as “responsible stray caregivers”, sought to address common concerns raised by residents, which include safety of children, hygiene, challenges to housekeeping staff and responsible feeding practices. A list of Animal Welfare Committee (AWC) guidelines was framed by a team of AWC resident volunteers for pets/ strays based on the rules laid down by Animal Welfare Board of India, with the Eden Park Residents Welfare Association members approving them at the general body meeting. “Once we gained the support of the Association, our next goal was to ensure the strays were vaccinated and sterilised under the Animal Birth Control programme, which was made possible as many residents came forward to contribute financially towards the exercise,” says Kamini Devi Udayashankar, a Responsible Stray Caregiver volunteer. With the approval of the Siruseri panchayat, four designated feeding spots were identified that included three outside the community and one belonging to the community. Volunteers conducted an awareness camp to bust myths about feeding strays and the need to adhere to feeding at designated spots. “Not everything can go out as a message, so we called residents for a meeting and told them that dogs will not be an issue as long as designated feeding spots are adhered to,” says Deepa Som, another volunteer. From one-on-one interactions to mailers on the Adda app, the awareness sessions are happening with the help of volunteers who spread the word about the do’s and don’ts of it. “We have a WhatsApp broadcast group created to nudge people to abide by the rules. Other suggestionsto improve this initiative are also discussed. These membersare also encouraged to alert the Responsible Stray Caregiver volunteers when they see people flouting rules,” says Deepa.Despite all of these things, there are still challenges to be tackled. There are animal lovers throwing food from the balcony or feeding the dogs inside the community. How is such a behaviour handled? The Association’s ticketing system, where complaints are raised about various issues, showed an increase in stray dogs-related complaints in the last two years. “There are people who feed the stray dogs not knowing the rules that ought to be followed and there are many others who feed them as it is a matter of convenience to them. So, the first step is that a volunteer approaches the resident informing them about the rules. If that does not take care of the issue, the facility team intervenes and hands out a paper educating the member on the feeding rules,” says Deepa. According to Association members, the bigger challenge in front of the Association is enforcing the rules framed. We don’t want our security staff and facility team threatened just because they are doing their duty. Enforcement becomes a challenge because of the threatening behaviour, they say. “It’s a continuous process and we are looking for cooperation from all,” say the members. Recently, the community expanded the scope of this exercise by asking people for leftover food, which is not stale, to feed the strays. A shelter for the strays is also coming up.  Once we gained the support of the Association, our next goal was to ensure the strays were vaccinated and sterilised under the Animal Birth Control programme||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-community-works-on-a-stray-idea/article64950386.ece

Near the intersection of Taramani Link Road and MGR Salai, the Chennai police have placed barricades along the pavement. One can also find a water drum, a wash basin, a booth and construction debris. This has forced the pedestrians to walk on the carriageway. On MGR Salai, construction debris has been dumped at the entrance of the washroom. The toilet is kept under lock and key. The public use the pavement as an open toilet. Taramani Link Road lane towards Rajiv Gandhi Salai is much better. Similarly, the pedestrian movement along an educational institution is restricted by private security guards deployed by the institution by placing barricades across the pavement at the entry and exit points. Pavements should be free of encroachments for pedestrians to walk. The Greater Chennai Corporation has to take steps to make the toilets accessible to the public.

For almost a week, the wheelchair ensured the users got to float on water — a dream come true for many with physical disabilities. “Of the 100 visitors a day that we got on an average in the first week, at least 50 of them wanted to use the amphibious wheelchair,” says Jai Krishnan MS, one of the DRA volunteers helping out at the spot. Four beach wheelchairs were provided by the Greater Chennai Corporation to ferry people with disabilities down the temporary pathway to enjoy the sea up-close. But experiencing the waves in the amphibious wheelchair was a whole new experience. “There’s a different thrill to enjoying the waves in the amphibious wheelchair as the person gets to float in the water,” says Smitha Sadasivan, member, Disability Rights Alliance (DRA). She says the Tamil Nadu Tourism Department lent its amphibious wheelchair from the blue flag certified Kovalam beach. Blue Flag is an international certification awarded to beaches that meet certain standards laid by the Foundation for Environment Education in Denmark. The certification recognises clean, safe and environment-friendly beaches. Ensuring accessibility standards is another criterion to qualify for the tag. Kovalam beach regularly presses its amphibious wheelchair into service for tourists visiting the coastline. In India, 10 beaches have the Blue Flag tag with Kovalam and Eden in Puducherry among the most recent to be added to the list.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/floating-on-air/article38270160.ece
