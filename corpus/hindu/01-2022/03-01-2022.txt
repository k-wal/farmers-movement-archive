A threshold of Rs. 8 lakh of annual family income, in the current situation, seems reasonable for determining EWS,” the committee report submitted as part of a government affidavit concluded. The committee did not agree with the notion that the Centre had “mechanically adopted” Rs. 8 lakh as a number because it was also used for the OBC creamy layer cut-off. It said the income criterion for EWS was “more stringent” than the one for the OBC creamy layer. “Firstly, EWS’s criteria relates to the financial year prior to the year of application whereas the income criterion for the creamy layer in OBC category is applicable to gross annual income for three consecutive years. Secondly, in case of OBC creamy layer, income from salaries, agriculture and traditional artisanal professions are excluded from the consideration whereas the Rs. 8 lakh criteria for EWS includes all sources, including farming. So, despite being the same cut-off number, their composition is different and hence, the two cannot be equated,” the committee reasoned. It found no fault in the uniform application of the Rs. 8-lakh criteria across the country. “The desirability of a uniform income-based threshold has been upheld by the Supreme Court, and it can be adopted across the country as a matter of economic and social policy,” it said. The report is the result of the Supreme Court’s repeated grilling of the government, since October, to explain how it zeroed in on the figure of ‘Rs. 8 lakh’ as the annual income criterion to identify EWS among forward classes of society for grant of 10% reservation in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) medical admissions under the All India Quota (AIQ) category. NEET aspirants’ plea The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by NEET aspirants challenging a July 29 notification of the Centre announcing 27% quota to OBCs and 10% reservation to EWS in AIQ. The Supreme Court’s query was significant as the One Hundred and Third Constitutional Amendment of 2019, which introduced the 10% EWS quota, is itself under challenge before a larger Bench. The Amendment is under question for making economic criterion as the sole ground for grant of reservation benefits. On November 25, the Centre had informed the court that it had taken a considered decision to revisit the criteria for determining EWS. The Centre had then formed an expert committee comprising Ajay Bhushan Pandey, former Finance Secretary; professor V.K. Malhotra, Member Secretary, ICSSR; and Sanjeev Sanyal, Principal Economic Adviser to the Government of India. The panel had submitted its report on December 31. “The current gross annual family income limit for EWS of Rs. 8 lakh or less may be retained. In other words, only those families whose annual income is up to Rs. 8 lakh would be eligible to get the benefit of EWS reservation,” the report said. The committee said the Rs. 8 lakh criterion struck a “fine balance” between over-inclusion and inclusion errors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-8-lakh-income-limit-for-ews-quota-reasonable-govt-tells-sc/article38095977.ece

The Registrar-General of India (RGI) had in December informed the States that the freezing of boundaries of districts, sub-districts, tehsils, talukas and police stations had been postponed till June 2022, a senior official said on Sunday. Freezing of boundary limits of administrative units, at least three months prior to the exercise, is a pre-requisite for conducting the census. Even if the RGI issues an order in June to freeze the boundaries again, the exercise can take place only in September. More districts  Finalisation of administrative units entails covering all jurisdictional changes in an administrative area between two consecutive censuses. According to provisional data compiled by the RGI till June 2021 and accessed by The Hindu , the number of districts has gone up from 640 in 2011 to 736.  The sub-districts are up from 5,925 to 6,754, statutory towns from 4,041 to 4,657, census towns from 3,892 to 5,050, but villages have decreased from 6,40,934 in 2011 to 6,39,083 in 2021. The first phase of Census 2021 — the Houselisting and Housing Census along with updating the NPR — was scheduled to be held from April to September 2020 but was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second and main phase of the decennial exercise — the population enumeration — was to be concluded by March 5, 2021. There was a ban on the States to create new administrative units from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. The RGI informed the States in July 2020 that after the outbreak of the pandemic, the field work of the first phase of Census 2021 and the other related activities had been postponed until further orders. “Subsequent to the postponement of census activities, requests were received from several State/Union Territory governments seeking clarifications/permission for creation/extension/up-gradation of different administrative units. Hence, it was decided to extend the date of freezing of boundaries up to December 31, 2020,” an RGI order said. It said if any changes in the administrative boundaries are to be made, it may be be effected latest by December 31, 2020. However, it was extended again till December 31,2021. The fresh date is June 30, 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/census-first-phase-npr-data-collection-put-off-till-sept/article38095974.ece

This comes in the wake of heavy rains last year that exposed the city’s poor infrastructure. While chairing a review meeting attended by all city MLAs and MPs on Sunday, the Chief Minister also extended the deadline to fill potholes by 15 days while all ongoing roadworks have to be completed by March 31. After the meeting, Revenue Minister R. Ashok told presspersons that over and above the Rs. 1,500 crore SWD allocation, the Amruta Nagarothana Scheme would be approved in the next Cabinet meeting. A “big package” would be announced for city infrastructure, he said. At the meeting, several MLAs raised complaints of agencies digging up newly laid roads and not restoring them properly. In response, Mr. Bommai announced the setting up of a coordination committee, which he would chair himself. In November 2021, following floods in pockets of the city, especially in the outer zones, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) firmed up plans to build 90 km of new drains. This includes 51.5 km of primary drains and 38 km of secondary drains at a cost of Rs. 900 crore. SWDs in the outer zones are narrow mud structures that need to be reconstructed with concrete and widened, sources said. In its master plan of water flow network — which was prepared at the behest of the Chief Minister — the civic body had identified 94 critical points which act as bottlenecks and cause flooding. Work will be taken up at these points to minimise flooding. During Sunday’s meeting, Mr. Bommai directed the civic body to clear 714 encroachments on the drain network in the city, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/swd-network-to-get-a-fillip/article38096010.ece

Several other BJP cadres were also arrested from the Deeksha site where they had gathered expressing solidarity with the agitated State government employees and teachers against the GO 317 and the “arbitrary zonal transfer policy.” Tension mounted at the MP’s camp office when a large posse of police personnel stormed into the conference hall after breaking open the door lock on Sunday night, around two hours after Mr Sanjay launched his deeksha inside his camp office. Mr Sanjay was brought out of the office and bundled into a police vehicle even as the party cadres put up stiff opposition, amid loud sloganeering against the TRS regime. Karimnagar Police Commissioner V Satyanarayana told reporters that around 120 BJP cadres were taken into preventive custody for gathering at the unauthorised meeting. Cases will be booked against those who violated the COVID-19 safety regulations, he said. Speaking to mediapersons from inside the locked shutter, a visibly angry Mr Sanjay alleged that the TRS regime was trying to curb the democratic protest to amplify the travails of thousands of employees and teachers distraught over the ‘arbitrary’ zonal transfer policy (GO 317). He hit out at the TRS dispensation accusing it of thrusting the controversial GO on the employees and teachers in a dictatorial manner. Taking a dig at Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, he said that the TRS regime remained callous to the travails of thousands of teachers and employees whose struggle ‘Sakala Janula Samme’ paved the way for formation of Telangana State. He warned of serious consequences if the persons at the helm obstructed the democratic protest on “one pretext or another.” Meanwhile, Karimnagar Police Commissioner V. Satyanarayana told mediapersons that they were strictly implementing the COVID-19 safety regulations stipulated by the Central and State governments to stem the spread of COVID-19. “The ‘large gathering’ at the deeksha is unauthorised and those found violating the regulations have been taken into preventive custody,” he added. The tense situation continued at the site till reports last came in, even as additional police forces were deployed near the venue to prevent untoward incidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bandis-jagarana-deeksha-foiled/article38096552.ece

Some of them could suffer ocular pain, a study has found. The study was done by ophthalmologists among 305 children, aged three to 17, who were brought for check up. More than half the children complained of headache and nearly two-thirds suffered from digital strain; 19 children complained of ocular pain. The doctors found that 263 children attended online classes using smartphone while 62 children used laptop. A total of 32 children used tablet and 16 used smart television. Only five children used desktop computers. The study analysed the parents’ background and found that over half the parents, 165 (54.10%), were employees, while 94 (30.82%) were entrepreneurs. Yet, there was little difference in the number of children who wore spectacles in this group. In contrast, of the 26 (8.52%) children whose fathers were farmers, only seven had a history of refractive error. Five of the seven children whose parents were physicians had a history of refractive errors and wore corrective spectacles. “This can be linked to increased exposure to the closed environment or digital device use from early life or the education of parents, which would have led to regular eye check-ups,” the study concluded. The questionnaire-based study found that the parents, though from middle class background, had not purchased smartphones until online classes were introduced. ‘Parents unaware’ Kirandeep Kaur, consultant paediatric ophthalmologist at Aravind Eye Hospital, Puducherry, who led the study done between November 1 and December 15, 2020, said: “About 95% of patients said for online classes children used digital devices. Most parents were not aware that the smaller the size of the device, more the strain on the eye. We see many patients whose parents are not aware of this though they do have the option of laptop or smart TV at home.”  She said the study pointed to the need to educate parents who believed children needed a break every 30 or 60 minutes only. “Educational videos were made and shared with them digitally. We explained that children need to take frequent breaks. “We taught them to follow the 20-20-20 rule of looking into a distance of 20 ft for 20 seconds after every 20 minutes. It is important to take frequent breaks and give children liquids so that they are not dehyderated. The parents were willing to comply with these tips,” she said. The study was published in the Journal of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus on December 8 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/smartphone-use-causing-digital-eye-strain-among-children-says-study/article38096103.ece

Mariyappa repeatedly asked Sankanagowdar to return the money which Sankanagowdar did not like. On the night of May 31, 2018, Sankanagowdar contacted Hullappa Soodi and the two murdered Mariyappa using a sharp weapon. The body was cut into two parts and dumped in the stream near the estate. The body was found two days later near the bridge.

He was addressing a massive rally at Meerut in Uttar Pradesh after laying the foundation stone of a sports university, named after hockey wizard Major Dhyanchand, Mr. Modi took a dig at the Samajwadi Party and rhetorically said that during the previous government in Uttar Pradesh, criminals used to play their games, and tournaments of land grabbing were common. “Lewd comments were passed at women, houses were burnt down during riots and people were forced to leave their native homes. The BJP government is now playing ‘jail-jail’ with such criminals,” he said, once again reminding the audience of the U.P. Police’s crackdown on the infamous stolen cars market in Sotiganj area of Meerut. Exhorting the youth to choose their role models carefully, Mr. Modi, without naming former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, said, “We should encourage the youth by all means, but when they make a mistake we should not say ‘boys make mistakes’.” Mr. Modi, speaking at the heart of western Uttar Pradesh politics, described Meerut as “a symbol of the country’s culture and might”. He described the region as an important centre of the Indus Valley civilisation and the cradle of Mahabharat. Mr. Modi invoked the role of the historic city in the First War of Independence and even made a reference to Chaudhary Charan Singh, calling him a “great visionary.” While leaders from the region have often complained of being neglected by the State government and the Centre, Mr. Modi said, “Both Lucknow and Delhi are just at an arm’s distance and both are keen to serve you.” He reminded the crowd that the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and the upcoming Regional Rapid Transit System project would shorten the distance between western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and the Ganga Expressway would connect it with the eastern parts of the sprawling State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bjp-govt-has-encouraged-real-games-modi-says-in-meerut/article38095975.ece

The app, ‘Bulli Bai’, which has now been removed, was hosted on GitHub. It is the second such instance in almost six months wherein Muslim women have been put up for ‘auction’ along with photographs largely from their social media accounts without permission. In July, last year, such pictures were shared on an app called ‘Sulli deals’, which was also hosted on GitHub, with the phrase ‘Sulli deal of the day’. A complaint about the ‘Bulli Bai’ app has been filed with the Delhi Police and the Mumbai Police. While FIRs were filed in the case of ‘Sulli Deals’, no concrete action has so far been taken against those behind the app. “Govt. of India is working with police organisations in Delhi and Mumbai on this matter,” Mr. Vaishnaw tweeted. Earlier, replying to Rajya Sabha member Priyanka Chaturvedi, who had raised the issue, the Minister said, “GitHub confirmed blocking the user this morning itself. CERT and Police authorities are coordinating further action.” However, he did not offer more details. Many women, whose pictures were misused, also took to social media platforms such as Twitter to share their trauma and anger over the issue. ‘Creators, hosts culpable’ “The creator of such an app is doing something illegal. But those who are allowing such applications to run or be hosted on their platform/cloud cannot be absolved of their responsibility. It is their moral as well as professional responsibility to shut such things down, which is not a very difficult thing to do,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder and CEO, Greyhound Research. Ms. Chaturvedi said, “On 01/01/2020, West Region Cyber police Station, Mumbai registered CR No.01/2022, U/S 153(A), 153(B), 295(A), 354D, 509, 500 IPC r/w 67 Information Technology Act against above mentioned Twitter handle holders and ‘Bulli Bai’ app developer hosted on GitHub.” Stern action “I have repeatedly asked Hon. IT Minister @AshwiniVaishnawji to take stern action against such rampant misogyny and communal targeting of women through #sullideals like platforms. A shame that it continues to be ignored,” the Shiv Sena MP tweeted, adding that besides blocking the platform, punishing the offenders creating such sites was important. “I hope @HMOIndia & @GoI_MeitY will support @MumbaiPolice to find these culprits & make them as well as platforms accountable #BulliDeals,” she said. Meanwhile, the National Commission of Women in reply to a tweet by a journalist, whose name and picture appeared in the app and has filed a complaint with the cyber cell of Delhi Police, said that it has taken cognisance of this incident, and thst chairperson Rekha Sharma had written to Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana to immediately register a First Information Report in the matter. “The process must be expedited so that such crime is not repeated,” it said. It added that the action taken in both the cases must be apprised to the Commission at the earliest, and that a copy of the letter has also been sent to Dy Commissioner of Police, Cyber Prevention Awareness Detection (CyPAD), Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-looking-into-app-targeting-muslim-women/article38096013.ece

We are running a decisive government,” Mr. Bommai told journalists in Dharwad on Sunday. “We don’t need any lessons on governance from Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah,” the Chief Minister added. He dismissed as baseless Mr. Siddaramaiah’s allegation that the State BJP was stalling the Mekadatu project. “We are working on the project in all earnestness,” he said. “There is no need to give replies to all such baseless allegations made by Congress leaders.

03 January 2022||NEW DELHI,||Pegasus: SC panel tells people to report if they were targets||The technical committee examining the Pegasus spyware allegations has issued a public notice inviting citizens to come forward if they suspect that their mobile phones or instruments have been infected with the Israeli military grade malware. The committee, overseen by former Supreme Court judge, Justice R.V. Raveendran, said citizens should make it clear whether they would let the committee further examine their phones or instruments if “reasonable cause” is found that they are infected. Citizens who believe they were victims of Pegasus snooping should write to the technical committee at inquiry@pegasus-india-investigation.in by January 7 noon. They should give detailed reasons to substantiate their suspicions. News reports had said a cross-section of people from journalists, activists, parliamentarians, government officials, lawyers and even court staffers were targetted using Pegasus. In case the suspicions ring true and deserve further examination, the mobile phones and instruments would be collected by the committee in Delhi and digital phone images of the records collected would be provided to their owners. Wide mandate The job cut out for the committee is to “enquire, investigate and determine” whether the “Pegasus suite of spyware was used on phones or other devices of the citizens of India to access stored data, eavesdrop on conversations, intercept information and/or for any other purposes”. The committee also has to get the “details of the victims and/or persons affected by such a spyware attack”. The other questions for the committee include whether Pegasus was used by the Centre or State or any of their agencies against their own citizens, and if used, was it authorised and under what law or procedure. The Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana wanted the committee to dive deep into the first public signs of the alleged use of the military-grade spyware years ago. The court had wanted the committee to dig up the steps taken by the government “after reports were published in the year 2019 about hacking of WhatsApp accounts using the Pegasus suite of spyware”. The court also wants the committee to use its expertise to test the existing surveillance laws and procedures to see how much they value and protect citizens’ privacy. The court said the committee should come up with recommendations to prevent State and non-State players from invading the fundamental right of privacy of citizens through illegal surveillance mounted on them. The court has also asked the Justice Raveendran panel to come up with suggestions for enhancing and improving the cyber security of the nation and its assets. Noting that there should not be any delay in protecting citizens from malicious spyware attacks, the court had even asked the committee to suggest an ad hoc arrangement that could be passed by the Supreme Court as an interim measure until the Parliament came up with a law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pegasus-sc-panel-tells-people-to-report-if-they-were-targets/article38095742.ece
03 January 2022||New Delhi,||Draft national air sports policy pushes for safety standards||The government on Sunday released a draft national policy for air sports in the country that will require entities providing these services and their equipment to be registered, as well as be liable for penalties. The policy proposes a two-tier governance structure for air sports in the country, which will include an apex governing body called the Air Sports Federation of India (ASFI) and associations for each air sport. It will cover activities like aerobatics, aeromodelling, amateur-built and experimental aircraft, ballooning, drones, gliding, hang gliding, paragliding, microlighting, paramotoring, skydiving, and vintage aircraft. The ASFI will be an autonomous body under the Ministry of Civil Aviation and will represent India at the Lausanne-headquartered Fédération Aéronaautique Internationale (FAI) and other global platforms related to air sports. It will provide governance over various aspects of air sports, including regulation, certification, competitions, awards and penalties. Each air sports association will lay down its safety standards for equipment, infrastructure, personnel and training, and specify the disciplinary actions to be taken in case of non-compliance. Inability to do so may lead to penal action by the ASFI. Registration required All persons and entities providing air sports services will be required to register as members of the respective air sports associations. Key equipment used will also have to be registered. It is proposed that popular air sports attractions in the country such as Bir Billing in Himachal Pradesh, Gangtok in Sikkim, Hadapsar in Maharashtra and Vagamon in Kerala can be declared as a “control zone” for air sports in order to ensure the safety of other manned aircraft. Schools and colleges will be encouraged to include air sports in their curriculum and their students will have the opportunity to participate in the FAI’s international competitions. The draft policy also aims to promote domestic design, development and manufacturing of air sports equipment under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan; waive import duty on equipment for a few years; as well as request the GST Council to consider rationalising the GST rate on air sports equipment to 5% or less.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/draft-national-air-sports-policy-pushes-for-safety-standards/article38095758.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:35 IST,||Six lakh adolescents register for vaccination||Ahead of the expanded vaccination drive for 15-17-year-olds that commences on Monday, nearly 6,00,000 adolescents have registered for their Covaxin shots according to data on the CoWIN platform. India’s estimated population in the 14-17 category is around three crore. The expansion comes even as India’s daily caseload increased to 27,553 and the total number of Omicron cases surged to 1,525. Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Kerala reported the maximum number of people with Omicron and accounted for close to two-thirds of the national count. Later this week, the Health Ministry is expected to issue guidelines on “precaution doses” and whether this third dose will be a repeat of the previous two or a different kind. Delhi reported 3,194 fresh COVID-19 cases on Sunday with one death. This is the highest single-day rise since May 2020. The positivity rate rose to 4.59%. There are currently 8,397 active cases. In its highest single-day jump in COVID-19 cases in the past six months, Maharashtra reported 11,877 new cases on Sunday as the active case tally climbed to 42,024. Fifty Omicron infections were reported on Sunday, of which 46 are from Pune district, taking the State’s total Omicron tally to 510. However, the number of fatalities remained low, with just nine deaths being reported as opposed to the daily average of 20 deaths last week. State authorities said more than 65% of the new cases were either asymptomatic or mild. Hospitals, too, have reported no significant rise in admissions, said health authorities, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, warned that restrictions could get stricter if the uptick in cases continued. Odisha on Sunday registered a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, prompting the State government to postpone re-opening primary schools from January 3. As many as 424 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Sunday — a 42% rise in infections in 24 hours. On Saturday, 298 persons were found infected by COVID-19 cases. The State’s cumulative Omicron cases increased to 37. Kerala reported 2,802 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday. Its Omicron tally rose to 152 as on Sunday, with 45 cases newly testing positive for Omicron. Health Minister Veena George said that community transmission of Omicron was yet to happen in Kerala as none of the general indicators — hospitalisations, ICU occupancy, oxygen bed requirement — were rising. Andhra Pradesh reported 165 cases and two deaths in the 24 hours ending Sunday morning. Gujarat recorded 968 cases and one death on Sunday. Active cases increased to 4,753, of which six patients were on ventilator support. Ahmedabad and Surat are emerging as major hotspots for the third wave. In Ahmedabad, active cases have gone up to 2,500. In Telangana, five more people were confirmed with the Omicron variant on Sunday, bringing the State’s total cases with the variant to 84. Karnataka on Sunday reported 1,187 new cases of COVID-19, taking the total to 30,09,557. The positivity rate for the day touched 1.08%. Tamil Nadu added another 1,594 fresh infections on Sunday. As on date, 9,304 persons are undergoing treatment, and 23 persons are being treated for Omicron.

03 January 2022||NEW DELHI,||Taliban promise to keep embassies safe||Hours after India announced vaccine and wheat delivery for Afghanistan, the Taliban reiterated that they will provide protection to diplomats from countries that wish to re-open closed embassies in Kabul. The assurance, however, will be tested against the current ground situation in Kabul and in other major cities of Afghanistan that India is tracking closely. “We are committed to provide security for all embassies and their diplomats to function normally if they return to Kabul,” said Suhail Shaheen, Taliban’s “Permanent Representative Designate” to the United Nations. The Taliban have given several assurances over the past few months to the international community about safety of diplomats and workers in international organisations, but the security situation in Kabul has not improved so far. India has not yet sent a diplomatic team back to Kabul for a first-hand report even though its humanitarian reach has expanded over the war-torn country. The pledge of delivery of wheat with the support of transit facility from Pakistan, however, indicated that Delhi is increasingly tilting towards engaging the Taliban indirectly through international organisations like the World Food Programme. It is understood that further engagement with the Taliban by placing official diplomats in the Indian Embassy — which was closed in August 2021 — will be attempted after due scrutiny. Officials say India is currently deliberating with Pakistan and other international organisations to figure out the modalities for the export of large consignments of aid but Afghan commentator Khalilullah Safi has pointed out that the aid distribution network in Afghanistan is riddled with corruption which may require close on ground inspection to be successful. Unimpeded access India has been demanding “unimpeded” access to the Afghan people to help deliver humanitarian assistance in a “non-discriminatory” manner. This line of argument reflects India’s concern about possible appropriation of the items by cartels and groups close to the Taliban, denying fair distribution. “Given the lawless situation on the ground, only 20%-30% of the food crops from India will reach the needy,” said Mr. Safi. A major problem during the distribution of the food assistance from India will be the difficulty that New Delhi may face in verifying the facts on the ground when the wheat distribution begins within the coming weeks. Mr. Safi has urged for involving more civil society activists and international organisations on the ground to ensure that the distribution remains transparent. However, it is yet to be seen how India will ensure transparency in the process without having an official Indian team in Kabul to observe the distribution of wheat. Following the arrival of the Taliban, India carried out rounds of evacuation of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus with support from locals but it is unclear how such a local network can ensure equitable distribution of humanitarian assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/taliban-promise-to-keep-embassies-safe/article38096016.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:23 IST,||Hospitalisations are less: Delhi CM||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that though the capital is witnessing a sharp spike in the number of daily and active cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, there is no need to panic as most patients are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms and do not need hospitalisation. He presented data to show that despite an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, oxygen bed occupancy is less than 1% in hospitals and very low when compared with the deadly second wave of the coronavirus in April 2021. “Currently, the number of active cases in the city is 6,360 and today [Sunday] 3,100 new cases are expected to be reported. All cases are mild and in most of them, patients don’t need hospitalisation,” the CM said in a virtual press conference. Active COVID-19 cases rose from about 2,000 on December 29, 2021 to 6,000 on January 1, but the number of patients in hospitals dipped during this period. On December 29, 2021 as many as 262 beds were occupied, while on January 1, it was only 247, he said. According to the latest health bulletin, Mr. Kejriwal said only 82 oxygen beds were occupied and 99.72% were vacant. “There has been no major change in this number over the last three days, which means no new patient required oxygen. If the need arises, the Delhi government is prepared with 37,000 such beds,” he said. “On March 27 last year, Delhi had 6,600 active cases and 1,150 oxygen beds were occupied. As many as 145 patients were on ventilator support compared to five now,” Mr. Kejriwal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hospitalisations-are-less-delhi-cm/article38095778.ece

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:34 IST,||Hospitalisations almost nil: Delhi CM||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday appealed to people not to panic as although the number of COVID-19 cases is rising, patients are showing mild symptoms and are getting better without having to visit the hospital. The Capital on Sunday reported 3,194 new cases and one death, taking the tally of active cases to 8,397, of whom 4,759 are being treated at home. Mr. Kejriwal said the current wave was less severe as there was barely anyone visiting the hospital and needing oxygen, leaving 99.78% beds vacant. Comparing the current scenario with the situation during the second wave in April 2021, Mr. Kejriwal said, “On April 1, when almost 2,700 cases were recorded in a single day like on Saturday, 1,700 oxygen beds were occupied, while only 82 are needed today. As many as 231 patients were on ventilator compared to five at present.” ‘Maintain caution’ He said the Delhi government was leaving no stone unturned in its fight against COVID-19. “Omicron is a very mild variant of COVID-19. Data show how oxygen beds, ventilators are lying vacant even with a high spread in cases. The situation is not worth panicking over. We need to maintain caution,” he said. “Please wear masks, follow social distancing norms and regularly wash hands with soap. About 99.78% COVID-19 beds are vacant in Delhi hospitals but we are still making preparations for 37,000 more beds to stay ahead of the virus,” he said. Cases have been increasing rapidly in the Capital since December 29, when 923 cases were recorded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hospitalisations-almost-nil-delhi-cm/article38095963.ece
03 January 2022||Srinagar,||Pakistan breached ceasefire pact on Jan. 1, says Army||The Pakistan army, in complete breach of the ceasefire understanding, made a bid to carry out a Border Action Team (BAT) attack inside Kashmir near the Line of Control (LoC) on January 1, in which one infiltrator was killed, the Army on Sunday said . “In a complete breach of the ongoing ceasefire understanding between the two armies across the LoC, an infiltration or BAT action was attempted in the Keran Sector of Kupwara district on January 1. A swift action foiled the bid,” an Army spokesman said. The Army said one infiltrator, identified as Muhammad Shabbir Malik, a Pakistani national, was killed. “Malik was equipped with weapons, ammunition and warlike stores,” the spokesman said. The incident site, according to the Army, is located on the Pakistani side of the Anti Infiltration Obstacle System, “kept under surveillance by the Indian Army to effectively counter any nefarious activity by the infiltrators or Pakistan Army”. The Army said the slain intruder, dressed in Pathani suit and black jacket, was moving from areas under the control of Pakistan Army across the Line of Control around 3 p.m. “Ambushes were laid along likely routes that could be adopted by the intruder and movement was followed till 4 p.m. The ambush was sprung at the opportune moment and the infiltrator eliminated,” the Army said. The body was recovered along with one AK-47 rifle and a large quantity of ammunition including seven grenades, he added. “A search of the belongings revealed Pakistani national identity card and vaccination certificates, issued by the Ministry of National Health Services Regulation & Coordination Government of Pakistan, identifying him as Muhammad Shabbir Malik. The belongings also include a photo of the infiltrator in army uniform wearing the name tag of Shabbir,” the Army said. The spokesman said the route taken by the terrorist was similar to the one adopted on April 4, 2020 during the Op Rangadori Bhaikh, in which five terrorists were eliminated. “A hotline communication has been made to Pakistan army asking them to take back the body of the killed individual,” the Army said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pakistan-breached-ceasefire-pact-on-jan-1-says-army/article38095763.ece
03 January 2022||GUWAHATI,||Kaziranga elevated road plan awaits nod||The Assam government is awaiting the Centre’s clearance for an elevated road over nine corridors used by the animals of the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve usually during high floods. The 35-km elevated road will run along an existing arterial highway. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday said the Centre had virtually cleared the 35-km project worth Rs. 6,000 crore. But officials of the Public Works Department said they were awaiting clearance from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH). “But we expect the clearance in a fortnight or so,” a senior official said. One of the reasons why the MoRTH took longer to process the project was the State government’s alignment report for a two-lane road that was deemed to be short-sighted. The Ministry sought a revised report, advising the State authorities to think “100 years ahead” and go for a four-lane project. “We will have to prepare a detailed project report to the Ministry after receiving its go-ahead. The next stage entails obtaining clearance from the Environment Ministry and the National Board for Wildlife,” the official said. According to the blueprint, the “Kaziranga project” will have two tunnels — one with an estimated length of 1.5 km and the other of 600 metres. “The alignment was fixed in coordination with the Wildlife Institute of India. Apart from the engineering aspect, the designing was done to ensure minimum harm to the wildlife and human settlements along the highway,” the official said. ‘Clear encroachments’ Kaziranga’s field director P. Sivakumar said the project would not benefit the park known as the best address of the one-horned rhino if the settlements and encroachment on the animal corridors were not cleared. “People settled on or near the corridors need to be relocated and compensated,” he said. The highway along the southern edge of Kaziranga has often proved fatal for animals fleeing the park during floods for the safety of the hills of the Karbi Anglong district further south. Speed restrictions during the monsoon often fail to prevent the animals from being run over.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kaziranga-elevated-road-plan-awaits-nod/article38095773.ece

Mr. Malik’s fresh salvo at the Central agency comes days after the NCB approached the Bombay High Court to cancel the bail granted to his son-in-law Sameer Khan in a drugs case.  Speaking in Mumbai, the Minister released two audio clips, one of a conversation purportedly between an NCB officer calling a panch to sign back-dated papers related to a case. The second clip allegedly detailed a phone call between the panch and NCB’s Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede, whose tenure ended on December 31.   “There seems to be no end to the NCB’s crooked activities going by the manner in which the agency’s officers have created bogus cases by getting signatures from witnesses on blank papers to frame people. And now, to set those cases right, they are calling witnesses to sign on back-dated panchnama papers,” alleged Mr. Malik, saying he will move the courts in this matter.  Mr. Malik has been training his guns on the NCB, especially Mr. Wankhede, since the Aryan Khan-Cordelia cruise case of October 2 last year. The NCP Minister has kept up a stream of allegations against Mr. Wankhede and the NCB accusing the Central agency of running “a private army” and indulging in extortion business in Mumbai city, while remarking that the Aryan Khan was “no drug bust case” but one of “kidnap and ransom”. The Minister has claimed that his son-in-law, who was later released on bail, was being deliberately singled out to put pressure on him but that he would not bow and would continue to “expose falsehoods” of NCB officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-end-to-ncbs-crooked-activities-malik/article38095736.ece

CM||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said that he is ready to contest as an MLA candidate in the upcoming Assembly election in the State on whichever seat is deemed suitable by the BJP. He said this during an interaction with reporters in Lucknow on January 1 evening. “I am ready to fight Assembly poll, from Gorakhpur, Ayodhya, whichever seat the party thinks is suitable,” he is reported to have said. Currently, Mr. Adityanath is a member of the Uttar Pradesh legislative Assembly, which he had assumed after being made Chief Minister and after resigning his Lok Sabha seat of Gorakhpur in 2017. Sources close to Mr. Adityanath said that the statement was in a manner of throwing down the gauntlet to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav who had announced in November that he would not be contesting Assembly seats while helming his party’s poll campaign. Mr. Yadav is the Lok Sabha member from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh. “This declaration by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath shows that he is confident of victory, and is not afraid of any attempts to tie him down to his seat during the campaign for the poll,” said a close aide to the Chief Minister. Election is scheduled early this year despite the looming threat of a third wave of Omicron variant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ready-to-contest-from-any-seat-my-party-mandates-up-cm/article38095744.ece

Former Ambassador of Nepal to India Deep Kumar Upadhyay said India should begin the much required Foreign Secretary-level dialogue to resolve the lingering bilateral irritants. “From the non-delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, to the territorial problems and ensuring access of Nepalese farmers to urea, there are several issues that need to be addressed during the visit of Prime Minister Deuba to India,” he said over the telephone from Kathmandu. He said the visit, though aimed at the business summit in Gujarat, is symbolically significant as it is the first time that a PM from Kathmandu will visit following the bitter spat over the Kalapani border row that lasted over two years. Mr. Upadhyay who served as Nepal’s envoy to India during the 2015-16 blockade said, Mr. Deuba has defeated challengers within his party and is in a position to hold dialogue with India on all issues that are of bilateral importance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/deuba-visit-ideal-to-resume-india-nepal-talks-ex-envoy/article38095966.ece

The United Democratic Party (UDP) has undertaken the initiative with the belief that regional entities can address the issues and give shape to the aspirations of the State’s people better than the national parties. The UDP is the second largest constituent of the alliance government in Meghalaya headed by the National People’s Party (NPP), which earned the national party status in 2019. The UDP is also a member of the North East Democratic Alliance helmed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a minor partner in the State’s alliance government. “We need to reignite the fire of regionalism that the All Party Hill Leaders’ Conference (APHLC) had lit. For this, the regional parties need to come together,” UDP general secretary Jemino Mawthoh said. The APHLC had led the Statehood movement more than five decades ago and had formed the first government when Meghalaya was carved out of Assam as a State in January 1972. Mr. Mawthoh said some leaders had betrayed the spirit of regionalism and joined national parties such as the Congress, which ruled Meghalaya for more than 35 years. A few quit and formed other parties, the UDP being one of them. “We wanted to convene a meeting of all the regional parties but the pandemic played spoilsport. But we are not giving up on our greater goal of becoming a strong, united regional force,” he said. The UDP has already formed the Regional Democratic Alliance with the Hill State People’s Democratic Party. It hopes to bring two other regional parties — People’s Democratic Front and Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement — on board before the polls. Mr. Mawthoh asserted that a larger regional force would be in a better position to pursue issues that the Centre may not be sensitive about.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/regional-parties-in-meghalaya-eye-unification-ahead-of-2023/article38095739.ece

Mr. Badal was addressing a panthic ikath [gathering of devotees] in Amritsar to protest the incidents of sacrilege including the outrage at the sanctum sanctorum of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple).  ‘Fomenting distrust’  “Our sacred gurdhams and their unique religious ideology are being targeted. The quom [community] will have to guard against attempts by powerful agencies to create dissensions, disunity and mutual distrust within the community by using the age-old tactics of Trojan horses,” said the former Chief Minister.  Mr. Badal cautioned against the dangerous conspiracy to inflame Punjab again through communal polarisation. “The hard-earned atmosphere of peace and communal harmony is being put to the torch by powers that be. They will finally blame the flames on Punjabis themselves in a repeat of 1980s and 90s simply to further vested petty political interests,” he warned and demanded a probe into the recent sacrilege incidents by the high court. He added that the Congress had played politics and done nothing to nab those behind this heinous act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/akali-leaders-warn-of-attempts-being-made-to-weaken-sikhism/article38095748.ece
03 January 2022||New Delhi,||House panel on marriage age has only one woman MP||The Parliamentary panel assigned to examine the landmark bill which seeks to raise the legal age of marriage for women to 21 has only one woman MP out of 31 members. The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha during the winter session and referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports. The Bill, piloted by the Women and Child Development Ministry, seeks to increase the legal age of marriage from 18 to 21. According to the members’ list of the parliamentary standing committee, led by senior BJP leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, available on the Rajya Sabha website, Trinamool MP Sushmita Dev is the only woman among the 31 members. When contacted, Ms. Dev said it would have been better if there were more women MPs in the panel. “I wish there were more women MPs in the committee but having said that we will make sure all interest groups are heard,” Ms. Dev said. Echoing similar sentiments, NCP MP Supriya Sule, who has been raising women-centric issues in Parliament, said there should have been more women MPs in the panel. However, she added that the chairman has the power to invite people before the panel. So for more inclusive and wider discussions, he can invite other women MPs. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports is a Rajya Sabha administered Committee. Parties nominate members based on their strength in the House. The introduction of the Bill was opposed by some members who contended that the move infringed upon several personal laws in violation of fundamental rights and demanded that it be referred to a Parliamentary panel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/house-panel-on-marriage-age-has-only-one-woman-mp/article38095752.ece

Mr. Modi said the region has made a record contribution in ethanol production and the government was investing in food processing and storage. Free of nepotism Earlier, underlining the BJP government’s agenda to develop a strong ecosystem for sports, Mr. Modi said the government had worked to make sports free of nepotism, corruption, and official indifference and towards creating an atmosphere of transparency. Invoking the Khelo India campaign and Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), he linked the government’s policies to the country’s credible performance at the Olympics and Paralympics earlier this year. New university Aimed at fostering the Prime Minister’s vision of inculcating a sporting culture in the country, the state-of-the-art university will be established in an area covering Sailawa and Kaili villages of Sardhana town in Meerut at an estimated cost of Rs. 700 crore. Mr Modi said the university, which is expected to train at least a thousand boys and girls every year, would help in making sports a viable career choice for youth and not just an ‘extra’ discipline, saying “It will bring a sports revolution in the country.” He added that the the university would also give impetus to the sports manufacturing business in Meerut that has not only practised the credo of “vocal for local but also made the products global.” Responding to the BJP’s investment in sports, SP president Akhilesh Yadav charged the party with ruining the sports infrastructure developed by his party’s government. In a tweet in Hindi, Mr Yadav said, “The incumbent BJP government discontinued the Yash Bharti awards given to sportspersons in wrestling, cricket, athletics and hockey during the SP rule... The Delhi government should tell us how much it has invested in the sports infrastructure in the State.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-has-encouraged-real-games-modi-in-up/article38095750.ece

So, despite being the same cut-off number, their composition is different and hence, the two cannot be equated,” the committee reasoned. It found no fault in the uniform application of the Rs. 8-lakh criteria across the country. “The desirability of a uniform income-based threshold has been upheld by the Supreme Court, and it can be adopted across the country as a matter of economic and social policy,” it said. The report is the result of the Supreme Court’s repeated grilling of the government, since October, to explain how it zeroed in on the figure of ‘Rs. 8 lakh’ as the annual income criterion to identify EWS among forward classes of society for grant of 10% reservation in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) medical admissions under the All India Quota (AIQ) category. The Supreme Court’s query was significant as the One Hundred and Third Constitutional Amendment of 2019, which introduced the 10% EWS quota, is itself under challenge before a larger Bench. The Amendment is under question for making economic criterion as the sole ground for grant of reservation benefits. “The figure ensures that most low-income people who are not required to pay income tax are not excluded and are covered in EWS and at the same time it should not be so high that it becomes over-inclusive by including many incomes tax-paying middle-and high-income families into EWS,” the report reasoned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-8-lakh-income-limit-for-ews-reasonable-govt/article38095751.ece

It said if any changes in the administrative boundaries are to be made, it may be be effected latest by December 31, 2020. However, it was extended again till December 31,2021. The fresh date is June 30, 2022. Finalisation of administrative units entails covering all jurisdictional changes in an administrative area between two consecutive censuses. According to provisional data compiled by the RGI till June 2021 and accessed by The Hindu , the number of districts has gone up from 640 in 2011 to 736. The sub-districts are up from 5,925 to 6,754, statutory towns from 4,041 to 4,657, census towns from 3,892 to 5,050, but villages have decreased from 6,40,934 in 2011 to 6,39,083 in 2021.

03 January 2022||NEW DELHI,||EWS income criterion worked well: panel||The Rs. 8 lakh income criterion has worked smoothly to identify and provide Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota benefits to deserving candidates in UPSC exams, NEET-UG and JEE (Mains), separately since 2019, an expert committee report in the Supreme Court has said. The report, which is part of a government report in the court, said the committee examined the actual outcome of the EWS income criteria as applied in the past two years as “the proof of the pudding is not in the recipe but in eating”. The committee said it found that for UPSC selections (2019 and 2020), there was no obvious bunching at the top of the income criteria that would suggest exclusion of deserving lower income candidates. Further, the annual household income distribution of qualified EWS candidates for NEET-UG and JEE (Mains) for 2020 reveals that a mere 9% and 8.2% of EWS candidates were found to be in the income bracket of Rs. 5 lakh-8 lakh respectively. “The committee has come to the conclusion that the existing annual income criteria of Rs. 8 lakh is not over-inclusive,” the report said. The report said there is no evidence to show that the Rs. 8 lakh limit has led to the inclusion of undeserving candidates for the EWS quota. Proper cut-off “There is no evidence of the bunching of EWS candidates at the highest income bracket of Rs. 5 lakh -8 lakh, the current cut-off of Rs. 8 lakh is not leading to a major problem of the inclusion of undeserving candidates. Despite the fact that the bulk of the qualifying candidates is below Rs. 5 lakh, a somewhat higher threshold is needed which ensures that deserving beneficiaries affected by various factors such as income volatility, size of family, high cost of living in certain locations are not excluded,” the report said. The committee also deliberated how the process of review of EWS criteria could be managed in future. It said the traditional approach of ever more detailed multi-dimensional surveys or studies at a frequent interval alone would not be especially useful for the operation of the EWS reservation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ews-income-criterion-worked-well-panel/article38095740.ece

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 00:00 IST,||The name Ramanuja||Ramanujacharya was an avatara of Adisesha. It was his maternal uncle Thirumalai Nambi who gave him the name Ramanuja. Thiruvarangathu Amudanar, who wrote Ramanuja Nootrandadi in praise of Ramanuja, says this name Ramanuja is equal in sanctity to the recitation of the Gayatri mantra 108 times. Lakshmana was also called Ramanuja, and was an avatara of Adi Sesha. Hence, the Acharya, who was also Sesha avatara, was given this name. Vaishnava scholars have elaborated on three points to show why he was named Ramanuja, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. In Ayodhya Kanda, sarga 31, sloka 25, Lakshmana says to Rama, “ aham sarvam karishyaami ” (I will do all manner of service to you). Ramanuja, likewise, performed every task imaginable for the cause of Vedanta. His writings and teachings helped crush unfair criticism of scriptural texts and put Visishtadvaita on a firm footing. Secondly, Lord Krishna too was known as Ramanuja because he was the younger brother (anuja) of Balarama. It was for this reason that Kulasekhara Azhvar, in his Mukunda Mala, calls out to Lord Krishna as “Ramanuja, Jagatraya guro.” It is also believed that Ramanuja was born due to the blessings of Lord Parthasarathy of Thiruvallikeni, and so he was given the name Ramanuja which was also Krishna’s name. In Kali Yuga, Nammazhvar is considered an avatara of Rama. Ramanuja had great regard for this Kali Yuga Rama. It was therefore appropriate that he should be named Ramanuja — the younger brother of this Rama (Nammazhvar). Kooratazhvan wonders what would have been the fate of people like him if the name Ramanuja with four letters had not been around. The name Ramanuja is like a medicine for the disease called samsara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-name-ramanuja/article38095769.ece

Mr. Baghel briefed Ms. Gandhi on the availability of hospital beds and oxygen and assured her that Chhattisgarh was “fully prepared” to deal with any developing situation. On Sunday, the Congress-ruled State reported 279 cases but is yet to report any Omicron case. “Soniaji called up in the morning and expressed her concern,” Mr. Baghel told reporters in Raipur. He said a few cities like Raigarh and Raipur had seen a rise in the cases but no case of Omicron has been reported. Mr. Baghel appealed to the people not to press the panic button as Chhattisgarh has geared up to deal with a fresh wave. “Since many samples of COVID-19 are being sent to Odisha for genome sequencing and there is a rush out there, it is taking time.” Ms. Gandhi’s call came on a day when State Health Minister T.S. Singhdeo had called off his official engagements and gone into self-isolation following common cold and flu-like symptoms. Late in the evening, Mr. Singhdeo tweeted that he had tested positive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sonia-dials-chhattisgarh-cm-for-update/article38095781.ece
03 January 2022||NEW DELHI,||‘Malabar is the most complex naval exercise’||While the Navy gears up to hold its largest multilateral exercise ‘Milan’ at the end of February, there are requests from several countries for various formats of exercises, defence officials said, pointing out that Malabar is the most complex naval exercise India does with any other country. Meanwhile, China continues to expand its presence and assistance in the region, the latest being the delivery of Ming class diesel-electric submarine to Myanmar, its second submarine after the first one given by India. “The tempo of exercises has been very high last few years and more and more countries want to exercise with us,” one defence official said. This could see some consolidation with expansion of existing bilateral or trilateral exercises into larger formats, which could bring down the overall number while increasing the engagements, an official stated. These engagements are further amplified by the bilateral logistics agreements, Navy to Navy agreements and information sharing agreements that India has concluded with several countries. Some countries require a Navy to Navy agreement for their bureaucratic process, the official explained. India also exchanges maritime Information bilaterally with friendly foreign countries to create Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in the Indian Ocean Region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/malabar-is-the-most-complex-naval-exercise/article38095754.ece

A notification issued by the court on Saturday informed lawyers and litigants about the decision to drop the hybrid mode of hearings for the next two weeks. Prior to Christmas holidays, the court had divided the weekdays between virtual and physical hearings of cases. Mondays and Fridays were virtual hearings and Tuesdays were optional while Wednesdays and Thursdays saw physical hearings in a controlled environment though lawyers could opt to appear online.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:18 IST,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu’s borrowings 17% lower so far this financial year||Tamil Nadu’s market borrowings in the first nine months of the 2021-22 financial year have been about 17% lower than last year, amid improving revenue. The State has borrowed Rs. 52,000 crore in April-December 2021, compared with Rs. 63,000 crore in the same period during the previous financial year. The borrowings have been done through the auction of State government securities or State development loans. Revenue rebound Tamil Nadu’s revenue has rebounded after the second wave of COVID-19. Its total revenue receipts increased about 22% to Rs. 1,18,992.48 crore in April-November 2021, from Rs. 97,635.78 crore in the same period last year. The total revenue receipts collected so far amounts to 58.76% of the Rs. 2,02,495.89 crore estimated in the revised Budget for 2021-22, according to the unaudited provisional figures from the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The total revenue receipts include tax revenue, non-tax revenue, grants-in-aid and contributions. Tax revenue comes from the State’s own direct sources like the State GST, stamps and registration fees, land revenue, tax on petroleum products and revenue from liquor sales and the State’s share in the Central and other taxes and duties. The revenue receipts got a boost with the Union government devolving Rs. 3,878.38 crore to the State in November last. The State also got Rs. 8,095 crore in back-to-back GST compensation loan from the Union government for 2021-22. Tamil Nadu’s revenue expenditure stood at Rs. 1,26,862.35 crore in April-November 2021. As a result, the revenue deficit (which implies revenue expenditure which is higher than revenue receipts) stood at about Rs. 7,869.87 crore as in November 2021, lower than Rs. 10,126.14 crore posted in October 2021. For 2021-22, Tamil Nadu has put its revenue deficit at Rs. 58,692.68 crore. But Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan has said it will be reduced. Tamil Nadu has recently announced fresh restrictions amid a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases, including those of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus. Any more stringent restrictions will impact revenue collection, resulting in more borrowings. The State’s fiscal deficit (the difference between total revenue and expenditure) stood at Rs. 30,051.71 crore as in November 2021. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Telangana are the top borrowing States so far this fiscal, accounting for 65% of the total borrowings, according to CareEdge Ratings. Tamil Nadu will raise Rs. 1,000 crore on Tuesday through re-issue of State development loans with a tenure of 24 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadus-borrowings-17-lower-so-far-this-financial-year/article38096113.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 04:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Homes for poor crumbling under neglect||The recent collapse of Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board apartment block on Village Street in Tiruvottiyur has once again highlighted the problem of poor upkeep of the dwelling units in almost all places. The dwellers at the site where the building collapsed complained that very little attention was paid to maintenance, except for plastering work in a few places once in a while. While the board has initiated an assessment of all buildings that are older than 25 years, residents say the condition of buildings that are less than 25 years old is no better, mainly due to poor quality of construction and lack of maintenance. The condition of apartment blocks in places like Kannagi Nagar, Ezhil Nagar and Perumbakkam is a case in point. L. Manikandan, an autorickshaw driver and a social worker in Kannagi Nagar, says a key problem was seepage during rain and from damaged pipelines. It has been highlighted several times by many dwellers. “The quality of the construction itself was poor, to begin with. To add to that, there is no periodic maintenance by the board. There is seepage on the ceilings and floors of most tenements, which worsens their quality. In two-storey structures in Kannagi Nagar, there is seepage from the floor during monsoon,” he said. R. Mahalakshmi, who lives in a flat at a three-storey tenement in Kannagi Nagar, said the plastering was of poor quality. N. Mary, who lives on the top floor of a building in Perumbakkam, said continuous seepage has led to the plastering of the ceilings falling. “The terrace does not have a proper slope. Hence, water does not drain easily if it rains or if overhead tanks overflow. My walls and ceilings almost always remain damp,” she said. There was hardly any response to the complaints made to TNUHDB, she said. A. Veerappan, a retired Chief Engineer with the Public Works Department, said the collapse of a building that was only slightly older than 25 years and the dilapidated state of several such buildings was unacceptable. Apart from several issues related to poor construction, he said that the poor upkeep was a serious problem. Extensive maintenance was needed at least once in five years. “The residents of these tenements, who are generally poor with limited awareness, are not able to do the maintenance work by themselves or push the officials to do it,” he said. At least 5% of the board’s budget must be allocated for maintenance along with steps to ensure that the work was done periodically.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/homes-for-poor-crumbling-under-neglect/article38096092.ece

With last mile connectivity lacking from most stations, passengers use their personal transport to reach the station and then board the Metro train. According to CMRL officials, before the pandemic, nearly 1.25 lakh people were commuting daily on weekdays and this number rose to 1.30 lakh recently. This meant that the number of those bringing their personal vehicle to the station too went up, raking in more parking revenue. “Before COVID-19, we used to get around Rs. 80 lakh a month but it has now increased to a little over Rs. 1 crore. Like before, we get more number of two-wheelers than four wheelers. This is because we mostly have space only for two-wheelers at several stations,” an official said. About 14,000 vehicles, including 12,000 two-wheelers, a day were parked at Metro Rail stations. Thirumangalam station houses the maximum number of 2,000 vehicles followed by Alandur with nearly 1,800 vehicles. Vadapalani comes third, holding about 1,200 vehicles. These were the only stations to cross 1,000 vehicles; apart from these three, Koyambedu gets about 900 vehicles and Meenambakkam and Egmore about 850 and 600 vehicles respectively. In the remaining stations, parking occupancy is poor. “In some of the stations like Vadapalani, Mannady and Washermanpet we have noticed that many of the non-Metro passengers too come to park their vehicles for various reasons. At Vadapalani, they leave their vehicles here and head to the Forum Mall. At Mannady and Washermanpet, they just find it safe to park it here and head for purchases closeby,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revenue-from-metro-rail-parking-spaces-touches-rs-1-cr-a-month/article38096089.ece

Publishers are in dire straits as we could not organise book fair in the last two years. Now they have invested more money and are ready with more titles. But the pandemic has come in the way of capitalising their efforts,” said Olivannan, CEO of the Emerald Publishers. He said 70% of those who would set up stalls in the book fair were small publishers and it was the annual book fair, besides the library orders, that sustained their trade. Nagarajan of Bharathi Puthakalayam said publishers were in a financial crisis as the government was yet to release the amount for books purchased from them in the last two years. “Of course, it was purchased when the AIADMK was in power. But the responsibility lies with the State Government. It will ease the burden on publishers if the government releases the amount,” he said. Even though there is a possibility of organising the fair after the infection rate comes down, the publishers feel January is the ideal month for the event. It is normally held at a stretch of eight days. Public holidays in the month coupled with an ideal climate in Chennai always attract book lovers to Chennai. “We have decided to bring a total of 120 titles, and 90 titles have been printed and are ready for sale. Another 30 are being printed. We also have to pay for the printers,” Mr. Nagarajan said. Mr. Olivannan said the government should at least buy books from the publishers who would participate in the book fair. Kannan Sundaram of the Kalachuvadu said it was an unfortunate situation and nobody could be blamed for it. “Even those who manage the stalls can catch the virus as it is spreading fast. The government can certainly help as the organisers had already begun work for the fair and spent money,” he said.

On Monday, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin will launch vaccination for students aged 15- 18 at Manthope Girls Higher Secondary School at Saidapet. Under the drive, the State expects to cover 33.46 lakh beneficiaries, including students at juvenile homes and orphanages, Mr. Subramanian informed the Union Health Ministry at a video conference earlier in the day. He said the Health Department was coordinating with the School Education, Higher Education and Social Welfare Departments to cover all beneficiaries. “We plan to achieve 100% coverage through the drive.” The Chief Minister is expected to launch the booster shots for those aged above 60 on January 10 at Sir Pitty Thyagaraya Hall at T.

Effective January 1, the price of one 19 kg commercial LPG cylinder has been reduced by Rs. 100. “Last month they had hiked the price of commercial cylinder by Rs. 130 each. And since last year, the price of cylinder used by restaurants and tea shops had almost doubled. This relief therefore comes only as a small comfort. However, we are headed towards the third COVID-19 wave and already seating has been reduced in restaurants to 50%,” said M. Ravi, President of Chennai Hotels’ Association, who went on to say that restaurants were fixing daily menus according to the prices of vegetables. “The menu is altered every day. Due to poor arrivals, vegetable prices have remained high. If the price of one vegetable goes down, another shoots up. Similarly, the price of edible oil too has gone up. In such a scenario, the price of LPG alone being reduced will not provide us enough relief. We need a reduction in GST on LPG from 18% to 5%,” he said. S. Murugesan, who runs an Aavin Milk centre in East Tambaram that also sells tea, said the reduction was a welcome one. “A further reduction would only help small vendors like me. I have been selling tea at Rs. 10 a cup since I stand to lose customers if I hike the price. Like others, I hope the price of LPG would go down even further,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fall-in-lpg-price-brings-minor-relief-to-hoteliers/article38096101.ece

Ranjith, Neelam Publications has produced a compilation on Dalit and Dravidian thinker Iyothee Thass Pandithar. Edited by Dalit historian Stalin Rajangam, the book will be made available in the market from January 6. The work has 29 articles by 28 renowned scholars and budding writers. While Dalit political parties have always projected Iyothee Thass as a Dalit icon, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin also recently announced that the State government would build a memorial for him. Tamil nationalist parties such as Naam Tamilar Katchi have also recently recognised him for his contributions towards understanding Tamil history and culture. Mr. Rajangam said the volume, to be published to commemorate 175th birth anniversary of Iyothee Thasar, would be divided into four parts, each dealing with a particular aspect of his life and work. History and culture “I have not focused too much on his political thought as much of it has already been done. This volume will focus on his ideas on history and culture. A number of renowned scholars like V. Geetha, A.R. Venkatachalapathy, G. Balasubramaniam, Gnana Aloysius, T. Dharmaraj have contributed,” he said. The first part focuses on his thoughts and ideas, second on his political action, third deals with the impact of his actions and fourth will feature research by those who have not studied or researched him but have arrived at similar historical conclusions as Iyothee Thasar. The work will also feature a play, short story and poems based on his thoughts. “Iyothee Thasar’s political ideas are out in the public. However, his cultural and historical ideas and conclusions have come in for sharp criticism. It has been said that much of what he has said is just fiction and there is no historical evidence for it. This is an attempt to address such criticism,” said Mr. Rajangam. “It is important to understand his ideas and historical methodologies and reclaim him as a thinker and not just contain him as a political icon by erecting statues and photographs,” he said.

Banners have been placed at several parlours and social media campaign has been stepped up. Those buying milk through monthly consumer cards stand to save Rs. 3 a litre and Rs. 2 a litre on toned milk (blue packet) and standarised milk (green magic) respectively. This would translate to a saving of Rs. 90 or Rs. 60 a month and all it requires is a valid ID proof, not necessarily Aadhaar card, said an official. The Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, which owns Aavin brand, recently launched a facility where people can apply for fresh cards online on its website. “Not just via the website, people can buy cards at all our hi-tech parlours. This will be apart from the facility to buy new cards or renew existing cards at zonal offices, which is the usual practice,” said another official. In case of those who apply for new cards or renew online, Aavin would send the transaction ID to the respective booth and in case there is a mismatch, the personnel at the booth would send back details for making changes in the system. The card system in the city was started over 40 years ago and has been expanded to other cities including Coimbatore, Madurai and Tiruchi.

Palaniswami on Sunday urged the Tamil Nadu Government to announce relief to the affected farmers. In a statement, Mr. Palaniswami urged the government to depute officials of the Agriculture Department to visit areas affected by the rain for assessing the damage and losses incurred by farmers so that relief could be announced. Mr. Palaniswami also insisted that the government should open direct procurement centres in the necessary areas. The former Chief Minister urged the government to ensure that farmers, who had registered for crop insurance, receive their claims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/give-relief-to-rain-hit-farmers-palaniswami/article38096115.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:18 IST,TAMIL NADU||It’s back to online lessons for students of Classes 1-8||For many schools in the State, it is back to online classes from Monday when a new set of COVID-19 restrictions come into effect. Under the new norms, in-person classes are not allowed for children in up to Class VIII till January 10. Schools had reopened for senior classes in Tamil Nadu from September 2021, and for primary and middle school classes from November 1 following a prolonged break owing to the pandemic. The new restrictions and concerns over the Omicron variant have meant that most private schools are gearing up to begin online classes from January 3 till the restrictions are in force. “We have already worked on a timetable which will be followed this week and parents have been suitably informed. Teachers are also being given the option to work from home since they will have access to faster internet connections than on the school premises where several teachers need to conduct classes at the same time,” said K. Manoharan, Principal, SBOA School and Junior College. He said it was important at this stage for schools to take safety aspects seriously and that they were working on ensuring that standard operating procedures are strictly adhered to by students of senior classes and staff members who will continue to be on the premises. Schools with a big strength of children in Classes I to VIII opted for a mixed learning module and had implemented shift systems — where classes were taking place both online and offline. “These schools will now revert to having classes online alone. Many schools like ours already had a timetable in place anticipating changes in the academic year and we will now enforce an online-only timetable for Classes I to VIII,” said Lakshmi Prabha, Principal, Prasan Vidya Mandir. As far as the teachers were concerned, Ms. Prabha said that schools would take a decision based on the internet connectivity and infrastructure available on the premises. Some private schools in the State which had not reopened for primary and middle school classes in November were now considering continuing with online classes for the month. Government school teachers, however, are concerned that students might once again face the impact of possible learning loss. The Tamil Nadu Teacher Association submitted a representation to the School Education Department and the Chief Minister. In its petition, the association said the schools should at least explore adopting a micro classroom model so that children could attend in-person classes at least once or twice a week in small batches. “Primary and middle school students were just starting to settle down, getting midday meals and getting motivated about attending schools. We will not be able to take online classes for students since many of them do not have access to good internet connections or devices,” said association president P.K. Ilamaran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/its-back-to-online-lessons-for-students-up-to-class-8/article38096051.ece

The Government Order issued in this regard cites the problems in collecting the maintenance charges, now fixed at either Rs. 750 or Rs. 250 depending on the buildings, and aims to transfer the responsibility to collect these charges to the RWAs. According to the order, the government will henceforth provide a matching grant every quarter equivalent to the total maintenance charges collected by the RWAs in the respective quarter and not more than that to fill any gap in the budget needed. According to the order, while routine maintenance and minor repair works are to be carried out by the funds collected by the residents welfare associations, major repair work and charges towards water supply and electricity for common areas will be met from the contribution of the board. Any additional infrastructure needed will be provided with equal contribution from the Board and the RWAs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-associations-to-be-formed/article38096093.ece

Thirumavalavan on Sunday unveiled a statue of Dr. Ambedkar’s in Kanigiri, Ongole district, Andhra Pradesh. The move is seen as an effort to take his party beyond Tamil Nadu. Party leaders said the VCK was seeking to venture into southern States where it felt the Leftist movement that had articulated the aspirations of Dalit people “diluted” over the years. According to VCK general secretary and Kattumannarkoil MLA Sinthanai Selvan, the party has presence in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana too. “Except in Munnar district, we do not have a presence in Kerala. But, in Telangana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, we have a presence and we have contested local body elections and supported other parties there,” he said. In his view, former cadres of the Leftist movement, which has had a strong support from the Dalit and other disadvantaged communities, “are now seeing VCK as an alternative”, apart from the Congress party. “The Congress gets a lot of support from the Dalits in these States as they raise Dalit issues. But, even they dilute the issues some times. So there is now a need for a strong Dalit party in these States. We are aspiring to be that voice,” said Mr. Selvan. Asked how a party that strongly reiterates the idea of Tamil nationalism can reach out to people who speak another language, Mr. Selvan contended, “Our Tamil nationalism is not based on a person’s DNA. It is about reiterating federal rights and regional aspiration within India.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vck-aspires-to-venture-beyond-tamil-nadu/article38096083.ece

The city is the main hub for the manufacture of grinders in the country. R. Soundarakumar, president of the Coimbatore Wet Grinders and Accessories Manufacturers’ Association, said the wet grinder manufacturers in Coimbatore, who supply not only within the State but also to other States, need about 30,000 stones a month. Those who make table top wet grinders source the stones from Namakkal, and those who make the ordinary and commercial grinders get the stones from Uthukuli. However, for almost six months now, the quarries in Uthukuli have been shut, and the issue is in the court. Hence, the manufacturers here are unable to get stones from the quarries in Uthukuli. It is not just the wet grinder manufacturing industries that are struggling. Several stone grinder manufacturers in the unorganised sector are also unable to continue business. Some are now sourcing stones from quarries near Edayarpalayam. However, these are not high quality stones like those from Uthukuli, and the volume is not much. “A large number of units have remained shut for the last six months because of this issue,” he said. The loss is estimated to be between Rs. 200 crore and Rs. 300 crore, and supplies to other cities and States from the wet grinder units here have come to a standstill. The Association had taken up the issue with the State government, too. Paneerselvam, a wet grinder manufacturer, said some manufacturers were reusing the stones. Fresh stones are not available and the manufacturers have been hit, especially during the last two months. “Almost 40% of the manufacturers here make the ordinary wet grinders and all these units are affected,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/non-availability-of-stone-hits-wet-grinder-manufacturers/article38096117.ece

According to police sources, activists S. Ganesh, R. Ramesh and Mohanraj alias Mac Mohan along with a girl and a boy visited a brick chamber that has not been functioning for nearly a year. The team reached around 2 p.m. and allegedly used a drone camera to capture the aerial view of the chamber. Seeing the drone camera, one of the labourers inside the premises alerted the brick kiln owner and gathered the residents of neighbouring villages, police said. As the verbal altercation between the two sides intensified, one of the activists allegedly attacked a resident with a helmet, the police said. The resident suffered an injury above his left eyebrow and he was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. Following this, the Thadagam police rushed to the spot and picked up the group of five for inquiry. Nearly 200 residents of the villages in Thadagam valley gathered outside the Thadagam police station around 5 p.m. demanding action against the activists. Later, Deputy Superintendent of Police (Periyanaickenpalayam) Rajapandian held talks with the residents. As per a direction from the Madras High Court issued in 2021, the Coimbatore district administration had ordered the closure of all brick kilns that were operating in five village panchayats in the valley namely Chinna Thadagam, Nanjundapuram, Veerapandi, Pannimadai and Somaiyampalayam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tension-after-activist-attacks-resident-in-thadagam-valley/article38096158.ece

As in an election year with regime change, 2021 was a year with two phases for the CCMC – one prior to election and two, after a new government assumed office. Until May 2021, the Corporation continued to chart the course that it had taken in the years earlier – execution of projects taken up under the Smart Cities Mission and continuation of the fight against COVID-19. After a new government took charge and change of guard at the Coimbatore Corporation – civil servant Raja Gopal Sunkara took charge in June last year – things started to turn around. One of the important decisions that the Corporation took was to make public the resolutions that the Corporation Council took in the previous four years or so. This not only brought in transparency into the administration but also addressed concerns of activists and concerned citizens. Prior to May 2021, the Corporation had kept under wraps the Council resolutions and also stymied efforts to have them revealed through Right to Information Act petitions. The period the Corporation had shown reluctance in making public the resolutions was when the commissioners had the Council’s powers as an elected council was not in place. It was also the period that the Corporation took decisions with huge financial implications. Post June 2021, the Corporation cancelled several projects – those that were at the planning stage, tender stage and contract finalisation stage. In cancelling the projects, the Corporation also admitted, perhaps for the first time, that its finances were weak, and it owed over Rs. 100 crore to contractors for works completed. Over July, August, September and October the CCMC continued to cancel projects, as revealed in Council resolutions that it regularly disclosed. The second half of 2021 also saw a few heads roll in the CCMC. After the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption raided the houses of a few engineers as a part of investigation into corruption case, the State Government transferred five top engineers by giving postings to three and leaving in lurch two engineers. On the question of development, the Corporation made progress in the lake improvement projects it had taken up under the Smart Cities Mission, improved the pace of execution of the 24x7 drinking water supply improvement project, underground sewerage scheme in Kurichi and Kuniamuthur and moved towards finalising the specifications of the water supply improvement project in added areas. The year also saw the Corporation bring in discipline among its employees, particularly among conservancy workers and contract labourers. It also took proactive measures like organising a competition for bill collectors to rate them on their efficiency in tax collection. In 2022, the Corporation has set its focus on two big ticket projects – the pending integrated bus stand project in Vellalore and the recently announced Semmozhi Poonga in Gandhipuram. In addition, the CCMC has the usual challenges to address – bad roads, faulty street lights, piling garbage and poor waste management system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/2021-a-year-of-course-correction-and-consolidation-for-coimbatore-corporation/article38096160.ece

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 04:34 IST,TAMIL NADU||‘Previous govt. developed only a few parts of Coimbatore’||The previous AIADMK government developed only one or two pockets in the city and ignored most others, Electricity Minister V. Senthilbalaji said here on Sunday. The then government had claimed that in five years Coimbatore had witnessed the kind of development that it had not seen in the previous 50 years. But the condition of city roads was proof enough of the development, he said. His charge against the previous government was based on the complaints he had received as petitions from the public during his Makkal Sabai interaction. In 150 sittings, he had collected 1.41 lakh petitions, Mr. Senthilbalaji said. The AIADMK government had splurged on unnecessary initiatives in the city, which the present government tried to rectify. Be it the purchase of bins for Rs. 44 crore or engagement of contractors for transporting waste using lorries to Vellalore, the Corporation had not prudently spent money. And, people knew who was behind the splurge and who benefited from it. Such development had only put behind the city in development vis-a-vis other cities. AIADMK leader O. Panneerselvam had levelled allegation that the present DMK government had started levying GST on power charges. However, the Tangedco started levying GST not on power connection, but the fee collected on new application and a few other services. This had been in vogue since 2018, the Minister pointed out. It was also wrong on his part to say that the government charged farmers the meter cost for the free power connection availed. This too was a practice that had been in place since the previous government’s days.

District Industries Centre, Coimbatore, general manager B. Karthigaivasan said the entrepreneurs will focus on value addition and the cluster is expected to be inaugurated in the coming months. Industry sources said that coming up at a total cost of Rs. 23.73 crore, the cluster will focus on value addition so that the coir fibre produced in Pollachi and nearby areas is consumed by the value adding units here. A substantial quantity of fibre is getting into exports now. The Union Government grant for the cluster project will be Rs. 14 crore and from the State government it will be Rs. 2 crore. The remaining amount will be from the special purpose vehicle. The entire coir industry in Pollachi will benefit from the project. The proposal started taking shape in September 2020 and the detailed project report prepared by the special purpose vehicle was submitted to the State government. It should be approved by the Union government. The entrepreneurs will purchase land and machinery for the common facility. Some of the facilities planned at the common centre are: coir quilting with preparatory process, coir brush mat production line, coir needle punch production, coir sheets production with latex spray, making of coir tuffted mats with latex base and laboratory for coir testing. With these facilities, the coir industry in Pollachi will be able to export value added products and the fibre producers will realise better prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coir-cluster-proposed-in-pollachi/article38096150.ece

Low-lying areas in Balakrishnapuram and Surveyor Colony were waterlogged by the heavy rain. Some of the residential colonies looked like islands and rainwater also entered dwellings. The intermittent rain since Friday night continued throughout Saturday. Low-lying areas, including Bharatipuram, Mettupatti and Thirumalaisamipuram, were surrounded by rainwater and there were complaintsof waterlogging. PWD officials said Natham recorded 111 mm of rain on Sunday. Rainfall recorded in other areas (in mm) was: Nilakottai 31, Dindigul Town 102.3, Kodaikanal 6.8, Palani 24, Chatrapatti 16.2 and Kodaikanal Boat Club 49.2. Boulders rolled from a hillock on the stretch between Athur Taluk and Kodaikanal Pullaveli and blocked the road near the Murugan temple. After the highways authorities were informed, the field staff worked for over four hours following which uphill traffic resumed around 2 p.m. The roadside sand was washed away on many stretches. As a result, motorists encountered freak accidents. There were a few cases of gutter mix too in the peripheries, the residents claimed. According to the PWD officials, Moongilkulam had 80% storage after the recent rain. The sudden rainfall over the last two days added to an increase in the level. In the early hours of Sunday, a portion of the bund weakened and, as a result, the tank breached. The water gushed into the dwellings situated close to the tank and, even after five hours, it flowed into the habitations, residents claimed. The residents in Surveyor Colony said the municipal authorities had given approval to land promoters, but had not provided any basic facility. The natural calamity had exposed the poor planning and nonchalant attitude of the civic body. There were neither roads nor street lights. Even riding motorcycles at a slow speed posed a danger, said Alagarsami, a resident of Surveyor Colony. “We hope the Collector visits our colony and gives relief.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rain-hits-normal-life-in-dindigul/article38096265.ece

The minister was participating in a bhoomi puja for construction of a new bus stand at Rs. 5.90 crore at Kanniwadi special grade panchayat. Speaking on the occasion, he said that the DMK government had in the past planned to build a bus stand here for the facility of the local commuters. However, after the change in guard, the AIADMK came to power. Unfortunately, in the last 10 years, the AIADMK did nothing tangible which would benefit the poor. The DMK believed in providing infrastructural facilities not only in big cities, but also in rural pockets. Hence, after coming back to the power, works were taken up to build bus stands, markets, community centres et al, in the panchayats. The Cooperative Banks across the State would give loans to the needy at lower interest rates. For instance, people seeking loans below Rs. 3 lakh would be charged 7% and not 12%, Mr Periasami said and added that the objective of lowering the interest was not to burden the people, who are mostly from lower strata, with higher rates. Similarly, the gold loans disbursed during the earlier regime (AIADMK) had very many violations and could not be waived as announced by the previous government. Charging that the AIADMK had ruined the State in every sphere, he also said that the party had also emptied the treasury. Only during Karunanidhi’s regime, towns like Dindigul witnessed robust growth. Many educational institutions came up here and also government schools were upgraded, which helped the students from travelling to far away destinations. By enhancing the infrastructural facilities at the village and panchayat levels, discontinuing from high schools also became a thing of past. Collector S Visakan presided over the bhoomi puja function in which MLA I P Senthil Kumar and Lok Sabha MP Velusami took part.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/50168-to-benefit-from-gold-loan-waiver-scheme/article38096258.ece

Sekarbabu said on Sunday that temple land worth Rs. 1,640 crore had been recovered since the DMK returned to power. He told journalists here that the government had recovered the temple land from encroachers. Appealing to the other encroachers to quit the temple property, which belonged to the “deity”, he said the drive would continue and measures would be taken during this year itself to improve the recovered land. Asked about BJP president K. Annamalai’s charge that the State government was merely renaming the Union government’s schemes, Mr. Sekarbabu said that Tamil Nadu was receiving its share of taxes (through the Union government’s schemes). The BJP leader should support the constructive development projects. It was BJP members who were moving courts against the initiatives of his Department, he alleged. The State government permitted worship at religious places since midnight December 31, 2021, on account of New Year, proving that the DMK was not against spirituality, he said. Alternative quarters would be constructed for the personnel living with their families at the Anjaneya temple at Namakkal, besides accommodation for devotees. Mr. Sekarbabu said the plan to monetise the gold offerings to temples was being carried out under the supervision of three retired judges at three temples in accordance with court direction. Trustees would soon be appointed for these temples, and the gold would be smelted at the Union government-recognised smelting plant in Mumbai. The money thus generated would be used for the development of the respective temples and amenities for devotees. The plan would be carried out without delay at temples with hereditary trustees in accordance with court directions. Mr. Sekarbabu said steps were being taken to lay a road to the Nainamalai temple and a feasibility study was under way for operating a rope car to the Tiruchengode temple. The Minister visited various temples in the district, along with Minister for Tourism M. Mathiventhan and Namakkal Collector Shreya P. Singh. They offered worship at the Anjaneya temple, where the deity was adorned with a 1.08-lakh ‘vada malai’ on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanthi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-has-recovered-temple-land-worth-rs-1640-crore-sekarbabu/article38096082.ece

While the density of vehicles in the city has been witnessing a steady increase over the years, the limited road infrastructure is unable to handle the traffic. Residents complain that traffic violations have become more rampant by the day. Most of the cases pertain to breaking one-way rules, signal jumping and haphazard parking at several places. The one-way rule exists only on paper at Ambalathadayar Madam Street, Rangapillai Street, Kokku Park junction and Vellala Street. It is a common sight to see people driving on the wrong lane on Ambalathadyar Madam Street, residents said. The arterial Jawaharlal Nehru Street, housing several commercial establishments, is the latest addition to the list. Although there is no time restriction mentioned in the rule, drivers think they can enter the wrong lane after 10 p.m. According to S. Ashwin, a resident of VVP Nagar, people violate the rule on several one-way roads. Even though traffic signs and barricades have been installed at the Kokku Park junction, drivers, including motorists, don’t take them seriously and cause inconvenience to others.” ‘No deterrent’ Traffic police personnel are also absent at the Kokku Park junction. With no fear of being prosecuted for traffic violations, there is no deterrent to stop drivers from breaking the law. P. Devanathan of People’s Pulse, a civil society group, said several arterial roads in the Boulevard, including Mission Street and Bharathi Street have no traffic signs. “A case in point is Mission Street. Entry for four-wheelers has been restricted on a few stretches of the road, including the Jawaharlal Nehru Street junction. However, cars continue to enter the stretch in the absence of sign boards. For a first-time traveller, it is very confusing. The Traffic police should coordinate with Google Maps and map the city’s arterial roads, including one-ways for better traffic management,” he said. According to a senior police official, the traffic police have been conducting frequent drives to ensure smooth movement of vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rampant-violation-of-rules-by-drivers-on-one-way-roads-leave-puducherry-residents-in-distress/article38096549.ece

The exercise will involve administering Covaxin — the only available vaccine that has emergency use authorisation for this age segment — to an estimated 85,000 children by deploying teams from primary health centres to the schools. The target population is based on the estimates provided by the Education Department, and pertains to children in the 15-17 age group born in or before 2007. Those aged 18 are already being covered under the Covishield vaccination regime for the 18-44 age segment, health officials said. Chief Minister N. Rangasamy will inaugurate the vaccination campaign at Thillaiyadi Valliammai School in Kadirkamam. "Stationing PHC teams at schools is simpler in terms of facilitating logistics, and also affords higher coverage potential. We are hoping to cover the entire target population in about two weeks,” G. Sriramulu, Director of Health, said. Both online and walk-in registration is available. The plan is to run a sustained vaccination drive, led by a network of 39 PHCs, continuously, till the coverage is complete by Pongal, or at least till the missed-out candidates are restricted to school drop-outs or those who are long-term absentees for specific reasons. The Health Department has received 83,000 Covaxin doses, which would help meet the target, Dr. Sriramulu said. Meanwhile, the roll-out of the booster shots of Covishield is set to start on January 10. It is targeted at healthcare personnel, frontline workers and vulnerable people above 60 years of age with co-morbid conditions. The administration has over one lakh doses of Covishield in its cold chain reserves for rolling out booster shots. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has calibrated the COVID-19 vaccination guidelines based on expert advice in the wake of the Omicron threat. Under the Ministry guidelines, prioritisation and sequencing of the “precaution dose” will be based on the completion of 9 months, or 39 weeks, from the date of administering the second dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schoolchildren-to-get-covid-jabs-from-today/article38096544.ece

The patents, granted under the Patents Act, 1970, will have a validity of 20 years, a press note from the university said. One of the patented works, ‘Preparation of Luminescent Nanocrystalline Indium-tin-oxide (ITO)’ by Mr. Thilakan and a team of researchers at the Department of Green Energy Technology deals with the preparation of ITO nanocrystalline active light emitting layers. As of now, the LED bulb manufacturing utilises the light emitted from the Gallium Nitride (GaN) that falls into the UV-A band width of emission, which is further converted into white light by phosphors. This white light is reported with poor colour vision called as colour rendering index (CRI). The capable emission wavelength of ITO found in the UV-B was around 280-315 nm with the potential to improve the coloured vision. In this patent, the methodology for the preparation of defect free ITO nano crystallites capable of emission at the room temperature was invented. Application of nano crystallites for the LED fabrication is expected to emit the white light having more colour rendering index, the university said. The other patent, ‘Preparation of wide band TiO2 Antireflection coating for Silicon Solar Cells’ by the team led by Mr. Thilakan involves a process for the preparation and deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles on the etch-optimized p-type silicon substrates suitable for solar cell fabrication. Solar cell is a current generator and its capacity is directly proportional to the absorbed number of photons with the energy capacity greater or equal to the bandgap of the semiconductor used. Hence, any loss of photon by reflection is the loss of output. Till now, the silicon solar cell reported with the highest efficiency of 25.0 ± 0.5% results in the reflection losses of about 16% in the UV illumination. Using the patented process for the optimisation of the surface of p-Silicon substrate, the preparation and deposition of TiO2 nanocrystal line layers results in flat band antireflection from the UV wavelength to the band edge wavelength of silicon. This combination of nano TiO2/textured silicon results in the reflection of incident light less than 10% in the UV range, which is less than the reflection of the best silicon solar cell reported so far, the university press note said.  The patents, granted under the Patents Act, 1970, will have a validity of 20 years||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pondicherry-universitys-associate-professor-granted-two-patents/article38096546.ece

Speaking on the occasion, senior CPI (M) leader and former MLA K. Balabharathi said crimes against girls and women were on the rise and the need of the hour was to prevent them. While the government was doing its part, people should be vigilant and bold to face the challenges. Police and the judiciary should punish the criminals without any delay. Similarly, social organisations and activists had a crucial role to play in preventing girls from falling prey. She said outfits such as SFI, AIDWA and DYFI must be pro-active in cases involving child marriage, female infanticide, abuse of teenage girls and humiliation of women for dowry. Society should be saved from the culprits. Ms. Balabharati also touched upon the ills of drugs and the consequences of addiction to narcotics. Though there was exclusive wings in the police, the prevention was not encouraging. Likewise, punishment and conviction rate too was far from satisfactory. Smugglers used Tamil Nadu as a passage to carry drugs from different destinations. According to data released recently, the State stood third in the country in narcotics smuggling. The educated youth should play a pro-active role in disseminating the consequences of falling prey to drugs. The mini-marathon began from the Collectorate and passed through Bharathi Nagar and Old Bus Stand and reached the new bus stand. Other speakers lauded the youth for participating in large numbers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/activists-have-crucial-role-to-play-in-preventing-crime-against-women/article38096262.ece

Its president P.Maniarasan recalled that in 1998, the then Minister for Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture M. Tamizhkudimagan, who was also the Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Board, issued a directive to the Executive Officers of temples to ensure that the priests recited ‘archanai’ in Tamil, if the devotees preferred it over Sanskrit. However, after the present DMK government led by M.K. Stalin took over, the State administration billboards appeared in temples, directing devotees preferring Tamil ‘archanai’ to call a particular person whose mobile phone number was given. ‘No option for devotees’ Devotees were left with no option but to contact him. They either had to wait till his arrival or leave without the recital of ‘archanai’ in Tamil. So, the earlier practice of recital of ‘archanai’ in Tamil at all times must be restored, Mr. Maniarasan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restore-tamil-archanai-at-temples/article38096250.ece

Shallots and onions are grown in vast extent of lands in Kovilpatti, Ettayapuram, Vilathikulam, Kulathur and Pudur, among other areas, next to Oddanchatram, Thuraiyur and Perambalur. They were raised on close to one lakh acres of land here. Farmers sowed the seeds during the second week of Tamil month Purattasi and were waiting for harvest now. “This has been the practice followed from time immemorial by our grandparents and forefathers,” said Mr. Varadarajan. However, when the produce was just waiting for harvest, sudden rain over the last two days resulted in inundation of many fields. The rainwater could not be drained. As a result, the shallots got soaked in water. The farmers had spent Rs. 15,000 per acre in the last 75 days. The State government had announced Rs. 4,000 as relief to farmers for loss of crops during the November 2021 rainfall but the agriculture department officials did not include the farmers who had raised shallots and chillies, he said. Farmers were keen on raising sunflower, blackgram and algae lentils in other parts of the district during the Rabi crop season. The change in rain pattern had spoiled the standing crops, farmers in Vilathikulam said and added that usually 4 to 6 quintals would be harvested from an acre while they could hardly harvest one quintal this season. They said that they had spent Rs. 12,000 an acre to raise blackgram crops. This time, the yield was also not encouraging. After the November’s northeast monsoon fury, the district had no rain during December, which came as a big relief. However, rainfall in the last two to three days in many parts of Thoothukudi district caused agony to farmers. Pockets including Vilathikulam recorded 12 mm of rainfall followed by Kadambur 10, Ettayapuram 9.3, Kadalkudi, Kovilpatti, Kazhugumalai, Kayathar and Vaipar 1 mm during the last 24 hours ending at 6 a.m. on Sunday. The State government should not neglect the woes of farmers and provide relief to them without any delay, said the farmers from several areas in Thoothukudi district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/onion-farmers-suffer-losses-due-to-change-in-weather-pattern/article38096260.ece

The drive, which will begin on January 3, entails inoculating children in this age group with Covaxin at schools itself. The registration process for vaccinating the children against COVID-19 on the CoWin portal began on January 1. However, children willing to do it on the spot, with parental consent, too, can get the jab. This initiative comes at a time when the fear of the spread of a new variant of COVID-19, Omicron, looms large. Deputy Director of Health Services A. Subramani said that around 1,26,800 children in the district were the target group for the drive. “The target number includes students studying at vocational training institutes,” he said. The number was arrived at in consultation with the School Education department. A total of 75,000 doses of Covaxin were available to inoculate the students and more will be allotted as the need arises. Each of the 16 blocks in the district will have anywhere between one to three health teams, consisting of nurses and doctors to vaccinate the students. “The team will go from one school to another; the students or their parents will not have to travel anywhere to get the dose,” Dr. Subramani said. A total of 45 such teams had been formed. Districts with a larger number of schools would be given priority. A meeting was organised with the Departments of School Education and Social Welfare and Integrated Child Development Services. “While many students have registered through CoWin, we will also be permitting walk-ins as many would not have access to the internet,” a health official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/children-aged-between-15-and-18-to-be-vaccinated-from-today/article38096246.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:23 IST,TAMIL NADU||Fresh restrictions come as a jolt to hospitality industry in Tiruchi||Fresh restrictions imposed by the State government on conduct of business by restaurants and bakeries in view of the spread of Omicron and Delta variants of COVID-19 have jolted the hospitality industry which has been on the path of revival. Restaurants and eateries were among the worst hit in the impact of two complete lockdowns in 2020 and 2021. Almost all restaurants in Tiruchi remained closed for about six months in 2020 and they could not operate fully for about three months in 2021. While a few of them operated with takeaway (parcel) service, others downed their shutters citing unviable business atmosphere. It forced the restauranteurs to lay off their employees. After incurring huge losses for several months on account of monthly rent, electricity and maintenance, the restaurants, eateries and bakeries began to operate on a full scale from October. Just at a time when the business was looking up, the announcement on permitting only 50% of seats in restaurants and bakeries has put brakes on the recovery path. In compliance of the government announcement, most of the leading and well-established restaurants in Chathiram Bus Stand, Central Bus Stand, Srirangam, Thillai Nagar and Woraiyur have altered their seating arrangements. Dining tables with four seats now have only two. Nearly 50% of chairs have been removed so as to comply with the stipulated space norms. The restaurant owners feel that this restriction will hit the business for sure. “We have no other option but to follow all rules and regulations. We have been facing enormous pressure on various fronts since March 2020 due to several restrictions. We are yet to see normality in business. The new restrictions will only add pressure,” says K.R.V. Ganesan, promoter of Ashwin Sweets, that operates a chain of sweet, bakery and restaurants in Tiruchi. Decline in patronage A cross section of restaurant operators say the patronage of the public has already come down. Many are in a state of confusion on retaining the present workforce and the quantity of food to be prepared. “In normal times, we can predict the sales volume and prepare the right quantity of food items. The travel restrictions and advisory will make it difficult to predict the business now. Those who make wrong calculations will suffer huge losses,” says a manager of another restaurant chain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fresh-restrictions-come-as-a-jolt-to-hospitality-industry/article38096242.ece

Vineeth has ordered the doctor to return the money that she allegedly accepted for treating the same patient at a private hospital. P. Premalatha, Joint Director of Medical and Rural Health Services for Tiruppur district, said on Sunday that the order was issued in the last week of December 2021. The Health Department would follow up on whether the woman doctor had returned the money and action would be initiated if she failed to do so as per the directions of the Collector, Dr. Premalatha said. The controversy involved Maruthamuthu of Karatholuvu near Madathukulam alleging on social media platforms that his pregnant wife was admitted at Udumalpet GH in September 2021, where the doctors diagnosed that the foetus had died. The woman doctor, who was working at the GH, allegedly did not provide the required treatment to remove the foetus for four days. He then admitted his wife to a private hospital in Udumalpet, where the same doctor, who worked as a consultant there, carried out the procedure and accepted fees of Rs. 37,000. Revenue Divisional Officer (Udumalpet) C. Geetha carried out an inquiry on this allegation and had submitted the report to Mr. Vineeth in October 2021. Dr. Premalatha said the woman doctor had been transferred to the Nilgiris district and the issue had been escalated to the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services for further action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruppur-collector-orders-govt-doctor-to-return-money-to-patient/article38096171.ece

Accompanied by M. Pratap, Additional Collector, Rural Development (RD), Tiruvannamalai Collector B. Murugesh met Public Works and Highways Minister E.V. Velu and Rural Development Minister K.R. Periyakaruppan on Sunday after achieving the record. “We created the farm ponds before the onset of northeast monsoon. They helped us conserved excess rainwater during the last two months,” said Mr. Murugesh. Between August and September last year, the district administration roped hundreds of women workers for the purpose. In early September, the workforce created 1,121 farm ponds in 541 villages at a cost of Rs. 19.96 crore. Paddy is the major crop in most of these villages. Ragi, maize, red gram, groundnut, banana, cotton and tapioca are also cultivated in the district that has cultivable land of 28,751 hectares. Built at a cost of Rs. 1.78 lakh, each pond is 72 feet long, 32 feet wide and five feet deep with a storage capacity of 3.63 lakh litres of water. In other words, 40.69 crore litres of water can be stored in these 1,121 ponds during monsoon. The Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Agriculture and Horticulture Departments were involved in the work, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruvannamalai-creates-1121-farm-ponds-in-a-month/article38096112.ece

Raja here recently. Mr. Raja was among the special invitees to the event in which the Nilgiri Documentation Center (NDC) released a special calendar commemorating the colonial survey of the Nilgiris plateau by British administrator John Sullivan was released. He said that he would urge Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to form a committee comprising Ministers from various departments to look into the schemes that can be implemented in the district in 2022. The MP also said that the district was unique in that there was no caste or religious discrimination like in other parts of the country. “Across the world, division of labour exists, but only in India, there is a division of labourers. For example, in other parts of the world, a carpenter is only a carpenter till he switches profession. Here, a carpenter and his sons will be carpenters forever. Even if a person passes a civil services exam and becomes a Collector, he will still be known by his caste,” said Mr. Raja. Forest Minister K. Ramachandran said consultations are being held for opening up more areas across the State for “sustainable, eco-tourism.” The government is also working towards increasing forest cover from 23% to 33%, he said. Project Director of the Special Area Development Programme Monika Rana said that the mandate of the scheme had expanded with a focus towards preserving hill districts through sustainable models of development not only to preserve biodiversity, but also to ensure water security for surrounding districts in Tamil Nadu. Venugopal Dharmalingam, honorary director of NDC, submitted a list of demands to the Minister and to Mr. Raja to elevate the Nilgiris as an international tourist destination. He also formally joined the DMK on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/committee-to-evolve-schemes-for-the-nilgiris-mooted/article38096154.ece

The number of murders reported in the district doubled in 2021, from seven the previous year, to 14 incidents. Causing further concern was the increase in the number of reported crimes of sexual harassment and assault, with the number of cases increasing from 63 in 2020 to 80 this year for which 114 persons accused of the crimes were arrested in 2021. The police said that they conducted 687 camps at schools and colleges to encourage victims of such crimes to come forward and register their complaints, which could partly explain the increase in the number of reported incidents.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:24 IST,TAMIL NADU||Congress MP raps Centre for ‘stepmotherly treatment’ to T.N.||Congress MP B. Manickam Tagore on Sunday said the Centre’s stepmotherly treatment of Tamil Nadu continued with non-announcement of Madurai airport as an international terminal and failure to set up a NEERI branch at Karaikudi to help the fireworks industry. Talking to reporters here, Mr. Tagore said he welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Virudhunagar on January 12. He would be the second Prime Minister after Rajiv Gandhi to visit the district.. The Centre had a wrong perception of the fireworks industry. “I hope the PM’s visit to Virudhunagar changes that perception and helps in protecting the industry that is on the verge of extinction,” he contended. Mr. Tagore wanted the Centre to consider the long-pending demand for a flyover at Padanthal junction at Sattur near Virudhunagar Collectorate and two road overbridges at Tiruthangal and Satchiyapuram in Sivakasi. The Prime Minister laid the foundation for AIIMs in Madurai in 2019. But now, the Centre claimed that the medical facility woud come up by 2026. “Whenever we ask the Centre about AIIMS, the reply that it will come up only if there are funds from Japanese International Cooperation Agency. It is as if we need to ask the Japanese government about this,” he quipped. Stating that the previous Congress-led UPA Government brought in international flight services to Madurai, connecting the temple city with Dubai in 2012 and Colombo in 2013. “Since last year, the demand has been to declare Madurai as an international terminal. But, the Centre has not shown the same interest like it did in the case of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.” The Prime Minister, who would land at Madurai airport, should declare it as an international airport, and a NEERI branch at Karaikudi would help the fireworks industry get easy access to its office for obtaining green crackers certificate. On the AIADMK’s claim that the inauguration of 11 government medical colleges on January 12 was its achievement, Mr. Tagore said the medical colleges were coming up due to a policy decision and with taxpayers money. He took a dig at former AIADMK Minister Rajenthra Bhalaji for absconding in a cheating case instead of facing it legally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-mp-raps-centre-for-stepmotherly-treatment-to-tn/article38096238.ece

Of the four lakh engineering students, 46% had received the first dose and 12% the second dose. With the Union government modifying the protocol for hospital admission, those infected after completing the two-dose regimen would henceforth be advised home quarantine. Persons with symptoms would be admitted to COVID-19 Care Centres and those with serious health conditions alone would be hospitalised, Mr. Subramanian said. Currently those infected with the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus undergo swab tests on the third day of admission to hospital and again on the fifth day. If they test negative both times, they are discharged and advised treatment at home. UK protocol The Health Department has proposed a protocol followed by the United Kingdom. Under this, patients with the Omicron variant are monitored virtually. They are provided with pulse oximeter and told to jot down their oxygen levels in a notebook. If the level falls below 92, they are advised to visit a hospital. “We are monitoring the situation, and if cases increase, those fully vaccinated, if infected, will be brought under such a system of surveillance. A district-level committee of health officials will monitor the patients virtually,” he said. More beds He said the Health Department had put up 100 beds at Injambakkam and Manjambakkam. At Chennai Trade Centre, it was proposed to put up 800 beds, and housing board facilities would have 2,000 beds. On Monday, the Higher Education Department and the Director of Collegiate Education would hold a meeting to get the hostels vacated and beds installed there. Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said there are 4.59 lakh students in the 15-18 age group that must be vaccinated. The civic body opened telephone numbers that would operate round the clock at Ripon Building. People under home quarantine could dial 044-25384520 and 044-46122300 for assistance from doctors, Mr. Bedi said.

M. Raja Tiruchi   Reappearance of COVID-19 in the form of highly- transmissible Omicron variant seems to have a bearing on the gaps in vaccination drive what with a significant number of people displaying a lackadaisical attitude. Since Omicron has been reported to be highly transmissible causing an exponential growth in cases, it should be prevented with extra measures. Mandatory testing and quarantine should be made compulsory for all international passangers. The civic bodies should play a pivotal role to improve screening and monitoring of Covid patients, and the vaccination process should be speeded up. Above all, people should cooperate with the government by strictly adhering to Covid protocols to keep Omicron at bay. R.

But the Congress, which has only four members, “is trying to engineer defections and buy our members” and some Independents also. “This is not acceptable,” he said at a party meeting in Mugalkhod village in Belagavi district on Sunday. “I would like to warn the Congress that if anyone tries to mess with our members, we will take strict action against them. I will make sure that not just those Congress members but even their family members will be sent to jail,’’ the former police officer said. Mr. Rajeev was a Police Inspector before he entered politics. The leader, who hails fromm Davangere district, resigned from his post and stayed back in Kudchi to defeat the incumbent MLA Sham Ghatage in 2017. “I will throw out such people from the constituency like garbage. I will not have proved myself as a MLA if I don’t do that,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-trying-to-engineer-defection-in-mugalkhod/article38096304.ece

We will hold a meeting of officers and experts, discuss the intensity of the spread and then decide on the need for tough rules,” he told journalists at the airport in Sambra. “We know that cases are rising in Delhi and Mumbai and also in other parts of Maharashtra. Bengaluru has also seen cases rising. We are watching the situation. We will see how the wave moves and how the virus spreads and among whom. We will elicit opinion of experts before reaching a decision for Bengaluru,” he said. Clarifying on a statement by Revenue Minister R. Ashok about a possible lockdown to stop the spread of the virus, the Chief Minister said that it reflected the State’s stand that there will be no lockdown if the people cooperated. “If the public acts in accordance with the present rules of night curfew and restricted public gatherings, then there is no need for a lockdown. This is our stand and Mr. Ashok has spoken about it. It is like a preliminary statement that describes the situation,” the Chief Minister said. He did not react to a straight question on whether there will be a lockdown if public cooperation is “less than satisfactory”. “We are preparing for a situation where cases may rise suddenly. We are asking hospitals in taluks, districts and in Bengaluru to prepare for oxygen supply to COVID-19 wards. Technicians have been asked to test oxygen plants and supply tubes, cylinders and other machinery. All hospitals have been asked to place indents for purchase and supply of medicine. We are adding 4,000 ICU beds to the pool of available beds in hospitals. We are also stepping up vigil in the borders. Strict checking on the borders may cause inconvenience to commuters. But these steps are necessary for the general well being of the public,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-decide-on-tough-rules-in-bengaluru-in-a-day-or-two-bommai/article38096305.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:53 IST,KARNATAKA||No implementation of welfare schemes in city since 2018||Senior citizens recently staged a protest demanding that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) restart the midday meal programme, not for children but for the elderly. Until two years ago, the civic body would provide midday meals to senior citizens in all wards. However, the programme, which came to a halt in the early days of the pandemic in 2020, has still has not been revived. The Akhila Karnataka Vayovruddhara Okkoota stated that senior citizens struggled during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns after the civic body suspended the midday meal programme. But this is not the only welfare scheme that has been suspended; many were stopped even before COVID-19 struck. According to BBMP’s senior officials, no welfare scheme has been implemented since 2018.  “Many files pertaining to welfare schemes have been pending and not approved. The schemes were all put on the back burner on account of the pandemic. Available funds were all diverted for COVID-19 management,” said a senior official, who spoke to The Hindu on condition of anonymity.  Barring a few schemes, such as reimbursement of school fees of children of pourakarmikas and ‘Onti Maney’, others such as wheelchairs for the disabled, distribution of sewing machines, laptops and tabs, and self-help programmes for women and transgender persons have not been implemented at all. “Even in ‘Onti Maney’, there have been no new sanctions. Only a few among those sanctioned earlier have been released,” the official added. Akkai Padmashali, founder of social organisation ‘Ondede’, rued the sorry state of affairs. Vulnerable communities such as senior citizens, unorganised workers, and transgender persons, did not get the due attention, especially when they needed it the most. “WhileCOVID-19 management is important, these communities suffered. If welfare schemes had been implemented, the problems of these communities would not have been severe,” she said. ‘Special grants diverted’ Venkatesh M. from Dalit Bahujan Movement — Karnataka said that apart from non-implementation of welfare schemes, special grants (24.1% grants) that should be utilised only for projects and programmes for Dalit welfare had been diverted and utilised for other purposes. The Karnataka Scheduled Castes Sub-Allocation and Tribal-Sub Allocation (Planning, Allocation, and Utilisation of Financial Resources) Act, 2013, the rules for which were notified in 2017, clearly state the purposes for which the funds have to be used. “However, we found that in Vijayanagar, funds had been used in areas where there were no Dalit habitations. In one instance, funds have been used for the upgrading of a swimming pool. We have raised objections and complained about this to the higher authorities,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-implementation-of-welfare-schemes-in-city-since-2018/article38096028.ece

They will be vaccinated across Karnataka in 4,000 sessions. In total, 31.75 lakh children will be the beneficiaries of this project in the State. At present, the State has a stock of 16 lakh doses. Officials said each district has formalised its micro-plans and logistics. Vaccination drives will take place in schools and PU colleges. Students who miss getting vaccinated on campus will be directed to nearby health centres for vaccination. The Health and Family Welfare Department in a press release said that children born in and before 2007 will be eligible for vaccination and will be administered Covaxin. Students will be administered the second dose after a span of 28 days. Students with comorbidities can get vaccinated only at a health facility under the supervision of a medical officer. The Department of Public Instruction has informed managements that schools conducting only online classes can fix a date for the vaccination programme for their students. The State government has chalked out a separate plan for school dropouts who will be mobilised to government hospitals. The Labour, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, and Urban Development Departments will work in coordination with each other. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai will inaugurate the vaccination drive at BBMP Higher Primary and Pre-University College, Bhairaveshwara Nagara, on Monday morning. Across Karnataka, the initiative will be launched in all districts by the district in-charge Ministers, while MLAs will launch the programme in all taluks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-plans-to-vaccinate-over-six-lakh-children-on-first-day/article38096042.ece

If temples are controlled by the Government it means the last person in the social structure has the right over them. The Government’s move will give 2% of 5.5 crore Hindu population control over temples,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said in a press statement on Sunday. He said: “The same priestly class forces that derailed the Sharana movement of Basavanna are now using politicians from lower classes in the BJP to take control of temples. This will push Kannadigas to religious slavery.” He warned that the priestly class will not seek autonomy of all temples, but only those that have huge income. “Temples without income will be left to others.” The former Chief Minister said 205 A category temples have Rs. 1,580 crore in fixed deposits and savings accounts with Kukke Subrahmanya Temple alone having about Rs. 400 crore. As many as 139 B category temples have Rs. 89.67 crore. “The total value of movable and immovable properties under the control of Category A and B temples is estimated to exceed Rs. 1 lakh crore. A small percentage of the population has an eye on the riches, and temple autonomy is just a strategy to take over these temples.” He said those speaking against such policies leading to harassment, violation of social justice and constitution values are quickly termed as anti-Hindu or bring issues related to Pakistan, Islam, or Christianity to divert the attention of the people. “This is an old agenda of those who propagate Manusmriti. By raising issues of religion, gods, temples, churches, and mosques, the BJP produces lies to indulge in politics.” In the past too, Mr. Siddaramaiah said, a lie was spread that the money collected in temples was being distributed to develop religious places belonging to Muslims and Christianity. “However, in reality the Muzrai Department has clarified that no such grant is from money belonging to temples. Even the tasdik grants and assistance given to temples and other religious institutions after their land were acquired for redistribution among landless come from Government money. The Muzrai Department has a budget of Rs. 350 crore.” Mr. Siddaramaiah said this anti-Hindu policy of the BJP has to be opposed since it is diluting over a 1,000-year struggle of people and is a step back in social movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/move-to-free-temples-from-govt-control-regressive-siddaramaiah/article38096057.ece

Yediyurappa announced that in three months, the Prime Minister would lay the foundation stone for the suburban rail project. But like many promises our politicians have made, this one has also remained undelivered. Bengalureans who have been waiting for decades for a suburban rail network are hoping that at least civil work will begin this year. In November, Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Ltd. (K-RIDE), the agency implementing the project, floated a tender for civil works between Byappanahalli to Chikkabanavara (Corridor 2 of the rail network). A few days ago, the Deputy Conservator of Forests of the BBMP issued a public notice regarding removal of 661 trees along the alignment. Tender floated “Considering that K-RIDE has already floated tender, construction work should start from this year. K-RIDE should also float tenders for the remaining three corridors as well,” said rail activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar. He pointed out that initially, the agency had prioritised the KSR Bengaluru – Devanahalli corridor, which would help people travelling to the airport. “But the State Government is not keen on taking up this line. The metro link to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) will take five to six years to be completed, and will benefit people living in the east as well as those coming from Electronics City. If K-RIDE takes up the KSR-Devanahalli line, it will be to the benefit of people living in the central business district and other areas. The State Government should prioritise this line for the benefit of the larger public,” Mr. Dyamannavar added. New metro lines The suburban railway is just one part of a comprehensive and well-mapped mass transit system that Bengaluru needs. While Namma Metro’s reach has been growing, the pace of expansion is slow, with deadlines often missed. On many occasions, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has also instructed Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) to advance deadlines for opening metro lines under phase II of the project. Citizens are demanding that the BMRCL operationalise the extension of the metro line from Byappanahalli to Whitefield and new line from R.V. Road to Bommasandra. BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said that all measures had been taken to expedite metro works on both the lines. “On the Byappanahalli–Whitefield line, construction work between Byappanahalli and K.R. Puram will be expedited. The project has reached an advanced stage on the rest of the line,” he said. He added that on the new line from Bommasandra to R.V. Road, measures will be taken to complete pending works. This year, the BMRCL is likely to open the short extension of the Green Line from Nagasandra to BIEC. The BMRCL has to go a long way in completion of the ongoing phase II metro project: of the 72-km line, only 14 km have been made operational. The BMRCL has also taken up work on the ORR–Airport line, covering a distance over 55 km from Central Silk Board to KIA. Till the completion of the project, motorists using the Outer Ring Road (ORR) will have a tough time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/waiting-for-mass-transit-projects-to-hit-full-throttle/article38096031.ece

Patil set to retire on January 5, an informal group of Muslim legislators is learnt to be lobbying with the Congress leadership to nominate a Muslim MLC for the post. While senior Congress leader B.K. Hariprasad, former Minister R.B. Thimmapur, and former KPCC president Allam Veerabhadrappa are keen on the post, the Muslim Legislators’ Forum, an informal group of seven MLAs and three MLCs in the Congress, wants to nominate an MLC from the community. Among Muslim MLCs who have evinced interest include senior leaders C.M. Ibrahim and Nazeer Ahmed, sources said. A four-time MLC from Vijayapura, Mr. Patil was denied party ticket to contest this elections. While the term of Mr. Thimmapur and Mr. Veerabhadrappa is set to end on June 14, 2022, Mr. Ibrahim and Mr. Hariprasad have term till June 17, 2024, and June 30, 2026, respectively. Two time MLC Nazeer Ahmed has tenure till June 30, 2026. All the aspirants are elected from the Legislative assembly.  “Muslims have stood behind the Congress for long. It is time the community be represented in power. We have conveyed our wish to the party leadership and the high command is aware too,” a senior Muslim legislator told The Hindu . The legislator said it was time that the community was rewarded.  The perceived rift between former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Mr. Ibrahim seems to have been buried for optics, sources said. Incidentally, both met in Bengaluru before the Belagavi legislature session. Another source pointed out that Mr. Ibrahim had made his moves to leave the Congress and join the JD(S) since he felt neglected. He met JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy many times fuelling speculations that he could be appointed president of the regional party. “Many in the party feel Mr. Ibrahim should not be let go since it would send a wrong signal to the community,” sources said. Meanwhile, sources close to Mr. Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar acknowledged that the names of Mr. Ibrahim and Mr. Hariprasad had been discussed informally in the party. “Ultimately, the high command will decide,” sources said. The party has time to select a new Leader of the Opposition till the next legislature session is convened, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/forum-pitches-for-muslim-mlc-as-opposition-leader/article38096061.ece

However, some parents are apprehensive about getting their children vaccinated amidst fears that Covaxin doses have expired and re-labelled by the manufacturer, Bharat Biotech. Shruthi S., whose daughter studies in Class X in a private school, said they are worried after hearing that Bharat Biotech had informed private hospitals that the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) had extended the shelf life of Covaxin doses to 12 months from the date of manufacture. Another parent of a first year PU college student said that she would not allow her daughter to be vaccinated at her college. Instead, the family plans to get the vaccine administered at a private hospital after checking the date of manufacture. The State Government has instructed private hospitals that vaccines should not be utilised beyond the expiry date mentioned on the label of each vial. Meanwhile, schools that have tied up with private hospitals to conduct vaccine drives on campus, said they will gauge the response on Monday. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, Board of Management, Delhi Public School, said that they would begin the drive on Monday and had tied up with a private hospital for their programme. “We will have to wait and see how the response is tomorrow,” he said. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said that they would wait for the Government to roll out the vaccination drive. “We will wait till the Government comes to our schools as we don’t want to put the burden on parents.

All through 2021, residents had complained of agencies digging up newly laid roads and remaking them shoddily. Several MLAs reportedly brought this up during the meeting. As a solution, Mr. Bommai announced the formation of an inter-agency coordination committee that he would chair. It would be convened by the Chief Secretary to ensure inter-departmental coordination. Citizen activists remain sceptical of the initiative, given that previous governments had also set up similar mechanisms to address the lack of coordination between agencies, with little success. According to sources, Mr. Bommai reportedly pulled up officials for the bad condition of the city’s roads and the delay in works, especially in filling potholes. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has missed several self-imposed deadlines since September 2021 to rid roads of potholes and craters. Unusually heavy rains in October and November resulted in further delays. “The civic body has completed filling potholes in 80% of the streets and work is remaining on another 750 km of roads. The Chief Minister directed officials to finish filling all potholes in 15 days,” Revenue Minister R. Ashok told presspersons after the meeting. He added that Mr. Bommaiset a deadline of March 31 to complete all ongoing works — TenderSURE roads, white-topping, five grade separators, and 950 km of roadworks in 110 villages in the outer zones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-to-chair-inter-agency-coordination-committee/article38096027.ece

Interestingly, December saw the growth rate of Indian Made Liquor (IML) slip by -3.35% and beer slip by -4.75% compared to the same month last year, resulting in reduced excise duty collection. As against 61.25 lakh carton boxes sold in December 2020, a total of 59.26 lakh carton boxes were sold in December 2021, a reduction by nearly two lakh carton boxes. The sale of beer dipped from 28.02 lakh carton boxes in December 2020 to 26.69 lakh carton boxes in December 2021, a fall by 1.33 lakh carton boxes, data released by the Excise Department revealed. Only the last week of December seems to have come to the rescue with very high sales reported. Of the total 59.26 lakh carton boxes of IML sold in December, 17 lakh carton boxes were sold in the last week alone. Similarly, of the 26.69 lakh carton boxes of beer sold in December, 10.13 lakh carton boxes were sold in the same period. The result of the reduced sales of liquor has led to a reduction in collection of excise duty for December. While Rs. 2,619.53 crore was collected as excise duty in December 2020, it dropped by 5.7% to Rs. 2,470.20 crore. Earlier, June also reported a reduced excise duty collection by 8.11% when Rs. 2,230 crore was collected as against Rs. 2,427 crore collected in June 2020. In terms of annual growth, the first nine months has seen excise duty collection of Rs. 19,306 crore, a 15% rise over the corresponding period of 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/liquor-sales-dip-in-dec/article38096003.ece

It will be a great achievement if everybody becomes a successful entrepreneur. It will be good even if 10% of the participants do it. We will provide online guidance for those who have registered even after this physical programme,” Additional Chief Secretary to Government E.V. Ramana Reddy said. In honour of actor Puneet Rajkumar who passed away recently, the podium of the programme has been named after him.

A release from Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd., here said the counter will be functional between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. every day. The existing counter at Kundapur Head Post Office too would continue to function, said a KRCL official. The PRS at the HPO that was operational for about seven years had become non-functional since about seven months following technical glitches. The Kundapur Railu Prayanikara Samiti launched a campaign demanding a PRS counter at the rail-head itself since it was convenient. Halady Srinivas Shetty, Kundapur MLA, and Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP and Union Minister of State Shobha Karandlaje voiced the concerns of rail patrons and had urged the Railway Minister to intervene immediately. Ms. Karandlaje on December 24 announced the Railway Ministry’s decision to allow KRCL to open a PRS counter at Kundapur station. The Ministry, in response to KRCL proposal to open the PRS at the station, on December 20 said it has already authorised zonal railways to double up existing unreserved ticketing system counters (UTS) as PRS counters. Since UTS was functional at Kundapur, there was no issue to make available reserved tickets too through the counter, it said giving clearance for the proposal. Samitsi member Kundapura Gautam Shetty said many passengers booked reserve tickets on the first day itself, indicating the need for such a facility at the station itself.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pending-demand-fulfilled-as-prs-counter-becomes-functional-at-kundapur-station/article38096494.ece

It was earlier ‘confirmed’ for November 12 but the election code of conduct kicked in due to the polls for the Legislative Council from the local bodies. Subsequently, the authorities sought to hold the grievance redressal meeting in the second week of December but the date was not finalised. The last Industrial Adalat for the Mysuru Division was held in 2011 and since then a slew of demands and grievances have spilled over and have a bearing on the industrial climate and employment generation in the region. Suresh Kumar Jain, General Secretary of Mysuru Industries Association, said that there are fresh terms and conditions stipulated by the authorities on who can participate and the kind of disputes that will be heard. Though one of the key issue pertains to allotment or the delay in allotment of industrial plots it is not clear whether the subject will be included during the proceedings. In most cases the allotment exercise is yet to be completed though the entrepreneurs have completed the payment and there are cases in which an official communique has been sent finalising the allotment but the allotees were yet to be given possession of land, said Mr.Jain. Stakeholders also point to the haphazard manner in which the industrial plot is allotted without taking into cognizance the nature of the proposed factory to be built as a result of which there tends to be zoning violations. In many cases the allotment is rejected altogether by the stakeholders, which results in loss of potential employment opportunity for the local people. There have been nearly a dozen cases in which land was allotted close to the Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre and permission was hard to come by due to the disturbance to animals. One of the key budgetary announcement made in recent years is the constitution of an Industrial Township Authority so as to obviate the need to pay taxes to multiple authorities. Property tax “At present property tax has to be remitted to the local authorities but that is not compensated by proportionate maintenance and hence bulk of the industrial units resist payment of tax to the local bodies. If the Industrial Township Authority is notified, then the payment will also be prompt as maintenance and extension of amenities is assured’’, said Mr. Suresh Kumar Jain. Lack of industrial waste recycling unit is another issue which is having a bearing on the local environment and is a key demand of the small- and medium-sized enterprises. Though the KIADB is expected to reserve a portion of the land for such a plant in the industrial areas developed by it, no such facility is in place at present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/industrial-adalat-on-january-18/article38096506.ece

The Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage is set to take the initiative and will study the presentation and documentation related to Durga Puja and initiate the measures, said Poornima, Commissioner of the Department. “This is on top of our mind and we will follow the due protocols and initiatives required to document Dasara and submit it to the Centre’’, she added. Though an effort was made in the past the initiative did not go beyond making a cursory report nor was it submitted to the Centre. The Mysuru chapter of INTACH had also pressed for preparing the ground work and was one of the resolutions passed in the District Heritage Committee meeting before the pandemic brought all efforts to a halt. N.S. Rangaraju, convener of INTACH, Mysuru, said that Dasara as it is celebrated in Mysuru is rooted in history and was inherited by the Wadiyars of Mysuru from the rulers of Vijayanagar empire. The festival was documented by the medieval writers, including Domingo Paes and Ferrnao Nuniz of Portugal, who visited the Vijayanagar kingdom during the 16th century. Hence not only does Mysuru Dasara has a historical pedigree but it is also a tradition whose origins extend to earlier days and is celebrated as Nada Habba, said Prof. Rangaraju. ‘Opportunities’ Experts aver that Dasara or Navaratri was part and parcel of the culture and tradition of Karnataka and securing the intangible cultural heritage tag for Mysuru Dasara could open up opportunities for promoting the event on a global scale to give a boost to tourism. “Mysuru Dasara meets all the criteria to secure the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage tag and it is a living cultural heritage practice of the State with its own history dating to over 500 years’’, said Prof. Rangaraju. Though the description of the intangible cultural heritage is elaborate, UNESCO describes it as something which is “transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity’’. Apart from Durga Puja celebrations, tradition of Vedic chanting, Kumbha Mela, chanting of Buddhist hymns in the Ladakh region, Navrouz, Kerala’s Sanskrit theatre Kutiyattam, Ramleela, the traditional performance of Ramayana, and Sankirtana, ritual singing, drumming and dancing of Manipur are among the traditions of India that have been accorded the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage tag.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seeking-cultural-heritage-tag-for-mysuru-dasara/article38096035.ece

Addressing the convention, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar said the party expects at least 10,000 participants from Chamarajanagar with 2,500 from each of the four Assembly constituencies. He appealed to the gathering to be part of the inaugural of the 10-day padayatra, scheduled to start on January 9 morning, and the concluding six-km trek in Bengaluru. The padayatra will culminate with a public meeting at Basavangudi grounds, he said. Participation on the other days for participants from Chamarajanagar is optional, he said. People from Mysuru and nearby areas will be asked to join the padayatra on the second day, he said. The Congress has scheduled a similar convention in Mysuru on Tuesday as a prelude to the padayatra and to mark the launch of the party membership drive. Mr. Shivakumar asked the gathering to leave Chamarajanagar early on January 9 to reach Mekedatu in time for the start of the padayatra. He said all arrangements had been made for breakfast and parking. Participants were asked register themselves on the portal titled ‘mekedatunammahakku’ to help organisers make arrangements for food and overnight stay. About 5,000 people had registered themselves, he said, and added that the party had booked marriage choultries and put up shamianas along the route for participants to rest overnight. Though 1,000 rooms had been booked to accommodate the leaders, Mr. Shivakumar said the party will not be able to make the rooms available to all participants. However, he said he will also sleep with them in the choultries. Mr. Shivakumar told former MP representing Chamarajanagar R. Dhruvanarayan, who is also working president of KPCC, to make arrangements for supply of sugarcane juice and coconuts to the participants enroute the padayatra. Apart from folk artistes joining with drums and musical instruments, the Congress leader asked participants to come prepared to display their talents in singing or reading poetry. Mr Shivakumar said the party will also issue a certificate to participants of the “historic” padayatra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-holds-convention-to-mobilise-crowds-for-padayatra/article38096059.ece

Lakshman has flayed the Janata Dal (Secular) for its stance on the padayatra to be launched by the Congress to drum up support for the Mekedatu project. Speaking to mediapersons here on Sunday Mr.Lakshman targeted the JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D.Kumaraswamy for his remarks that the padayatra will not serve any purpose. Mr. Kumaraswamy had stated recently that the Congress was trying to get political mileage out of the Mekedatu project by conducting a padayatra. “It will serve no purpose nor will it help secure the Centre’s nod for the project but will only help Congress make some political consolidation and gains’’, Mr.Kumaraswamy had stated. The KPCC spokesperson said the contribution of the JD(S) for irrigation was negligible. While 21 dams were constructed during the regime of the Congress governments, KRS was constructed during the period of Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar while four other dams were pre-independent structures. He said let alone a dam, the JD (S) did not even repair or construct a canal to help farmers irrigate their lands. Responding to Mr. Kumaraswamy’s comment on the Mekedatu padayatra, Mr. Lakshman said this has sowed seeds of confusion among the people of the State and accused Mr. Kumaraswamy of rendering a favour to the BJP. Mr. Lakshman said the attitude of the JD(S) leaders lends credence to speculations that it was working at the behest of the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-flays-hdk-for-comment-on-mekedatu-padayatra/article38096504.ece

The GST Council met on December 31, 2021, and decided to defer the impending GST hike to 12 per cent. “Dropping the proposal of GST hike once and for all will enable the silk industry to recover from the present jolt of COVID-19 and other adverse conditions”, said Association’s Secretary M. Ramachandra Gowda in a statement. The Association, in a statement on December 30, 2021, had expressed concern over the possible impact of the GST hike and said it would creative a negative impact on the textile industry. The hike would lead to closure of many factories, outlets and other shops, which will have a cascading effect on all other activities including those carried out by the grassroot producers. “Increasing the GST from 5 per cent to 12 per cent would indirectly prompt the small and medium scale players to pass it on to the consumers. On the other hand, they fail to compete with heavyweights of the industry and face natural closure”, the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/silk-association-welcomes-move-to-defer-gst-hike/article38096507.ece

Addressing a convention, he reminded the gathering that the next Assembly elections were about a year and three months away. During his tenure as the Chief Minister, Mr. Siddaramaiah said all four seats in Chamarajanagar district – Chamarajanagar, Kollegal, Hanur, and Gundlupet – were bagged by the Congress. In the coming elections too, the Congress should capture all four seats, he said. The BJP Government in the State has not taken up any development work, he said. Mr. Siddaramaiah emphasised the need for taking up the Mekedatu project on a priority basis and called upon the people of the region to participate in the padayatra. He said neighbouring Tamil Nadu was unnecessarily opposing the project and leading the campaign against it was the BJP’s Tamil Nadu leader Annamalai. BJP’s national general secretary C.T. Ravi, who hailed from Karnataka, but was in charge of the party in Tamil Nadu, was not pushing the project, he alleged. The project will not only ensure drinking water for the people of Karnataka, but would benefit Tamil Nadu too, he claimed. Mr. Siddaramaiah also held the BJP Government directly responsible for the death of 36 COVID-19 patients in Chamarajanagar due to oxygen shortage in April 2021. Accusing Health Minister D. Sudhakar and then Minister in charge of Chamarajanagar district Suresh Kumar of trying to mislead the public by claiming that the number of patients who died due to oxygen shortage was only three, Mr. Siddaramaiah said when he visited the district after the tragedy, it came to light that the number of COVID-19 patients who died due to oxygen shortage was 36. Mr. Siddaramaiah claimed that officials of the district had admitted that they were unable to ensure oxygen to patients, leading to their death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-sounds-poll-bugle-in-chamarajanagar/article38096062.ece

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 05:35 IST,KARNATAKA||Corridors||One person who drew everyone’s attention in the legislature session Belagavi was former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa (in picture) . Unlike earlier occasions when he was in the news for political reasons, this time the veteran leader hogged the limelight for his disciplined behaviour in the Assembly. The 78-year-old MLA attended the session regularly without any delay. He sat through the session every day unlike many others who took regular breaks. Interestingly, he maintained dignified decorum in the House and desisted from indulging in private conversations with party legislators inside the House, though he actively participated in all the major debates. Of course, he made his presence felt politically during the debate on the anti-conversion Bill when he exhorted Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri to complete the process related to adoption of the Bill instead of prolonging the issue. Mr. Yediyurappa’s presence was also felt when he sternly told the Speaker and Law Minister J.C. Madhuswamy to be tough while dealing with indiscipline. Without mincing words, he asked why both leaders were seeking advise from others instead of acting when they were given the responsibility to ensure discipline in the House.     KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar (in picture) lost his cool again when a supporter from his party tried to take a selfie with him during the Congress Foundation Day programme on December 28. The incident occurred at Shivapura in Mandya. In the video, which went viral, Mr. Shivakumar was seen getting irritated with the supporter for coming close to him and attempting to take a selfie without permission. Furious, Mr. Shivakumar forcefully grabbed the cellphone and reprimanded him. “Don’t you have common sense?” he was heard saying in the video. Mr. Shivakumar later justified his action and said taking selfies without permission was a security breach. In July last, he had slapped a supporter who tried to click a photograph with him in Mandya. The State Congress chief had then said that the man was a close relative and would not mind it.     Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai (in picture) seems to be unhappy about the media speculating on major political changes in the Government, including a Cabinet reshuffle. He termed the recent news reports about possible change of leadership/Cabinet reshuffle as “media creation”. “You create these things and ask questions related to their authenticity,” Mr. Bommai shot back at a reporter. “We don’t have to reveal political issues that will be discussed. These are internal party matters,” Mr. Bommai said when asked whether issues relating to reshuffling of Cabinet would be discussed with BJP president J.P. Nadda. Later, BJP leaders clarified that Mr. Bommai would continue as the Chief Minister.  B.S.

The department will bank on Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) satellite-based imagery technique, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and Electronic Total Station (ETS) machines. The project is aimed at unifying land-related documentation and interlinking the services of revenue, survey, and registration departments through Revenue Land Information System. Officials said the resurvey would enable the issue of RoR, settlement of land-related disputes and accurate documentation and sketches pertaining to land. It is also aimed at preventing encroachments on government land and better disaster response. The government earlier formed a district monitoring and review committee, taluk-level committees and panchayat/urban-level committees for implementing the project. The resurvey of villages will be completed over four-and-a-half years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/digital-land-resurvey-gets-under-way-in-alappuzha/article38096458.ece

As per official data, the State recorded the highest number in 2021 with 162 persons donating their organs. In 2020, when the novel coronavirus broke out, only 75 people had donated organs. The second highest of 160 donations were logged in 2018. There were two features that made 2021 special with regard to organ transplantation in Telangana — lung transplantations increased by four times and skin transplantation was performed for the first time. In cadaver organ donation programmes, vital organs are harvested from a person who is declared brain-dead. Hub for transplants In fact, Hyderabad has turned into a hub for organ transplantations, especially lungs, which are mostly performed at corporate hospitals. The first transplantation of skin harvested from a brain-dead patient was performed at the State-run Osmania General Hospital. The government’s Jeevandan-Cadaver Donation Programme was started in 2013 when 41 persons pledged their organs. The number gradually increased in the subsequent years. However, the COVID pandemic dealt a sharp blow to the programme. Donations dropped after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in March last year. The subsequent lockdowns restricted movement of people on roads, bringing down road accident rate and a corresponding drop in number of brain-dead patients from whom organs are harvested. Interestingly, along with the donations, which dropped sharply in 2020, there was also a dip in the number of people who register for receipt of organ/ organs. Though 2021 witnessed the deadly second wave, the rate of organ donations did not drop, barring in the months of April and May. Factors for upsurge In-charge of Jeevandan, G. Swarnalatha said increase in critical care infrastructure such as ICU facilities at hospitals and people becoming more concerned about other people’s lives are two factors which led to high number of donations. “People have started attaching more value to life after COVID. They have become generous. In fact, some are coming forward to enquire if there is a possibility to donate organs,” said Dr Swarnalatha. Raising awareness Usually, counsellors from the programme convince the family members of brain-dead patients about the importance of organ donation. Jeevandan staff hold condolence programmes for donors at their respective native places to eliminate misconception in the minds of neighbours and others that the donation was made for some form of benefit. Dr Swarnalatha added that such initiatives have helped raise more awareness about organ donation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/citizens-put-humanity-first-step-forward-to-give-gift-of-life/article38096316.ece

The newly discovered species, Monoceromyia flavoscutata and M. nigra, belong to the Syrphidae family. They were discovered by researchers H. Sankararaman, a Ph.D scholar from Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, Anooj S.S., an assistant professor of entomology at the Kerala Agricultural University, Padannakkad, and Ximo Mengual, a scientist from Alexander Koenig Zoological Research Museum, Germany. The study was recently published in the Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology .   Mr. Anooj told The Hindu that members of the genus are extremely rare with only 12 species reported from India previously.  “The new species discovery in this rare genus is happening in India after 80 years,” he said. As part of the study, surveys were done in the forests of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Arunachal Pradesh, he added. Mr. Anooj said in addition to the two new species, researchers had revised the genus and redefined seven existing species in the genus. He explained that the new species, M. flavoscutata, discovered from Thadiyankudisai in Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu, was named after its yellow coloured thoracic ends and can be differentiated from the closely resembling species based on the colouration of the thorax and the wing vein characters, whereas the other new species, M. nigra discovered from West Siang of Basar district of Arunachal Pradesh, differed from the other species based on thoracic, abdominal and facial colouration and wing vein character. It was named as nigra based on the black-coloured thorax. This genus is recognised by their facial projection from which their antennae arises, petiolated abdomen and colouration which mimic thread-waisted wasps to escape predators. The one discovered from Western Ghats (Thadiyankudisai) was found to show a peculiar habit of egg laying on tree sap. The immature stages of the genus are reported to show interesting habitat preferences like sap runs and rot holes of trees, colonies of stingless bees and water fills of plants like bamboo. Conservation Mr. Anooj said the discovery of such rare species with specialised habitat preferences highlighted the diversity of the Western Ghats and north-eastern India and the need for the conservation of natural vegetation in these region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/researchers-discover-2-new-species-of-rare-wasp-like-flower-flies/article38096363.ece

A senior traffic police officer said what began with a private bus ramming 14 vehicles on Foreshore Road in mid-November, reportedly due to brake failure, was followed by a spree of major accidents. They included a private bus which was overtaking another vehicle and was fully on the wrong side ramming a two-wheeler, resulting in the death of a young man and a woman pillion rider at Vypeen a month ago. This was followed by a couple of deaths in the city suburbs, after buses took off even as passengers were entering or disembarking them. On their part, bus operators confided that a section of them was turning a blind eye to gross rule violations, which included rash driving and halting of buses in the middle of the road to collect passengers. “They seem to forget that reckless driving worsens wear and tear and also considerably lessens fuel efficiency, while at the same time creating a negative image among passengers and other road users,” said an office-bearer of a prominent bus operators’ association. Both traffic police and MVD officials said they were hamstrung during the past week, since officials had to be taken off regular duty and deployed for VVIP visits to the city. Even otherwise, there is little coordination between the police and the MVD in bringing erring drivers to book, it is learnt. Both the departments are, in the meantime, devising measures to rein in private buses that flout road safety norms, sources said. A senior traffic police official said they had begun detaining buses involved in gross rule violations at the police stations concerned for a day or two, since imposing fines had not been a deterrent. “This is because the fine amounts are quite minimal. We have also resumed the practice of posting personnel in mufti, to record incidents of rash driving and other rule violations which impact public safety. We hope they act as a deterrent,” he added. Special drives aimed at nabbing buses that frequently violate traffic rules will resume in a week, said a senior MVD official. “We could enforce rules better if the police share feeds from their surveillance cameras, which include those from the Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System of Cochin Smart Mission Limited that is managed by police personnel,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rash-and-negligent-driving-by-private-buses-on-the-rise-in-city/article38096400.ece

(KEIL) at Ambalamugal is operating below its capacity owing to the non-availability of biomedical waste, while the Palakkad facility of Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly (IMAGE) is having a backlog of biomedical waste, according to a report by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The finding was based on the data related to the average collection and disposal of biomedical waste by both the units between December 1 and December 9. The total capacity of the plant operated by KEIL is around 16 tonnes per day, while the corresponding capacity of IMAGE’s Palakkad plant is around 55.8 tonnes per day. KEIL received only one tonne per day of COVID-related biomedical waste on a nine-day average basis, while the quantity of non-COVID biomedical waste was six tonnes. There was a gap of around nine tonnes in the quantity of waste disposed of daily in this period compared to the actual capacity of the plant. The facility of IMAGE was getting an average seven tonnes of COVID-related biomedical waste, while the corresponding figure of non-COVID biomedical waste was 47 tonnes daily. The total waste processed in the plant was around 54 tonnes per day against the capacity of 55.8 tonnes per day. The board pointed out that a considerable quantity of biomedical waste is remaining for treatment as backlog in the IMAGE’s plant in Palakkad. Therefore, an additional Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility has to come up in the southern part of the State and another one in the northern part so that the disposal of biomedical waste can be done effectively within 48 hours of its generation. The board will monitor the functioning of the two existing facilities, it said in a report filed before the Southern bench of the National Green Tribunal on December 17. The tribunal had asked the board to submit district-wise data on biomedical waste generated by healthcare institutions in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/keil-not-getting-enough-biomedical-waste-while-image-has-backlog-pcb/article38096395.ece

It is important, since contractors are often reluctant to agree to the DLP of narrow but congested roads and of corridors whose specified surface quality is inadequate to cater to the axle load of vehicles using them. As per rules, payment is made to contractors after the quality wing, chief technical examiner, and the vigilance wing ensure that the work was executed in accordance with technical specifications. Contractors must be pulled up only if they default on technical specifications, said KGCA president Varghese Kannampilly. “On the contrary, action must be taken against engineers who fail to ensure that work is being executed as per technical specifications. This is because contractors are often forced to compromise on technical specifications and the laid-down procedures when engineers yield to pressure from people’s representatives to unduly extend the length of roads and provide amenities not mentioned in the contract. Ultimately, contractors are pulled up for no fault of theirs if roads suffer damage within the DLP,” he said. The State committee of the body also took exception to contractors being “forced” to shell out the expenses of boards that specify the DLP and other relevant information. All this could affect the quality of road work. Ultimately, members of the public must get value for public funds earmarked for road work. But such grey areas while executing work, official apathy, and corrupt practices end up compromising on the quality of roads. On its part, the government must ensure laying of designed roads, readying of estimate that is in sync with the prevailing market rate, prompt supervision and timely clearing of dues, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dlp-boards-must-specify-load-bearing-capacity-of-roads/article38096403.ece

A butterfly park, close to the large water reservoir on the main campus of the university, is ready to receive its colourful guests, said a senior official of the university on Sunday. Besides, the university has also provided permission to grow vegetables on five acres behind the Radar Centre. The idea of setting aside a substantial plot of land for planting trees on one’s special days was first mooted by Babu Thattarkunnel, an employee of the university, who is a former member of Maradi panchayat, near Muvattupuzha. He said the idea was to persuade employees of the university to plant a tree on a special occasion, which could include one’s birthday, retirement, wedding anniversary, the date one joins the university service, etc. Mr. Thattarkunnel had carried out widespread greening activities in Maradi panchayat when he was a member and won the State award for environment protection activities. The ‘Ishta Maram’ or one’s favourite tree progamme was first launched at Maradi on April 16 last year during a wedding when the newly married couple were encouraged to plant a tree on the special occasion, he added. He said he had joined the university as an employee a year ago and presented the idea before the university authorities, who took up the programme. The Vice Chancellor of the university, K.N. Madhusoodanan, is among those who have planted trees at the designated land, which is located behind the Cochin University Students’Amenity Centre. The Cusat official said that more than a hundred medicinal plants from Oushadi would also be planted on the land. Cusat has also granted permission to cultivate vegetables on five acres behind the Radar Centre. The programme is called ‘From Idle to Ideal’, signifying the initiative to bring land lying idle now under cultivation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cusat-to-increase-its-green-cover/article38096367.ece

The fame of the bank has now spread across the seas as consignments of coconut oil, processed tapioca and dehydrated banana chips were flagged off from the bank premises on Saturday by Cooperation Minister V.N. Vasavan, to be exported to New Zealand, Australia and the US. 9,500 members The cooperative bank, which boasts a membership of nearly 9,500, had ventured into providing coconut oil with a view to supplying a quality product in the face of widespread allegations of adulteration, says M.G. Ramakrishnan, president of the bank, who initially mooted the idea of having a oil extraction unit to ensure the availability of quality coconut oil. The tapioca processing venture emerged during the COVID-19 challenge as an answer to the steep fall in the price of the produce, which pushed farmers into deep financial trouble. While tapioca price fell to about Rs. 8 a kilo, the Service Cooperative Bank procured the tuber from farmers at Rs. 15 a kg. The first consignment of processed tapioca was shipped to the US, where it found wide acceptance. The success prompted the bank to launch exports to other two countries too, Mr. Ramakrishnan added. He said the bank secretary, P.R. Sunil, played a key role in the launch of ventures, which are now seeing fruition. Own brand of oil The bank, which has its own brand of coconut oil, started oil extraction in a small way in a mill that was closed. The facility was leased to start the processing of oil. Kerafed came to the aid of the cooperative bank initially. The State government too extended a helping hand. The Coconut Development Board provided Rs. 3 crore at an interest of 4% with 3% subsidy. With the money, a new mill with a capacity to process 4,000 kg of copra per day was established and inaugurated in February 2021. The secret of success is the quality. No dry copra is procured but fresh coconuts are procured from Kozhikode and Malappuram districts and dried in electrical dryers. Similarly, tapioca is procured from joint liability groups, which are engaged in cultivation. Only the best quality produce is processed, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cooperative-bank-sets-an-example-in-entrepreneurship/article38096405.ece

Once completed, it is slated to become a state-of-the-art integration facility for long-length flexible sensor arrays and cables, says an official release. The programme also witnessed the handing over of DHWANI acoustic trainer system developed by NPOL to the Indian Navy. The system would enable Indian Navy personnel, in a graded manner, to quickly advance their skills in interpreting and handling sophisticated readings from passive sonar, active sonar, and underwater communication systems. The DHWANI system was handed over by Sameer V. Kamat, Director General, Naval Systems and Materials at DRDO, to Chief Staff Officer (CSO) (Training) of the Southern Naval Command Rear Admiral T.V.N.

Since the council denied them permission to move the resolution, the seven members walked out of the meeting. The opposition members told the media that protest meetings would be organised at all Bar Association offices. The findings of the High Court were very serious, and the council is bound to protect the interests of lawyers, and any attempt to scuttle CBI probe will only serve to protect the interests of those involved in the scam. The High Court had issued the order on a writ petition filed by Adv. C.G. Arun and four other lawyers. Slow progress The petitioners submitted that the probe by the Vigilance and Anti-corruption Bureau was going at a snail’s pace. They alleged that every effort was being made to put the entire blame on the accountant. The court had observed that the crime was spread over 10 years. It also said that the VACB investigation had not reached its logical conclusion. Several aspects need to be further investigated.

He was inaugurating the public meeting in connection with the CPI(M) district conference at E. Kasim Nagar (Kottarakara railway station junction) here on Sunday. “Political opposition that blocks the future development of the State will not be accepted. The government is willing to talk to people who are opposing the project. Action will be taken to dispel doubts, and the government respects the sentiment of those who lose property. The government will ensure adequate compensation and rehabilitation for them. The government will be with them and the Chief Minister and the Ministers will convene meetings in this regard,” he said. During UDF rule Pointing out that the previous United Democratic Front (UDF) government had planned a high-speed rail project which was not pursued, he added that the State government was implementing a semi-high speed rail project. “For this, half of the amount set aside by the UDF government will be enough. Eight States, including Kerala, have come forward to implement the SilverLine. The Congress and the BJP had not opposed it in other States.

In a statement issued on the occasion of the145th jayanti (birth anniversary) of its founding leader, NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair said the government had turned down its repeated demands citing lame excuses. Mr. Nair said the government might face the consequences if it did not change its approach towards the NSS, which had maintained an equi-distance policy towards all political parties. The statement, widely regarded as the latest in a war of words between the community organisation and the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government, received instant backing from the Congress and the BJP. Cong., BJP support Supporting the NSS, Congress leader K. Muraleedharan, MP, said the present government did not appear keen on declaring Mannam Jayanti as a holiday. “This is not fair especially because the founding leader of NSS had fought for all sections of society,” he said. Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan too accused the State government of disregarding a reasonable demand raised by the organisation. “It is a collective demand of the Hindu society. The Chief Minister should find a way to resolve this issue,” he told the media, on the sidelines of his visit to the NSS headquarters here. The Mannam Jayanti was observed at the NSS headquarters in Perunna with Mr. Nair lighting a lamp and offering floral tributes at the Mannam Samadhi mandapam in the morning. The Jayanti was also observed in all the taluk union offices, Karayogam units and NSS institutions across the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mannathu-anniversary-nss-raises-holiday-issue-again/article38096410.ece

Vehicles with poor cubic capacity that can only be used for palliative care or mortuary purposes are plying across national and State highways taking advantage of relaxed speed regulation norms. Even after the introduction of a centralised ambulance service network by the government under the Kanivu-108 project, there is no system in place to periodically inspect the fitness of such vehicles or test the driving skills of those behind the wheel. The proposals submitted by experts to streamline the sector too remain ignored. Functionaries of Kozhikode-based Active Network Group of Emergency Lifesavers (ANGELS) who pioneered efforts to convert ambulances into emergency lifesavers in the State said it was high time the government introduced a scientific colour coding system to categorise ambulances on the basis of their services. They pointed out that it would help in easy identification of vehicles carrying the dead and those under emergency medical care. “Since ambulances are considered as emergency life savers, we need a proper system to periodically inspect their fitness, quality of facilities, infection control standards, arrangements for patient care, and drivers’ ability to handle emergency situations. Sadly, we lack such measures,” said P.P. Venugopal, a senior emergency medicine expert and executive director of ANGELS. He added that it was high time the government introduced an emergency vehicle operation course for drivers who operate basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) ambulances. According to Dr. Venugopal, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) can consider constituting a team to study the situation with the support of medical experts. “Ambulance operators get priority treatment on the road and exemption from traffic regulations, and they should be held accountable for ensuring a safe service,” he said. Projects pending A number of district- and State-level projects to improve ambulance services are pending with the government thanks to poor cooperation on the part of a few operators. A comprehensive proposal earlier submitted by the ANGELS team to the Justice M. Ramachandran Commission carrying five specific action plans aimed at streamlining ambulance services, the government is yet to take any favourable action. According to a senior doctor, one of the suggestions was fixing of a fair service tariff, which was overlooked due to staunch opposition from a few private organisations operating in the sector. Similar was the case with the implementation of a National Ambulance Code proposed in 2013 by the Automotive Industry Standard Committee of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to define constructional and functional requirements for ambulances, he pointed out.  Ambulance operators get priority treatment on the road... they should be held accountable for ensuring a safe service P.P.

The Performance Museum Project uses every part of the venue, the school, right from its entrance to the playground, verandahs, classrooms, staircase, and even toilet. Members of the audience walk around from one scene to another, run after the characters and even lie down, blurring the boundaries between audience and performers, being part of participatory theatre. The director or any of the characters often guides the audience to the next scene, where they create a surreal world of light and darkness based on various facets of death. The audience gets to play a part in every scene knowingly or unknowingly. They get to throw soil into a grave or drink toddy in memory of the dead after the rituals. They get to listen to monologues by the ‘dead’ on circumstances that led to their death. Sometimes, it is the dear ones of the dead who talk. The audience of 15 is dragged into a state of numbness where they feel death from the perspective of the dead. Director of the play and founder of Theatre Company and Inner Circle Performing Community, Emil Madhavi, had first presented the play in Hyderabad a few years ago and then in Delhi before it was staged at Kokkallur, Kozhikode, since when Maverick Theatre Collective of Kokkallur became a part of the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/blurring-borders-between-performers-and-audience/article38096370.ece

Deputy Mayor Musafir Ahamed said though the mobile application that enables booking of parking space from afar was yet to be ready, the manual system was already in place. The tender for a mobile application for Smart Parking will be floated in a few days, and it is expected to be ready in a month. Meanwhile, markings are being made on roadsides by the Corporation’s engineering wing to enable systematic parking of all kinds of vehicles. The Corporation is implementing the Smart Parking system in association with the traffic police as a sustainable solution to the parking woes of the city. The project was designed based on a study report of the traffic police. The District Police Chief (Kozhikode City) had approached the Mayor with the report, combined with another project report by a start-up named Qcopy. The Mayor in turn discussed the matter with various departments. A detailed report on spaces on roadsides where vehicles could be parked without disrupting traffic was prepared with the help of the traffic police. Thus, the first phase of the project to convert Kozhikode into a parking-friendly city was readied. The project was approved by the Corporation council on November 19 last year and was launched on Saturday by Minister for Public Works and Tourism P.A. Mohamed Riyas at the launch of the first anniversary celebrations of the corporation council. Under the project, those travelling to the city can book parking space in advance through a mobile application. The space will be vacant for a specific period of time. The police have already mapped every road of the city and charted the parking spaces available. There are parking bays separately for cars, motorbikes, vehicles of disabled people, and buses. There will be drop-off points and emergency/police bays in select locations on most roads. Maximum parking space is available on North Beach and near the Corporation office, while South Beach, Meenchanda-Areekkad Road, Pottammal-Arayidathupalam Toad, and Pavamani Road too have enough parking bays. However, there are very few bays available at Pottammal Junction and Rajaji Road, which have shortage of space for parking. The Corporation has already set aside Rs. 10 lakh to set up parking spaces on wider roads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/smart-parking-system-to-be-fully-operational-in-a-month/article38096372.ece

According to functionaries of the Parallel College Association, the last date for admissions to regular undergraduate and postgraduate courses in affiliated colleges, with a fine, was December 14. The university closed the admissions to distance education courses the next day itself. A.G. Rajeevan, secretary of the association, said on Sunday that normally the university gave another chance to students to apply for SDE courses with a “super fine”. It did not happen this time. This led to many students in Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur, and Wayanad districts being unable to secure admissions to degree courses. C.G. Shaji, vice president of the association, said the university could have easily extended the last date for a day or two since the University Grants Commission (UGC) directive was to close the admissions only by December 31. The University of Kerala had extended the last date of admissions to December 20, he added. The association functionaries accused the SDE Director of being apathetic to the concerns of students when they sought his help to address the issue. “The Director asked us why the students were waiting for the last date and why they did not apply before. Most of the students wait to see if they get admissions to regular courses before trying for distance education courses. Nobody expected that the authorities would close the process in just a day,” said Mr. Shaji. Meanwhile, the university authorities have reportedly claimed to approach the UGC to see if the students who missed out can be admitted in courses starting in January. They have also highlighted the pandemic situation to seek a relaxation. The association leaders, however, said Calicut University had so far never encouraged courses starting in the calendar year.

The city police came across the operation of a few such WhatsApp groups during recent checks in hotels and resorts in Kozhikode as part of the intensified surveillance against rave parties on New Year’s eve.  “Though the private social media groups are outwardly harmless in nature, there have been constant efforts to promote drug abuse and form separate sub groups for interested members,” a senior police officer, who was part of the surveillance activities, told The Hindu . He said the parents of some students were aware of the presence of such groups, but were helpless to find a solution.  Events called off Many students had scheduled such New Year parties in various hotels in the city. However, intensified curbs considering the pandemic situation had forced them to call off such events. The attempts of some groups to host the parties before New Year’s were also prevented following the spot intervention of the police. The police also found that huge amounts were pooled in for conducting the parties. Some parents had warned the hotel managements against facilitating such events and thanked the police for preventing the conduct of parties. Officials with the Special Branch said they had forwarded a report to the higher authorities for focused action in the area. They said a State-level probe could be launched and the role of senior students in luring juniors could be examined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drug-abuse-students-social-media-groups-under-scanner/article38096381.ece

Inaugurating the valedictory session of the three-day district conference of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] at Fort Grounds, Mr. Vijayan warned the Congress and the BJP against stalling the State’s development. “When the Congress is trying to stall the State’s development, the BJP is busy polarising the country communally,” said the Chief Minister. He accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of following the policies and steps of Adolf Hitler, and trying to create divisions and hatred in the country in the name of religion. He said that it was the development agenda of the LDF that brought his government back to power in the State. “Realising this, the Congress is trying to stall the State’s development with the help of the BJP. Only those with an anti-development agenda can stand against the K-Rail project,” he said. Pinarayi’s stance E.N. Suresh Babu was elected Palakkad district secretary of the CPI(M) on Sunday.

The merger is aimed at improving service delivery and coordination between the various wings of local administration and planning. On February 18, annually observed as panchayat day, the five departments of panchayat, urban affairs, rural development, town and country planning and LSGD engineering will be merged to form a common service. The headquarters will be located at the Swaraj Bhavan here under a principal director. At the district-level, offices will be set up under a joint director, which will act as facilitators for all local bodies in each district. Support system “What is being envisaged is a support system for local bodies, bringing together all services under a single umbrella. Though plan campaign had brought the public into the planning process, there were some level of short-sightedness and fragmentation in the planning at local levels. The new system will enable planning with a long-term perspective. Projects related to waste management or disaster preparedness in a region are not limited to a specific local body. It needs a lot of coordination and joint projects between local bodies, which this system will help achieve,” said C.P. Vinod, chairperson, Local Government Commission, which prepared the functional manual and draft rules for integration. Under the present system, many of the local level administrative set-ups work in silos, even though some of their areas of control and responsibilities do overlap. Coordination issues For instance, there are at times coordination issues in the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) because the implementation is by the grama panchayat, the supervision is under the block panchayat and the district office is under the rural development department. In the cleaning of rivers too, which pass through rural and urban local bodies, there are problems of coordination. A district office with all these departments merged together can save some funds in projects with common and overlapping aims. The initial talks for the common service began in 2007. . It figured in the Governor's policy address. Though an order was issued in 2011, the integration plan remained in cold storage until 2016 when the LDF government began working on it. The government held multiple consultations with service organisations. The committee which was formed to frame the draft rules also considered the demands of these organisations. One of the major demands put forward by the organisations was the protection of service terms of the existing employees, while drafting new recruits into the common service. This was agreed upon. Though the Cabinet took a decision on the merger in July 2020, it was delayed due to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lsgd-common-service-in-feb/article38096415.ece

Besides affecting high-end devices, electromagnetic interference (EMI) is known to be detrimental to the health of living organisms. Subodh G., assistant professor of the Department Physics at Kerala University, and research scholar Vidhya Lalan have developed fifth-generation (5G) microwave absorbers that could serve as an effective shield against such radiation. The study recently figured in peer-reviewed Journal of Material Chemistry C published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. Immediate attention “The problems posed by EMI demanded immediate attention in this era of 5G technology and Internet of Things (IoT) when it has become difficult to undertake routine chores without the help of electronic devices and internet that work around electromagnetic waves. The need for EMI shielding materials, especially those suitable for high frequently applications, has never been as crucial as present,” Dr. Subodh says. The new shielding material, a ‘mayenite electride’ that is chemically stable, has shown exceptional microwave absorption ability in the high frequency region, specifically in the 5G band. The presence of anionic (chemical substances that possess negatively charged ion) electrons provides the compound high conductivity, which is responsible for its property of high electromagnetic wave attenuation. Conductivity Apart from conductivity, the material is also highly porous and contains a coating of graphene. The macropores and the graphene interface in the material causes the electromagnetic waves to repeatedly undergo reflections and subsequent absorption. Futuristic devices The professor points out the microwave attenuation properties of the mayenite electride in extreme high frequency region outlines its potentiality for futuristic devices designed for 5G applications. The research was undertaken as part of the Kerala University-funded Microwave Materials Laboratory scheme. The entire study was also supported by the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment with a research grant through its Kerala State Young Scientist Research Award.

The zoo clocked a revenue of Rs. 32.98 lakh in the last month of 2021. This was a huge jump from the revenue in November—Rs. 18.2 lakh. The zoo reopened on October 25, after being closed for six months in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19. In 2020, after opening post the first wave of the pandemic, the zoo collection was Rs. 13.31 lakh in December. During the Christmas break in 2021, the maximum collection logged was on December 26—Rs. 3.12 lakh. The day before, on Christmas, the zoo earned Rs. 2.89 lakh through ticket sales. With city residents out and about in good numbers to make the most of the easing of COVID restrictions, the number of visitors to the verdant zoo and museum complex has surged. There have been a number of days even before Christmas when the earnings hovered near Rs. 1 lakh, says zoo superintendent T.V. Anil Kumar. In December, the total footfall was nearly 1.18 lakh visitors. The Napier Museum too earned Rs. 2.1 lakh in December with as many as 13,669 visitors. The month before, the museum’s total collection was nearly Rs. 1.5 lakh with 7,987 visitors. Zoo and museum authorities find the trend encouraging, and hope the visitor count will keep going north till it reaches the pre-pandemic levels. Protocols in place Strict COVID-19 protocols continue to be observed, especially in the zoo to prevent any infection breakout among animals. Mr. Anil Kumar says additions to the zoo animal collection this month will help attract more visitors. A pair of sloth bears and green iguanas will be brought from the Hyderabad zoo in exchange for two pairs each of white and brown rhea chicks. There is also a proposal to bring a pair of lions and three common langurs—one male and two female—from the Indore zoo. The city zoo has only two elderly lions at present. Future plans Mr. Anilkumar says the zoo infrastructure has been improved, and focus is now on improving the animal collection.

Chinchurani has called for concerted efforts to ensure that the State’s milk demand is met entirely from domestic output and the sale of milk coming from outside is discouraged. Kerala, she said, was poised to achieve record milk production. The Minister was speaking after giving away the prizes of the ‘Milma Aiswaryolsavam’ project launched by Thiruvananthapuram Regional Cooperative Milk Producers Union of Milma (TRCMPU-Milma) during 2021 Onam for recognised Milma agencies. TRCMPU recorded an increase in production of 65,000 litres of milk daily, the Minister said, citing the figures for December. “All the three regional milk producers’ unions of Milma are vying with each other in stepping up production. While the Malabar Region is leading in milk production, the central and south regions also have envisaged various projects to increase production,” she was quoted in a statement. The subsidy on Milma’s cattle feed had been extended till January-end as a New Year gift to dairy farmers, she said. With the milk powder factory in Malappuram set to be operational in eight months, the State would be free from its dependence on neighbouring states to convert the surplus milk to milk powder, she said. Around 52 Milma agencies from the four southern districts were selected through draw of lots based on the volume of sale by them in last August. They were given prizes worth Rs. 4,71,677. TRCMPU administrative committee convenor N. Bhasurangan, who presided over the function, said TRCMPU had recorded an increase of 30,000 litre of milk per day in the four districts under its purview. TRCMPU managing director D.S. Konda said TRCMPU had set a target of achieving Rs. 1,200 crore as turnover in 2022. Milma disbursed a total of Rs. 51.74 lakh as incentive to recognised agencies as part of the ‘Milma Aiswaryolsavam’ project. Through its implementation, an 8% increase in sale was clocked in August 2021 compared to last year, a statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/promote-domestic-milk-production-says-minister/article38096368.ece

Representatives of political parties and organisations and technical experts will attend the event scheduled to be held at the Jimmy George Indoor Stadium, Vellayambalam, at 11 a.m. The project will reduce travel time between Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod to four hours, one-fourth of the present duration. It would also usher in massive changes across various sectors including industry, technology and tourism, a statement issued by the government on Sunday said. 11 stations The semi-high-speed rail project, to be implemented by the Kerala Rail Development Corporation Limited (K-Rail), will have 11 stations including one at the Cochin International Airport. The Kochi-Thiruvananthapuram travel time would be slashed to one-and-a-half hours, the government said. A total of 1,383 hectares of land will be needed for the project, which included the land needed for rehabilitation. Of this, 1,198 hectares are privately owned. The alignment of the corridor is so designed to have minimal impact on places of worship, farm lands, and sacred groves across 11 districts. According to the government, the project will affect 9,314 buildings including houses. The government has earmarked Rs. 13,362.32 crore for land acquisition. The project will be implemented with low-interest funding from international financial institutions.

Shaji, the grade sub-inspector attached to the Kovalam police, who was suspended for allegedly misbehaving with a foreigner on New Year’s eve, has petitioned the Chief Minister and the State Police Chief to revoke his suspension. In his plea sent after the Kerala Police Officers Association took up cudgels for him, the officer claimed innocence in the incident and maintained that he had acted in accordance with the instructions that were issued by his seniors. According to him, the police had imposed restrictions in carrying liquor to the Kovalam beach on the New Year’s eve to prevent untoward incidents. Without bill Nonetheless, they had permitted tourists with room bookings to carry liquor upon the production of their bills. Stephen Asberg, the Swede whose scooter was flagged down by the team during the checking, had failed to produce the bill for the three bottles that he had possessed. The sub-inspector said the team had only asked him to produce the bill and not dump the liquor. However, the foreigner emptied two bottles on his own volition and returned with the third one. Besides, he was travelling towards the beach and not his homestay.  ‘Unfair’ Mr. Shaji, who was part of the investigation team of a sensational murder case in Koliyoor in 2016, said the disciplinary action was unfair, considering he just had five months left for retirement. Meanwhile, the City police initiated departmental enquiry against three more officers—sub-inspector Aneesh, and civil police officers Maneesh and Sajith—who were part of the team in Kovalam. On the directions of General Education Minister V. Sivankutty, Mr. Asberg arrived at the office of the Assistant Commissioner, Fort, to provide a statement on a complaint he had raised. The Swede has been involved in a civil case pertaining to the purchase of a property where he operated his homestay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sub-inspector-petitions-cm-to-revoke-suspension/article38096393.ece

It is for the first time that the species Italochrysa japonica is spotted in the country. The findings are published in the recent issue of the International Scientific Journal, Halters . This is the eighth species of Italochrysa genus reported from the country, according to research scholar Suryanarayanan T.B. and research supervisor and assistant professor of the college Bijoy C., who were behind this discovery.  Chrysopidae, globally comprises 1,200 species belonging to 80 genera of which 66 species under 21 genera are known from India. “Chrysopidae is a beneficial candidate of the order Neuroptera which feed on pests in larval and adult stages. Though they are widely used as biological pest control agents, their taxonomy is least studied in India,” said Dr. Bijoy.  The larvae of Italochrysa live parasitically in ant-colonies and feed on the larvae and pupae of the ants. The adults do not feed on any insects. Italochrysa can easily be identified by the presence of a long quadrangular intramedian cell in the forewing.   “ Italochrysa japonica is a fascinating medium-sized species (8-12 mm) characterised by red horizontal lines in pronotum and abdomen white with clamp-shaped black markings at each segment. Females are easily distinguished from males by their broad abdominal tip and bilobed sub-genitals and a pillbox-shaped spermatheca with long coiled duct,” he added.   Apart from India, Italochrysa japonica has been reported from China, Japan and Korea. The research was conducted with financial assistance from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rare-green-lacewing-found-in-2-districts/article38096361.ece

A decision in this regard will be taken in the next two days, Revenue Minister R. Ashok said on Sunday. “The number of cases is rising in Mumbai, other parts of Maharashtra, and Delhi. Kolkata has already imposed a lockdown. Delhi and Maharashtra are likely to announce a lockdown anytime now. Bengaluru has also seen a sharp spike and is in the red zone, as categorised by the Union Government. So more stringent restrictions are inevitable to save lives and reduce hospitalisation. If people do not cooperate, we may be forced to go into a lockdown,” warned the Minister. He added that the CM would chair a meeting and announce new restrictions before January 7, when night curfew will come to an end. Following speculation on a possible lockdown in the media, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said later in the day in Belagavi that a decision on the nature of restrictions would be taken over the next two days. “The Revenue Minister has only reflected the Government’s stand that there will be a lockdown only if people do not cooperate,” he reiterated. Bengaluru has seen a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases over the last two weeks. On December 20, the city accounted for 146 of the 222 new cases in Karnataka. On Sunday, Karnataka recorded 1,187 new positives of which 923 were from Bengaluru alone. The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee recently recommended a lockdown if the weekly test positivity rate crossed 5%. It also recommended an action plan, including revamping COVID-19 Care Centres in Bengaluru, in preparation of a third wave. “We are preparing for a situation where the cases rise suddenly. We have asked hospitals in Bengaluru, districts, and taluk centres to ensure oxygen supply to COVID-19 wards. Technicians have been asked to test the oxygen plants, supply tubes, cylinders, and other machinery. All hospitals have been asked to place indents for purchase of medicines. We are adding 4,000 ICU beds to the pool of available beds in hospitals,” Mr. Bommai said.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:36 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Karnataka CM set to visit Ramanagaram today||With the Congress — amid concerns over COVID-19 spike — preparing for the padayatra from Mekedatu to Bengaluru demanding implementation of the drinking water project at the earliest, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s scheduled visit to Ramanagaram on Monday to inaugurate a slew of development works is being keenly watched in political circles as politics over Cauvery waters unfolds. The timing of the Chief Minister’s visit to Ramanagaram, coming less than a week before the launch of the 10-day padayatra of the Congress, is being seen as an effort by the State Government to show its intent of development in the Vokkaliga-dominated Ramanagaram district. The nearly Rs. 9,000 crore Mekedatu drinking water project site is in Ramanagaram district, bordering Tamil Nadu. On Monday, Mr. Bommai is scheduled to unveil the statues of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Nadaprabhu Kempe Gowda. He will also inaugurate several development works and lay foundation stone in Ramanagaram town. He is also scheduled to visit Magadi Assembly constituency to inaugurate development works. The Chief Minister will wind up his Ramanagaram district tour with a visit to Kempapura in Magadi taluk, where Kempe Gowda has been buried. While the nearly 170 km padayatra of the Congress from January 9 will cut through 15 Assembly segments — taking the issue closer to the Cauvery basin farmers for whom Cauvery river is an emotional issue. Ramanagaram district is central to the drinking water project as it will be a big beneficiary once it is implemented. Mounting pressure Meanwhile, bringing pressure on the Government, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar have been preparing for the padayatra while also visiting basin districts to drum up support for the issue. The two leaders were in Chamarajanagar on Sunday and they are scheduled to be in Mysuru on Monday. Mr. Bommai’s visit also follows statement by Water Resources Minister Govind Karjol on Saturday in which he threatened to release documents in the coming days that would show complicity of the Congress in the project when it was in power. Cornered by the call for padayatra, the Government has also been insisting that it is expected to receive “favourable news” from the Centre on Mekedatu shortly. The Mekedatu padayatra has also put the Janata Dal (S), which draws its strength from the Vokkaliga heartland, in a tight spot as the padayatra will touch some of its base constituencies in Ramanagaram and Bengaluru Rural. Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy represents Channapatna and his wife, Anita, represents Ramanagaram — both in Ramanagaram district while Magadi also has a JD (S) legislator. The issue has already triggered spats between the Congress and the JD (S). The JD(S) has questioned the Congress’ intent and termed the padayatra a political stunt. Mr. Kumaraswamy cited the earlier Congress padayatra in 2013 from Ballari to Kudalasangama for Upper Krishna Project – III. Meanwhile, the padayatra comes at a time when a massive rise in COVID-19 cases is expected in a possible third wave. Indicating that there could be more COVID-related restrictions in place by next week, Revenue Minister R. Ashok on Sunday — to a question by mediapersons on the Congress padayatra — said “the Government’s priority is to save lives and not any rally by any political party”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-cm-set-to-visit-ramanagaram-today/article38095789.ece

Subramanian said here on Sunday. “The infection is spreading. In the past few days, it has been rising incrementally,” he said, citing the number of fresh cases in the State, while inspecting the 17th mega vaccination camp. Though Chennai continued to lead the State in vaccination, more than five lakh persons had not yet received even one dose of the vaccine, he said. Of the 33.22 lakh students aged 15-18 for whom vaccination would be launched at Manthoppu Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Saidapet on Monday, 26 lakh would be covered through the local bodies, with support from the School Education and Higher Education Departments, he said. Of the four lakh engineering students, 46% had received the first dose and 12% the second dose. With the Union government modifying the protocol for hospital admission, those infected after completing the two-dose regimen would henceforth be advised home quarantine. Persons with symptoms would be admitted to COVID-19 Care Centres and those with serious health conditions alone would be hospitalised, Mr. Subramanian said. Currently those infected with the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus undergo swab tests on the third day of admission to hospital and again on the fifth day. If they test negative both times, they are discharged and advised treatment at home. The Health Department has proposed a protocol followed by the United Kingdom. Under it, patients with the Omicron variant are monitored virtually. They are provided with pulse oximeter and told to jot down their oxygen levels in a notebook. If the level falls below 92, they are advised to visit hospital. “We are monitoring the situation, and if cases increase, those fully vaccinated, if infected, will be brought under such a system of surveillance. More beds He said the Health Department had put up 100 beds at Injambakkam and Manjambakkam. At Chennai Trade Centre, it was proposed to put up 800 beds, and housing board facilities would have 2,000 beds. On Monday, the Higher Education Department and the Director of Collegiate Education would hold a meeting to get the hostels vacated and beds installed there. People under home quarantine could dial 044-25384520 and 044-46122300 for assistance from doctors, Mr. Bedi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/third-wave-has-started-in-tn/article38096050.ece

Several hamlets and thandas in the mandals of KV Palle and Tamballapalle, bordering with Kadapa district, buzz with rooster fights between December and February during which punters from not only Chittoor and Kadapa districts but also from Karnataka come here. Some families are known for grooming special breeds of roosters meant for the bloody and cruel completions, with betting running into crores of rupees during the season. In addition to rooster fights, the gambling activity would also be in full swing in several forest-fringe villages. Fearing police raids, even the enthusiastic gamblers from the urban side would find their way to join the batches in fields and forests-fringe areas.  Deputy SP (Madanapalle) A. Ravi Manohar Achari told The Hindu that special teams were formed to curb the prohibited rooster fights and the gambling menace.  “We have about 300 known offenders organising the rooster fights in Madanapalle sub-division. Based on the past records, we are going to bind over all of them and seize the roosters found to be groomed for the banned sports. Special teams would be posted at all vulnerable hamlets till the Sankranti festivities get over,” the Deputy SP said. 5 punters held Meanwhile, the police on Sunday morning took five punters into custody and seized two roosters, eight two-wheelers, and a cash of Rs. 19,000 at a remote locality near Devarajulapalle village of B.Kothakota mandal of Madanapalle division.

Kishan Reddy said the Central government recognises the role of ‘Manyam Hero’ Alluri Sitarama Raju's role in the freedom movement and the museum being constructed at a cost of Rs. 38 crore at Lambasingi in Visakhapatnam district will be completed this year. He said the Centre has sanctioned Rs. 18 crore for construction of Alluri Sitarama Raju's museum in Hyderabad as well and Rs. 1 crore of this has already been released. He was speaking at the 175th birth celebrations of the freedom-fighter in the city on Sunday. Mr. Reddy urged the Tourism Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Srinivas Goud and Avanti Srinivas Rao, present at the programme, to complete the construction of the museums at the earliest, apart from celebrating India’s loved son on a large scale and teach his heroics to the younger generation. Earlier, the Ministers felicitated veteran film actor Ghattamaneni Krishna, who donned the role of Alluri Sitarama Raju in the epic movie released in the late 70s. He said he was a fan of actor Krishna during his childhood and in fact learned much about the freedom fighter through the film that was a runaway hit. He said that the Centre has decided to honour freedom fighters as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav to celebrate 75 years of Indian Independence. He said his Ministry is trying to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the programme to be organised on Alluri Sitarama Raju at Vignana Bhavan in New Delhi. Mr Reddy said he will visit Mogallu village, the birth place of Alluri Sitarama Raju, on January 13. Telangana Tourism Minister Srinivas Goud said that the state government respects freedom struggle heroes, and the statue of Alluri Sitarama Raju would be erected in Kompally area in consultation with Municipal Administration Minister K. T. Rama Rao. Film actor Krishna went down the memory lane to reveal how well the movie was accepted by the people and how it got him special respect among the Telugu people. Film actor Mohan Babu was among others who were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/alluri-sitarama-raju-museum-in-city-soon/article38096335.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:36 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana to raise over Rs. 13 cr. through borrowings||The State government has decided to depend on open market borrowings (OMBs) for the fourth quarter of the current financial year to meet its financial requirements and commitments on welfare programmes. The government has indicated that it will raise Rs. 13,562 crore State development loans through auction of securities to be conducted by the Reserve Bank of India during the last quarter (January-March). The first instalment of OMB of Rs. 1,187 crore will be raised on January 4 through RBI’s core banking solution (e-Kuber) system. The government, according to the indicative calendar of market borrowings by State governments or Union Territories for the quarter January-March released by the Reserve Bank of India, has decided to raise Rs. 8,000 crore in four instalments of Rs. 2,000 crore, in addition to Rs. 1,187 crore on January 4, Rs. 1,500 crore each on February 28 and March 15 and Rs. 1,375.15 crore on March 29. The RBI said that the quantum of total market borrowings had been finalised in consultation with the State governments/Union Territories. The actual amount of borrowings and the details of the States/UTs participating would be intimated two to three days prior to the actual auction day and it would depend on the requirement of the State governments/UTs, approval from the Government of India under Article 293(3) of the Constitution of India and market conditions. The government had been banking on OMBs from the start of the financial year to meet its commitments like revised pay scales that imposed an additional Rs. 10,000 crore burden annually on the exchequer, Rythu Bandhu, farmers’ investment support scheme that entailed an expenditure of over Rs. 15,000 crore in two instalments every year and Dalit Bandhu. Dalit Bandhu, in particular, involving a financial grant of Rs. 10 lakh to each identified Dalit families across the State, would require huge amounts as the government had assured that it would provide the amount to 100 families each in the 119 Assembly constituencies spread across the State by the end of the current fiscal. The government’s resolve to depend on OMBs is apparently borne from the fact that finances were not up to the expected levels in spite of relaxation of restrictions imposed on account of the pandemic. Though some sectors like registration and stamps, excise duties and sales tax returned to the pre-COVID levels, others like the non-tax revenue were not matching the expectations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-to-raise-over-rs-13-cr-through-borrowings/article38095792.ece

People buying goods online would also get justice if they were supplied inferior quality goods instead of the products shown in the advertisements. Speaking at a consumer awareness programme organised by advocates, retired officials and representatives of various associations here, he said that the district commissions were allowed to take up complaints up to Rs. 50 lakh value and State commissions up to Rs. 2 crore value of goods and products. “Misleading advertisements are a major concern. Apart from the companies concerned, the celebrities who act in those false advertisements will also face legal consequences hereafter as per the new Act. Establishment of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission is a good step. It can handle cases involving products up to Rs. 10 crore value,” said Mr.Jagannadha Rao. The forum members K.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:36 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala Governor objects to ‘disrespect’||Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has taken exception to making national institutions and national symbols such as the offices of the President and Governors, a subject of commonplace discussion in public domain. Mr. Khan’s comment came against the backdrop of the tide of news reports triggered by the “simmering dispute” between Raj Bhavan and the government over university appointments and honorary degrees. More immediately, the "conflict" related to a purported "Raj Bhavan proposal" to award an Honorary DLitt to President Ram Nath Kovind. The dispute had prompted Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala to ask the government to clarify whether the Governor had made the recommendation. However, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan appeared to strike a different note. He reiterated that Mr. Khan had acted unlawfully if he had indeed summoned the Vice Chancellor and asked the latter to award an honorary degree to "any person." Khan clarifies Speaking to reporters in Kochi, Mr. Khan appeared to suggest that he was well within his rights to make the recommendation. Without going into the details, Mr. Khan said: "As far as me making any recommendation is concerned, if I am the Chancellor and if it is either the university or related matters, they come within the ambit of the Chancellor." The Governor requested that everyone, including the media, to exercise discretion in national matters relating to institutions and national symbols. "Article 15 (1) (a) of the Constitution make it binding on us to respect national institutions and national symbols. The President and the Governor are considered national institutions. Please exercise some discretion,” he said. Mr. Khan said he found the trend to impinge on national institutions disturbing. Trite discussions about national institutions did not augur well for national dignity and national prestige. Mr. Satheesan responded that the Governor's office was not above criticism. “I did not say that the Governor cannot recommend an Honorary DLitt for the President. But it is an abuse of power if the Governor had indeed summoned the Vice Chancellor and made such a demand,” he said. The university bestowing an Honorary DLitt on the President was not a private matter between the Governor and the Vice Chancellor. It was not a matter to “whisper in the ear of the Vice Chancellor.” Ideally, the Governor should have given the proposal to the Vice Chancellor, which the latter would submit before the Senate for consideration. “The Raj Bhavan has not clarified whether it has made such a demand. There is no clarification from the university. The CPI(M) leadership is silent,” he said. CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the government had no say in university matters. The Congress was spreading the rumour that the Governor had recommended an Honorary DLitt for the President. “If so, let the Governor clarify,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-governor-objects-to-disrespect/article38095785.ece

The third route had become a necessary alternative in view of the landslides witnessed in the other two ghat roads due to the recent rain havoc. Mr. Reddy harped on the need to stay away from disturbing the wildlife in the biodiversity-rich forest while preparing the DPR for a distance of 23 km of ghat road.

Sri Ranganadha Raju has said that the houses being constructed under the ‘Navaratnalu - Pedalandariki Illu’ (NPI) scheme will not only fulfil the dream of the poor to own a house but also contribute to the country’s long-term commitment of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions. An official release said that Mr. Raju, in a virtual conference with the officials of the department, said that under the NPI it was proposed to provide energy-efficient appliances in every house with a view to implementing the energy efficient measures. Annual savings “The estimated annual energy savings for the 15 lakh houses will be around 1,674 MUs, which is worth Rs. 539.7 crore,” the Minister said. Mr. Raju asked the department to prepare a special action plan for achieving energy efficiency in 28.3 lakh houses. He said the State government wanted to make the housing scheme a role model for the country. “Andhra Pradesh is keen on contributing to India’s commitment of reaching net-zero emissions by 2070 by implementing energy efficiency measures in the country’s biggest housing programme in the State. This will also benefit the beneficiaries in the form of reduction in power bills,” Mr. Raju said. Employment generation “The housing project will also help generate jobs in the construction sector,” Mr. Raju observed. Special Chief Secretary (Housing) Ajay Jain said the government had sanctioned 15.6 lakh houses under the PMAY-YSR Urban Scheme and PMAY-YSR Gramin Scheme in the first phase and targeted to complete them by June 2022. He said the construction of 10.72 lakh houses in 10,055 layouts had already commenced. “A special action plan will be prepared to create a facility to supply energy-efficient appliances on an optional basis,” he added. “The government is planning to provide four LED bulbs, two tube lights, two energy-efficient fans in each house,” Mr. Ajay Jain added.

The entire medical and health department staff has been asked to accomplish the task in three days, though the campaign would continue,” the official said. Airport under surveillance The DM&HO said that the Tirupati airport was kept under constant surveillance, given the growing cases of Omicron elsewhere in the country. “We have been conducting about 6,000 tests every day, and if need be, the number would be increased as per requirement. All the paramedical staff on field duties are instructed to identify the unvaccinated persons as part of the target,” Dr. Sree Hari said. The official said the drive to slap fines on those not complying with the face-mask rule would be intensified.

The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in 2020-21 was not reflected as the TDP leaders were comparing with the current prices. The fact was that the GSDP had risen to 7.23% in 2019-20 under the YSRCP government, taking Andhra Pradesh to the fourth place in the country, Mr. Rajendranath said. The revenue deficit during the first six months of the current financial year was less than that prevailed during the previous year as per the CAG report. The opposition parties were resorting to blatant lies on revenue deficit, he alleged. The bifurcation of the State had impacted the economic system of the residuary State. “Misrule during the TDP term had upped the ante. The COVID-19 and the lockdown aggravated the problem. Despite hardship, the government is working with a commitment to achieve sustainable development goals in education, health, women empowerment, agriculture and irrigation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/buggana-rebuts-telugu-desam-charge-on-states-economy/article38096532.ece

Speaking to reporters after inaugurating a handloom exhibition at the APCO showroom here, he said people should patronise these hand-woven clothes which were not just beautiful but also eco-friendly. He said the State government had been trying to address the issues of the weavers’ community and reminded that schemes like Nethanna Nestham were aimed at their welfare. Under this programme, every weaver who owned a loom was given an annual financial assistance of Rs. 24,000, he said. APCO Vice-Chairperson and Managing Director Chadalawada Nagarani said the Society was trying to find new ways to market weavers’ products. Models sashayed across the venue showcasing the latest designs of handloom garments carted in by weavers from the 13 districts of the State. She said the event was timed with occasions like New Year and Sankranthi to enable handloom-lovers to upgrade their wardrobe. The products available include hand-woven Mangalagiri cottons, Uppada Jamdani, Pedana cotton, varieties like Polavaram and Aidugullapalli, Venkatagiri silk, Dharmavaram silk saris and pavadas, dress material, shirting and other material.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/people-urged-to-patronise-handloom-weaves/article38096590.ece

Sailajanath on Sunday said works on the Polavaram project suffered a setback as the YSRCP MPs were unable to present a strong case for the multi-purpose irrigation project in Parliament. He said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who had claimed that the project would be completed by 2022, failed to get funds sanctioned by the Centre. He said it was unfortunate that the YSRCP MPs had failed to utilise the Parliament session to make a strong case for Polavaram project and get the Centre’s nod for release of funds required for its completion. The rehabilitation works, a key component of the project, were moving at a snail’s pace, he said, adding that not even one-fourth of them had been completed. The authorities had been setting deadlines for completion of the project, but were not been able to keep pace with them, Mr. Sailajanath said. The government, in its report on the project status, had admitted that only 20.19 % of the rehabilitation works had been completed so far, he said. As per the revised estimates, the construction of the project would cost Rs. 47,725 crore, but only Rs. 6,654 crore had been spent so far, the Congress leader said, adding that the government would need to spend an additional Rs. 29,000 crore on it. A survey on the social and economic status of the project oustees was not yet completed. Of the Rs. 8,112 crore the government had to pay to the evacuees, only Rs. 580 crore was paid so far, he said. Expressing concern over the plight of the project evacuees, Mr. Sailajanath said the government had so far spent only Rs. 800 crore on construction of houses and other basic amenities in the rehabilitation colonies against the required Rs. 13,212 crore. He said works on the project moved at a swift pace when the Congress was in power, but the parties that assumed power after that had been neglecting the crucial project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-mps-failed-to-get-funds-sanctioned-for-polavaram-cong/article38096591.ece

It was learnt that most of the households were reluctant to pay the charge of Rs. 120 and have been demanding the corporation to withdraw the decision. Volunteers from Ward Sachivalayams and sanitary workers in several wards have informed the households in their localities that garbage collection tax of about Rs. 120 should be paid to the corporation from the month of December. However, a number of households are not ready to pay the amount. “Not just individual or group houses, even several households in apartments are resisting to pay. They question why do they need to pay when no sanitary worker comes till their door, as garbage is collected by the watchman only and kept on the ground floor,” said a volunteer from the city. It may be remembered that the garbage collection charges proposal was passed in the GVMC Council during July 2021. The decision to levy charges on garbage collection was drawing flak since the idea was mooted long ago. General Secretary of Visakhapatnam Apartment Residents Welfare Association (VARWA) B.B. Ganesh said that the sachivalayam staff have been asked us to pay Rs. 120 for each household in our apartment. “Our apartment association has decided not to pay the amount and take up this issue with the GVMC officials. There is resistance to the garbage tax collection proposal from all section of people, but the GVMC is still taking it forward,” he said. K.S.R. Murthy from Andhra Pradesh Federation of Resident Welfare Association said that some apartments people are paying the charges, while some are reluctant to pay. He said that residents feel that Rs. 120 is too high. “Already each household is paying about Rs. 30 for garbage collection, which may be unofficial. Monthly these charges are included in maintenance charges itself in most of the apartments. Increasing the amount to Rs. 120 is condemned. The GVMC should reconsider the decision,” he added. CPI(M) leader and Corporator of Ward 78, B. Ganga Rao, said that the party is teaming up with resident welfare associations to agitate against the garbage collection charges very soon. A senior officer from the GVMC said that the decision has taken a political turn as the Opposition and the Left parties have been strongly opposing and campaigning against the idea. “Opposition party leaders have been strongly asking people not to pay the charges. In the meanwhile, several videos of people resisting to pay charges and messages are widely circulated on social media,” the officer added demanding anonymity. Admitting that there is resistance on garbage charges, GVMC Commissioner G. Lakshmisha said that it is a government’s decision. He agreed that there is political angle behind the resistance. He said that the issue will be handled carefully and the GVMC will take up awareness programmes to explain about the garbage collection charges clearly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gvmc-struggles-to-collect-garbage-charge-as-people-strongly-resist/article38096596.ece

He said that the some political parties, which have lost the faith of people, are trying to rake up a controversy on the issue for their existence. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Mr. Satyanarayana said that the decision to levy charges for garbage collection was not a new one and was being implemented at various parts of the State for the last six months. The resolutions made by all municipalities have got complete support from people. People want their surroundings and colonies to be clean, he said. The Minister said that as part of the Clean Andhra Pradesh (CLAP) initiative, the government has provided garbage collection vehicles to every sachivalayam, one sanitary inspector to every ward and laid special focus on sanitation. He said that source segregation and door-to-door garbage collection were yielding good results. “Apart from sanitation, drinking water supply, street lights and education, we have also focussed on Urban Health Centres (UHCs),” he added. Commenting on the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) demand to rename King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam and Jinnah Tower in Guntur district, the Minister questioned what were the BJP leaders doing when they were in alliance with the Telugu Desam Party(TDP). On the controvery over online sale of cinema tickets, he said the objective of the government was to ensure entertainment to the poor at a lower cost.

A dharna was organised by the NGO protesting against the remarks made by the BJP leader at a party meeting in Vijayawada, at the Gandhi statue, near the GVMC, here on Sunday. Addressing the women, Dr. Shirin Rehman took exception to the statements of Mr. Veerraju, which she said were disrespectful towards women. She said that women would have appreciated the BJP leader, if he had said that the price of cooking gas would be reduced, instead of saying that the price of liquor would be reduced. Recalling the agitations conducted by Chaitanya Sravanti for control of liquor in the past, she said that liquor was playing with the health of people. She called for bringing highly concentrated alcohol under the purview of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Dr. Shirin Rehman said that liquor, which has less than 10% ethyl alcohol, could be sold in a controlled manner by the governments. A uniform liquor policy was required for the whole country. She hoped that governments would control liquor that was ruining the health and lives of the people in the form of liver and kidney damage to addicts. She called for liquor control to realise the dream of Ayushman Bharat. Earlier, the participants paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi by garlanding his statue. The women raised slogans against liquor. Chaitanya Sravanti representatives Rukiya Bhanu, Vijaya, Vijaya Kumari, Anasuya, Sharada, Roja, Uma and Lakshmi were among those who led the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-chiefs-comments-on-liquor-were-inappropriate/article38095990.ece

The extended meeting of the All India Coordination Committee of Central Public Sector Undertaking Trade Unions, organised on Sunday ahead of the all-India general strike scheduled for February 23 and 24, witnessed the participation of CITU leaders from various States.

The VSP workers, under the aegis of the Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee (VUPPC) that has representation from almost all the trade unions, had successfully prevented members of various committees sent by the Central government to assess the plant and also prospective buyers from entering the plant premises during the last 300-odd days. Mr. Tapan Sen said the Centre had brought out the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) as its privatisation policies were being opposed by the trade unions and the workers. CITU national president K. Hemalata called upon the CITU activists to realise the importance of involving all sections of the people in the struggles against the privatisation policies.

Many parents and college students had been approaching the cyber cell in his office with such complaints, he said. Mr. Anil Pulipati, a 2012 batch group-1 officer, has recently been promoted as an Additional SP. He got a rare honour of the decoration of shoulder flaps by DGP Gautam Sawang himself in Vijayawada on Saturday.  The promotion had put more responsibilities on his shoulders and he needed to work with more dedication to implement the new initiatives of the government such as the Disha Act, Mr. Anil told The Hindu .  “Fortunately, we could ensure two lakh downloads of Disha app in the jurisdiction of 12 mandals and 14 police stations. But mere downloading is not sufficient since prevention of crime against women is important. That is why, our teams, including Mahila Rakshaks, have been visiting colleges to make girl students aware of the dangers from the predators who collect their data easily from social media platforms and the ways to protect themselves from such exploiters,” he said. “Following the directive of Superintendent of Police M. Deepika Patil, we are giving priority to visible policing as part of preventing crime. Police personnel continuously move in Hawk and Blue Colt vehicles and observe the movements of suspicious persons in public places. The CCTV footage of various areas is also constantly monitored,” he said. “The CCTV footage helped us arrest many offenders involved in theft cases. Nearly Rs. 1 crore worth of movable properties, including jewellery, have been recovered in the last few months,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/do-not-post-personal-details-on-social-media-girls-told/article38095984.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:37 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan to meet Modi, Amit Shah today||Additional financial commitments, including the pay revision for government employees, are posing a challenge to the State Government, sources say. The other key subjects likely to come up for discussion include continuation of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council, privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) and permission to dovetail PM-KISAN with the State’s Rythu Bharosa scheme. Other issues like funds for the Polavaram multipurpose project, release of pending grants from the Centre and grant of special category status to the State form part of the CM’s agenda. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy is expected to request the Prime Minister to complete the necessary formalities to retain the Council. The State Assembly passed a resolution in November 2021 withdrawing its previous statutory resolution seeking abolition of the Legislative Council, after the ruling YSRCP secured a full majority in the 58-member House. Central aid The State government has to bear the expenditure under the Rythu Bharosa if it is to be delinked with the Centre’s PM-KISAN scheme. The State has been paying Rs. 13,500, including Rs. 6,000 under PM-KISAN, to each farmer per annum, naming the scheme as YSR Rythu Bharosa. The government wants the Centre to allow A.P. to continue the existing format. In March 2021, the CM wrote a letter to the Prime Minister seeking his appointment to discuss options to revive the VSP. Mr. Reddy said he would lead a delegation of all-party leaders and representatives of trade unions to the Prime Minister. But, it did not materialise for various reasons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-to-meet-modi-amit-shah-today/article38096521.ece

The jabs would be administered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Urban PHCs, Community Health Centres (CHCs), Area Hospitals, District Hospitals, and Teaching Hospitals. Health officials said the vaccines would be given at healthcare facilities as doctors would be present there to ensure safety while immunising the teenagers who belong to “a very sensitive age group”. Besides, corporate hospitals will also be conducting the immunisation drive for the young beneficiaries. Registration was opened on CoWIN portal on Saturday. Only Covaxin will be offered to the age group. While vaccination in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits and 12 municipal corporations will be provided only after online registration, walk-in or offline facility is available in other places of the State. “This group of beneficiaries shall be accompanied by their parents for vaccination for added safety,” said officials. All those born during or before 2007 are eligible for vaccination in this drive. Precautionary dose From January 10, the government will start administering precautionary dose to healthcare workers, frontline workers and those above 60 years with co-morbidities will begin from January 10. The vaccine and dosage to be administered is yet to be communicated. “The 60+ age group with co-morbidities who have taken second dose in April 2021 will be eligible for precautionary dose in February 2022. Precautionary dose will be given as per the beneficiary’s willingness after due consultation with their doctor. They will not be actively mobilised,” Health officials stated. Citing data from the Central government, the officials said that around 20% of the beneficiaries who are aged above 60 years will be having co-morbidities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/jabs-for-15-18-age-group-from-today/article38096320.ece

A combination of approaches apart, it was the pre-eminent position of Hyderabad as vaccine capital of the world and pharmaceutical hub of the country that maintained the spotlight on the State and helped generate more interest from investors. The year began with Bharat Biotech getting emergency use authorisation for Covaxin, from the Drugs Controller General of India, making the vaccine a key arsenal in the country’s fight against COVID-19. Information Technology (IT) was another industry where Telangana sought to build on its position as a hub. U.S. life insurer Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual), leader in medical technology Medtronic, investment banking major Goldman Sachs, global financial services firm J.P. Morgan, IBM Consulting, Genpact Affine, Larsen & Toubro Infotech and 3i Infotech were some of the companies that either opened facilities or announced plans to invest and raise headcount. The New ICT Policy of the State is eyeing doubling of IT exports to Rs. 3 lakh crore and creating more than three lakh additional jobs over the next five years. In doing so, the emphasis will also be on encouraging IT firms to set up operations in tier II cities. The year, however, will be best remembered for the State government successfully wooing Kitex Group to invest, especially by despatching a private aircraft to fly the garment makers top leadership to Hyderabad from Kerala. Impressed by the response and offer, the Group, which at that point was also evaluating other States, entered into an MoU and announced it will invest Rs. 2,400 crore in Telangana. The Kitex Group is expected to commence operations in Warangal in November 2022. Another major investment commitment Telangana got in 2021 was also from a Kerala entity when Malabar Gold and Diamonds said it will be setting up a gold and diamond jewellery manufacturing unit along with a refinery with an estimated investment of Rs. 750 crore. Defence and aerospace, which is another sector for which Telangana is known, also saw several investment and expansion announcements during the year, including Boeing adding a new production line at its joint venture, Tata Boeing Aerospace, in Hyderabad, to manufacture vertical fin structures for the 737 family of airplanes. While consolidating its position in pharmaceuticals, defence and aerospace and IT, the State has turned its focus on food processing, as part of which it has unveiled plans to set up clusters across the State, electric mobility and renewable energy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/good-show-on-industrial-front/article38096328.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:04 IST,TELANGANA||Reopen CCI unit in Adilabad: KTR to Centre||Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao has requested the Central government to take steps to reopen the Cement Corporation of India (CCI)’s plant in Adilabad. In letters to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Union Heavy Industries Minister Mahendra Nath Pandey, Mr. Rama Rao said that the unit spread over 772 acres, including a township on 170 acres, had all the necessary infrastructure and limestone reserves to the tune of 48 million tonnes for mining. In addition, it had an assured 2kVA power supply system and water availability to meet its production needs. The Centre should consider the geographic advantage of Adilabad for reopening the unit that would cater to the cement needs of not just Telangana but also neighbouring States like Maharashtra, he said. Restarting of the unit would ensure accelerated development of Adilabad, considered among the backward districts, by providing employment to the youth of the district mostly hailing from tribal background. Mr. Rama Rao recalled that the State government had introduced TS-iPASS, a single window system for industrial development, which achieved significant results in terms of attracting investments into Telangana. Adilabad benefited with the introduction of TS-iPASS and the new industrial policy as soon after, Orient Cements invested US $215 million (Rs. 1,500 crore) at Devapur plant. Infrastructure and construction sectors registered a huge growth since the formation of the new State and the demand for cement was expected to continue in future too as the development was likely to continue. The Minister said that demand for cement was expected to be high in the coming days and the State government had resolved to take up strengthening of roads and highways under Gati Shakti – National Master Plan scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October. According to rating agencies such as ICRA and CRISIL and Cement Manufacturers’ Association, focus was likely to be on basic infrastructure and weaker section housing programme in addition to roads and highways that could fuel the demand for cement, he said. Reopening of the Adilabad unit would go a long way in fortifying the country’s position as a leading cement manufacturer and the Centre should consider factors like scope for imports to Gulf countries and Africa in the coming days for reviving the activities of the cement plant. Minister KTR expressed concern that the Centre was dilly-dallying on reopening the plant in spite of the positive factors. Though several representations were made for the revival of the unit in the past, there was no response. He reiterated that the government was prepared to extend incentives on a par with new industrial units if the Centre was willing to revive the Adilabad unit. He averred that the government would continue its efforts to convince the Centre to revive the unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/reopen-cci-unit-in-adilabad-ktr-to-centre/article38096348.ece

WE-Hub partnered with the government of Jammu and Kashmir and Gujarat. More collaborations are on the anvil. Meanwhile, the year saw other WE Hub-incubated startups such as Startoons Labs, a medical devices company, raising a round of angel funding, and an institutional investment from IKP Knowledge Park. The company managed to increase its headcount from three to 15 in 2021, and began production of 1,000 units of their product Pheezee, a device which tracks recovery of patients undergoing physiotherapy, and also assists physiotherapists. Others like Innogle, also a WE-Hub-incubated startup that has come up with Kadalcompass, a device that can be installed on boats and vessels of fishermen to help them identify fishing zones in real time, now plan to implement their solution. They expect to have measurable outcomes in the next couple of years. Their 5G-enabled device was adjudged as one of the best 5G use case by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Government of India. It was awarded by DoT for being one of the best use cases to educate and introduce how IoUT (Internet of Underwater Things) works with 5G.  To reach other areas in the State and tackle hurdles that hinder women from taking up entrepreneurship, incubation centres were established in Warangal and Peddapalli districts and Ramagundam.

Since the online system has come into force from November 2020, any such permissions obtained through the gram panchayats (GP) should be made to apply fresh under the TS-bPASS adjusting the fee paid so far with the revised rates, said Director of Municipal Administration (DMA) N. Satyanarayana in a communication to the municipal commissioners and District Collectors concerned. Already, about 927 unauthorised structures were demolished across the various Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), including 459 buildings from within the jurisdiction of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA), and 459 in other municipalities in the last few days. Official sources informed that about 141 district task forces have been formed with combined strength of 700 personnel under the additional collectors concerned to keep a tab on unauthorised constructions and take suitable action. Complaints received through digital mode of Twitter, email or complaints made in person or even those logged into the portal are being taken seriously. The teams have been tasked with the work of taking up inspections every 15 days in their respective municipal areas to identify the unauthorised constructions. Focus is especially on permissions sought to be obtained through the GPs illegally, taking up construction without any official sanction and building extra space against the sanctioned plans. Layouts being sold without taking the requisite permissions are also under the scanner, they said. Earlier, Special Chief Secretary Arvind Kumar had alerted the municipal officials about the such ground plus illegal constructions being carried out taking permissions from the GPs even after the online system has come into vogue in some places after reports had appeared in the media. He called for task force teams inspections at all the ongoing ground plus two floors constructions and take action wherever there are violations. The DMA has also ordered for a joint enquiry by the regional directors concerned for taking action for demolition of illegal constructions in the areas of Medchal-Malkajgiri. Commissioners of Karimnagar Municipal Corporation, Luxettipet, Boduppal, Badangpet, Turkayamjal, Nizampet and Manikonda municipalities have been asked to conduct special survey to identify violated/ unauthorised constructions if any and to take stringent action for removal of such structures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/g2-building-permission-of-gram-panchayats-not-valid/article38096331.ece

Working president of the party and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao along with Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy and Rythu Bandhu Samiti president P. Rajeshwar Reddy held a teleconference with the party ranks on Sunday and issued directions on organising the celebrations. Speaking to the cadre, Mr. Rama Rao said that neither the Chief Minister of any State nor the Prime Minister had thought of this basic scheme for farmers. “It was Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao who implemented the scheme successfully for the last four years and helped farmers take up cultivation in time by providing timely investment as grant,” he said. The Minister also said that over Rs. 50,600 crore would have reached the bank accounts of landholding farmers by January 10 as the investment support for the last eight agricultural seasons, and called it a historic moment. He suggested the party cadre to take out rallies with bullock carts and tractors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-to-celebrate-rythu-bandhu-feat/article38096345.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao as is being propagated on social media by highlighting his picture with MA&UD Minister K.T.

The resurvey was ordered after the Ministry of Transport and Highways raised doubts about the viability of the project as the southern corridor did not have traffic volume more than 5,000 to 6,000 vehicles an hour. Whether grounding such a high budget project for a small number of vehicles was the question. Proposal conceded The State government represented to the Centre that a clear picture on traffic would emerge only after north and south corridors integrated in a ring. The road will be useful only when it is aligned in a ring. The traffic on southern corridor would be similar to the northern one after that. The Ministry conceded the proposal and ordered a fresh survey, sources said. The prestigious four lane express way project estimated to cost Rs 7,512 crore was divided into two parts -- northern and southern corridors. Approved alignment The final alignment for the northern corridor over 158.46 kms which connects Sangareddy, Narsapur, Toopran, Gajwel, Jagdevpur, Bhongir, Yadadri and Chouttuppal has already been approved by the Ministry after two surveys and posed to the State government for land acquisition. The traffic on this corridor was fixed at 19,000 vehicles per hour. Nagpur-based J & J Constructions had submitted four options of alignment, of which option one was selected by the Ministry authorised National Highways Authority of India. Sources added that the government had decided to appoint staff district-wise to complete the land acquisition and provide them the requisite machinery by this month-end. About 4,000 acres of land is required for the purpose in four districts. The road will run for 40 kms each in the four districts -- Sangareddy, Medak, Siddipet and Bhongir -- and touch 80 to 100 villages. The land acquisition is proposed to be completed in one year by district-level units of officers and staff. The units will take shape by January-end. Balancing reservoirs Billed as the longed regional ring road in the country, the alignment for the project did not factor in balancing reservoirs of Kaleshwaram lift-irrigation scheme that might fall on the way. Therefore, the initial alignment for the northern corridor was done away with and fresh proposals were considered taking into account reservoirs, canals and feeder channels. The alignment was redesigned taking into consideration several diversions. This was accepted by the NHAI. The cost of land acquisition will be shared equally by State and Central governments but the construction of the road will be entirely borne by the Centre under Bharat Mala programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/central-government-orders-fresh-survey-on-regional-ring-road/article38096333.ece

It is strange how and why family members of these tipplers fail to monitor their movements and alcohol intake. Sad that the government has no fool-proof plan to avoid such tragedies and seems more bothered about revenue from alcohol sales. Is it not the responsibility of the government to bring in some regulations for bars/ wine shops and restrict timings for sale of alcohol? Why not set aside some budget from the excise revenue for the kin of those dying in drunk-driving accidents? J.P. Reddy, Nalgonda   Vaccination of children between 15-18 years and booster dose for senior citizens is a welcome move but I request the government to make arrangements at schools and colleges to provide vaccine to the students since they are better equipped to certify the age of the students. Senior citizens should be taken proper care of at the vaccination sites unlike earlier when they were made to wait inordinately. Safe drinking water as well as toilet facility should be provided. The government should also consider imposing night curfew and educate people about Omicron symptoms and treatment. B. Rajendra Prasad, R.K. Puram   Vehicular movement in the twin cities has increased multi-fold but it has been observed that many of these vehicles do not have their headlight painted black. Moreover, these vehicles are fitted with LED bulbs whose focus is high and can blind those coming in the opposite direction. Some vehicles are seen sporting multi-LED lights and the drivers do not even bother to use the dipper. I request the authorities to keep a check on these vehicles and penalise them. Vithal G. Deshpande, Warsiguda   Provision for a digital traffic signal points is necessary mainly at Yashoda Hospital (Secunderabad), Chandana shopping mall and JBS/Parade ground metro station. While these three points are being manned by the traffic police personnel, a disproportionate amount of time is being taken for vehicles awaiting their turn to go ahead. As someone frequenting the three signals twice a day, I request the GHMC authorities and traffic police to look into this aspect. Shiju N.T., West Marredpally   For the past four years, I have been writing to Dr.B.R. Ambedkar Open University to introduce English medium in certain PG courses as even Telugu students are not able to write in English by translating subject material supplied in Telugu. The then Vice-Chancellor was again posted back to this position on regular basis. In between, the in-charge V-Cs and other officials did not show any interest in this matter.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:05 IST,TELANGANA||Is a police reshuffle on the cards?||Like every new boss, even Hyderabad’s new Commissioner of Police C.V. Anand wants to have his own team, but looks like he is not in a hurry. First, the new Kotwal wants to get a grasp of things before considering a major reshuffle in the commissionerate. However, it is learnt that immediate changes might take place in the rank of sub-inspectors and a few inspectors posted at key police stations in the city. It won’t be a surprise if a key officer opts out to go to a different wing of Telangana police following the change in the helm of affairs. A few days ago, Anand gave assurance to his force that the reshuffle would be unbiased and everyone will get the opportunity to work in each wing.   Fuelling credibility to the petrol pump owned and operated by Cyberabad Police, Commissioner Stephen Raveendra said that fuel dispensed at their outlet stands for purity and surety. When a journalist asked DCP (Balanagar zone) Sundeep Gone about issues of pilferage in the petrol pump at the annual press meet recently, Mr. Raveendra grabbed the mike and doled out the promise of fuel purity before the former replied. He further said that no one need to harbour any doubts about the product quality, quantity and purity and people were welcome to get petrol from their outlets at Gachibowli and Mailardevpally. “I assure you 100% purity,” he quipped. Everyone broke into laughter.   COVID appropriate behaviour is found to be heading southwards if New Year celebrations, mass gatherings, including marriages of the family members of those in the high echelons of power, witnessed during the last few days, are any indication. Irrespective of the government imposing restrictions on rallies, public meetings, and mass gatherings, Hyderabad witnessed several events where these curbs had no bearing. What’s worse, a key Health official, who keeps on preaching COVID norms, had no respect for the curbs as his family organised a wedding by pulling out all stops! On top of it, tracing and testing norm appears to be on the back-burner as the number of samples tested every day is below 30k. (Abhinay Deshpande and B.

The party said the police at the last moment cancelled permission for the planned meeting with members of a tribal NGO at Baramura Eco Park, 36 km east of here. Mr. Banerjee kick-started his two-day visit, his fifth in the last six months, to boost the party in Tripura. “The police gave permission to a different organisation to hold an event at the same venue to be attended by State’s Tribal Welfare Minister Mevar Kumar Jamatia,” a party statement alleged. The police, however, claimed that they had communicated the matter to the West Bengal police looking after the security detail of Mr. Banerjee as no prior permission was obtained from appropriate authority of the State for his programme. On the day one of his visit, Mr. Banerjee offered prayers at the famous temple of 14 deities near Agartala, had lunch at the residence of a party worker at Teliamura in Khowai, inaugurated a party office at Teliamura and held a meeting with the State leaders here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-deny-permission-for-tmc-meet-in-tripura/article38096234.ece

A woman, whose case the State authorities have cited as a “forceful conversion to Christianity”, has denied the charge in an affidavit she filed before the court. The centre and the nuns have been booked by the local police under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2003, for allegedly “hurting Hindu religious sentiments” and “luring towards Christianity young girls” in the shelter home run by the organisation. On December 30, the local court adjourned the hearing after the Vadodara District Government Pleader Anil Desai requested the court submitting that an intimation from the office of the Government Pleader of the Gujarat High Court was awaited in the question of law over the use of Section 3 and 4 of the Act in the police case. The issue legal tenability of Sections 3 and 4 arose as the same sections have been stayed by the High Court in August 2021 while hearing two petitions challenging the inclusion of conversion in an interfaith marriage as being a “forceful conversion”.

Nine out of 30 districts received rainfall ranging from 10 mm to 53 mm last Thursday. There were reports of hailstorm occurring in some districts. The unseasonal rain caught the farmers unawares. Unable to sell the paddy as per schedule, many farmers had stored their paddy stocks at different mandis and were also guarding it.  “For the last 10 days I was trying to sell my produce. Thursday’s unexpected rain poured cold water on any hopes for sale,” Suresh Patel, a farmer in Subarnapur district told The Hindu .  Hundreds of gunny bags filled with paddy were lying in the open fields as the farmers had no clue about the impending rains and nor did they know how to save the crop from the downpour. “Nowadays, the procurement agencies keep a portion of grain from every quintal of paddy citing low quality of the grains. The farmers fear that after the rains washed away their stocks, they might now be asked to forcibly cough up higher quantity of paddy at the mandis,” said Ashok Pradhan, convener of Western Odisha Farmer Organisations Coordination Committee (WOFOCC),||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/widespread-rain-damage-paddy-crops/article38096212.ece

He said the file on the regularisation was reverted to the office of the Chief Minister with six queries, which need to be clarified by the State government. “This file was duly received by the CMO on December 31, 2021, and the reply to the queries is awaited,” he added. “I advise the Chief Minister to give reply to the queries raised on the file,” said Mr. Purohit. He added that once the reply comes, the Bill will be re-examined at the Governor’s Secretariat. The Bill on the regularisation of the services of contractual employees was passed in the State Assembly on November 11, 2021. The statement said the file was sent to Raj Bhawan on December 1, 2021. “During the month of December, the Governor was on tour to various districts of the State. The Governor concluded the tour on December 21 and thereafter, on December 23, the Chief Minister came and met him at Raj Bhawan. The file was duly studied and reverted with observation-queries to the CMO on December 31, 2021,” said the statement. ‘Deliberate delay’ On Friday, Mr. Channi had blamed the Governor for deliberate and inordinate delay in clearing the file. He accused the Governor of functioning under the political pressure of the BJP in the wake of the upcoming Assembly polls. Mr. Channi had said that if needed, he would not hesitate to stage a ‘dharna’ (sit-in) in front of the Raj Bhawan along with his Cabinet colleagues and party MLAs to safeguard the legitimate rights of the employees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/channi-giving-wrong-information/article38096227.ece

Alleging that Majithia is “roaming around openly”, Mr. Chadha claimed that pictures of the Akali leader surfaced on social media on Saturday showing him . The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader alleged the Channi government did not want to arrest Majithia as there was a “setting” between it and the Badals. Even as Punjab Police is hunting for Majithia, booked under the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substance (NDPS) Act, his pictures at the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar went viral on social media. Without mentioning when they were clicked, the Youth Akali Dal, the youth wing of the Shiromani Akali Dal, shared the leader’s photos on its official Facebook page on Saturday. The pictures surfaced at a time when Punjab Police has been conducting raids to arrest Majithia, who is a former State Minister. Last month, Majithia was booked under the NDPS Act on the basis of a 2018 report of a probe into a drug racket in the State. He is the brother-in-law of Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and brother of former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. Addressing the media here on Sunday, Mr. Chadha said nearly two weeks have passed since the registration of FIR against the Akali leader but he has not been arrested yet. It has been happening for the first time in the history of the country that an accused, whose anticipatory bail had been rejected, could not be arrested, he added. “The accused [Majithia] has been “roaming around openly”, alleged Mr. Chadha. “Yesterday [Saturday], some pictures of Majithia surfaced on social media, showing him paying obeisance at the Golden Temple,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/aap-slams-channi-for-not-arresting-majithia/article38096432.ece

The delegation also demanded Rs. 50 lakh ex gratia for the next of kin of those killed and Rs. 25 lakh each to the injured. Led by CITU’s State vice president comrade Satvir Singh, the delegation met the labourers at the mining site and gathered details about the accident and the working conditions. Mr. Singh, speaking to the labourers, said that they had been demanding right mining policy keeping in view the livelihood of the people and not for the profiteering. “Profit is not everything. Human life is more important than profit. So, there is a need for an employment-centric mining policy. Also, a welfare board on the lines of a board for construction workers be constituted for the mining labourers. The labourers, contractors and the Mining Department can make contributions to it for the welfare of the labourers and education for their children. Profiteering from mining is at its peak during the present regime,” said Mr. Singh. Later, the delegation submitted a memorandum to Tosham Sub-Divisional Officer addressed to the Chief Minister demanding a high-level judicial probe into the incident by a sitting judge of Punjab and Haryana High Court, and to bring the culprits to the book.

The joint action plan is expected to significantly enhance the State’s power generation capacity. The Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam has recently obtained environmental clearance for coal mining at Parsa East and Kante Basin’s second phase in Chhattisgarh, from where the State has been getting coal for its thermal power stations. The availability of coal from Chhattisgarh was getting affected because of near-exhaustion in the first phase. Additional Chief Secretary (Mines, Petroleum & Energy) Subodh Agarwal had said that lignite mining capacity of 10 lakh tonnes was available in Gudha West, where there was a plan to set up a power plant of 125 to 135 MW capacity in 2005 as well. Four possible options were being considered for lignite mining and power generation in the region, he said. The Central Government’s Neyveli Lignite Corporation is already generating electricity in its power plant at Gudha East, while the power is being produced by the private sector in Bikaner district’s Barsingsar village. Mr. Agarwal said the combined work of mining and power generation would increase the State’s power production capacity, reduce the cost of electricity and ensure the utilisation of lignite within the State. The road map will be submitted to the government after an analysis of all possible options. Coal crisis The Central Government had earlier allotted 1,898-hectare area for the coal blocks in Parsa East and Kante Basin to facilitate the supply of coal to the thermal power stations in Rajasthan. The State was getting coal from the region since 2013 after the approval for 762 hectares, but the crisis situation arose recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rajasthan-to-mine-lignite-for-enhanced-power-generation/article38096228.ece

He is committed to bringing back the glory of 1995 when Congress contested without any allies. “Alliances don’t work in local bodies,” he told The Hindu but talked about giving 27% seats to Other Backward Classes (OBC). “Either there will be a Congress Mayor or without Congress there can’t be a Mayor,” he said during a brief chat. Excerpts : The Congress has decided to contest all 236 seats alone in the civic polls. Don’t you think you would perform better with the alliance? In 2002 and 2007, we fought separately, though we were in an alliance. In 2012, we joined with the Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi and Republic Party of India but lost miserably. Alliances don’t work in local bodies. The day I took charge I said we would fight alone and make it happen. I want to bring back the glory we enjoyed in 1995. In 2017, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ate into INC’s share, what do you think is different this time? 2014 onward, it has been Modi tsunami. In 2017 when his party was at its peak, we were the only party to contest on all 227 seats. One of our candidates got 800 votes; it means change can happen. Till 1995, we had our Mayor and later the alliances came into being. Someone has to take a stand and I have. This time, either there will be a Congress Mayor or without Congress there can’t be a Mayor. Are you also setting the tone for 2024 Assembly elections? Local body elections are different from Assembly and Parliamentary elections; it is a different canvas altogether. As the president of Mumbai, I can only talk about the city. There are 108 local body elections going on and there are many places where the Congress is fighting on its own. So is Shiv Sena. What is the big deal? When the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was formed there were talks about it not lasting five years. Your going solo is giving credence to that. If you remember people said the MVA will not last even a month. Then it became two months and five months and so on. Look at how COVID-19 was handled by the MVA in Maharashtra; it set an example for the world. Everything was managed without support from the Central government. There will be no problem with the MVA, it will continue. What is Congress’s stand on OBC seats? I do want to politicise the issue but I fail to understand why the Centre intervened into a State affair and now refuses to disclose the empirical data. The State government has started collating its own data; but it will take time. Before the matter was in the Supreme Court, I had announced we will give 27% to OBC in the BMC polls and I stand by it. Rahul Gandhi was supposed to campaign for the elections, will his absence affect the outcome? Due to the COVID-19 situation here, Rahulji was unable to attend the party’s 137th Foundation Day. All the party workers were looking forward to it but right now the priority is to fight Omicron. Rahulji will definitely come to campaign before the elections. Does your strategy need to change with the nine extra wards added this time? Addition of wards changes the scenario. The nine extra wards mean lot of restructuring. Even if a small part of a ward goes into another ward, it makes a difference. All my party workers are present in all wards to raise concerns over fuel price hike and other financial crises.  Addition of wards changes the scenario. The nine extra wards mean lot of restructuring.

He was taken to the Police Station along with his 19-year-old friend and both got an earful from the Station House Officer (SHO). Talking to The Hindu, Deepak recalled the SHO explained to them that petty thefts often escalated into bigger crimes and turned youths into hardened criminals and advised them not to return to their old ways again. No FIR was lodged against them as they were identified as Children in Conflict with Law (CCLs). Instead, both were taken to a room full of first-time juvenile offenders like them. There were also several underprivileged children, school drop-outs, drug addicts, victims of crimes and children of under trial prisoners, who were attending classes under YUVA, an initiative of the Delhi Police aimed at making the participants realise their potential and upgrade their skills. The success of the programme launched four years ago to keep the wayward youth from crime and mainstream them through skill development courses, led Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana, launch YUVA 2.0 earlier this month. Deepak, who took a three-month course in computer hardware, now works as a field technician with Rajasthan-based company and earns Rs. 12,000 per month. After completing school, Deepak fell into bad company. "The course helped me find my calling," he said. "I send money home every month and my parents are happy that I have left my past behind," he said. Sandeep* (22), joined the YUVA classes at Kirti Nagar Police Station and has been able to get rid of his drug addiction. "I used to waste time indulging in undesirable activities. Attending the skill development course changed the course of my life," he said. Sandeep now earns Rs.20,000 a month as salesman with Kotak Mahindra Bank. "My life has a new purpose as I am able to fend for my family now," he added. A resident of Jorbagh’s Karbala Masjid, 27-year-old Amir* lost his father in 2012. He would be often detained for questioning whenever scuffles broke out at the mosque. Soon the police realised he was only staying in the mosque and had no role in the fights there and asked him to join the YUVA programme at the Lodhi Garden PS. "It has helped me to get a job with Cafe Coffee Day in Gurgaon," he said. Amir also has a good word for the policemen, who, he says, interrogate offenders in detention and later double up as teachers and ensure unhindered teaching for the likes of him. For 22-year-old Narayan*, the course at the same PS meant a way to support his family, especially after his father attempted suicide in2017 given the family's poor financial condition. “When I started searching for a job, I was duped several times. In 2019, I came to know about the YUVA classes through beat constables who were then going around promoting the initiative."  Narayan learnt about emergency medical care, how to handle patients and provide them with CPR. "The training helped me play an active role during Covid-19’s second wave as I was on ambulance duty," he said. Narayan now works as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) at Kapoor Medical Centre in Naraina. “It was my dream to be associated with the medical field and the YUVA course gave me that opportunity,” he said.   According to police, more than 14,000 youngsters have been trained under the YUVA skill training initiative between August 2017 and December 2021. Of them, 8,000 youths have secured jobs ranging from front office executives, field technicians to emergency medical providers. Some have even started their own ventures.  Mr.Asthana, who inaugurated the new YUVA training centres recently at Greater Kailash, Malviya Nagar and Saket Police Stations, said while the police is accountable for keeping a check on crime and maintaining law and order in the city, initiatives like YUVA, have helped to contain first-time criminals. "The aim is to motivate them to mend their mistakes and contribute to nation-building," he said.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 04:13 IST,||Air quality ‘severe’; rain likely this week||The minimum temperature in the Capital on Sunday settled at 5 degrees Celsius, which is 2 degrees below normal for the season, while the air quality was in the “severe” category. The IMD has forecast that temperatures will stay below normal for the next two days, after which the minimum temperature will rise and the maximum will fall under the influence of a ‘western disturbance’ that is likely to bring rain. The average 24-hour AQI score of the Capital, based on readings from 33 monitoring stations, was 404. The forecast for January 3 said “partly cloudy sky with shallow to moderate fog in the morning. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be around 21 and six degrees Celsius respectively”. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) in its forecast said that prevailing cold wave conditions in the north-west region with moderate winds blowing from west/north-west direction led to degradation in the air quality. “Maximum temperature shows a tendency to increase slightly on January 3 and 4 with mixing layer height of about one km. The net effect is likely to keep AQI in the ‘higher end of very poor’ level for the next two days. On January 5, AQI may touch ‘severe’ category due to a likely drop in the maximum temperature and consequent reduction in ventilation,” the SAFAR bulletin said. Moisture incursion The IMD in its forecast has said that two consecutive active western disturbances — the first between January 3 and 6 and the second between January 7 and 9 — with moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea are likely to affect the north-west and adjoining central India for the next seven days. “Scattered to fairly widespread light/moderate rain is likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, north Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh during January 5-7,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/air-quality-severe-rain-likely-this-week/article38096202.ece

Anxiously picking her nails, Ms. Gangwar said that a string of disputes at work and within her family led to a severe mental breakdown after which she fled to Delhi where she was rescued from the streets in 2019. At a recovery shelterfor women in the city’s Kabir Basti, 65-year-old Munish Rani struggles to settle in the space as she fondly recalls her daughter. “I don’t live with her because her husband’s family has a problem with me. I moved to this shelter close to four months ago. This was after my eyesight weakened and the hospital authorities referred me here because I had no one to take care of me,” she lamented. Mental ailments  Speaking to The Hindu , many of the homeless who have taken to shelter homes in the city, gave an insight about their past with most stating that they were either abandoned by their family members or victims of domestic abuse, which has led to severe mental ailments.  Chitrarekha, who manages the shelter at Kabir Basti, said that most of the middle-aged women who were rescued and brought to the facility were abandoned by their family members. “At first, they are very hostile because they are not familiar with living at shelters and it takes them a long time to settle in. There are also cases where some of the homeless women get violent because of their past experiences of being ill-treated. We provide them with counselling and medication but they take a long time to recover because they are suffering from trauma in most cases,” she said, adding that rarely had she seen any of the homeless women returning to their families Rajni Singh, who also manages the Karol Bagh shelter, said that while most of the homeless are spotted around places of worship and railway stations in the city, it takes multiple efforts to convince them to move into shelter homes because of “lack of trust”. Pointing towards an elderly homeless woman at the facility, she said, “We call her ‘Kamala Amma’ and she has been here since the shelter was started more than a decade ago. Kamala believes that her son will come back for her, but we know that is not the case.” Worried of exploitation “The homeless are worried about being exploited because they have lived in harsh conditions. The average age group that we have noticed in these cases are between 30 years and 65 years and most of them are migrants from other States. Some of them also come from financially sound families, but there is domestic abuse involved in these cases. They manage to get out of the situation but land up on the streets instead,” she said. According to Sanjay Kumar, who has worked towards the betterment of the homeless for over two decades through his organisation Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan, the prime age group of the homeless, over the years, stands between 26 years and 35 years. “Roughly, 40% of the homeless are from this age group, while those between 36 years and 45 years make up for close to 30%. On a structural level, poverty, migration and unemployment are prime factors which lead towards homelessness. However, there are cases such as those who come out of prison and try to lead a new life,” he said. Counselling sessions While the shelter at Karol Bagh, managed by Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan, provides regular sessions of counselling along with vocational and skill training, the requirement of similar provisions remains lacking, according to caretakers and managers, at other shelter homes. “In most instances, the mental health issues that these women suffer from, who are mostly abandoned by their families, cannot be treated completely and some residue is left behind. While there are some shelters which are pretty good, there are a lot of places where care is not taken in the required manner and they end up coming back to hospitals. It is a revolving door which keeps repeating,” said Anita Verma, an independent psychiatrist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/abused-and-deserted-homeless-try-to-find-a-meaning-to-life/article38096196.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 04:13 IST,||HC allows woman to terminate 28-week pregnancy||The Delhi High Court has said that reproductive choice is a facet of reproductive rights of a woman and a dimension of her ‘personal liberty’, while allowing a woman to terminate her 28 weeks’ pregnancy as the foetus suffers from a rare congenital heart disease. Justice Jyoti Singh agreed with the contention of the woman that continuing the pregnancy would cause grave injury to her mental health. “The petitioner (woman), in my view, is justified in contending that continuing with the pregnancy, once it is known that the foetus suffers from a rare congenital heart disease, which is a ‘substantial foetal abnormality’, with attendant complications and risks, would have a deleterious impact on her mental health,” Justice Singh said. Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, termination is permissible where the length of pregnancy does not exceed 20 weeks, on an opinion formed of a doctor, that the pregnancy would cause a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or grave injury to her physical or mental health or if there is a risk that upon birth of the child, it would suffer serious physical or mental abnormality. Where the length of pregnancy exceeds 20 weeks but not 24 weeks, termination is permissible on the opinion formed of two registered medical practitioners. However, in the present case, the woman has completed 28 weeks of pregnancy. As the MTP Act does not permit pregnancy termination beyond 24 weeks, she approached the court. The woman, 33, said she has been undergoing regular check-ups from the fifth week of her pregnancy. “From the ultrasonography report, conducted during the 20th week of gestation, it was revealed that there was choroid plexus cyst in the left lateral ventricle of the foetus,” the plea said. “However, since the foetus was only 20-week-old, foetal echocardiography was not performed. On completion of 24 weeks, foetal echo-doppler test was done...and various anomalies were found in the heart of the foetus,” the plea said. The High Court said the woman cannot be deprived of the freedom to take a decision to continue or not to continue with the pregnancy, in the backdrop of the foetal abnormalities. It took the decision based on a report by a medical board which opined that the child, if born, would have to undergo repeated cardiac surgeries. The board said the foetus suffers from a hole in the heart (ventricular septal defect), along with poorly developed valve that guards the blood vessel taking blood from the right side of the heart to lungs, which leads to both obstruction and leaking of valve. The board said that in addition to the heart disease, the foetus is likely to have associated airway problems leading to requirement of respiratory support in the first year of life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-allows-woman-to-terminate-28-week-pregnancy/article38096200.ece

Leader of Opposition in Assembly Tejashwi Yadav ridiculed Mr. Kumar for making such “laughable” comments. “According to a World Health Organisation [WHO] report drinking alcohol causes 200 diseases like AIDS, cancer, hepatitis, tuberculosis, mental health and it also increases tendency of violence against women,” the Chief Minister said while addressing a public meeting at Patel Maidan in Samastipur on December 31. The crowd clapped while the senior bureaucrats sitting on the dais smiled puckishly when Mr. Kumar named the diseases caused by drinking alcohol. Bihar, under Mr. Kumar, was declared a dry State banning liquor consumption, manufacturing and trade from April 2016 through a stringent State Excise and Prohibition Act’ 2016. Mr. Kumar further said that according to the WHO survey done in 2016 which was published in 2018, “in one year 30 lakh people died in the world due to liquor consumption which is 5.3% of the total death worldwide and 13.5% people between the age group of 20-39 have died due to drinking alcohol while, 18% commit suicide because of this and 27% road accidents happen due to liquor consumption”. “You all should turn your attention to these facts and inform others about it,” he appealed to the audience. Recently, Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana too said the prohibition law in Bihar was an example of “lack of foresight” as it could directly result in “clogging of cases in courts.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/nitishs-listing-of-diseases-caused-by-liquor-laughable/article38096215.ece

Addressing a rally organised by local MLA Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, Mr. Sidhu said rival political leaders are being asked to either join the BJP or be put behind bars. The BJP resorted to “bad politics of vote polarisation and using the Enforcement Directorate and other agencies for browbeating opponents to trigger defections”, he said. Taking a dig at the BJP for opening its office in Jalandhar, Mr. Sidhu said a party which was not seen in the State for five years has now opened its office just to “arm-twist opponents”.  “The opening of the BJP office meant that either aa jao sadey daftar Jalandhar, nahi ta kar diyange jail de andar [either join us or be behind bars],” said Mr. Sidhu.  He alleged the BJP is playing “dirty games of creating terror among its opponents”. Truthful people will remain undeterred by such “tricks” of the BJP, he said. Mr. Sidhu said the upcoming Assembly polls in the State are for the next generation and saving Punjab from the mafia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-using-central-agencies-to-trigger-defections-sidhu/article38096223.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 05:29 IST,||Pune’s NFAI to restore Satyajit Ray’s Pratidwandi||For most cinema aficionados, instant identification with legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray’s cinema comes with either the celebrated Apu Trilogy (1955-59) or other classics such as Charulata , Mahanagar (The Big City) or Ashani Sanket (Distant Thunder).   While these films have been digitally restored and are available in high-quality prints, pristine prints are lacking for Calcutta Trilogy , Ray’s other three-part series made in the Seventies. Pratidwandi (The Adversary) based on Sunil Gandopadhyay’s novel was the first in this trilogy and filmed in 1970.   On the occasion of the great auteur’s birth centenary year, Pune-based National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has started the process of restoring Ray’s films as part of National Film Heritage Mission (NFHM). Pratidwandi is the first to be taken.   “The priority is to focus on the restoration of Ray’s films’ which have not received due attention. Pratidwandi was available in poor quality, possibly because it was obtained from some other transferable source in late 1990s or early 2000s,” NFAI Director Prakash Magdum shared with The Hindu .  “The film’s producer Purnima Dutta was contacted for the original camera negative. Fortunately, she had kept it with her in Kolkata for 50 years,” he said.  Ray’s Calcutta Trilogy is a heart-wrenching story of a city in turmoil — Calcutta (now known as Kolkata), where lack of jobs takes a toll on educated men. In a brilliant performance, Dhritiman Chatterjee plays the role of the frustrated 25-year-old protagonist searching for a job in vain. The hero’s pain and feelings are captured by Ray in his inimitable style.   In his biography titled Satyajit Ray, The Inner Eye: The Biography of a Master Film-Maker , British writer Andrew Robinson notes how the filmmaker remembered Calcutta of the 1970s as “a nightmare city” when the Naxalite movement was at its peak.   The other two films that complete the Calcutta Trilogy — Seemabaddha and Jana Aranya — also portray the city in a ‘time capsule’ of the revolutionary movement.   Mrinal Sen’s Calcutta Trilogy was also filmed and released in the first half of 1970s. But the cinematic rawness that Ray brought in Pratidwandi was a new high for him, that surpassed even Pather Panchali in some ways.   “The upheaval that Calcutta was going through in the late 60s and early 70s is portrayed most sensitively and impressionably in Pratidwandi ,” Mr. Magdum said. He added how thrilled he was to get the original negatives in decent condition even after five decades.  Explaining the restoration procedure, Mr. Magdum said the first step was to recover the edited film negative used by the filmmaker during the shooting of the film. At NFAI now, the film will be first digitised using state-of-the-art archival film scanners manufactured by the Munich-based ARRI, widely known for its top-notch film cameras. The original negative was scanned on these scanners in 4K resolution. Once the digitisation is completed, the restoration process will begin. Mr. Magdum said it is a time consuming activity as it involves working on each frame. “One second is equivalent to 24 frames of the scanned film,” he said. “But once the restoration is over, film lovers will enjoy the opportunity and experience of watching the classic film in its original avatar 51 years ago.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/punes-nfai-to-restore-satyajit-rays-pratidwandi/article38096230.ece

No casualties have been reported in the fire, which has also spread to the wing housing the current National Assembly, where parliament sits. “The roof of the Old Assembly building has collapsed and is gone,” Jean-Pierre Smith, Cape Town’s mayoral committee member for safety and security, told reporters. The cause of the fire was not yet known, but an investigation was opened. President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters at the scene an arrest had been made. “Someone has been held right now and is being questioned,” he said. The historic building houses a collection of rare books and the original copy of the former Afrikaans national anthem “Die Stem Suid-Afrika” (“The Voice of South Africa”), which was already damaged. “The entire building has suffered extensively smoke and water damage,” Mr. Smith said, adding “the fire has not been contained”. It started at around 0300 GMT Sunday in the parliament complex’s oldest wing, which was completed in 1884 and has rooms covered in wood where parliamentarians once sat. It then spread to newer parts of the complex which are currently in use. “Firefighters are currently trying to control the fire in the New Wing, where the fire has affected the National Assembly Chamber,” parliamentary spokesman Moloto Mothapo told an online press conference. The imposing red and white building was still shrouded in a thick cloud of black at midday. The cordon stretched to a square where flowers were still displayed in front of the nearby St. George’s Cathedral, where anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s funeral took place on Saturday. After a simple, no-frills mass, with a cheap coffin, his ashes were interred in the cathedral on Sunday. Another fire also broke out in the older wings of parliament in March, but it was quickly contained. Cape Town suffered another major fire in April, when a blaze on the Table Mountain overlooking the city spread, ravaging part of The University of Cape Town’s library holding a collection of African archives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/fire-ravages-south-african-parliament/article38095723.ece
03 January 2022||Peshawar,||Pilgrims pray at rebuilt Pak. temple||Over 200 Hindu pilgrims from India, the U.S. and the Middle East prayed at the 100-year-old renovated Maharaja Paramhans Ji temple in Pakistan on Saturday amidst tight security, a year after the temple was demolished by a mob belonging to a radical Islamist party. The delegation of Hindus consisted of nearly 200 people from India, 15 visitors from Dubai, and the rest from the United States and other Gulf states. The temple and samadhi of Paramhans Ji in Karak district’s Teri village of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa underwent extensive repair last year after it was demolished by an angry mob in 2020, an incident that was condemned globally. The Indian pilgrims crossed over the Wagah border near Lahore and were escorted to the temple by armed personnel, officials said. The programme was organised by the Pakistani Hindu Council in collaboration with the country’s national carrier, the Pakistan International Airlines. On the day of the visit, the funerary monument and Teri village at large was fortified with 600 men from the Rangers, with Intelligence and Airport Security Force keeping guard.  Hujra s or open-air reception rooms were converted into shelters for the pilgrims. The markets near the temple were seen buzzing with tourists and children from the Hindu contingent were photographed playing cricket with local kids. Rohit Kumar, in-charge of legal affairs with the Hindu community, commended the Pakistan government for the arrangements and the repair works. “Today’s prayers at the mandir (temple) by yatri s (pilgrims) from India is a positive message for India, for promoting peace and religious harmony,” he said. Maharaja Paramhans Ji died at Teri village in 1919. Some members of the radical Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) vandalised the samadhi on December 30, 2020. The temple was also demolished in 1997. The provincial government renovated the shrine after Rs. 3.3 crore was recovered from the JUI-F mob.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pilgrims-pray-at-rebuilt-pak-temple/article38095735.ece

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:46 IST,||With recent overtures, India, China eye stability in ties after a year of tensions||The exchange of sweets at 10 posts along the India-China border on New Year’s Day and recent talks between the two sides have indicated that New Delhi and Beijing are seeking greater stability in relations and haven’t given up hopes of a breakthrough, despite the massive 1,00,000-strong troops still amassed on both sides after nearly 20 months of a stand-off and a continuing stalemate in disengagement. The hopes of 2021, when the two sides agreed to disengage and withdraw troops from Pangong lake in February, including the heights on the Kailash range taken by the Indian army just months prior, and at Gogra, were belied later in the year. According to officials, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has refused to budge on India’s demand that they restore status quo ante by withdrawing from other areas like Demchok, Hot Springs and Depsang plains. Unexpected talks Even so, the exchanges on January 1, several rounds of talks between diplomats and military commanders, and an unexpectedly upbeat farewell video conference between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the outgoing Indian Ambassador Vikram Misri last month, where both sides spoke of uninterrupted communication as the “silver lining” around the dark clouds that engulf bilateral relations which are perhaps at their worst point since the 1980s, are indications of both sides seeking an improvement. It is particularly significant that the exchanges took place in areas such as Demchok and Depsang that saw PLA troops occupy land claimed by India, leading to criticisms that the Modi government may be looking to agree to a compromise in these areas. That Mr. Wang chose to speak with Mr. Misri, and moreover, that the Chinese Foreign Ministry sought to publicise the meeting despite the state of relations and the recently shrill rhetoric from the state media in China, was also seen by observers as significant. Mr. Misri has now taken over as Deputy National Security Adviser. “Even though certain challenges since last year had overpowered the vast opportunities in the relationship, he was hopeful that with continued communication at all levels, the two sides would be able to resolve the current difficulties”, a readout from the Indian Embassy said. Another positive sign came in December after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, and Mr. Putin’s virtual conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping later in the same month. A senior Kremlin aide said the leaders had discussed holding a Russia-India-China trilateral in the “near future”, a possibility the Ministry of External Affairs has neither confirmed nor denied. Regardless of the possibilities, the situation at the LAC remains fraught with risk, given the likelihood of a recurrence of violence with both disengagement and de-escalation nowhere near completed, and an official said that the most they can hope for is that ties “stabilise” in the coming year as the Indian army attempts to hold off Beijing’s territorial aggressions. As of Sunday evening, Beijing’s official media was yet to mention the New Year’s Day exchange, and instead, state media outlets shared a video from Galwan Valley showing PLA troops there pledging to protect “every inch” of Chinese territory. New border law Beijing is also pushing ahead with bolstering its infrastructure in border areas and has passed a new border law that came into effect on January 1. The law calls on government agencies in China to take steps to “safeguard sovereignty”. Beijing has also accelerated plans to build civilian “frontier” villages, including in disputed areas, while the Chinese government on December 30 issued new “standardised” names for 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh, to be used on Chinese maps, ahead of the law coming into effect. With the boundary stalemate, ties in other areas have come to a standstill. Curbs on Chinese investment have seen Chinese FDI to India plummet. Trade ties Bilateral trade has, however, continued to boom, and in 2021 reached the highest ever. After 11 months of the year, two-way trade reached $114.26 billion, with Chinese exports to India touching a whopping $87.9 billion and Indian exports accounting for $26.35 billion, both record figures, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/with-recent-overtures-india-china-eye-stability-in-ties-after-a-year-of-tensions/article38095733.ece
03 January 2022||Paris,||France removes EU flag from Arc de Triomphe||French authorities took down a temporary installation of the European Union flag from the Arc de Triomphe monument in Paris on Sunday, after rightwing opponents of President Emmanuel Macron accused him of “erasing” French identity. The giant blue flag was raised in place of a French flag on New Year’s Eve to mark France’s turn at the rotating presidency of the EU Council. The arch, a monument to war dead, and other landmarks including the Eiffel Tower and the Pantheon are also being illuminated with blue lights for the remainder of this week. But Macron’s rightwing rivals for the presidential election four months away seized on the removal of the tricolor flag, calling it an affront to France’s heritage and its veterans. “Preside over Europe yes, erase French identity no!” tweeted Valerie Pecresse, the conservative candidate who polls indicate could be the main challenger to Macron in the upcoming vote. She urged him to restore the French flag, saying, “We owe it to our soldiers who spilled their blood for it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/france-removes-eu-flag-from-arc-de-triomphe/article38095725.ece

The person was earlier spotted at the eastern portion of the border, but avoided capture by South Korean troops on Saturday night.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:46 IST,||This NSP cannot change Pakistan’s direction||At its 36th meeting on December 27, 2021, Pakistan’s National Security Committee (NSC) approved the country’s “first ever” National Security Policy (NSP). Seven years in the making, the NSP is designed to be a “Comprehensive National Security Framework” and covers a five-year period from 2022-26. The NSP seeks to ensure the “safety, security and dignity of the citizen of Pakistan”. To achieve this objective, it puts “economic security” at its “core”. Apart from economic and military matters the NSP also covers issues relating to foreign policy, terrorism, water security and demographics. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who chaired the NSC meeting, called the NSP’s approval a “historic moment”. Pakistan’s cabinet endorsed the NSP on December 28. Marks a fundamental change Significantly, a public version of the NSP has not been released as yet. According to a press release by the office of the Pakistan Prime Minister it will be done “in due course”. However, Pakistan’s National Security Adviser, Moeed W. Yusuf said on December 28 that it will be done within a week to 10 days. Should it be released soon, it would show that a kind of consensus has been achieved between the elected government and the Pakistan Army on the NSP. A delay, however, could be indicative of remaining difficulties. But even if the army is ostensibly on board, the question is whether it is willing to turn Pakistan away, in the true sense, from being a hard military security state into a state where the military competes for resources with other state institutions and the final decision is taken by the political leadership. The logic of giving primacy to the economy is that national policies will be directed through resource allocation towards development. That would mark a fundamental change in Pakistan’s direction, for it would reduce the army’s demand for resources. It’s the Army first The Pakistan Army has always laid first claim on the country’s revenues. It has never allowed light to fully shine on the defence expenditure. Nor, for that matter, does it allow scrutiny of its vast network of business enterprises and real estate for the benefit of its officers and men. From time to time, some officers have laid stress on the importance of “geo-economics” but seldom has the army shown any willingness to divert resources from defence to other areas. And, it has convinced the majority of the people that sacrifices have to be made for national defence because of enemies external, principally India, and internal. More than 40 years ago during Pakistan President Zia-ul-Haq’s period, a Pakistani comparing India to his own country told me that his country’s army controlled everything in the name of defence, but “what is it really defending but itself”? Despite the passage of time and the geo-political global and regional transformation, the veracity of my interlocutor’s assertion holds true today too. Thus, if the NSP is to mark a substantial change in Pakistan’s systems and governance, the first step has to be transparency in actual military expenditures and the dismantling of what the brave Pakistani scholar Ayesha Siddiqa terms as “Mil.Inc.”. That does not seem to be on the horizon. An ‘India obsession’ In the NSP’s context, the question that Pakistan also needs to ask itself is this: can it ever achieve human security for its people and put the country on the path of normalcy and growth without radically changing its India policy? As the product of the two-nation theory, Pakistan has defined its very identity — to put it crudely but bluntly — thus: it is what India is not. Almost 75 years since its creation, Pakistan continues its search for a positive identity which will allow it to give up its India obsession. Its so-called commitment to the ‘Kashmir cause’ is a sub-set of its overall negative approach to India. This deep-seated hostility has prevented it from adopting rational policies towards India. Rational approaches would have enabled it to ‘legally’ adhere to its positions but ‘practically’ have ties with India in areas that would be in its national interest. An example of its irrational approach is the position it has taken on the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) issue after the constitutional changes of August 5, 2019. Pakistan could have maintained its stand on J&K and yet traded with India as that was in its interest to do so. Instead, it decided to suspend the abridged commercial relationship that existed. Countries can adopt selective approaches to register protests. A sacrifice of interests is especially futile where such sacrifice does not yield results as it obviously has not, from Pakistan’s standpoint, on J&K developments, post 2019. While Pakistan’s ideology and mindset prevents it from developing realistic ties with India, it also has a bearing on its social development and the economic management of the country apart from draining resources from development to defence. Pakistan aspires to become a society imbued with moderate Islamic faith. However, its security apparatus has actively sought to use Islamism against India. This has led it to pander to violent sectarian groups and marginalise progressive elements of civil society. The culture of Islamism is illustrated by the veneration of the grave of Mumtaz Qadri, the killer of Punjab Governor Salman Taseer. It is astonishing that Qadri who was executed for the crime of murdering one he was duty bound to protect was lauded by millions for serving the cause of Islam by killing Taseer who was perceived to be sympathising with a blasphemy accused. There is another aspect. Islamist forces are also allies of feudal elements in the Pakistani political elite, and together they support inimical and irrational policies towards India, including in economic and commercial sectors. China as anchor The natural economic partner for a country such as Pakistan is a large neighbour. This is especially so in an era when economies are not barricaded as some were for several decades in the second half of the previous century. Stoutly refusing to open up trade with India, Pakistan has looked to other economic and commercial partners among whom China is by far the most important. The security relationship was the anchor of the China-Pakistan ties. Now, Pakistan hopes that China will offer its assistance to transform its economy. It looks to the mechanisms under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to play a crucial role through connectivity, port development, power production and other investments. All this may be of some help but they cannot be a substitute to be integrated with a large neighbouring economy. That can only come about with the opening of trade and connectivity with India. Over 25 years ago, Chinese President Jiang Zemin had, in an address to the Pakistani Senate, spoken of the need to temporarily shelve disputes so that they do not impact inter-state ties. He may have mentioned this in the context of Chinese-South Asian ties, but these comments applied to Pakistani approaches to its neighbours as well. But Jiang Zemin’s words were simply ignored by the Pakistanis. Today, with the regional and international context entirely changed, it is unlikely that President Xi Jinping will give Pakistan the same advice. However, that does not erode the veracity of Jiang Zemin’s views. Thus, irrespective of what the NSP may state, the Pakistan people can neither have human security nor a successful economy without cooperative ties with India. That the Pakistan Army and the political elite are unwilling to have. The NSP, therefore, cannot change Pakistan’s unhappy direction.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:31 IST,||From selective to universal engagement||The remarkable hyper activism of Indian foreign policy will be the legacy of 2021, though the COVID-19 situation was not congenial for travel, high-level meetings on sensitive matters and protocol. Those who travelled ran the risk of falling sick in foreign lands. Every time I saw External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar braving it all with a mask that covered much of his stern and unsmiling face, with the demeanor and stride of a determined crusader, I whispered a prayer for my former colleague’s safety. At a time when diplomacy had retreated behind laptops, he unhesitatingly undertook extensive journeys, making him the most visible face of India last year. The activism was inevitable with geopolitics having turned topsy-turvy not only by the pandemic, but also by the events before and after it through periodical elections, which brought new dramatis personae to the centre stage, and the volatility of the economic and political changes across the world. The pandemic turned the wind of change into a whirlwind and it became necessary for nations to move fast even to stay in their positions. The paradigm shift in foreign policy was palpable and the field was open to nimble-footed and decisive governments, not to hesitant, doubting, calculating ones. A decisive Prime Minister and a seasoned diplomat as the External Affairs Minister (EAM) rose to the challenges of the times for India. Priorities in 2021 Coping with the change from President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden and the consequent changes in U.S. policy were big enough to keep the world leaders on tenterhooks. But even that appeared small against the increased onslaught of the pandemic. India suddenly became the epicentre of the tragedy after a relatively easy period which gave it the honor of being the pharmacy of the world. The exposure of the inefficiency of India’s health system and the panic caused by pictures of unattended funeral pyres put the country in the defensive and weakened its credibility as it tried to contribute to the resolution of global issues. Every global forum was compelled to find vaccines, medicines, masks and sanitisers when it met to deal with political and economic crises. For India, the biggest preoccupation of 2021 was the effort to get China to disengage in areas in Ladakh. Dialogue, military preparedness and economic pressure met with limited success. The sooner we achieve disengagement in the remaining sectors, the better it will be for India to be more effective in the other areas of concern. Much of the time for dialogue with others must have been spent on establishing the rationale of our position on the border. Afghanistan turned out to be a bigger crisis than expected, with the Taliban’s walkover in Kabul. India appeared to be the sole defender of the Americans against Pakistan, China, Iran, Russia and others. Bringing some civility to the Taliban in Kabul became a high priority in the face of a Pakistan-China-Taliban axis with some support from Russia and Iran. Wherever the Prime Minister and EAM appeared either in person or on virtual platforms, priority was given to Afghanistan and anti-terrorism rather than Chinese expansionism. Climate change, United Nations reform, and charges of India being only a part-democracy also demanded attention, but the Indian interest in these areas did not appear as urgent and crucial as in the other areas. India threatened to stand out of the line on the matter of net-zero emission target years, but succumbed to the pressure to commit more on promoting renewable energy and phasing down of coal. UN reform was not going anywhere and there was no need to concede on our position on expansion of the Security Council. As for Indian democracy, the Prime Minister’s assertion that India is the “mother of democracy” and the EAM’s primacy of governance went uncontested at the political level. What made Indian diplomacy hectic during the year was a distinct change of style of openness and readiness to deal with friends and foes alike. From selective alignment, India moved to universal engagement, even to the extent of convening meetings with antagonists. Engagements with the U.S. went beyond familiarisation with the new government to increased commitment to Quad and acceptance of AUKUS and formation of the ‘western Quad’, with the U.S., Israel and the UAE. The engagement with China at the level of commanders and diplomats was intense, and ministerial interaction continued even when China tore up many fundamental agreements that sustained the dialogue for many years. Major agreements were signed with Russia, despite the American threat of CAATSA against S-400 missiles and the Russian inclination to align with China in the days to come. Patience, diligence and firmness rather than reaching conclusions through concessions were the ingredients of Indian strategy. India attended a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, where a sub-group led by China took its own decisions on Afghanistan. We also attended a meeting of Russia, China and India. Such an approach demanded high-level personal involvement at the senior levels. Perhaps because of the unique geopolitical situation, India gave particular importance to its presidency of the UN Security Council in August 2021. Unprecedented in the history of the UN, an event at the Security Council was chaired by the Prime Minister. India also brought global issues of particular importance to the agenda of the month. Significant inputs were provided during discussions on issues like maritime security, peacekeeping and anti-terrorism for active consideration in the future. Although it is illusory to believe that the way has been cleared for India’s permanent membership of the Security Council, India’s diplomatic capabilities and its commitment to the UN were demonstrated yet again. The Foreign Secretary’s visit to Myanmar to engage the military junta at a time when Aung San Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders are in prison may raise eyebrows in many countries, but this is another instance of India’s readiness to engage those in power to explore possibilities of friendship and co-operation. The intention is to prevent China from having a field day in Myanmar. Two major challenges Sadly, the extraordinary efforts made by India have not been fruitful in the cases of China and Afghanistan. China has not shown willingness to disengage in Ladakh and withdraw to the previous positions behind the Line of Actual Control. But the expectation is that China will take a more reasonable approach once the current convulsions end with the beginning of another term for President Xi Jinping. He cannot afford to show any sign of weakness in his external and internal policies at this critical time. As for Afghanistan, the haul may be longer, given the stubbornness of the Taliban and its proclivity to endanger its own people for the purity of faith. The international community is already moving in the direction of rescuing the regime by providing humanitarian assistance even without any change in the repressive regime. India has a formidable challenge in Afghanistan, regardless of its open and universal engagement with all concerned. But India’s new style of diplomacy will have an impact in shaping the world of the future. T.P.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:46 IST,||State schemes can cast a lifeline to this welfare plan||India accounts for a fifth of the total childbirths in the world, with a maternal mortality rate of 113 per 1,00,000 live births. On January 1, 2017, the Government rolled out the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), a conditional cash transfer of Rs. 5,000 for pregnant and lactating mothers for the first live birth, where a ‘cash incentive of Rs. 5,000 is provided directly to the bank/post office account of pregnant women and lactating mothers for the first living child of the family (subject to fulfilling specific conditions relating to maternal and child health)’. It is aimed at improving health-seeking behaviour and to compensate for wage loss for pregnant women, particularly in the unorganised sectors. However, the performance of the scheme has been deficient, necessitating urgent need for improvement especially when the novel coronavirus pandemic has resulted in economic shocks for 260 lakh women who deliver on an average a child each year in India. How the PMMVY fares Since its inception, the PMMVY has covered 2.01 crore women nationally, disbursing a total amount of Rs. 8,722 crore. But the annual estimate of the targeted beneficiaries by the Government of India has remained the same over the years. While the estimated eligible population of pregnant and lactating mothers in India was 128.7 lakh for 2017-18 (as in a report by the Centre for Policy Research 2019-20), the target set by the Government was 51.70 lakh beneficiaries, which is only 40% of the eligible population. This means that we have an exclusion error of at least 60% since 2017, as the target has remained unchanged over the years. Further, the enrolment and disbursements under the scheme have witnessed a downward fall in the last two years, as in the data provided by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (WCD) in response to my parliamentary questions. In 2020-21, more than 50% of registered beneficiaries did not receive all three instalments and there was a 9% drop in enrolment under the scheme. Despite the Government’s continued emphasis on maternal and child health, the overall budget for women and child development was reduced by 20% for 2021-22. Additionally, Budget allocation for the PMMVY has also been slashed as it has been clubbed under SAMARTHYA along with multiple other schemes such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Mahila Shakti Kendra and Gender Budgeting/Research/Training. The overall budget of SAMARTHYA is Rs. 2,522 crore, which is nearly equivalent to the budget of PMMVY alone in the previous financial years. States show the way While the Centre rolled out the PMMVY scheme at the national level, States such as Odisha, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, respectively, chose to implement State-specific schemes for maternity benefits in the form of MAMATA (2011) or the maternity entitlement scheme, the KCR Kit (2017), which is has items such as KCR Kit contains baby oil, soaps, mosquito net and dresses) and the Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit Scheme (MRMBS) with relatively increased coverage and higher maternity benefits. Odisha’s MAMATA, for instance, has been offering a conditional cash transfer of Rs. 5,000 as maternity benefit for up to two live births for more than a decade now. In a comparative analysis between the PMMVY and MAMATA for 2020-21, the PMMVY shows poor performance with a 52% drop in the number of beneficiaries covered while MAMATA showcased a 57% increase in women who received all the instalments. The scheme stands as a testament to an inclusive and efficient implementation of the maternity benefit programme, thereby serving as promising evidence for the Centre to improve the PMMVY in line with the Odisha Government Scheme. Steps to take Here is the way forward for the PMMVY. Extend the maternity benefit under the PMMVY to the second live birth The predecessor scheme, the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana was applicable for two live births. Of the total live births in India, 49.5% comprises first-order births and 29.9% are second-order births, as per Sample Registration Survey 2018. It is imperative to include second live birth under the maternity benefit cover particularly for women in the unorganised sector who are more vulnerable to economic shocks and nutrition loss for all child births. There must be an increase in the maternity benefit amount. Since the primary objective of the PMMVY is to provide partial wage compensation, we need to revisit the maternity benefit amount offered under the scheme. Most women continue to work during and post-pregnancy since they cannot afford to lose wages; additionally, they also spend on out-of-pocket expenses during pregnancy. The current entitlement of Rs. 5,000 provided over one year amounts to one month’s wage loss (as per the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act wage rate of Rs. 202). In line with the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 which mandates 12 weeks of maternity leave for women with two or more children, pregnant and lactating mothers should receive 12 weeks of wage compensation amounting to Rs. 15,000. Simplify the process Eliminate correction queues. Further, the implementation gaps in the PMMVY scheme lead to reduced coverage. These gaps stem from a lack of awareness within targeted beneficiaries and process level challenges. The current registration form requires a mother and child protection (MPC) card, husband’s Aadhaar card, bank passbook and registration form for each of the three instalments, resulting in delayed, rejected or pending applications. A simplification of the process can result in increased registration of beneficiaries. To fulfill India’s commitment towards the Sustainable Development Goal of improving maternal health, an ambitious Prime Minister’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nourishment (POSHAN) Abhiyan and a national maternity benefit scheme are promising initiatives by the Centre. However, targets can be achieved only if we revisit the design and implementation of this scheme, drawing lessons from States such as Odisha which are successfully prioritising maternal health and nutrition in a pragmatic manner.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:31 IST,||The crypto assets conundrum||The Indian Government appears convinced that cryptocurrency is a dangerous proposition. Cryptocurrency enables relatively invisible transactions, with serious implications for crime, terrorism, money laundering, tax evasion, etc. Another worry is that a crypto mania is getting built of purely speculative investments. The eventual bursting of such bubbles will badly hurt people. Further, crypto threatens the state’s macro-economic role. On the other hand, the Government wants to avoid any tech-unfriendly image. Caught in this dilemma, it proposes that cryptocurrencies be banned but crypto assets be legalised and strongly regulated. This way, the problem of invisible value transactions gets taken care of, the interests of investors are protected, and the tech industry’s demand is met halfway. This ‘solution’, however, is based on a flawed premise, rendering it unworkable in the medium to long term. The distinction between an asset and currency may not be so much legal as it is about the inherent characteristic of what is considered an asset or currency. Land, gold and stocks do not lend themselves to becoming common mediums of exchange because these assets are not easily divisible and portable. On the other hand, crypto is more divisible and portable than even physical currency. Once legalised, a crypto asset’s creep towards becoming a medium of exchange would be unstoppable. Underlying value The same argument can also be made in another manner. Crypto assets are either ‘purely speculative assets’ or they have some underlying value, in which case such ‘value’ can consist only in their future as a medium of exchange. Both ways they are very problematic. A purely speculative asset has zero underlying value (unlike assets like land and gold). Regulators watch out for the purely speculative elements of any assets market, considering them dangerous. The 2008 financial crash happened largely because some ‘assets’ lost all connection to any kind of underlying value. When this happens, it is just a bubble waiting to burst, gravely hurting people. If the Government legalises a purely speculative asset, it provides a green signal to investors to invest in it and blow into the bubble. When the bubble bursts, there may be a heavy political price to pay for the ruling dispensation. Or crypto does have some ‘underlying value’. This value can only be in terms of the expectation that crypto assets will eventually gain widespread acceptance as currency. Such an expectation indeed has a good basis in the fact that crypto is preferred as a currency by many powerful groups because it is very private and less amenable to regulatory oversight. It basically removes the state from its existing status at the heart of currency systems. The question then is: by legalising crypto assets, is the Government trying to promote this ‘underlying value’ of crypto as a future currency with these ‘unique characteristics’? Evidently not, since it wants to ban crypto as a medium of exchange precisely because of these characteristics. So, in legally recognising crypto assets, the Government is either promoting a dangerous ‘purely speculative asset’, which, when the bubble bursts, will lead to all-around harm; or it is itself promoting the ‘underlying value’ of crypto assets in terms of their unstoppable eventual conversion to a currency. Not a tech decision The argument that crypto assets need be legalised for promoting blockchain technologies and being pro-future is weak, if not bogus. Legalising crypto assets primarily to support blockchain technology is like signing on to the use of space as a new frontier of war just because it would promote India’s space industry. Blockchain has thousands of applications other than crypto. Various innovations and services, including using blockchains and those in the realm of decentralised finance, are indeed possible over the top of a monopoly platform of a Central Bank Digital Currency, as an alternative to private cryptocurrencies. The real decision that the Government faces is not about supporting a new technology. Certain groups and people want the state to mostly be out of currency systems because that serves their interests. Since the society is now at a fork to decide whether the future of currency will be public or private, what the Government has to decide is the side it would throw its weight behind. The argument to let both public and private currencies co-exist, leaving it to ‘people’s choice’, is also deceptive. The powerful resent the distributive potential contained in public currency systems. They will all immediately lap up and push private currencies. Their combined economic heft itself would ensure an overwhelming dominance of private currencies over the public currency. It is true that India’s decision alone would not determine this issue. But with China having already banned crypto, what India decides at this stage would count for a lot.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:31 IST,||Transport projects not on track||In November 2021, the Rs. 14,132 crore Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR), built on the public-private partnership (PPP) mode by the concessionaire, L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad), completed four years. It is going to be a while before the Telangana capital sees the next phase of metro rail. The first phase of the 69.2-km metro passing through three dense corridors of the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad was until recently the second largest metro rail network after Delhi. It seems like it is going to lose this tag soon as other cities are either extending or building new metro networks at a rapid pace. Hyderabad is unlikely to improve the public transport system as there is no progress in the proposed second phase of the metro linking Gachibowli to the Shamshabad International Airport. Three years ago, the State Government had announced the acceptance of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s detailed project report to build a ‘fast metro’ over 31 km at a cost of Rs. 9,000 crore. But no steps were taken thereafter. Another proposal was to connect Nagole and L.B. Nagar (5 km). This was to complete the circular route of the first phase of the metro rail connecting all the terminal stations. There was also promise of a new line from BHEL-R.C. Puram to Lakdikapul (21 km). Till the COVID-19 outbreak, HMR was carrying more than 4 lakh passengers a day and saved an estimated 4.7 crore litres of fuel. Last year, L&TMRH declared a loss of about Rs. 1,780 crore due to COVID-19-induced lockdowns and sought ‘suitable compensation’ as project ‘delays’. These include, for instance, the present ruling dispensation demanding an alignment change to protect the heritage at Sultan Bazar and near the Legislative Assembly and disallowing the metro in the Old City bowing to the pressure from the Majlis Party. Later, this was completed according to the original alignment save for the Old City route. A committee headed by the Chief Secretary has been formed to “look into the issue” of providing compensation to L&TMRH. The Centre too has not helped matters by withholding the release of the balance amount of Rs. 254 crore of the Rs. 1,458 crore it had assured for the project. Prior to the metro rail project, the capital region was serviced by the ground rail-based Multi-Modal Transport System (MMTS) built and run jointly with the Indian Railways connecting Hyderabad-Secunderabad-Falaknuma-Lingampally. It was launched in 2003. Phase II of the project has been stalled for the past three years with the State Government inexplicably not releasing its share of about Rs. 500 crore. As a result, South Central Railway has delayed implementation despite completing a majority of the work. And so, people on the outskirts and the surrounding villages are being deprived of an affordable and quick transport mode to and fro from the twin cities. The ticket for MMTS starts at Rs. 5 and the metro fare begins from Rs. 10. These were projects initiated in united Andhra Pradesh. The Telangana Government sought a 32-km extension of the Ghatkesar line (part of Phase 2) till Raigir, three km away from Yadadari, where redevelopment of the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple is nearing completion, a project dear to the Chief Minister. But tenders had to be cancelled as the Government did not release Rs. 290 crore of the estimated cost of Rs. 412.26 crore. All this is enough indication that public transport is not a priority of the Government despite its proclamations. With the public sector TSRTC having its own infrastructure limitations, citizens of the twin cities are still sadly forced to depend on private transport. geetanath.v@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/transport-projects-not-on-track/article38095717.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:46 IST,||Patchwork policy||On New Year’s eve, nine hours before a new GST rate of 12% was to kick in for readymade garments and fabrics, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the plan is off and the existing 5% rate will continue into 2022, or at least for its first quarter. The decision was made at an emergency meeting of the GST Council, which had approved the higher tax on textiles at its last meeting in September 2021 to correct the anomaly of an inverted duty structure. While the GST rate on manmade fibre is 18% and yarn made from the same is taxed at 12%, the rate on the final fabric was 5%, ostensibly creating a headache for textile producers which the Council had sought to alleviate. The move to raise that rate to 12%, along with that on footwear costing less than Rs. 1,000 a pair, had been on the Council’s agenda for over a year but had been kept on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s adverse effects on households. Explaining the rethink to hold off the rate hikes that were to become effective January 1, the Finance Minister indicated that the original decision was arrived at after several parleys that explored, among other things, the likely impact on consumers. Yet, a letter from the Gujarat Finance Minister she had received on December 29, along with representations from industry, prompted a review. Although the rate hike was aimed at helping producers get easier credit for taxes paid on inputs, that is not how it was seen by several players in an industry that has historically been one of India’s largest employment creators and contributes around 2% to the overall economy. Last month, many lathes in the textile industry were left idling for a day, in what may be the first ever strike that has not been triggered by industrial unrest in the sector that last witnessed debilitating strikes from labour unions in the 1980s. Those protests, along with some States’ missives to the Centre, warning of significant factory closures and job losses, had failed to move the needle and the industry had resigned itself to the new rates. Perhaps, it was fortuitous that most State Finance Ministers, who are members of the Council, were already expected in the capital for a consultation on the Union Budget for 2022-23. A ministerial group already tasked with rationalising inverted duty structures across products and reviewing the multiple rate slabs of the GST regime, has now been assigned the additional task to suggest an appropriate structure for textile products; it has two more months to finalise its report. It is unlikely that these broader corrections will take place before the coming State Assembly polls conclude and this time could be used for wider consultations with industry, consumers and States before pencilling in new rates and avoiding such about-turns. The course correction needs to be navigated more deftly and with greater purpose, if India hopes to revive private investments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/patchwork-policy/article38095705.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:46 IST,||Fair and safe||All indications are that elections to five State Assemblies — Goa, Manipur, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab — will be held on time, regardless of the rising new wave of COVID-19. The three-member Election Commission of India (ECI) has visited four States over the past weeks to assess the preparedness, which is usually one of the last steps before the announcement of the poll schedule. Its visit to Manipur is expected soon. Conducting an election in normal times is one thing, but doing so in the midst of a pandemic is quite another. On the ECI’s visit to U.P. last week, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra said that all parties wanted the polls to be on schedule. He said the ECI would look into the enforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviour in campaigning and voting after the schedule is announced. Once the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is in force, the ECI’s COVID-related restrictions, first drawn up in August 2020 ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections, will also be in play. The rules include mandatory wearing of masks during the whole election process, from campaigning to casting of votes, holding rallies in identified grounds with social distancing measures in place, and reducing the number of people allowed in roadshows. In the wake of the second wave of the pandemic in April 2021, the ECI put in place more measures such as a longer silence period before polling, reducing the time for campaigning. Going by the spree of inaugurations and groundbreaking ceremonies for government projects by the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers and Ministers, the election season has already begun. On January 2, the Prime Minister laid the foundation for the Major Dhyan Chand Sports University in Meerut, with a large, mostly mask-less crowd in attendance. Huge gatherings organised by all parties are taking place in the poll-bound States. Official events are being turned into campaign opportunities by those in power, raising a different question of propriety. The MCC imposes special restrictions on the party in power, which, it says, “shall ensure that no cause is given for any complaint that it has used its official position for the purposes of its election campaign”. Till the announcement of polls, however, it is only a question of decency and propriety of those in power. The lines between a political party’s rally and a government function continue to blur, to the advantage of the BJP in most cases. Once the poll schedule is announced, the burden will be on the ECI to be fair, and seen to be fair. In the last round of elections, its conduct was questioned on various valid grounds. The ECI must take political parties into confidence and ensure an environment conducive to a fair election process that also limits public health risks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fair-and-safe/article38095706.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:31 IST,||PM rejects concept of superpower||New Delhi, Jan. 2: The Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, to-day made it clear that India had no ambition to become a super power and said it believed in the equality of all nations. Addressing a mammoth reception held here in her honour for leading India to victory over Pakistan in the recent war, Mrs. Gandhi said the concept of super powers and the resultant balance of power were not obsolete. These had no place in the present world, she added. “We believe in equality of all nations,” she said. She described the big power concept “as bullying of smaller nations and economic domination over them.” And said, “Times have changed and we will never adopt a big brother role.” She had a dig at “certain rich nations” who, she said, sermonised India day-in and day-out on removing its poverty and backwardness. Why did they not try to remove pockets of poverty still existing in their own countries, she asked. Referring to the frequent war threats held out by Pakistani leaders, including the President, Mr. Z.A. Bhutto, Mrs. Gandhi said, “We do not know whether the war has really ended. We are ready. Our men and women in villages, cities and on the frontiers are all alert and vigilant to meet any eventuality.” Mrs. Gandhi made it known to “those concerned” that India would not be taken by surprise if there is any attack on her. “It is difficult to say whether the war is over. There is a new threat every day. On one day there is a threat, on the other day there is an indication there there could be negotiations. In our opinion the situation needs constant watch and our Army is alert,” the Prime Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/pm-rejects-concept-of-superpower/article38095715.ece

We have started constructing a house by availing of the staff housing loan through my wife who is working in LIC. This loan is via LIC HFL, in which she is the principal borrower and I, the co-borrower. Can my wife avail of I-T exemptions on the loan? K. Rajeev A.Deductions under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 towards interest paid on borrowed capital for construction/purchase can be availed of by only such person who is the owner of the house property or in whose name the property is.

The Society will be disbursing about Rs. 44,000 per month to each member for the next 3-4 years by way of rentals for alternative accommodation till our redeveloped flats are given back to the members. A few members, staying at retirement homes, have been paying Rs. 24,000 a month towards maintenance of the apartments and food expenses. Can you tell me how such rentals are to be treated from an I-T viewpoint? V.N. Vasudevan A.The amounts received by you during the time of re-development of your Mumbai apartment is in the nature of a hardship/rehabilitation allowance for which the developer is offering to pay for temporary accommodation until the redevelopment is complete. The amount so compensated is to be used entirely for a temporary accommodation, if the same is used partly or not used, the same will be taxable under the head “Income from Other Sources.” Amounts paid by you as maintenance and food expenses in Coimbatore are not eligible to be set off against the amounts received by you at the time of redevelopment as you own the retirement home located in Coimbatore.

Aruna Reddy, fresh from her double gold at the recent Egypt International meet, is now gunning for an Olympics berth. The 26-year-old Aruna, training at the National camp in Ambala under Manoj Rana, has put behind her a three-year phase of uncertainty hit by two surgeries on her right knee. On top of her game “Age is no bar even for a gymnast. That is a myth. In fact, I feel more experienced, confident and physically and mentally much stronger,” she said.  “Yes, the Olympic qualifiers will begin this year with the World Cup in Egypt this March. Having won two golds at the international meet at the same venue, I am confident of putting up a strong show in the two vault and floor events,” Aruna said in a chat with The Hindu .  “The preparations have been really good. Hoping to make it and if I get the chance to represent the country in the World Cup, I am ready for the challenge,” said Aruna, who incidentally had to take an injury-break immediately after the 2018 World Cup bronze in Australia.  “There was a phase during the last three years when I did think it was all over. When everything looked bleak. That was the time when my coach Rana Sir was rock-solid behind me,” she said. “The foreign coach, Andrei Levit, too has been just amazing,” she said.  “I am also grateful to Go Sports and the Aurobindo Pharma Foundation for their support, taking care of my training and competition expenses,” said Aruna. Challenges “This year is going to be challenging with the Commonwealth and the Asian Games also scheduled. So, there is a conscious effort to keep improving and return with a medal,” she said. Incidentally, despite her achievements, Aruna, the B.Com graduate, is still searching for a job.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/aruna-sets-sights-on-olympic-berth/article38096309.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:37 IST,||With momentum on its side, India will go for the kill at ‘bullring’||The Wanderers is shaped like a bullring. The cricketers have to walk down a lengthy covered staircase to reach the ground. And, in the arena, the contests are fierce. The pacemen will come charging at you on a conducive pitch and the ball will fly around. In several respects, the Wanderers is the soul, the essence of South African cricket. It is here that India, already 1-0 up, will strive to conquer the Final Frontier — a maiden Test series triumph in South Africa — when the second of the three Freedom Tests gets underway on Monday. The Indians will not like to leave it to the third Test at Cape Town which they would want as an occasion to celebrate Virat Kohli’s 100th Test. Apart from the Proteas, India will have to battle the weather. Rain has been forecast on all five days of the Test, with thunderstorms on the last two. Onus on batters The Indians start favourites. However, they will have to bat better. Apart from K.L. Rahul’s magnificent 123 at Centurion, and his century opening partnership with Mayank Agarwal, the Indian innings lacked knocks of substance. Kohli and Rahane got starts but could not convert. And the Indian batting disappointed in the second innings. The visitors will be up against an incisive opening combination of Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi. And beanpole left-arm quick Marco Jansen can ask questions with his angle, bounce and movement. The South Africans could still include lively paceman Duanne Olivier after skipper Dean Elgar virtually declared left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj will play. If Olivier comes in for all-rounder Wiaan Mulder, the tail will become too long in a line-up that is already struggling. The Indians will seek runs from Cheteshwar Pujara. His tendency to push forward, irrespective of the delivery’s length, makes him vulnerable to a variety of dismissals. The length should dictate footwork, the golden rule of batting really. The same applies to Ajinkya Rahane and Kohli, whose wafty cover-drives are proving costly. Tightness around the off-stump is the key to survival on South African pitches. Rahul showed this in the manner in which he ‘left’ deliveries and forced the frustrated pacemen to shift line and bowl to his strength. Innings-building in Tests is much about patience. You play out deliveries, overs and sessions and things will gradually go your way. Winning the toss, putting together a solid opening partnership after weathering a challenging first session, and posting a good first innings score is the mantra to success. The surface at Wanderers could develop cracks as the match progresses and batting could become increasingly difficult; off-spinner R. Ashwin could come into play. The South Africans, save Elgar and Temba Bavuma, are short of confidence and runs. And the Proteas are up against a high-quality pace attack comprising Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohamed Siraj with Shardul Thakur as back-up. The Proteas desperately need a substantial opening stand and runs from Aiden Markram. Quinton de Kock’s replacement, Kyle Verreynne, is believed to be a capable batter. South Africa could also play an extra batter in place of all-rounder Mulder. The focus shifts to the bullring. India will be going for the kill!  The teams (from): India: Virat Kohli (Capt,), K.L. Rahul (Vice-capt.), Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Rishabh Pant (wk), R. Ashwin, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Shreyas Iyer, Hanuma Vihari, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Priyank Panchal, and Jayant Yadav.   South Africa: Dean Elgar (Capt.), Aiden Markram, Keegan Petersen, Rassie van der Dussen, Temba Bavuma, Kyle Verreynne, Wiaan Mulder, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Marco Jansen, Duanne Olivier, Sarel Erwee, Beuran Hendricks, George Linde, Sisanda Magala, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Glenton Stuurman, and Prenelan Subrayen.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:36 IST,||India’s happy hunting ground||The Wanderers will bring back happy memories for Team India and Rahul Dravid. It was at this venue that a young Dravid made his first Test hundred in 1997 — an innings of 148 — against a high quality pace attack that put him on course to what would be a great career. Dravid followed it up with an 81 in the second innings but South Africa, eight wickets down in the fourth innings, hung on for a draw. “The hundred was very satisfying but I was disappointed with the result. We came so close to a win,” said Dravid. However, Dravid and India could not be denied in 2006 against a powerful South African side at the peak of its powers. Led by Dravid, India made 249 in its first innings, comeback man Saurav Ganguly top-scoring with 51 against a potent attack of Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Jacques Kallis and Andre Nel. S. Sreesanth then whipped up one of the finest exhibitions of swing bowling to slice through the South African top- and middle-order with a spell of five for 40 as the host was bundled out for 84. The batting line-up which included, Graeme Smith, Herschelle Gibbs, Hashim Amla, Kallis, Ashwell Prince, AB de Villiers, Mark Bouncher and Pollock, lay in tatters. India took the game away from South Africa posting 236 in its second innings, the elegant V.V.S. Laxman top-scoring with 73. In an interesting sidestory, the normally punctual Laxman, undefeated overnight, was a tad late for the team bus in the morning and the side coached by Greg Chappell, a strong disciplinarian, left without him. Laxman, fuming, followed the team bus in a taxi! India set South Africa a target of 402 and despite a gutsy 97 by Ashwell Prince, South Africa was dismissed for 278 with Man of the Match Sreesanth, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble sharing the spoils. This was India’s first Test victory on South African soil. A historic occasion. Can India also register its first Test series triumph on South African soil at its favourite venue in the Rainbow nation?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indias-happy-hunting-ground/article38095948.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:37 IST,||Goa rallies to hold Blasters||It continues to rain goals at the ISL. And quality ones at that. The match between Kerala Blasters and FC Goa at Vasco’s Tilak Maidan Stadium on Sunday produced four goals, at least two of which were remarkable. Though the 2-2 draw took Blasters to the third spot with 14 points from nine matches, it must be ruing its missed chances. Goa remained ninth with nine points in nine games. All the goals came in the first period in the space of 18 minutes. After Jeakson Singh and Adrian Luna struck for Blasters, Jorge Ortiz and Edu Bedia scored for Goa. The goalfest began in the 10th minute when Jeakson leapt high to head home a corner kick from Luna. Sensational goal Just 10 minutes later, Luna produced an even better effort. After being set up by Alvaro Vazquez, the Uruguayan, from 30 yards out, smashed the ball into the top corner of the net, beating Goa custodian Dheeraj Singh. It should, undoubtedly, count among the goals of the season. Goa came right back into the match through a fine goal from Ortiz who, after receiving a superb ball from Saviour Gama, got the ball past a diving Prabhsukhan Gill. With seven minutes remaining for the half-time whistle, the Goans equalised in stunning fashion as Bedia's corner-kick rocketed straight into the net, stunning Gill under the bar. The second half failed to produce any of that drama.  The results:   Kerala Blasters 2 (Jeakson Singh 10, Adrian Luna 20) drew with FC Goa 2 (Jorge Ortiz 24, Edu Bedia 38); Jamshedpur FC 0 lost to Chennaiyin FC 1 (Lukasz Gikiewicz 31).

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 04:02 IST,||Lukasz’s header seals it for CFC||Lukasz Gikiewicz’s header in the first half, off a set-piece, was enough for Chennaiyin FC to start the new year on a winning note with a 1-0 verdict against Jamshedpur FC at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Sunday. The win helped the two-time champion turn around its fortunes after defeats in the last two matches. A case of missed chances For Jamshedpur, it was a case of missed opportunities though it was the better team on the park. Owen Coyle’s men paid the price for some poor finishing and suffered their second defeat of the season. Jamshedpur’s best chance came in the fifth minute when Seiminlen Doungel received an assist from the left flank, but the midfielder messed it up. He failed to take the shot immediately and slammed the ball over the net when he did. After that, neither team looked threatening enough to score until Doungel’s foul on Jerry Lalrinzuala gave Chenaniyin a free kick. Vladimir Koman sent in an inch-perfect cross to the far post where Lukasz, left unmarked, charged in and headed home what proved the only goal of the night. In the second period, Jamshedpur completely dominated the match but had nothing to show for as Chennaiyin was happy to sit back and put men behind the ball to defend the slender lead. Jamshedpur had two gilt-edged chances late in the match but squandered them. In the 82nd minute, Jordan Murray sent in a perfect cross to Ishan Pandita, who had an open goal in front of him but shot wide. A few minutes later, Murray himself received an assist, but a slight hesitation in taking the shot on the first attempt cost dear. Dhot shines The star of the day for Chennaiyin was defender Sajid Dhot, who was signed from Odisha FC before this match.  The results: Kerala Blasters 2 (Jeakson Singh 10, Adrian Luna 20) drew with FC Goa 2 (Jorge Ortiz 24, Edu Bedia 38).   Jamshedpur FC 0 lost to Chennaiyin FC 1 (Lukasz Gikiewicz 31).

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 06:37 IST,||Batters getting starts should push on: Dravid||Rahul Dravid appeared relaxed and confident ahead of the second Test. And he spoke with clarity and vision. “If the weather holds across five days we will have a result at the Wanderers. That’s the exciting part,” he said. The Indian coach observed, “The bowling was phenomenal in the first Test. And we batted well on the first day. On an overseas tour, in these conditions, to be 272 for three on day one is a very good performance.” Dravid added, “But we should not have got bowled out for 327. And our batting in the second innings was disappointing. We have been having honest conversations on how to set it right.” Backing his men The erudite Dravid said, “Batters getting a start should push on. But it is not always easy in these conditions when you are never really ‘in.’ But I am sure a big score is around the corner for Pujara, Kohli and Rahane.” Dravid was all praise for Kohli. “He has been an exceptional leader. The way he trains, prepares and connects with the boys has been outstanding. And he led the team very well. All the outside chatter hasn’t bothered him.” The Indian coach said the Indian team was aware that it had not always responded well after winning the first Test. “The good thing is that this conversation started among the boys soon after the first Test. As a coach I did not have to tell them.” Dravid appreciated the Indian pacemen for mixing up their length capably. He said, “A lot of planning, watching of video footage, has gone into it.” Asked whether the ICC was fair in docking World Test Championship (WTC) points for slow over rate - India was penalised a point after the first Test at Centurion - Dravid said, “The rule is the same for everyone so I am okay with it. But as a coach sometimes you feel the teams can be given some leeway. For instance, Bumrah had an ankle problem and the physio had to come in and then there was a ball change.” Dravid said, “Both teams are good enough to get 20 wickets. South Africa will be looking to bounce back. We are focused on the job.”  Test cricket can be bloody tough. It’s time for us to put on our big boy pants and face up to them About facing Bumrah and Shami   It came as a shock to me really. I did not see it coming, it was disappointing. But he gave me his reasons and you have got to respect his decision On de Kock’s retirement   You’ve got to ask yourself the tough questions and answer them.

The reigning champion was humbled 0-3. It nearly bounced back in the following match against NorthEast United, but had to deal with an inspired show by Jamaican striker Deshorn Brown, who scored a brilliant hat-trick in a 3-3 draw. Mumbai should be hoping to return to form when it takes on Odisha FC at the Tilak Maidan Stadium, Vasco, on Monday. Odisha, too, will be desperate for a win. It hasn’t won a game after defeating NorthEast United 1-0. Since then it has lost three and drew one. It is not just the defeats that the team management has had to worry about. It was thrashed 0-4 by Jamshedpur and 1-6 by Hyderabad in its previous match. Dubious distinction In eight matches, Odisha has conceded 20 goals, more than any other team this season. “There are some moments where we made individual mistakes and that cost us the game, but we cannot blame anyone,” said Odisha’s assistant coach Kino Garcia. “The coaching staff will take the responsibility first and then the players. We will keep trying to find a solution and we are confident of getting better.” Mumbai’s coach Des Buckingham also spoke of the importance of defence. “We need to make sure defensively we are well placed,” he said. “We want to continue playing attacking football but we need to be good defensively as well.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mumbai-looks-to-get-back-on-track/article38096498.ece

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 05:25 IST,||Full throttle||First meetings aren’t always the best. Tamil filmmaker H. Vinoth knows that well.  He first met actor Ajith Kumar fresh on the heels of his successful 2017 Karthi-starrer Theeran: Adhigaaram Ondru . At that time, Vinoth was selling the actor a script that featured a protagonist with shades of grey. Ajith, however, was not too keen on that, but insisted on remaking Hindi hit Pink in Tamil. “He wanted to do something I felt I was incapable of attempting,” laughs Vinoth, over a telephone chat. “That meeting didn’t go well.”   But that is now history. Today, Vinoth has become one of Ajith’s favourite directors and is fast rising to be among Kollywood’s popular filmmakers. He has already finished two films with the star: Nerkonda Paarvai, the remake of Pink he finally ended up doing, and upcoming Pongal release Valimai , touted to be one of the biggest projects of 2022. The story does not end there: Vinoth will again team up with Ajith and producer Boney Kapoor for their next project, which makes it three consecutive projects from the same team. Excerpts from an interview with the 40-year-old filmmaker, who seems to be on a dream run in Tamil cinema:   Take us back to the day when you first narrated the script of Valimai to Ajith...  I narrated a one-liner of the story. He was impressed that it was socially responsible and was sure that it would turn out to be a film that would entertain all audiences.  The last film you worked with him was a remake... was there inherent pressure to make Valimai more “mass”?  No, there wasn’t. The story we selected in the first place had all the elements of a mass, commercial entertainer. There is a real-life connect to the storyline, we hear...  As the subject features bikes prominently, we started researching and stumbled upon the story of how late CM Jayalalithaa directly appointed a racer as a policeman. We tried scouting for him in order to hear his life story, but we couldn’t track him down. We have taken that one incident as a small inspiration for Valimai .  What do you think Ajith liked most in you to team up for three back-to-back projects?  Well, he has done it before, with director Siva (Ajith did Veeram , Vivegam and Viswasam ). If Ajith feels comfortable with a person, he likes working with them continuously. I have myself told him this many times: ‘Sir, you should work with other directors too. Many assistant directors have written stories for you. If you work with them, they will also get a bright future, just like me’. He agrees with that, and he is meeting many other directors too, but he believes that there should be a spark for it to come together as a project.  How happy are you making a film that has a lot riding on its star value? I am fully aware of that, and the challenge is to tap into that as effectively as possible. I am not here to take cinema to the next level. I am here to take my life to the next level, and I have chosen this as my path for that. It is a simple demand-supply concept: working with a star, knowing what he wants and what his fans and audiences want, and delivering that to the best of my capabilities. As a filmgoer, what about cinema fascinated you the most during your growing-up years?  I was a big Rajinikanth fan during my younger days. Till the release of Padayappa , I have queued up for FDFS tickets outside theatres. You should see the scene after the jostle of tickets is over... there would be a hundred slippers strewn everywhere near the counter. There would be so much excitement then.  Do you think the pandemic has changed the way films are being thought of, and shot? The first time the world spoke about social distancing, as filmmakers, we were thinking about how to film the lead pair standing next to each other, and how to shoot crowds. We have moved a long way since then, as we have realised that there are plenty of ways to execute things. The pandemic has taught filmmakers to do things that we already did in a more effective manner, keeping in mind safety protocols. When you entered the film industry, you would have had certain dreams. Do you think you have achieved all of them? I will not describe myself as a filmmaker with a lot of passion for cinema. I treat it purely as a profession. I do not have any big dreams; all I want is to ensure that the producer makes enough and the audience who pays for the film leaves the hall satisfied and entertained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/full-throttle/article38096424.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 05:25 IST,||Her world through his eyes||Clad in a sari, her hair in a neat braid, an umbrella peeping from her handbag slung across her shoulder, a resolute stride: think Vasanth S. Sai’s film heroine and this is the image that comes to mind. She is always on the move: on her way to catch a bus to work; riding a scooter to keep an appointment with someone… In his latest, Sivaranjiniyum Innum Sila Pengalum, too, she is constantly on her feet.  The film, that released on SonyLIV last month, is among the most talked-about ones of the year. “I don’t think I would have been this happy about the film’s reception even if it had had a theatrical release,” says Vasanth, who was in Coimbatore to take part in the Vishnupuram Literary Circle’s award event. Vasanth admits he was initially bent on the film being shown on the big screen. “The film’s journey began in 2018 when it won the Gender Equality award at the Mumbai Film Festival. From there, it travelled to film festivals across the world in 2019, and was the first Tamil film to be screened at most of them. I had to give it space for this travel,” he adds. By the time he readied it for release towards the end of 2019, the pandemic struck. Vasanth finally decided to release it on OTT, since he felt “it would get old” otherwise. OTT, he feels, “is a welcome change for films that have serious themes. The platforms help viewers see important films with deep concentration, enjoy the many nuances they offer.” Sivaranjiniyum … is an anthology, featuring three 40-minute films, each of which is based on stories by master Tamil writers — Ashokamitran, Aadhavan, and B. Jeyamohan. The cast includes actors Parvathy Thiruvothu, Lakshmi Priyaa Chandramouli, and Kalieswari Srinivasan.  The film explores the world of three married women: their desires, dreams, and little joys often swept under the carpet knowingly or unknowingly by the men in their lives. It makes for powerful social commentary, one that Vasanth says takes root in filmmaker K. Balachander’s school of thought, whom he considers his inspiration. Critical thinking The women in Vasanth’s stories shine with personality traits he admires in women in his life.  “This can be confidence, kindness, and perseverance despite their struggles. For a lot of women, it is never this or that. It is this and that.” Sivaranjiniyum ... ultimately, explains Vasanth, talks about how women, in order to make people in their lives happy, often fail to make themselves happy. “It shows that you too are important. Your happiness matters,” he says.  Vasanth’s questions on society’s unfair standards for women started when he was as young as 10 years old. “When I was a little boy, Sunday mornings were meant to play street cricket. But that was when my mother would send me on chores. We lived in Alwarpet [in Chennai] then and she would ask me to accompany my college-going sister when she went to get zoology notes from her friend. I found this odd: I was just 10, but here I was, expected to escort my sister just because I was a male,” he says. Gradually, as he grew older, and started reading, he found the answers. Reading shaped his thinking, and Vasanth says it is his mother who initiated him into literature. “The very thought of my mother brings to mind the image of her seated on an easy-chair with a book,” he recalls. “She would send me to a library in Nandanam when I was in Class V or VI to borrow books for her,” he says. “Mother would instruct me to look for titles by Sivasankari, Indhumathi, Soodamani, and Anuthama.” When he started reading later on, the names came rushing back. Vasanth started writing in his undergraduate years. He wrote short stories, did a stint as a freelance journalist, and even set up a small library at home. In fact, it is his love for literature that brought him to Coimbatore to participate at the Vishnupuram literary event held recently. “I spent the whole day listening to young and senior writers talk. I enjoy this,” he says. He hopes to share all that he learns with people. “This is my philosophy. Since I am a filmmaker, I do so through my films.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/her-world-through-his-eyes/article38096425.ece

A movie is in the works.  Producer Nikhil Dwivedi has acquired the rights of Gautam Chintamani’s book, Dark Star: The Loneliness Of Being Rajesh Khanna .  In a press statement, Nikhil said, “I’m in talks with Farah Khan to make the film. I’m really very excited about bringing Rajesh Khanna’s story to the big screen.”  Born Jatin Khanna, and affectionately called Kaka by his industry friends, Rajesh Khanna was considered quite a complex personality and misunderstood by many. Debuting with Aakhri Khat (1966), he went on to deliver more than 15 hits in succession and generated mass hysteria, especially among female fans.  Farah Khan added in a statement, “I have read Gautam’s book, and it’s very fascinating. We are in a conversation over this but I cannot comment more.” Details about who will play the lead role and the rest of the cast are yet to be revealed by the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/now-a-film-on-rajesh-khanna/article38096423.ece
03 January 2022||January 03 2022 03:45 IST,||Future plans||I have completed my Master’s in Cultural Studies and am in a full-time research and communications job for the last year. With my growing interest in the area of environment and its influence on development politics, I wish to do a one-year Master’s programme abroad before pursuing a career in Civil Services through UPSC. Is this unrealistic? - Philo Magdalen Dear Philo, You will need to start shortlisting courses, schools and universities and find out what it will cost and whether scholarships and credit points are possible? Please begin the process. No learning and knowledge is ever wasted. I have completed my graduation and am preparing for the competitive exams. My problem is when practising writing answers, I tend to write longer ones. How can I write a short answer, brush up on my handwriting and avoid grammatical mistakes? - Vardhan Jain Dear Vardhan, Try to use keywords, main points, acronyms, and mind-maps to express and highlight the significant features. Also, time yourself if these are long exams where you need to complete a minimum number of questions to pass and qualify. Yes, the presentation does matter; so work on that more than the handwriting. I am a 26-year-old BE EEE graduate. I identified my passion for veterinary sciences rather late. Is it possible for me to study now in India? Am I eligible to write NEET for the above course? – Arjhun Dear Arjhun, There is no upper age limit restriction (as yet) to take the NEET, so you are eligible to apply. Prep hard and make it happen! However, be aware that your finances need to be taken care of since you will be back at vet school for at least 5.5 years. How will that impact your life in other ways? I have passed Class 12 (CBSE) board exams with a score of 92% and cracked JEE with a score of 99.58 percentile. But I was forced to drop out to support my family. But I still want to become a scientist. Is there any way to do so? – Shivansh Dear Shivansh, I am sorry for what you have undergone. Do not drop your academic plans. What are you doing now? Do you have any valid admissions for the upcoming academic year? There are many ways to find financial support: corporates. NGOs, philanthropists, charities and others who can be approached. Speak to a trusted adult who can help you with this. Start working towards your dream by getting into the college of your choice.

03 January 2022||January 03 2022 05:24 IST,||‘An artist needs to remain vulnerable’||One of the most remarkable characters of 2021 was Manu Munjal, the cocky weightlifter from Chandigarh who falls in love with a trans woman in Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui. For Ayushmann Khurrana, who has made a habit of playing flawed characters with aplomb, once again, portrayed the inability of Manu to process the reality that his girlfriend was once a boy. “I always look at the script first and then my character,” he says. “Manu mirrors an average Joe on the street who is not woke, who has no idea what the life of a trans person is and what the trans community looks and feels like. Being a Chandigarh boy, I know many such characters. He gets cold feet when he discovers that the girl he loves used to be a boy. It is very important for him to be like this because if Manu Munjal the character can transform, anybody can in India.” For the role, he had to undergo physical transformation as well with some of the best trainers and nutritionists in the industry. “The lockdown helped but after the gruelling process, where I got injured many times, I would advise one should not go this crazy about transformation.” ‘Space for everything’  The success of protagonists like Bala and Manu gives an impression that the star culture is on the wane, but Ayushmann feels there is space for everything. He reminds the season started with Sooryavanshi .  “For theatres to survive, star culture is still useful as it could bring in the masses. It is good for the business.” But, in the same vein, he adds, a different genre of cinema that is slightly real, middle of the road is also gaining traction. “The point is the film has to resonate with people. It doesn’t matter whether the hero is completely sanitised and picture perfect or flawed. Sometimes, the swagger of a star works, and others’ imperfections become endearing. Remember, as Manu, I had to be a little vain as well for the transformation to work.” The content, he says, is the star because people are exposed to content from across the globe. “It is time for evolution,” says the actor.  Somebody who cut his teeth in theatre, Ayushmann says he is a team player and reminds he has been on both the active and the reactive sides in films. “If I have done Article 15 and Vicky Donor, I have also been part of Dum Laga Ke Haisha andBadhai Ho, where I was just one of the protagonists in the ensemble cast . The characters have to shine for the film to work .” This reality, he says, dawned on him when big banner films like Hawaizaada and Meri Pyari Bindu tanked despite him being central to the story.  He has been in the industry for a decade but Ayushmann retains his innocence. “An artist needs to remain vulnerable from all sides. He should be sensitive and not self-absorbed. It is about seeing the world in totality and remaining rooted.” Since childhood, he says, he has the same set of friends. “Some of them are doing good, some are doing just fine but all of them come from different walks of life. I still have very few friends from the film fraternity. It provides me good objectivity and world view,” he says. Being a journalism student in college, Ayushmann says, keeping in touch with the real world comes naturally to him. “I can do better but I am trying to do my best.” Ayushmann admits COVID-19 will change cinema. “The audience have become so used to the OTT content that for the families to return to theatres you have to provide them a completely out of the box experience. My hunch is while OTT will continue to serve dark themes, for community viewing, we will have happy, positive films that are uplifting and engaging.” New year, fresh projects  With three films lined up, Ayushmann is eagerly looking forward to 2022. He has finished a political thriller called Anek with Anubhav Sinha. “We shot in the Northeast, which is still a very unique and unknown territory for Hindi cinema. I want to break my genre every three films. I had a wonderful experience with Anubhav in Article 15 and thought it would be good to return to his zone.”   He has also finished Anubhuti Kashyap’s Doctor G,w here he is playing a male gynaecologist. “Anubhuti has a unique voice as a director and a male gynaecologist is still a rarity, even in urban India. The combination excites me.”  Then there is Anirudh Iyer’sAction Hero,where again, he says, he gets to grapple with a unique dichotomy. “He is an action hero. He has always fought on screen but he has never been in a real fight. What happens when he gets into one…” Made for Ayushmann, one must say!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/an-artist-needs-to-remain-vulnerable/article38096422.ece
