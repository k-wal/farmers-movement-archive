Three other BJP MLAs — two from the OBC bloc and one Dalit — said they were also leaving the BJP and would follow Mr. Maurya’s political lead. One of them, Brajesh Kumar Prajapati, MLA from Tindwari in Banda, has submitted his resignation letter from the BJP. Soon after Mr. Maurya made public his resignation letter to Governor Anandiben Patel, which was yet to be accepted, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav tweeted an undated picture of himself with Mr. Maurya and “welcomed” the OBC leader and his supporters into his party. Options open However, while not denying future prospects with the SP, Mr. Maurya, who is yet to formally resign from the BJP, remained tight-lipped on his next move. He said he would make a formal decision on joining another party after consultation with his supporters. Sources said Mr. Maurya’s supporters backed a pre-poll alliance with the SP through the Loktantrik Bahujan Manch which he had formed after quitting the BSP in 2016 rather than joining the party. “Now they will know the status of Swami Prasad Maurya. In the 2022 election, they will know what mass base I have. The party where I go to will form the government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-poll-eve-blow-to-bjp-senior-minister-quits-up-cabinet/article38245639.ece

They will have to arrive at suitable decisionbased on the number of cases afterconsultation with Health and Education Department officials in the district. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who chaired a meeting on COVID-19 situation in the State with Cabinet Ministers and Technical Advisory Committee on Tuesday, authorised Deputy Commissioners to decide on functioning or closure of schools and colleges in taluks in their districts depending on the number of cases. On January 4, the government had issued guidelines banning physical classes, except for Class X, XI, and XII in Bengaluru Urban district. The government issued fresh guidelines on Tuesday and prohibited all rallies and protests.It issued instructions to authorities to take stringent action against those holding public conventions and large gatherings. However, marriage functions are permitted to be conducted involving not more than 200 people in open spaces and 100 people in closed places strictly adhering to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Public transport, including BMRCL, would operate as per seating capacity only. It was reiterated that the Chief Commissioner BBMP and Deputy Commissioners based on their assessment of the situation have been empowered to impose additional containment measures as deemed necessary in their jurisdictions. There would be intensive surveillance at the border of Maharashtra, Kerala, and Goa as per the prevailing circular/guidelines issued by Department of Health and family Welfare. These containment measures would remain in force up to 5 a.m. on January 31. In a reply to a question, Home Minister Araga Jnanedra said a decision on the weekend curfew, which has been enforced till January 19, would be taken after a meeting of the Chief Minister with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. During the two-hour long meeting, Mr. Bommai instructed officials to arrange children’s ward, ICUs and other treatment facilities for children at taluk and district hospitals. The officials have been told to ensure sufficient stock of medicines in all hospitals for providing treatment for children. To check the number of cases in schools, particularly in residential schools, officials of Education and Health and Family Welfare departments have been asked to conduct a general health check-up of schoolchildren in schools every fortnight. Deputy Commissioners and Superintendent of Police have been instructed to strictly enforce COVID guidelines in public places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dcs-authorised-to-decide-on-closure-of-schools-colleges-based-on-cases/article38245683.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday formally launched a website that would acccept applications during the first phase of the ‘Jagananna Smart Townships’ for allotment of residential plots to the Middle Income Croup (MIG) families, in the virtual mode from his camp office. Speaking on the occasion, Minister for Municipal Administration and Town Planning Botcha Satyanarayana said more than 30 lakh poor families were given house pattas. Similarly, the smart township programme was designed for the MIG families on a no-profit-no-loss basis to enable them to fulfill their dream of owning a house. ‘Clear title’ He said the plots would be allotted with titles without any deviations. The Chief Minister wanted a township to be developed in every constituency across the State, and the District Collectors had already given instructions to the officials of the department concerned, the Minister said. He also said that it would be a self-sustainable project, wherein lands would be acquired from people willing to give them, or government lands by following all the rules. Referring to the criticism by the opposition parties, he said people would not bother about it as long as the government was working for their welfare. “Any programme started with a good intention is bound to yield good result,” he observed. Chief Secretary Sameer Sharma, Special Chief Secretary, Municipal Administration and Urban Development, Y. Srilakshmi were among others present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/chief-minister-launches-website-for-smart-townships-programme/article38245644.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:21 IST,||PDS hit owing to server glitch||The public distribution system (PDS) in the State has plunged into a crisis owing to a server glitch in the online system that facilitates the operation of e-PoS (electronic point of sale) machines at ration outlets. With the snag having persisted for four days, a section of the ration dealers downed their shutters and suspended ration supply on Tuesday. In most parts of the State, ration cardholders were forced to wait for as long as half-an-hour to receive their allocation since Friday. Several beneficiaries returned empty-handed after waiting outside ration shops for long hours in certain areas. There has been considerable uptick in beneficiary inflow presumably to receive the additional allocation of half-a-litre of kerosene this month. Ration dealers claimed the e-PoS machines have gone offline frequently especially during the early hours of sale. They also alleged that the authorities have been unresponsive despite repeated pleas. Public protest All Kerala Retail Ration Dealers’ Association general secretary T. Muhammedali said there have been instances of the public getting agitated at ration dealers for no fault of theirs. In some places, the e-PoS machines have recorded the biometric data of beneficiaries, but went offline before the receipts could be printed. “Under the circumstances, it has become difficult to run the ration outlets before a permanent solution has been found to the problem,” he said. Food and Civil Supplies Minister G.R. Anil attributed the problem to a glitch in the central server of the State Data Centre. The snag has affected the functioning of various departments. “The issue has been taken up with the IT Mission Director. Efforts are under way to resolve the glitch,” he said. The Minister, however, took umbrage at the decision to shut down ration outlets. He alleged there have been constant attempts to malign the department and impede its activities to modernise the public distribution system for the benefit of the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pds-hit-owing-to-server-glitch/article38245970.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 05:11 IST,||Two arrested on the charge of defaming Koragajja||The Dakshina Kannada Police on Tuesday arrested two persons in connection with a case related to defamation caused to Koragajja, a revered Spirit in the district, reported in the Vitla Police limits. The police gave names of the accused as Ahamed Mujitabu (28) of Mangalapady in Kumble of Kerala and Mohiddeen Muneesh (19) from Bayarupadavu from Kerala. They were produced before the jurisdictional magistrate who remanded them to judicial custody. Chetan, a resident of Vitla Padnur, lodged a complaint with Vitla Police on Friday last saying that a bridegroom and a resident of Uppala in Kerala, Umarulla Bashit, arrived at the residence of a bride and daughter of Aziz in Salethur village, Bantwal taluk, dressed as Koragajja on Thursday. Bashit and his friends danced wildly that defamed the revered Spirit, the complainant said. A video of the dance was widely circulated on social media platforms and this attracted the ire of the devotees of Koragajja. The police registered the complaint for offences punishable under Sections 153 (A) and 295 of the Indian Penal Code. Superintendent of Police Rishikesh Sonawane said that efforts are on to trace Bashit, who is at large. Fatwa Meanwhile, Vishwa Hindu Parishad has demanded that Muslim religious leaders issue a fatwa against Bashit and his family members and remove them from the jamat. VHP Mangaluru Divisional Secretary Sharan Pumpwell told reporters here on Tuesday that mere castigation of the act by Bashit and his family members by the community is not enough. “They should be removed from the jamat and a fatwa should be issued if that dance is a non-Islamic act,” he said. Mr. Pumpwell said that the irreligious act by Bashit has hurt many Koragajja devotees who actually belong to different communities. This comes close on the heels of a series of such incidents of defaming and desecrating Hindu places of worship in the twin districts. VHP activists held prayers across temples and daivastanas in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts on Tuesday seeking divine reprimand for those involved in defaming and desecrating places of worship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-arrested-on-the-charge-of-defaming-koragajja/article38246069.ece

The State is scheduled to vote in a single phase on February 14. While the Congress had earlier named former Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chiefs Partap Singh Bajwa and Sunil Jakhar as heads of the manifesto and campaign committees, respectively, party president Sonia Gandhi approved other names by Tuesday. As the party is facing intense factional fights, the move is seen as a fine balancing act to accommodate all groups within the State unit. The 20-member manifesto committee has Deputy Chief Minister O.P. Soni, Surjit Singh Swaich, Amit Vij, Jaiveer Shergil, Ashok Choudhary and others. The 25-member panel for the party’s campaign, headed by Mr. Jakhar, includes Ravneet Singh Bittu, Amarpreet Singh Lally, Raj Kumar Verka, Vijay Inder Singla, Raja Warring and Navjot Dhaiya. Final list The committees have been announced before the Congress’s Central Election Committee (CEC) is expected to approve the final list of candidates later this week. So far, the screening committee, headed by Ajay Maken and including Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and Mr. Jakhar, has had six meetings to shortlist nominees. But the process to prepare the final list of candidates has turned out to be a tricky affair. The party has to factor in the possibility of defections and desertions; sitting legislators and leaders who do not get ticket could switch to the recently launched Punjab Lok Congress of former Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh (retd.) that has tied up with the BJP.  “More than taking on our political rivals, for our party, this election has been about dealing with the demands of different groups and egos of various leaders,” a party leader told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cong-forms-jumbo-panels-for-punjab/article38245652.ece

The total number of samples tested was 63,898. The growth rate of new cases was 100% in the week from January 4 to 10, in comparison to the previous week, resulting in 18,149 new cases during this period. The number of active patients went up by 45%, while hospitalisations went up by only 2% during this period. The surge in new cases has not begun to be reflected in the hospitalisation graph. Apart from the surge in hospitalisation, absenteeism of healthcare workers in hospitals after contracting COVID-19 is another issue that could crop up. Though the number of healthcare workers testing positive has begun to rise, it is yet to create a crisis in the health system. With the increase in new cases, the State’s active case pool has risen to 44,441, of whom, only 5.7% are currently admitted in hospitals or field hospitals such as COVID first line/second line treatment centres. A total of 2,064 people were reported to have recovered from the disease on Tuesday. ICU occupancy Current ICU occupancy in both public and private hospitals went up slightly to 457 cases, while the number of patients requiring ventilator support also showed a nominal increase from 148 on Monday to 161 on Tuesday. The number of patients newly admitted to hospitals with COVID showed a jump from 257 on Monday to 298 cases on Tuesday. Hospitalisations are rising slowly, with 2,887 people being treated in hospitals. The official cumulative COVID-19 case fatality crossed the 50,000 mark and now stands at 50,053, with the State adding 296 deaths to the official list. This includes 19 deaths which occurred in the past few days and 277 deaths which have now been accepted as COVID deaths by the government as per the new guidelines of the Centre and following the appeals filed by families. The cumulative COVID-19 burden, ever since the pandemic began, now stands at 53,00,405 cases. Thiruvananthapuram reported the highest number of new cases with 2,200 cases, Ernakulam 1,478, Thrissur 943, Kozhikode 801, Kottayam 587, Kollam 551, Palakkad 511, Kannur 417, Pathanamthitta 410, Alappuzha 347, Malappuram 309, Idukki 239, Wayanad 155 and Kasaragod 118.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/9066-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-state/article38245968.ece

All of them have only mild infection and will be under isolation for seven days. Senior officials said that a cluster of cases were expected as Omicron is highly transmissible and the doctors are in frontline. At least 79 MBBS students, house surgeons, Post Graduates and faculty from Osmania Medical College (OMC) tested positive for the infection till Tuesday evening. And 36 MBBS and PG students from Gandhi Medical College too were detected with the infection. Senior doctors and junior doctors from Osmania General Hospital said that the 79 healthcare professionals from OMC were isolated either at their homes or at the college hostel. “The 79 cases are among 35 house surgeons, 19 MBBS students, 23 PGs, two faculty members,” said the doctors. OMC Principal P Shashikala said the students who couldn’t go home from the hostel were provided with single room accommodation for isolation. The tests were conducted on those who have symptoms. Apart from senior doctors, PGs and MBBS students too provide medical services. Being in the frontline of health services, they have to attend both COVID and non-COVID patients and are at risk of contracting the infection. While there is transparency about COVID cases among doctors and students of government hospitals and care is taken to ensure uniterrupted medical services, corporate hospitals are cautious about information leaking out due to the fear of patients shunning their establishments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/115-medicos-in-gmc-omc-test-positive-for-covid-19/article38245922.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 05:31 IST,||Assam Police has the last laugh on Twitter||The serious job of policing has not stopped Assam Police from finding humour in routine cases. A burglary in Guwahati in the last 24 hours would hardly have made news but for the State police’s take on the incident on Twitter. “The curious case of a cereal burglar! Despite its many health benefits, turns out, cooking khichdi during a burglary attempt can be injurious to your well-being,” it tweeted on Tuesday. “The burglar has been arrested and @GuwahatiPol is serving him some hot meals,” it added. Locals in the city’s Hengerabari area were alerted by the sounds from the kitchen of a house whose occupants were away. They caught the burglar cooking and handed him over to the police.  On Monday, the Guwahati traffic police tweaked the “ hum do, hamaare do ” slogan coined in 1952 for a family planning campaign. “ Aami duta, amaar duta helmet (the two of us, our two helmets),” the tweet in Assamese read above the red inverted pyramid of the family planning campaign. “Ensure safety for yourself and people close to you… Don’t be lax when your life matters,” the tweet added.  On December 30, the Assam Police let pun take over while cautioning New Year revellers. “This New Year’s Eve, try not to be our guests. Free entry for rash drivers, drunk drivers, other eligible violators,” it said in a tweet. ‘On the menu: CopCake’ “Special performance by: DJ Lockup. On the menu: CopCake and other dessert items in our custard-y,” the tweet added. A State police team under Harmeet Singh, now Guwahati’s Commissioner of Police, had in 2018 begun adding fun to the force’s campaign against crime in 2018. He was then the Additional Director-General of Police (Modernisation- Logistics). One of the first fun-tweets was: “Sharing rumours/hate messages online can enable you for a date with us in nearest police station this weekend.” “Mobs may not follow the law, but the law will follow them. If you hit, the law won’t miss,” followed. These and scores of other such messages have been shared through the Assam Police’s Facebook and Instagram accounts besides Twitter. They were under the ‘Think’ campaign in three hashtag segments – #ThinkBeforeYouPost, #ThinkBeforeYouHit and #ThinkBeforeYouStalk. On the ground, the Assam Police has been tough against criminals of all hues. Since May 2021, when Himanta Biswa Sarma took charge as the Chief Minister, the force has killed 33 alleged drug dealers, cattle smugglers, kidnappers and murder accused in “encounters”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/assam-police-has-the-last-laugh-on-twitter/article38245786.ece

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the decision to step up restrictions was taken considering the health of the citizens. He said the Delhi government was not in favour of imposing a lockdown and would lift the current restrictions “as soon as possible”. All private offices, except those falling under the exempted category such as medical establishments, financial institutions, transportation and courier services, among others, were asked to shut down premises with immediate effect till further orders by the DDMA. Restaurants have been allowed to extend takeaway and home delivery services. After taking stock of the medical infrastructure at Lok Nayak Hospital later in the day, Mr. Kejriwal said the Delhi government was “completely prepared” to deal with what continued to be a dynamic situation and would increase the number of dedicated COVID beds in the city to 37,000 and ICU beds to between 10,000 and 11,000. 15% bed occupancy As of January 11, there were 14,762 COVID beds, 13,768 oxygen beds, 4,192 COVID ICU beds and 1,890 COVID ICU beds with ventilators ready in city hospitals.  Government sources told The Hindu that though hospital bed occupancy was increasing slightly on a daily basis – it was above 15% on Tuesday – it remained “well below” the average occupancy of 20% recorded during the second wave of infection in April-May last year.  Despite this, a senior official said, private hospitals have been given the go-ahead to increase the number of COVID beds by 25% if they feel the need to do so. Meanwhile, COVID Care Centres are mostly lying vacant — only 561 of over 5,000 beds at 23 centres are currently occupied. These are currently serving as quarantine centres for both international passengers as well as citizens who do not have adequate isolation facilities at home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/private-offices-in-delhi-closed-till-further-orders/article38245784.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:03 IST,||860 students test COVID positive in a month||Since December last year, 860 students in classes I to X have tested positive for COVID-19. During the same period, 85 teachers also contracted the virus. This data was presented to the Chief Minister by the Department of Public Instruction at a review meeting on Tuesday. According to officials, it includes children and staff in both private and government-run schools who contracted COVID-19 from December 8, 2021, to January 10, 2022. The highest number of cases has been reported in Belagavi district with 160 students testing positive, followed by Chikkamagaluru district with 144 students. As many as 30 students and seven teachers in Bengaluru Urban tested positive, according to government data. Data for Vijayapura and Raichur districts were not available. Sources in the Department of Public Instruction pointed out that infections among children account for a small percentage given that the total number of students studying from Classes I to X across the State is 1.04 crore. Many felt that the data strengthens their argument for the need of physical classes with SOPs in place. “Stopping physical classes will have a drastic impact on the academics of students. Schools must be open amid all precautionary measures. Already, two academic years have been disrupted due to the pandemic and we cannot afford to lose out on more classroom time. This will be detrimental to children,” said an official. While schools in Bengaluru (barring class X, XI, and XII) are closed, in other districts, the Deputy Commissioners will have to take a decision on closure of schools. At the meeting with the Chief Minister, Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.C. Nagesh requested that the department be allowed to restart the Vidyagama programme where teachers go to neighbourhoods and teach small groups in outdoor spaces. However, sources said that no decision was taken in this regard. Meanwhile, at the meeting, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education and the Department of Health and Family Welfare was asked to conduct a general health check-up in schools every fortnight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/860-students-test-covid-positive-in-a-month/article38245679.ece

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:47 IST,||Not here to administer Mullaperiyar Dam: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday told Tamil Nadu and Kerala that it was not there to “administer the dam” when a supervisory committee was already in place to examine the issue of safety of the Mullaperiyar Dam and the management of its water level. “The safety of the dam is related to the management of the water level. A committee has already been formed for that... We are not here to do the administration of the dam,” Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, heading a Bench including Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, said. The court said it was, however, concerned about the safety, security and health of the people living in the vicinity of the dam. The Bench said it was, hence, willing to examine the dam strictly on statutory basis and would not dabble in the administration of the dam, which was the job of the committee. The court asked stakeholders in the cases, including the two States, to finalise core issues for adjudication by the court by February. It adjourned the case to the second week of February. In the previous hearing, the court had told Kerala and Tamil Nadu not to approach it for every issue regarding the dam, urging them to behave like normal litigants and not use the court as a platform to score political brownie points. The court had said the States should approach the Mullaperiyar issue in a dispassionate manner and take decisions in a consensual manner. It has been constantly reminding the two neighbouring States that the apex court should not be compelled into the day-to-day management of the dam. The court’s stern words had come after Kerala filed an application complaining that Tamil Nadu was releasing water from the dam at the middle of the night without any prior warning, endangering the lives of thousands living downstream. Kerala said Tamil Nadu should inform 24 hours before opening the shutters to release water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/not-here-to-administer-mullaperiyar-dam-sc/article38245655.ece

Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu struck down a 2016 amendment to the Tamil Nadu Town Panchayats, Municipalities and Corporations (Delimitation of Wards or Divisions and Reservation) Rules, 1996. Zone as a unit The amendment provided for taking an individual zone as a unit for determining reservation for women candidates in the GCC alone. It was made to ensure that reservation was spread over all zones. However, the Division Bench agreed with senior counsel S. Prabakaran, representing the petitioner, that reservation on the basis of zones had led to the overall quota having crossed the permissible limit of 50%. The judges held that such a procedure could not be adopted with respect to the GCC alone when the reservation for women was being done only on the basis of the total number of seats in the Corporations of Coimbatore, Madurai and other cities. R. Parthiban of West Mambalam had filed the petition contending that the legal provisions, relating to reservation for women candidates in the urban local bodies, originally provided for only one-third of the seats to be reserved for them.

Ramana is scheduled on Wednesday (January 12) to urgently hear a petition seeking the arrest and trial of people who made hate speeches, inciting violence towards Muslims, at the HaridwarDharma Sansad. The other judges on the Bench are Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli. The CJI had on Monday assured senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing in the petition, that the court would list the case quickly. “The hate speeches consisted of open calls for genocide of Muslims in order to achieve ethnic cleansing. The speeches are not mere hate speeches but amount to an open call for murder of an entire community. The speeches thus, pose a grave threat not just to the unity and integrity of our country but also endanger the lives of millions of Muslim citizens,” the petitioners, former High Court judge Anjana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali, had highlighted in the top court.  “We are living in different times where slogans in the country have changed from Satyamev Jayate to Shashtramev Jayate ,” Mr. Sibal had submitted in court during the oral mentioning on Monday. The senior lawyer had said no investigation or arrests have been made despite the registration of FIRs. Video footage raises suspicions of police being hand in glove with the orators of hate. The hate speeches were allegedly delivered between December 17 and 19, 2021, in Haridwar by Yati Narsinghanand and in Delhi by ‘Hindu Yuva Vahini’. The petition has sought an independent, credible and impartial probe by a special investigation team into the hate speeches against the Muslim community.  ‘Police inaction’ The petitioners said “despite the passage of almost three weeks no effective steps have been taken by the police authorities including non-application of Sections 120B, 121A and 153B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 that squarely apply to hate speeches”. “The blatant inaction by the police also came into the forefront when a police officer’s video went viral on the internet, wherein one of speakers openly acknowledged the officer’s allegiance with the organisers and speakers of theDharmaSansad... the police authorities are hand in glove with the perpetrators of communal hate,” the petitioners has argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-hear-plea-seeking-probe-into-haridwar-hate-speech-today/article38245562.ece

At the press conference, Mr. Sidhu launched the ‘Punjab Model’ that according to him would bring back power in the hands of people. The banner at the event included only photographs of AICC president Sonia Gandhi, former president Rahul Gandhi, general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and Mr. Sidhu. Interestingly, Mr. Sidhu launched his ‘Punjab Model’ even as Ms. Gandhi set up a ‘manifesto committee’ for the Punjab election. Mr. Sidhu said the Punjab Model was formulated in consultation with the party’s Punjab affairs general secretary. Unveiling policies on issues such as liquor, sand mining, cable TV and transport, Mr. Sidhu asserted that the State and its people should wake up to the possibility of change and unravel the potential of the schemes announced by the PCC. This time, people will elect their Chief Minister based on the futuristic agenda, he said, adding, “These changes will transform the landscape of the people and lead us to a prosperous Punjab.” He said the aim was to utilise the State’s resources to the maximum and generate maximum revenue possible so that the same can be invested in the development of people. ‘Convince party first’ The event on Tuesday came days after Mr. Jakhar stated that before going and convincing the public of the benefits of his ‘Punjab Model’, Mr. Sidhu should first convince the party and get it adopted by the party, and not just go ahead with it as an “individual’s model”. Congress spokesperson and national general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala had recently stated that Mr. Channi, Mr. Sidhu and Mr. Jakhar would together lead the party in Punjab for the upcoming election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chief-minister-channi-missing-as-sidhu-rolls-out-punjab-model/article38245580.ece

Bhutia. The Bench reconstituted the committee to review the situation on the Ganga Sagar Island with a retired judge of this High Court as its chairperson. In its earlier order, the court had set up a committee comprising Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari, a representative of the State and a representative of the Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission. The State government submitted before the court that the committee “should not only be an independent one but it should not have a political member”. The High Court said that when it had issued an order on January 7 it was not made known to it that the posts of the Chairman, Human Rights Commission, and the Secretary of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission were vacant. “To avoid any misapprehension in the mind of the applicants or the State, we deemed it proper to reconstitute the committee with the retired judge of this High Court as chairperson to review the situation on the spot at the Ganga Sagar Island,” the Bench said. The court said the Chief Secretary, Government of West Bengal, would be personally liable to ensure the compliance of above directions and the directions contained in the January 7 order. State against ban While public health experts have expressed concern over holding the annual pilgrimage, the West Bengal government, in an affidavit in the court on January 6, had informed that it was not in favour of banning the Gangasagar Mela at this stage in view of the arrangements already made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/more-curbs-for-ganga-sagar-mela/article38245594.ece

Missile hit the designated target ship precisely,” the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said.   The successful test-firing certifies the accuracy of the ship’s combat system and armament complex and also validates a new capability the missile provides the Navy and the nation, the Navy said. “Augurs very well for Aatma Nirbhar Bharat and provides the Navy yet another shot in the arm,” it added.  Mission readiness  Congratulating scientists on the successful test firing, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on social media, “The robustness of Indian Navy mission readiness is reconfirmed today after successful launch of the advanced version of BrahMos Missile from INSVishakhapatnam today.”  BrahMos is joint collaboration between India and Russia and is capable of being launched from land, sea, sub-sea and air against surface and sea-based targets, with a range capped at 290 km initially. The range of the missile was originally capped at 290 km as per obligations of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Following India’s entry into the club in June 2016, officials said the range would be extended to 450 km and to 600km at a later stage. An extended range missile had been tested earlier.

He said the rise in numbers was expected to continue for the next few weeks. At present, COVID deaths were being reported mostly among those with co-morbidities, the expert said. Following the continued spike in cases across India, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday held a virtual meeting with members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to discuss the clinical treatment guidelines and measures to be brought in to ensure that correct information was provided to the public. “Most COVID-19 cases in India currently seem to be driven by the Omicron variant,” said N.K. Arora, who heads the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), COVID Working Group.  The early indication given by the IIT Kanpur model noted that transmission was taking place very actively and that India should be reaching its peak in the near future. “But it is likely to last for several weeks before it subsides,” Dr. Arora told ANI .  “The peak will depend on the virus transmission, and how well the community adheres to the COVID-appropriate behaviour. If the norms are violated, a faster and taller peak is likely to occur. On the other hand, vaccination and administrative actions such as night curfews and weekend curfews tend to flatten the curve,” he said. He said the initial experience from the genomic surveillance showed that from 10 days to two weeks, over 90% of the virus circulating in big cities like Delhi, Pune and Mumbai was the Omicron variant. However, the Delta variant cases were not completely out and some districts of Tamil Nadu and the areas of the north-eastern States were still reporting the cases. Dr. Arora said that as per reports, most of the COVID-19 deaths were associated with patients with co-morbidities. “About 85% of the deaths being reported are from people above 60 years of age,” he added||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omicron-variant-behind-current-surge-in-cases/article38245587.ece

The experts of the task force cited safety concerns, and argued that Molnupiravir was not of much benefit in COVID treatment to arrive at the decision in a meeting held on Monday. According to the Health Ministry, Molnupiravir is an antiviral drug that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by viral mutagenesis. This anti-COVID pill got the Drug Regulator General of India’s approval on December 28 for restricted use in emergencies. Mutagenesis is a process by which the genetic information of an organism is changed by the production of mutation. “Members of the National Task Force for COVID-19 were not in favour of including the drug in the national treatment guidelines citing that it does not have much benefit in the treatment of coronavirus infection and that there were safety concerns,” an official source said. Indian Council of Medical Research chief Balram Bhargava had said Molnupiravir had major safety concerns. He added that the World Health Organization and the U.K. had not included it for treatment. He said this drug could cause defects in a developing foetus and could damage the muscles also. “Contraception will have to be done for three months for male and female if this drug is given because the child born could be problematic due to teratogenic influence,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-molnupiravir-icmr-team/article38245592.ece

Mr. Puri was speaking during a briefing on the Ministry’s month-long programme to mark Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav , the government-wide celebration of the 75th year of Independence, when he said the programme would culminate at an event in Surat on February 4 and February 5 “hopefully”.  ‘Highest amount of rain’ “I use the word hopefully because we plan but we got the highest amount of rainfall that any day in January has witnessed in the last many years and I think my Central Vista Avenue expansion programme has probably lost a day or two, but not more.” He then went on to speak about the “Smart Cities, Smart Urbanisation” grand finale event in Surat, which would be held in-person if the COVID-19 situation permitted. This isn’t the first time that rainfall has caused delay in the project. In September 2021, Mr. Puri had visited the site and tweeted that more workers were being deployed to compensate for the time lost due to rain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rain-delays-central-vista-project-again/article38245559.ece

The Home Minister hit back saying the Akali leader was “rejoicing shamelessly over his interim bail, but he should remember that he is not a ‘freedom fighter’ but a ‘drug peddler’ on the run and the Akali leader will have to soon pay for his sins against Punjab and its youth”. Addressing a press conference a day after he was granted interim bail and stay on arrest by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Mr. Majithia said, “Truth has won despite a clear-cut conspiracy by the Congress government to use threats and allurements to implicate me in a false case.” ‘Politicisation of police’ Asserting that Punjabis had suffered due to the Congress government’s decision to focus on vendetta politics during the past three months, Mr. Majithia said, “Never before in the history of the State have three DGPs and four Directors of the Bureau of Investigation been changed in such a short period.” Mr. Majithia also alleged that there has been a complete politicisation of the police force in Punjab under the present Congress regime. “The clearance to compromise the safety of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent visit to Ferozepur was a well-planned conspiracy, which was hatched at the Chief Minister’s residence with the CM himself and the Home Minister being the prime conspirators,” he alleged. Responding to the Akali leader’s allegations, Mr. Randhawa, in a statement, said Mr. Majithia can’t escape from the punishment for the crime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-hc-bail-majithia-randhawa-trade-charges/article38245578.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao to take the lead in national politics in the fight against the BJP. The invitation came in the midst of a meeting between Mr. Rao and Mr. Prasad’s son and Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly Tejashwi Yadav at the former’s camp office. Significantly, Mr. Tejashwi called on Mr. Rao three days after the general secretaries of the CPI and the CPI(M) met Mr. Rao separately to discuss the unity of parties to pull down the BJP-led government at the Centre. As Mr. Tejashwi and Mr. Rao were discussing the “anarchic rule” of BJP at the Centre, the latter called up Mr. Tejashwi’s father over phone. The senior Yadav urged Mr. Rao to play a role at the national level befitting his good work in the State. After Mr. Rao enquired about Mr. Prasad’s health, the latter invited the TRS supremo to Patna for discussions. Mr. Prasad recalled the support of the RJD for the formation of Telangana and complimented Mr. Rao over his struggles and sacrifices for a separate State. Mr. Rao achieved his objective and he was taking the State on a path of development, making the nation proud. His experience of running a government favourable to all castes, religions and the downtrodden was needed for the country, Mr. Lalu said, according to sources. ‘Unite against BJP’ Mr. Prasad also insisted that all secular parties should unite to rid the country of the anarchic rule of the BJP. The country should not be allowed to go to ruins. “You must take the lead,” he told Mr. Rao. Earlier, at the meeting Mr. Tejashwi and Mr. Rao were of the view that there was an urgent need for democratic and secular forces to unite to reject the divisive and undemocratic policies of BJP. The two leaders came to the conclusionthat an action plan be chalked out shortly in the struggles against the BJP, sources said. The struggles of parties at the national level should be focussed on intensifying the unity of secular and democratic forces. The message was instantly conveyed to Mr. Prasad over phone, they added. Mr. Tejashwi enquired about the welfare programmes of the Telangana government and development of agriculture and irrigation sectors in the State. They also discussed the latest political situation in Uttar Pradesh which was going to the polls. They analysed that a Minister quitting UP Cabinet and some MLAs of BJP deserting the party were indications of bad time for the party in elections. The support extended by Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar to Akhilesh Yadav led Samajwadi Party in UP was a major development in this context.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lalu-invites-kcr-to-enter-national-politics/article38245573.ece

A senior official privy to the probe declined to disclose the contents of the provisional report that was prepared after the five-member SIT examined more than 60 witnesses and also interrogated members of an elite force of the Army said to have carried out the botched operation on December 4. Final report not yet “It will take some time for the final report to be submitted. Reports are awaited from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, that is the reason,” the official said. “We have completed the examination of the Army personnel in Assam’s Jorhat who were reportedly involved in the massacre at Oting village. The other aspects of the investigation are going on smoothly,” the official added. On January 10, Konyak civil society organisations decided to convene a summit on January 14 to chalk out their action plan over the delay in booking the culprits of the killings. The Konyak Nagas are the dominant community in the Mon district. Among the demands of the Konyak organisations is the trial of all the officers and jawans involved in the killing of the 14 civilians in an “applicable civil court”. Soldiers of the Army’s elite unit on December 4 gunned down six coal miners near Oting village in a botched operation, “mistaking” them to be extremists. Seven more people were killed when the villagers, alarmed by the gunshots, attacked the soldiers. Another person was killed in Mon, the district headquarters, when the security forces opened fire on a mob that attacked an Assam Rifles camp to protest the killings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sit-submits-report-on-naga-killings/article38245571.ece

The court observed that petitioner Bablu Paul, a resident of Patharkandi in southern Assam’s Karimganj district, can “get the benefit of citizenship” under the CAA that “lifted” the “bar to get citizenship by registration” for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014. Mr. Paul is a Hindu. The Foreigners’ Tribunal-II of the district had in May 2017 declared him a foreigner who came to India illegally from Bangladesh on or after March 25, 1971. He challenged the judgement claiming that he was about two years old when he entered West Bengal with his father Boloram Paul and grandfather Chintaharan Paul 57 years ago from East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh on March 26, 1971. He settled in Patharkandi in 1984 and set up a jewellery business there. The two-judge bench of Justice N. Kotiswar Singh and Justice Malasri Nandi observed that the petitioner entered India in 1964 without any valid documents but was given shelter by this country. “Merely because he was given shelter does not mean that he is a legal migrant as he did not possess any valid document/passport to enter India,” the court said. While expressing its inability to declare Mr. Paul as an Indian citizen, the court said the bar to his citizenship by registration was lifted by the CAA and exemptions made in other Central rules such as the Passport (Entry into India) Act of 1920.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/apply-for-citizenship-under-caa-says-hc/article38245635.ece

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, which was hearing the pleas filed by 12 BJP MLAs who have challenged their one-year suspension from the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for allegedly misbehaving with the presiding officer, observed that there was a statutory obligation to fill a seat within six months. “You cannot create a constitutional void, a hiatus situation for the constituency. And it is one constituency or 12 constituencies, it makes no difference. Each constituency has equal amount of right to be represented in the House,” the court observed. It said the House cannot suspend a member beyond 59 days. Suspension of the MLAs would amount to punishing the constituencies as a whole. The Bench referred to Article 190 (4) of the Constitution which says that if for a period of 60 days, a member of a House, without its permission, is absent, the Ho- use may declare his or her seat vacant. The court posted the case for January 18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/suspension-of-mla-is-worse-than-expulsion-observes-sc/article38245575.ece

Incoming and outbound flights from Mysuru have seen a fall in passenger numbers in the last few days, in sync with the general increase in COVID-19 cases.  Mysuru airport Director R. Manjunath told The Hindu that flight operations had more or less attained the passenger traffic that existed in the pre-pandemic times. All the flights had over 90% occupancy, and there were signs of a revival in air traffic. But within two weeks, occupancy rates have been a gradual dip, and is now down by at least 30%.  Worst affected He said that some of the sectors in which passenger occupancy was consistently around 95%, like Mysuru-Hyderabad, Mysuru-Chennai and Mysuru-Goa, were the worst affected. “As COVID-19 cases increased in those cities or States, outbound traffic from Mysuru to these cities began to take a hit. Occupancy has come down from 95% to 60%,” he added. With the number of new COVID-19 cases increasing in Mysuru over the last few days, occupancy rates are expected to fall further. The third wave has also put paid to the exercise of seeking additional flights to Mysuru. Mr. Manjunath said additional flights were in the offing to Goa, which is a very popular destination. Flights were also sought to Goa via Belagavi, Kalaburagi via Hubballi, Tirupathi, Shirdi and a late evening or early morning flight to Mangaluru. “We had sounded off flight operators about the potential. The additional flight to Goa was almost getting finalised, but now all proposals are on hold,” he said. At present flights operate from Mysuru to Chennai, Goa, Kochi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad (two flights). Some passengers prefer to fly to Hyderabad or Chennai and take a connecting flight to Delhi or Kolkata instead of traversing nearly five hours by road to Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru Cancellation of tickets A decline in passenger occupancy rates has also been reported by the railways, which is a mass public transport provider. The passenger footfall during weekends at Mysuru railway station was down from around 15,000 on an average day to 5,000 while the occupancy rates in unreserved trains and compartments were also low compared to the actual carrying capacity of the trains. There was a decline in the number of passengers travelling from Mysuru to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, which are reporting a surge in COVID-19 cases, while cancellation of reserved tickets is on the rise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/third-wave-hits-occupancy-in-flights-trains-in-mysuru/article38245701.ece

It also advised the States and the Union Territories that the prison admission register may be suitably revised to include “transgender” as a category other than male and female gender. It also asked that similar provision may be made in the Prison Management System in maintaining electronic records. The government enacted the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act in 2019 and the advisory was sent to ensure their safety and to protect them against any form of exploitation in the context of prisons and correctional facilities. “However, while making provision for a separate enclosure for transgender prisoners, due care may be taken by the prison authorities that this may not result in their complete isolation or propagate social stigma among such prisoners,” it said. “There should also be adequate preservation of right to privacy and dignity in regard to separate toilets for transmen and transwomen as well as shower facilities,” the advisory said. It said the physical search of a transgender person may be conducted by a person of their preferred gender or by a trained medical professional or a paramedic. “The person conducting the search must ensure the safety, privacy and dignity of the person being searched. At the stage where the search procedure requires stripping, it must be done in a private room or partition,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/advisory-on-transgender-prisoners/article38245568.ece

Mr. Maurya also defended the right of the dharmacharyas to express their views from their own platform.  As per a BBC report on the incident, Mr. Maurya asked his security personnel to delete the video of the interview and also allegedly pulled at reporter Anant Zanane’s face mask.  The reporter’s question on why Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh remained silent after the statements inciting violence against Muslims were made from the stage of the Dharma Sansad and would not the silence of the authorities further encourage the perpetrators, upset Mr. Maurya. Mr. Maurya said, “BJP does not need a certificate. We believe in developing sabka saath sabka vikas .” He also defended the right of the dharmacharyas (religious leaders) to express their views from their own platform.  ‘Speaking like an agent’  The Deputy Chief Minister then asked the reporter to talk about statements made by other religious leaders. He further said, “Why don’t you talk about how many people had to migrate from Jammu and Kashmir before [Article] 370 was removed? When you raise questions, then the questions should not be of one side only. The Dharma Sansad is not of the BJP, it belongs to the monks. What the monks say, what they don’t say in their meeting, is their subject.” When the reporter reminded Mr. Maurya, that the accused Yati Narasimhanand is from Ghaziabad, Annapurna is from Aligarh, asking why action was not taken against the kind of atmosphere these people were creating, Mr. Maurya said, “Nobody tries to create an environment, what is the right thing, what is the wrong thing, what is appropriate in their platform, they would say...” He then turned on the reporter, accusing him of speaking like an “agent” and not as a journalist. In the video posted by BBC Hindi, he is then seen removing his lapel mic. The BBC, in its report, said once the camera was switched off, Mr. Maurya pulled the reporter’s mask and directed his security personnel to forcibly delete the video.  “The cameraman managed to recover the deleted video — the video has been deleted from both the cameras, it was confirmed by the security personnel of KP Maurya, but the video could be recovered from the camera chip,” the BBC report said. The BBC said it had officially sent a complaint to the BJP national president, the party’s state president, and the Chief Minister, expressing serious objection to this incident, but no response had been received so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maurya-defends-right-of-sansad-speakers/article38245566.ece

It now ranks at 83rd position in the Henley Passport Index, climbing seven places from 90th rank last year. However, in 2020, its rank stood at 84 while in 2016, India was ranked 85th along with Mali and Uzbekistan. Japan and Singapore top the index. The current rankings are for first quarter of 2022 and India shares the position with Sao Tome and Principe in Central Africa, behind Rwanda and Uganda. Since 2005, Henley Passport Index ranks world’s passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without prior visa and is based on data from International Air Transport Association (IATA). Growing disparity India now has visa-free access to 60 destinations worldwide with Oman and Armenia being the latest additions. India has added 35 more destinations since 2006. A statement by Henley and Partners said that in 2006 an individual could, on average, visit 57 countries visa-free. “Today, that number has risen to 107, but this overall increase marks a growing disparity between countries in the global north and those in the global south,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indias-passport-rank-improves-to-83-from-90/article38245567.ece

Slamming the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for his comment of 80% people with him and 20% against him, Mr. Pawar said that such statement by a Chief Minister of a State is shameful. “He said what he believes in.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:47 IST,||Ahead of polls in U.P., senior Minister quits||However, Mr. Maurya said his daughter Sanghamitra would continue as a BJP MP and will continue to carry out her promises as MP of Budaun. “My decision has nothing to do with my son or daughter,” he said. A five-time MLA, multiple-time minister, and sitting legislator from Padrauna in Kushinagar in Purvanchal, Mr. Maurya held the Labour, Employment and Coordination portfolio in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet. In his resignation letter, Mr. Maurya, who comes from the Kanshiram thread of Bahujan politics, said he had carried out his ministerial duties diligently despite “adverse circumstances” and ideological differences with the BJP. BJP’s OBC vacuum His departure comes as big loss to the BJP’s OBC game plan in east and central U.P. as Mr. Maurya, who spent most of his life in the BSP, is considered a popular face among the most-backward castes especially the Maurya and Kushwaha communities he leads. If he joins the SP, it would come as a further boost to Akhilesh Yadav, who has already stitched key alliances with parties backed by the Maurya, Noniya Chauhan, Kurmi and Rajbhar OBC communities in eastern U.P. The SP chief has worked assiduously to ensure wider acceptability among the numerically crucial and dominant OBCs whom the BJP has been aggressively wooing with welfare schemes, Hindutva discourse and representation. Following Mr. Maurya’s decision, Mr. Yadav welcomed him to the SP, hailing him as a leader who “fights for social justice and equality.” “There will be a revolution of social justice, there where be a change in 2022,” Mr. Yadav said in his tweet in Hindi. Crucial departures MLA Brajesh Kumar Prajapati, who resigned in support of Mr. Maurya, said that in the past five years, Dalit, OBC and minority leaders were not given due respect or importance by the BJP government. Hailing Mr. Maurya as the “voice of the exploited,” Mr. Prajapati said, “he is my leader and I am with him.” Three-time MLA from Tilhar (Shahjahanpur) Roshan Lal Verma said he would follow the course of action decided by Mr. Maurya. Bhagwati Sagar, a four-time Dalit MLA from Bilhaur in Kanpur Dehat, who was minister in three Mayawati governments, also said he was leaving the BJP and would follow Mr. Maurya, indicating a soft-corner for the SP. Responding to the development, U.P. Deputy CM and BJP’s Maurya face from the RSS stable Keshav Prasad Maurya appealed to Mr. Swami Prasad Maurya to reconsider his decision and hold talks. “Decisions taken in haste often prove to be wrong,” Mr. Keshav Prasad tweeted. Sidharth Nath Singh, BJP government spokesperson, was more critical. He questioned Mr. Swami Prasad Maurya’s claim to do politics of the backward castes when he was leaving the only party which works for Dalits, poor and farmers to ride the “punctured cycle of the SP”, he said. Mr. Maurya, who started his political career with the Yuva Lok Dal in Prayagraj, then Allahabad, in 1980 had enjoyed a stint as the State general secretary of the Janta Dal from 1991 to 1995 before he was appointed the BSP State general secretary in 1996. He has been a minister in the governments led by BSP chief Mayawati.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-obc-leader-swami-prasad-maurya-quits/article38245556.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:48 IST,||Param Bir’s distrust of police ‘disturbing’: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday found former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh’s abiding distrust of the very police he once led “disturbing”. Mr. Singh wants the FIRs of extortion and corruption registered against him by the police to be transferred to the CBI. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice S.K. Kaul, the former police chief portrayed himself as a whistle-blower who plucked up the courage to face a “draconian” State and its police which have hounded him for exposing the alleged wrongdoings of former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, facing money laundering charges. CBI’s claim As if to buttress Mr. Singh’s negativity about the Maharashtra State apparatus, the CBI, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, said several stumbling blocks had been laid out in its way in the probe against Mr. Deshmukh. The apex court had protected Mr. Singh from arrest in November, provided he co-operated with the investigation against him. On Tuesday, the court extended the protection. The court finally adjourned the case.  In early December 2021, the apex court had indicated its prima facie view that the CBI, and not the Maharashtra police, ought to probe the allegations of corruption and misconduct against Mr. Singh.  The court had not stopped the Maharashtra police from continuing with their probe into Mr. Singh, but had restrained them from filing charge sheets against the former top police official. The apex court had said the primary question that needed to be answered was that of bias raised by Mr. Singh against the State police. The Bench was hearing an appeal filed by Mr. Singh against a Bombay High Court order dismissing his plea challenging the enquiry ordered against him for corruption and allegedly violating service rules. Senior advocate Darius Kambatta, for Maharashtra, had said the cases should remain with the Maharashtra police. The issues raised by Mr. Singh concerned departmental enquiries which should be resolved in the Central Administrative Tribunal. Exclusive jurisdiction The High Court had dismissed the case for the reason that the Tribunal had “exclusive jurisdiction” over it. The State argued that Mr. Singh is being wrongly portrayed as a “whistle-blower”, he wrote the letter against then Maharashtra Home Minister Mr. Anil Deshmukh and leaked it to the media when he sensed the tide was turning against him. Mr. Kambatta also pointed out that the current CBI Director S.K. Jaiswal was the Director General of Police, Maharashtra at the time of the contentious transfers and postings under question. Senior advocate Puneet Bali, for Mr. Singh, said all he wanted was a fair, quick and independent enquiry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/param-birs-distrust-of-police-disturbing-sc/article38245564.ece

Kerala said Tamil Nadu should inform 24 hours before opening the shutters to release water. The court had said it was up to the supervisory committee to consider the need for release of water from the dam and when or how it should be released. “Political statements are being made here and such statements cannot be made in court. Let there be a dispassionate approach. Applications cannot come here on a daily basis. This is all generated by somebody’s ingenuity,” Justice Khanwilkar had remarked. Tamil Nadu, in an affidavit, had said the safety of the dam was supported by reports of the expert committee and the empowered committee after extensive study. It said the height of storage level of the dam at 142 ft. was endorsed by the Supreme Court in 2014 in a judgment. Kerala, in turn, had demanded a reconsideration of the rule curve as the dam is situated in a seismic zone. It had accused Tamil Nadu of adopting an “obsolete” gate operation schedule dating back to 1939.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/not-here-to-administer-mullaperiyar-dam-sc/article38245569.ece

A burglary in Guwahati during the last 24 hours would hardly have made news but for the State police’s take on the incident on Twitter. “The curious case of a cereal burglar! Despite its many health benefits, turns out, cooking khichdi during a burglary attempt can be injurious to your well-being,” it tweeted on Tuesday. “The burglar has been arrested and @GuwahatiPol is serving him some hot meals,” it added. Locals in the city's Hengerabari area were alerted by the sounds from the kitchen of a house whose occupants were away. They caught the burglar cooking and handed him over to the police.  On Monday, the Guwahati traffic police tweaked the “ hum do, hamaare do ” slogan coined in 1952 for a family planning campaign for couples to not have more than two children. “ Aami duta, amaar duta helmet (the two of us, our two helmets),” the Tweet in Assamese read above the red inverted pyramid of the family planning campaign.

The Guild also urged the government to take steps to dismantle this “misogynistic and abusive digital ecosystem”. In a statement here, the Guild said there should be a thorough investigation to identify and punish all the people working for the app. It was disturbing to note, the statement said, that most of the attacks were targeted at journalists who had been critical of the current government and the ruling party. “This is a travesty of all democratic norms, and in violation of law,” it added.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:48 IST,||India, South Korea discuss trade barriers||India and South Korea on Tuesday held discussions on bilateral trade and agreed to fast track negotiations to upgrade the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). During the meeting between Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and his South Korean counterpart Yeo Han-koo, the Indian side highlighted the difficulties the bovine meat exports are facing in South Korea. Sources said Seoul was urged to expedite the process to help in export of agricultural products. “The two Ministers agreed with the spirit of openness to address difficulties expressed by industry from both sides and instructed their respective negotiating teams to meet on a regular basis to conclude the CEPA upgradation process negotiations as soon as possible in a time-bound manner,” said the joint statement issued after the dialogue. Sources said New Delhi had put in a request to Seoul to provide market access for bovine meat in 2019 which was renewed in 2021. But it appears that South Korea has been insisting that India should get a clearance from the World Organisation for Animal Health. However, the Indian has said the meat is being exported to several countries like Mauritius, Brunei, the Maldives, Seychelles and the Philippines and there are no complaints regarding the foot-and-mouth disease from them. It was learnt that India had also raised the need to expedite the process to facilitate export of grapes, pomegranate arils and eggplants. The request has been pending for more than a decade with the Korean side. The discussion also focused on the employment possibilities for English teachers and IT professionals in Korea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-south-korea-discuss-trade-barriers/article38245589.ece

Subramanian said on Tuesday. Tamil Nadu has over 3 lakh testing kits for the S-gene drop, and the Department of Biotechnology has approved the inclusion of one laboratory as a new INSACOG Genome Sequencing Laboratory in the State. Speaking to journalists, he said that only samples from clusters would be sent to NIV, Pune for the identification of new variants, if any. “The Chief Minister is determined to control the spread of COVID-19 without any adverse impact on the economy. So, there is no need for a major lockdown. With the cooperation of residents, the number of cases can be controlled. Whether we can relax the lockdown or not depends entirely on the attitude of the people; whether they follow COVID-19 protocols, he said, in response to a question on whether the lockdown would be suspended during the Pongal weekend. “Currently, patients with a combination of co-morbidities and the Delta variant and the Omicron variant are being admitted to hospital. Less than 1% of the beds at COVID-19 care centres are occupied. Patients with a mild infection are requested to be in home isolation. Those who do not have rooms for isolation at home are requested to get themselves admitted to COVID-19 care centres. Just 30 beds at the Nandambakkam Trade Centre have been occupied,” Mr. Subramanian said. “Cases increased by around 1,700 on Monday. There is an increase of around 2,000 cases every day. A total of 178 doctors and volunteers have been deployed for telecounselling to monitor the condition of residents in home isolation in Chennai,” he said. “An apartment complex at Thiruvanmiyur reported a cluster of more than 10 cases. We have launched the distribution of pulse oximeters to such residents. Virtual monitoring of cases is being done in Chennai,” he said. The Minister said there were at least 26,000 active cases in Chennai, and 21,987 people were in home isolation. At least 200 medical teams had been formed to conduct camps in cluster areas. The King Institute and the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital had admitted 250 Omicron cases each. These patients did not require intensive care or oxygen support. “A total of 20,000 people received their precautionary vaccine booster dose on Monday. Around 22.5 lakh children aged 15-18 have received the vaccine in Tamil Nadu,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-stops-sending-samples-to-pune-to-confirm-omicron-cases/article38245756.ece

Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu passed the interim order on a writ petition filed by the foundation contending the State government authorities had misconstrued an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification issued in 2014. Senior counsel C.S. Vaidyanathan, representing the foundation, stated the 2014 notification was an extension of a similar notification issued in 2006 and therefore the exemption granted for buildings used for educational purposes must be extended from 2006 and not from 2014. He claimed the State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority was also clear on the issue. Nevertheless, due to mala fide reasons, the State government officials had decided to prosecute the foundation after the recent change of regime, the counsel alleged. On the other hand, Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram said, it was up to the Centre to clarify whether the 2014 notification would have a retrospective effect from 2006 or not. He added the prosecution had already been launched by filing a complaint before a Magistrate’s court. After hearing both sides, the judges ordered notices, returnable by two weeks, to the Centre and the State government and asked Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan to ascertain the stand of the Centre on the issue by the next hearing. Filing an affidavit on behalf of the foundation, its authorised signatory C.R. Dinesh Raja contended it was a volunteer-run registered public charitable trust, founded in 1992. The foundation had set up Isha Yoga Centre in 1994 to run a group of educational institutions. A variety of courses on yoga, classical arts and Sanskrit were taught through a Gurukul format. The foundation also began imparting English-medium education, affiliated to the ICSE Board. The institutions were spread over 48.3 hectares in Velliangiri hills. Claiming that the buildings used for educational purposes were spread over 1,25,849 square metres, the foundation stated that 28,279 square metres were constructed before 2006, when the first EIA notification came into force, and the remaining 91,519 square metres were constructed later. The foundation contended that the 2014 EIA notification was an extension of the 2006 notification and therefore the exemption provided under the former for educational institutions must apply from 2006 onwards and there could not be an unreasonable classification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madras-hc-restrains-govt-from-prosecuting-isha-foundation/article38245894.ece

Law Department sent reminder to Raj Bhavan in December||The Tamil Nadu Law Department had, in December last year, sent a reminder to the Governor’s Secretariat on the Bill to dispense with NEET-based admissions for undergraduate medical courses, which was passed by the Legislative Assembly in September. This has come to light in a response from the Law Department to an application filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. In an application dated November 22, 2021, P. B. Prince Gajendra Babu, general secretary of State Platform for Common School System (Tamil Nadu) had sought to know the status of the Bill, which requires Presidential assent. Responding to this, Law Department Under Secretary K Sakthivel has informed Mr. Gajendra Babu on January 6 that a reminder was sent to the Raj Bhavan on December 1 last year. In the letter, C. Gopi Ravikumar, Secretary to Government (Legislation), pointed out that on September 18, the Tamil Nadu Admission Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill 2021, passed by the Legislative Assembly, was submitted to the Governor to reserve the Bill for consideration of the President. He said the Tamil Nadu Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming Services (Promotions and Facilitation) Repeal Bill 2021 and the Bharathiar University (Amendment) Bill 202, were sent to the Governor’s Secretariat on September 20. He requested the Secretary to Governor, “to obtain the orders of the Honourable Governor” on the Bills and to return the files to the Law Department. ‘Under consideration’ Earlier, by a reply dated December 17, the Raj Bhavan had informed Mr. Gajendra Babu that the file relating to the NEET exemption Bill “is under consideration” of the Governor. On January 8, chairing a meeting of all-party legislators on the NEET Bill, Chief Minister M K Stalin had complained that the Governor did not forward the Bill to the President though he had met and urged him to do so. A delegation of Tamil Nadu MPs is also expected to meet Home Minister Amit Shah in this regard in a few days. The BJP, which has four MLAs, has defended the NEET.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 05:57 IST,TAMIL NADU||CM’s Economic Advisory Council member favours universal basic income for T.N.||Member of Economic Advisory Council to the Chief Minister Arvind Subramanian said he was in favour of the State introducing a universal basic income scheme. An idea of a minimum basic income would help complete Tamil Nadu’s social safety net project and help in individuals realising their potential, he added. He was speaking at a webinar on the topic ‘Tamil Nadu’s major development challenges and how can policy respond?’, organised by Chennai International Centre on Monday. Mr. Subramanian said Tamil Nadu had a successful social development model and currently beneficiaries were targeted based on particular criteria. His personal view is universal basic income is one more step where one can look at the leakages happening and rationalise and design a well targeted minimum income programme. Mr. Subramanian said his idea was a quasi-universal basic income model where the rich were excluded and the rest covered. “It is an easier task to identify the rich people, than identifying the poor people,” he said. Mr. Subramanian pointed out Tamil Nadu’s growth had lost its way partly because of the economic challenges faced by India and also some local factors like the governance deteriorating in the last 7-8 years. Moreover, there was much more political instability. Despite having the technology and talent, Chennai had only three Unicorns (startups valued over $1 billion) out of 80 in India, he added. “Unicorns were the boom sector in India in the last three years and Tamil Nadu lagged behind in this dynamic sector. The State government is addressing it now,” Mr. Subramanian said. However, he said that alone would not be enough and the State needed to focus on export-oriented labour intensive sectors. Mr. Subramanian said the State had historical advantages in clothing, footwear and auto sector and some of it had been lost. “As China has become richer and less competitive, it has been vacating these sectors from 2010 and there is a $150 billion export opportunity. This is currently going to Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Thailand. Tamil Nadu is well placed to grab some of these opportunities,” Mr. Subramanian said. It was also important to address the resource constraint faced by the State with high deficits and most of the revenue going towards interest payments. Reform in power sector Two big areas which needed reforms were property tax sector and power sector. He called for innovative property taxes. The problem of power sector with the State’s power utility having massive debt had to be addressed. This was destabilising the State’s resource and macroeconomic position, Mr. Subramanian added. He said power tariffs for manufacturing should be reduced and that resource should come from elsewhere from the power sector. This would add to the State’s competitiveness and attractiveness as an investment destination. Tamil Nadu was one of the most urbanised States and earned Rs. 2,500 crore from property tax, which was not even a fraction of what other less urbanised States like Maharashtra and Karnataka earned. Asked about property tax and power reforms being politically sensitive topics, he said at the moment there seemed to be optimism about the political will. Mr. Subramanian also pointed out there had been strain in the relationship between the Centre and the States mainly due to centralisation. This issued had to be addressed and there should be a relook at how revenue generated by States were redistributed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cms-economic-advisory-council-member-for-universal-basic-income/article38245740.ece

Stalin on Tuesday called upon Secretaries of the State Government to set targets by competing not with other States but with developed and South Asian countries. He also urged them to visit the districts twice a month to monitor the implementation of various schemes. “We have to compare ourselves with the well-developed. We should avoid comparing ourselves with other States in the country to see if we are doing better,” the Chief Minister said. Chairing a meeting to review the status of various announcements made by the State Government, Mr. Stalin said officials should focus on improving water resources, agricultural production, quality of education and health indicators, ensuring housing for all, developing industrial infrastructure, honing skills of the youth and eradicating poverty. Of the 1,641 announcements made during the Governor’s speech and the State Government, necessary Government Orders (G.O.) have been issued for 1,313, which was 80%, he said, and instructed officials to work towards realising the remaining announcements. Mr. Stalin said the duty of the officials did not end after issuing G.O.s, but they had to check and ensure that the schemes had reached the beneficiaries and whether funds had been released to them. He also instructed Secretaries to visit districts at least twice a month. The Chief Minister also asked them to plan in advance for the upcoming year, coordinate with the Union Government to get approval and allocations for the remaining 20% of the announcements. There was a need for a road map, he added. Monitoring the dashboard installed in his chamber by the Tamil Nadu e-Governance Agency to keep track of various government schemes, Mr. Stalin said the next review meeting would be held in February.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 04:32 IST,TAMIL NADU||Lorry owners’ federation wants separate colour code for sand lorries||Tamil Nadu State Sand Lorry Owners’ Federation has suggested that the State government introduce separate colour code for sand lorries to streamline river sand sale. While welcoming the government’s move to open more sand quarries and make it easily available for people, members of the federation said fixing colour code for lorries used for transportation of sand would help easily identify them. Similarly, such vehicles must also be fitted with GPS equipment. It may be recalled that the government had recently announced opening of river sand quarries across Tamil Nadu and prioritising sales for individual customers at a cost of Rs. 1,000 per unit. At present, the government had noted that GPS equipment would be fitted in shunting vehicles to be used in quarries and government sand depots. However, the federation wants such equipment to be installed in sand lorries to monitor operation and illegal sales. There are about 40,000 lorries registered as sand lories across the State. However, several of them are not being operated due to dearth of sand loads, members said. S.Yuvaraj, president of the federation, said the State government must also consider restricting trucks with national permits from engaging in sand sale to prevent transportation to other States. There are nearly 22,000 trucks with national permits operating in the State. The State has a demand for nearly 20,000 sand loads daily and of this, Chennai has a demand for about 6,000 -7,000 loads. However, sand shortage has affected construction activity. “We would be able to supply three units of sand for nearly Rs. 12,000 to Chennai if the quarries are in neighbouring district. The rate would depend on the distance of quarries and fuel cost,” he said. The federation also plans to launch portal or mobile application to aid sand customers in transporting sand loads that they purchase at government depots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lorry-owners-federation-wants-separate-colour-code-for-sand-lorries/article38245889.ece

However, officials of the Meteorological Department noted that the prospects of heavy rainfall events was less during this spell, and showers could only cover isolated places. On Wednesday, light to moderate rain may occur in a few areas over the coastal regions, Salem, Namakkal, Erode and Puducherry. The other districts may mainly experience dry weather. Coastal districts and adjoining interior places may receive light to moderate rain on Friday and Saturday. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the interaction between easterlies at the lower level and westerlies moving from the west to east would trigger rain over coastal districts. However, rainfall intensity would be restricted to light to moderate and cover isolated areas as westerly disturbance was active. Chennai also has chances of light rain in some areas during the next two days. Cloudy conditions may prevail, and nights may be relatively warm with the minimum temperature two degree Celsius above normal. On Tuesday, the city experienced warm weather with both day and minimum temperature hovering two degree Celsius above average. The weather stations at Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded a day temperature of 31.2 degree Celsius and 31.9 degree Celsius respectively. Tamil Nadu has recorded an excess rainfall so far this month with 3 cm against its normal share of 1 cm. Such wet spells extending till Pongal time has occurred during many other years in the past. Last year too, the northeast monsoon spilled over till the festival. “We are monitoring the weather, and the monsoon withdrawal can be declared only after a dry spell set in across the State,” Mr. Balachandran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-may-get-rain-during-pongal-days/article38245859.ece

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:35 IST,TAMIL NADU||Physicians should decide on chest CT scans, say doctors||The rise in coronavirus infections has led to several patients seeking chest CT scans on their own. Not everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 requires a CT scan, and the decision should be left to the treating physicians, according to doctors. V. Anand Kumar, nodal officer, Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital, said, “Right now, we have to convince many persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 that not all require scans. People tell us that they have mild fever with cough and want to undergo a scan. We are telling them that cough and sore throat are quite common now, and scans are not required if there is no breathing difficulty and no dip in oxygen saturation. The second wave was different as we saw patients with lung involvement in the early days itself, and the same protocol need not be followed now.” He said that at the COVID-19 outpatient department, the earlier protocol of prescribing a CT scan for persons who had tested positive was dropped, and home isolation was recommended with continuous monitoring for healthy and fully vaccinated individuals with a mild disease. Koushik Muthu Raja M,, associate professor, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre, said, “The number of persons voluntarily seeking CT scans is high. It is important that scans are performed judiciously and decided by healthcare providers. Self-medication and self-treatment is not correct. Whether a patient should be in home isolation or admitted to hospital or requires a scan should be decided in a clinical setting under the supervision of a healthcare provider.” As of now, scans were required for persons who had a fall in oxygen saturation levels and those with co-morbidities and immune-compromised conditions, he said. Furthermore, “scans performed in the early phases of the disease can be normal and misleading”. Another doctor said scan centres should perform scans only on prescription/request from physicians and not on patients’ request. “Most COVID-19 patients have a scan with them, often done by their referring doctor or hospital. In 80% of these cases, the scans are probably unnecessary,” said Srinivas Rajagopala, director of Transplant Pulmonology and Lung Failure Unit, Kauvery Hospital. “We do a scan only if a patient has persistent fever for three days, breathing trouble and saturation of less than 93%, or any concerns on examination, or previous lung disease that they are worried could be worsened by COVID-19. Otherwise, we do not prescribe scans upfront for everybody. It is important to avoid unnecessary scans for two reasons. One is unnecessarily doing tests and coughing up money and secondly, scans involve radiation. A lot of people have undergone a lot of CT scans over the last two years, adding to the cumulative radiation. The State government has brought out guidelines, and we have to make sure that unnecessary tests are avoided,” he said. R. Narasimhan, chairman, Respiratory Research Foundation of India, said the level of awareness among people had improved. “People are aware that Omicron does not affect the lungs or cause oxygen dependency. So, there is no increase in CT scan requirement unlike the scenario in the previous wave. Earlier, people used to walk in with CT scans. Now, the majority of them are asymptomatic. In general, there is no need for a scan and we do not suggest it unless they are symptomatic, have co-morbidities, or are unvaccinated,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/physicians-should-decide-on-chest-ct-scans-say-doctors/article38245748.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 04:01 IST,TAMIL NADU||Touched by #MeToo Movement, advocate pens book||It took senior advocate K. Santhakumari three years to get one book published. The only reason was that the subject was the #MeToo movement. “Several publishers refused to bring out the book since I had mentioned the names of some famous personalities. It took me three years to bring the book out,” she said. Finally, Ethir Veliyedu Publishers picked up the book, and it was released recently. What began in October 2017, when news of women accusing film producer Harvey Weinstein broke out, grew as the #MeToo movement and took the world by storm. India was no exception and in Tamil Nadu, notably, many accusations were made by several women, populating the laundry list that was initially drawn up by a law student Raya Sarkar. Subsequent trolling of some of the women victims, who identified themselves, on social media caught the attention of Ms. Santhakumari. “The way a singer, who had called out a famous personality, was treated, hit me hard. She had also posted messages of other women calling out their abusers too. For me, the sad part was the way the women were hounded on social media and asked to prove the guilt of the sexual predators. A number of men rallied behind the men who had been accused. I wanted to understand the psychology of a society that didthis,” she explained. Supreme Court judge V. Ramasubramanian said that victims were oftensubject tosecondaryvictimisationwhen people try to take the side of the offender.Ms.Santakumarihas covered all aspects of the movement, including its history and where itwasheaded. ‘No field an exception’ Seema Agarwal, chairperson, Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board received the first copy of the book, during the book launch. She said she had witnessedfirst-hand,the confusion and pain of women in such cases, and it was disturbing to note that no field had remained untouched by the #MeToo issue. Former High Court Judge V. Chandru explanied that despite the existence of a law to protect victims, people were using loopholes in the law to try and delay cases. He said it was not enough if there was a law, and what was really needed was the will to implement it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/touched-by-metoo-movement-advocate-pens-book/article38245737.ece

Sasikala having bought malls and mills using Rs. 1,674.50 crore in demonetised currency notes has led to an interesting development, with the Madras High Court observing that such notes cannot be considered legal tender at all. Justice Anita Sumanth made the observation while dismissing a batch of writ petitions filed by Ms. Sasikala’s alleged benamidars who had challenged the preliminary inquiry initiated against them by the Income Tax Department. The cases were dismissed by way of a common judgment on October 25 last year, but the verdict was made available only now. Holding that the Department was in possession of sufficient materials to initiate a preliminary inquiry, the judge, however, said most of the arguments raised by the petitioners could be answered only during adjudication to be undertaken by the Department. On the petitioners’ contention that action under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988, could be initiated only if the payment was made by way of legal tender, the judge said, “There is no question that currency notes of the value of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000, once demonetised, do not constitute legal tender.” She further said, “It is a plausible argument to state that ‘consideration’ must comprise legal tender alone” and left the question open for a decision by the Income Tax Department. The judge also ordered the start of adjudication within a month and insisted upon following the principles of natural justice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/demonetised-notes-cant-be-considered-legal-tender-hc/article38245732.ece

Senthil Balaji, Coimbatore District Collector and District Forest Officer of Coimbatore Forest Division seeking immediate ban on dumping of garbage by Somaiyampalayam panchayat at Maruthamalai foothills. The NGO, Aaniver Organisation, also wanted authorities to shift the waste dumped at the foothills to another designated dump yard or waste management facility. R. Santhakumar, founder of the organisation, said that the place where garbage is dumped by the panchayat is situated close to the forest boundary and many animals including elephants use it as a transit path. “Due to waste materials including food waste dumped at the place, many animals including wild boar and deer are frequenting the place for easy food. The incident wherein plastic covers and other waste materials such as sanitary napkin and mask found in the dung of a wild elephant from the area on Sunday has highlighted the gravity of the issue,” he said. According to Mr. Santhakumar, the location close to Pothigai Residency is not a designated dump yard. But Somaiyampalayam panchayat has been dumping garbage on the vacant land for over two years, he alleged. Somaiyampalayam panchayat president K.P. Rangaraj said that the local body has stopped dumping of garbage at the place. “A new waste treatment facility of the local body near Vadavalli police station has started functioning. The panchayat will also make efforts to clear the garbage dumped at the foothills,” he said. Around 25 staff from the Forest Department led by District Forest Officer T.K. Ashok Kumar removed 200 kg of plastic waste from the two km road from the foothills to the Maruthamalai temple on Tuesday. Some residents from the locality and conservancy workers from the local body also took part. The staff visited shops at the foothills and created awareness on safe and proper disposal of waste. The Department discussed with the temple administration about the threat posed by littering of plastic waste in the locality and appealed to the shop keepers to not use polythene carry bags.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ban-dumping-of-garbage-at-maruthamalai-foothills/article38245768.ece

The CB-CID, which is investigating the death and illegal stay of Lokka in disguise in Coimbatore, recently arrested Sabesan and two others Chinnasuresh (35), also from Sri Lanka, and Soundararajan (25) of Chennai. The CB-CID team led by Deputy Superintendent of Police P. Sivakumar interrogated the trio and found they were closely associated with Lokka and his confidanteChanuka Thananayake alias Ladiya. According to investigators, Sabesan and Chinnasuresh had left Sri Lanka following crimes there and to escape from a rival gang. Lokka and Ladiya had also shifted base to India for the same reason. Lokka died under suspicious circumstances while hiding in Coimbatore as Pradeep Singh in July 2020, following which the CB-CID launched an investigation. Investigators had arrested Ladiya and T. Gopalakrishnan alias Jayaprakash, who sheltered the former in Bengaluru, in November 2021.The duo during interrogation disclosed to the CB-CID about their links with Sabesan,Chinnasureshand Soundararajan. Prior to the CB-CID arresting the trio, the NIA had arrested Sabesan,Chinnasureshand Soundararajanfor their alleged involvement in the Vizhinjam arms case wherein six Sri Lankan nationals were arrested by the Coast Guard off Minicoy coast in March 18, 2021. The Coast Guard had seized five AK 47 rifles, 1,000 live rounds and 300 kg of heroin from three fishing vessels. The NIA took over the investigation and later arrested Sabesan,ChinnasureshandSoundararajanfor alleged involvement. The CB-CID formally recorded the arrest of the trio when they were in judicial remand in the NIA case and later interrogated them in custody. The CB-CID suspects Lokka and Ladiya were into drugs business while hiding in India. Ladiya took over the control after the death of Lokka,said an investigator. “Lokka and Ladiya were into drug dealing in Sri Lanka. The investigation has found out that they were doing the same from India through supporters in Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu. The entire network seems to have been smuggling drugs and arms from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. Sabesan played a key role in reaching smuggled items in Sri Lanka. The money from the illegal dealings reached Lokka and Ladiya through hawala transactions operated by Jayaprakash,” the officer said. According to the NIA, Sabesan was the key conspirator in the Vizhinjam arms case. The agency said in a release on Sabesan’s arrestthat theproceeds from the arms and drugs trafficking fromPakistanto Sri Lanka was for the revival of the LTTE. It said that he organised conspiracy meetings of LTTE sympathisers in India. Pistol seized The CB-CID has recently a pistol which Lokka’s another aide D. Sivakamasundari, an advocate from Madurai whose father is also an LTTE sympathiser, had procured for him. Sivakamasundari had buried it in a deserted area after the death of Lokka.

Bill against NEET||State Platform for Common School System (SPCSS) would conduct a signature and door-to-door campaign to urge the Central government to get Presidential assent for the Tamil Nadu Bill against NEET, its general secretary P.B. Prince Gajendra Babu told journalists here on Tuesday. This would be a State-wide campaign, where the SPCSS and other supporting organisations would distribute a 24-page booklet answering all questions related to NEET and also talk about how unconstitutional it was for the Tamil Nadu Governor to delay referring the Bill to the President. On January 30, the SPCSS would hold a fast in Chennai. If by then, the Governor and Central government had not taken steps to get Presidential assent for the Bill, Mr. Babu said he would go on an indefinite fast. He was in Coimbatore, where he had secured the support of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, Dravida Tamilar Katchi, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and a few other organisations. The State government was well within its right to pass the Bill seeking to dispense with the requirement for candidates to quality in NEET to gain admission to undergraduate medical courses. The State Board syllabus for Plus Two was as good as any other, as pointed out by the National Curriculum Focus Group in the National Council of Education Research and Training. If so why was the Plus Two examination that the State government conducted not enough for students to gain admission in medical colleges. The irony was that while State government-conducted examination was enough, the one conducted by a testing agency based on the same syllabus was considered for medical admission, Mr. Babu argued. He also said that through NEET, the Central government tried to promote commercialisation of medical education and support private coaching centres . Around 2.75 lakh students applied for NEET from the State. Of those, if one lakh students spent between Rs. 3 lakh and Rs. 5 lakh for coaching. “Imagine the money involved in it,” he said. The Governor, by delaying the forwarding of the Bill for Presidential assent, was trying to create a constitutional crisis, he said and added that people would lose faith in democracy. The Bill was passed by the elected representatives in the Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-urged-to-get-presidents-assent-for-bill-against-neet/article38245770.ece

The two-day programme was organised as a part of the Asian Waterbird Census. The citizen science initiative tried to enumerate resident and migratory waterfowls associated with the major wetland ecosystems in the district such as Banasura and Karappuzha reservoir areas; Arattuthara, Valliyoor Kavu, and Panamaram paddy fields; and Ammavayal and Golur waterbodies inside the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. The key species that were recorded during the counting are spot-billed ducks, common teals, painted storks, lesser whistling ducks, and river terns, said C.K. Vishnudas, conservation biologist who supervised the survey. A red-breasted flycatcher, a migratory bird from Eastern Europe and Central Asia, was spotted near the Golur waterbody, he added. “Though small in numbers compared to other parts of Kerala, the waterbird count shows a trend of many wild ducks establishing gradually in the wetlands of Wayanad. Spot-billed ducks and common teals were very rare in Wayanad nearly 10 years ago. When the Karapuzha reservoir was partially commissioned, the shallow waterbodies close to the hills created ideal habitats for many waterbirds to thrive and breed. Spot-billed ducks and common teal population is showing an increasing trend,” he said. However, it was alarming to note that the population of lesser whistling ducks had declined considerably. Though the ducks used to be seen in good numbers in the Karapuzha wetlands, this year only three birds were recorded, according to R. L. Ratheesh, an ornithologist who led the survey. Global efforts Wetland ecosystems play a major role in maintaining the water resources of a region and are considered to be the kidneys of the earth. The data generated from the annual event contributes to the global efforts to understand the changes in avian population in response to climate and ecosystem changes, he added. As many as 50 birds enthusiasts, including members of the Ratufa Nature Club of the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Pookode, took part in the survey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wayanad-bird-census-records-140-species/article38245605.ece

Collector T. Prabhushankar, after an inspection, said the inscription in Tamil-Grantha script was found in a private land. The village, situated on the south bank of the Amaravathi river, has remnants of a Sivan and a Perumal temple. One of the stones of the Sivan temple has a 13-line inscription on one side.  “The first 10 lines of the inscription records a donation of a piece of land made by Nirandevi, wife of Sri Thennavan Vanjivel Iravikuvan, for lighting of a lamp and offering thiru amudhu to Mahadevar of the Keezhkudaiyur Sivan Temple. The last three lines is a sloka in Sanskrit. Experts indicate that the inscription could date back to the 9th century CE,” Mr. Prabhushankar said.  Karur had been referred to as Vanji in inscriptions found elsewhere too, he pointed out. The inscription and a few other sculptures found there by officials would be shifted safely to Karur Government Museum, the Collector said and added that steps would be taken to conduct a study of the inscription and the site by archaeologists soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/inscription-in-tamil-grantha-script-found-in-karur-village/article38245838.ece

Dileep’s brother P. Sivakumar, alias Anoop, and brother-in-law T.N. Suraj, who are also arraigned as accused, have also sought anticipatory bail in the case. According to the petition by Dileep and his kin, the registration of the FIR was “nothing but a vindictive and retaliatory act of investigation officer Baiju Paulose” against whom Dileep had initiated criminal contempt of court proceedings for causing obstruction to the administration of justice before the Additional Special Sessions Court trying the assault case. The FIR was filed in the wake of the allegation by Balachandrakumar, who claims to be a friend of Dileep, that he had overheard Dileep issuing death threats against the investigation officer and his team members. They pointed out that even if the allegations were accepted as true, the case did not make out any ingredients of any of the offences alleged.

The party machinery and its affiliated organisations, including the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), would be geared up to take on the “negative narrative” against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government with massive campaigns in the coming days. Workers would be asked to go to all households to expose the biased and misleading information against the project, informed sources said. The CPI(M) leadership believes that fringe environmental groups with the support of the Opposition parties, especially the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), as well as the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) are spearheading the agitation against the project in some regions. “This political propaganda against the government should be exposed,” a party functionary said. During his address to delegates at the ongoing Kozhikode district conference, CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan interpreted that the protest against the SilverLine was a political weapon against the LDF government. “If they are against the project, they should come and discuss about it. We have to defeat this political propaganda,” he said. CM to hold meetings Mr. Balakrishnan said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would hold meetings in all districts. This would be followed up with public meetings. The CPI(M) has decided to take on the orchestrated analogy of the United Democratic Front (UDF) to portray the SilverLine protest in Kerala as the West Bengal farmers’ agitation in Nandigram and Singur. The Left parties which are aware of these agitations are now implementing the SilverLine project. “We have clearly mentioned this in our manifesto,” Mr. Balakrishnan said, adding land owners who part with property would not have to shed a tear. Also, the CPI(M) leadership has decided to expose the double standards of the BJP-led government at the Centre. The Rs. 63,941-crore SilverLine project is a joint venture of the State government and the Ministry of Railways.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpim-cadre-to-counter-campaign-against-silverline/article38245609.ece

The court ordered notice and sought a response from the State in this regard. A Division Bench of Justices S. Vaidyanathan and G. Jayachandran passed the direction while hearing a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to the authorities to not grant permission for the event in Poolamvalasu in Karur district. The petitioner, N. Premnath of Karur district, said the people of Poolamvalasu had planned to conduct the rooster fight in a grand manner and were making arrangements for the event. He complained that rooster fight amounted to cruelty. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act prohibited subjecting of animals to unnecessary pain or sufferings. Therefore, rooster fights were illegal irrespective of whether roosters were fitted with knives or not, he said. The petitioner also complained that rooster fights encouraged social evils like betting, gambling and child labour. During the course of the events not only the roosters but also the public got hurt, he said.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan observed that it reflected deliberate bureaucratic refusal to understand that the Collector owed his/her position only because of the sacrifices and sufferings of freedom fighters. The court was hearing the petition filed by M. Saiyedha Begum, who said her husband Mohammed Sheriff was lodged at Allipuram Camp Jail in Bellary, Karnataka, from October 1943 to April 1944. Sheriff had not sought freedom fighters pension. However, Ms. Begum made representations to the authorities on the grounds that she was entitled to the freedom fighters family pension. The original representation was rejected on the grounds that the petitioner’s husband had not been granted the freedom fighters pension. When she approached the High Court in 2017, the court held that she was eligible for the pension. The court held that if her husband had satisfied the condition of serving in prison and other related conditions then her application could not be rejected. The authorities had not filed an appeal against the 2017 court order. Taking note of it, the judge said the order was binding on the authorities. Unfortunately, the representation was yet again rejected on the grounds that her husband had not sought the pension. The court set aside the Theni Collector’s order, and directed the Collector to consider the petitioner’s representation within six weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-consider-womans-plea-for-freedom-fighters-family-pension/article38245867.ece

Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan visited the pottery hub in Villianur on Wednesday to get a first-hand account of the hardships faced by the highly-skilled artisans. One of the main problems faced by the potters is the shortage of sand as they strive to meet the higher demand for earthen pots during Pongal. The Lt. Governor was informed that the sand for clay was sourced at high cost from Tamil Nadu. Potters also complained that they had to hawk the finished pots on the roadside as they did not have a proper trade outlet. Ms. Soundararajan, who also tried her hand at the pottery wheel, said the native skills of these potter families was remarkable and appealed to the public to extend their support and patronage. The Lt. Governor, who was accompanied by Agriculture Minister C. Djeacoumar, told the media that her visit was also to instil a sense of reassurance that the Government was willing to support the artisans and the tradition. The Government will consider providing raw materials at a subsidised rate and extending other support systems, she said. The Lt. Governor earlier inaugurated the vaccination drive for the 15-17 age group at St. Patrick Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Saradambal Nagar. About 33,000 of an estimated target population of 83,000 students had already been vaccinated and full coverage was expected to be achieved in another week or so, Ms. Soundararajan said. The administration was adopting a scientific approach to the COVID-19 situation and striking a balance between imposing certain restrictions, rather than a disruptive lockdown, and sustaining the local economy and livelihoods, she said. Stating that she had faith that the people would comply with the safety norms, Ms. Soundararajan said the new surge of cases could not be singly attributed to the granting of permission for New Year celebrations as the third wave was spreading all across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/l-g-assures-support-to-potters-in-villianur/article38246143.ece

Palaniswami alleged on Tuesday that the DMK government had looted people through the Pongal gift hampers. Talking to journalists at Omalur, he alleged that corruption to the tune of Rs. 30 crore had taken place in the procurement of sugar cane alone. While the government had set Rs. 33 as the price for the cane, it was being bought from farmers for a low price of Rs. 15-Rs. 20. He alleged that Rs. 60 is the price set for the cloth-bag, but its actual price would be Rs. 30. He said poor quality items were being given in the gift hampers and they were procured from north Indian traders. All the items in the hamper were being produced and sold in Tamil Nadu, and farmers and traders would have benefited had the items been procured in the State itself. Not all rice card-holders were getting the 21 items in the gift hamper. After he raised the issue of poor quality, the Tiruvannamalai Collector inspected the ration shops and found 2.5 tonnes of jaggery unfit for consumption. Mr. Palaniswami said that while the DMK government had been talking about promotion of Tamil, the labelling on the items in the hamper was in Hindi. New dhotis and saris were not provided at many places. There were variations in the quantity of the items, he said. He said arrests were being made on false complaints, and that the arrest of former Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji was in retaliation for his criticism of Mr. Stalin. The former Chief Minister said the government had failed to contain the spread of COVID-19. Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK entered office in May last year and the monsoon set in during October. The government did not take measures to prevent rainwater stagnation in Chennai. It was the AIADMK government that had built canals to drain rainwater. He alleged that 160 engineers of the Chennai Corporation were transferred, and those who had taken up new posts were not well-versed in flood prevention measures. On the claim that the 11 medical colleges that would be inaugurated by the Prime Minister were constructed during the DMK regime, Mr. Palaniswami said everyone knew that he himself had laid the foundation for the colleges and over 60% of the construction was completed when he was in power. AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam demanded a probe into the alleged irregularities in the distribution of the gift hampers. He said the scheme did not go down well with the people, who had been saying it would have been better had the government given them Rs. 1,000 each instead. Referring to the use of other languages, including Hindi, on the packaging of grocery items, he wondered whether the ruling party had decided to welcome Hindi. Giving an account of the items that were supplied by firms operating from other States, he wondered if no local firms were available to supply them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-govt-looting-people-through-pongal-gift-scheme-palaniswami/article38245747.ece

According to sources, civic officials on Monday came to the evening market area and asked vegetable vendors on the carriageway and at some ‘permanent structures’ behind Shyamaladevi temple to vacate. On hearing the fiat from the officials, the vendors gathered under the AITUC-affiliated `Amma Maalainera Kaaikari Angadi’ Vendors Association (AMKAV) and staged a demonstration. Association president V. Sevaiah claimed that they were doing their business in the area for more than six decades and the AITUC-affiliated AMKAV Association was formed in 2014. As the vendors carried out their business under the open sky, the association organised several demonstrations seeking permanent infrastructure in the area to carry on their bread-earning activity.  Subsequently, in 2015, the then Chairman of the civic body, K. Sulthan, who had allocated the space abutting the Cauvery Supermarket complex to them, ensured that an angadi (market) to accommodate the street vendors at the allotted site after passing a resolution in this regard at the Council.  The vendors had not remitted the rent levied for utilising the market infrastructure facility since the outbreak of novel coronavirus as the Corporation refrained from collecting the same citing the pandemic situation, Mr. Sevaiah said. Meanwhile, official sources said the fiat was issued to the vendors who had encroached upon the carriageways and the public place behind the temple. Pointing out that over a dozen shops on the market premises remained unoccupied, they said they had only directed the vegetable vendors to whom the shops were allotted to revive their business at the allotted space inside the market complex and not by encroaching public places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vendors-lock-horns-with-civic-body/article38245850.ece

Only a well-balanced committee comprising political, bureaucratic, religious representatives and persons well acquainted with Hindu religious customs and practices could help streamline the functioning of Hindu temples as per the observations and directions issued by the Supreme Court and the Madras High Court, the Archagargal Samooga Nalasangam said in the memorandum addressed to the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-reconstitute-advisory-panel-on-temples/article38245835.ece

Based on specific information about the stocking of adulterated diesel in a godown near Old EB Colony here, the police team, led by Superintendent of Police Bhaskaran, Deputy Superintendent of Police Balasubramanian and Inspector Kala raided the godown on Tuesday afternoon. They found 18,000 litres of adulterated diesel in a tanker, a small cargo vehicle and also in the PVC tanks. The police team seized the adulterated diesel and the vehicles. When the police grilled one Ravi of Sundaravelpuram in this connection, he told the investigators that 13,000 litres of adulterated diesel had been stocked in another godown in SIPCOT Industrial Complex. The police acted swiftly and seized another tanker with 13,000 litres of adulterated fuel. “By adding a few chemicals, the adulterators dilute the density of a byproduct of petroleum to sell it as diesel to the customers, mostly mechanized boat owners of Thoothukudi. Since this fuel is being sold at Rs. 75 per litre, they buy this adulterated product which is not safe for the operation of their boats. Efforts are on to secure all the adulterators,” Mr. Bhaskaran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/31000-litres-of-adulterated-diesel-seized/article38245862.ece

Based on a tip-off, a team, led by Assistant Superintendent of Police G. Chandeesh raided the lorry yard near Pudurpandiapuram toll plaza on the Thoothukudi – Madurai National Highway on Monday evening where around 50 discarded lorries had been parked. When the police team checked one of the lorries, they found 150 red sanders logs, weighing about 20 tonnes, had been loaded in a vehicle. The police found that the lorry had reached the well-secured yard with 10-feet-tall compound wall with barbed wire atop on December 25 from Andhra Pradesh and the high-valued timber was about to be exported to an undisclosed destination through VOC Port. “Due to intense police patrolling in and around Thoothukudi, possible export of the sand sanders logs might have been delayed,” said Mr. Chandeesh. The forest department personnel, who inspected the logs on Monday evening and Tuesday, said that both ‘A’ and ‘B’ grade red sanders logs had been smuggled to Thoothukudi. “Since soil and climatic conditions prevailing in the areas like Tirupathi and Seshachalam hills are conducive for the red sanders, illegal felling of this timber, fetching around Rs. 50 lakh per tonne (as per the price fixed by the government while seized red sanders logs are auctioned), is reported in Andhra Pradesh quite often. In the open market, the price of a tonne of red sanders is more than Rs. 1 crore. This illegal trade, having its roots in Andhra Pradesh, has its branches in various countries. The logs might have been brought from Andhra Pradesh to be shipped to the foreign destinations,” said a forest official. The police confirm that the red sanders logs, which were about to be smuggled to foreign destinations via VOC Port have been seized on several occasions in the past few years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/seized-red-sanders-meant-for-export/article38245861.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:28 IST,TAMIL NADU||Bittersweet harvest for senkarumbu farmers||Farmers in Tiruchi and Thanjavur districts, who had raised senkarumbu , the edible sugarcane variety ubiquitous during Pongal festivities, are disappointed over the poor farmgate price offered by traders this season.   Although the harvest has been good, the farmers complain that they are faced with losses for the third consecutive year on raising the sugarcane variety, also known as panneer karumbu . While a glut in market was blamed in 2020, poor demand due to the pandemic and the restrictions imposed to check its spread are cited as the reasons for the poor prices last year and this Pongal season.  Farmers raise the crop of 10-11 months duration in specific pockets such as Tiruvalarsolai near Tiruchi district and Thirukattupalli in Thanjavur district seeking to leverage the demand during Pongal. Though the State government has ordered procurement of the sugarcane to be given as part of the Pongal gift hampers to ration card holders at Rs. 33 apiece, a section of farmers allege that they are being offered a much lower price – anywhere between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20 apiece. Besides, not all farmers get to supply to the government, forcing many to depend on traders. The government move to supply a full grown cane through ration shops may also force private traders to scale down their purchase as there may not be much demand in the open market, some farmers said. Farmers complain that after spending about Rs. 2 lakh an acre to raise the crop, they could hardly manage to sell the cane for Rs. 2.40 lakh. “We had a good season this year, but the price that is being offered by traders is disappointing. The pandemic and lockdown is hurting us badly. We had raised the crop on two acres by raising loans. The cost of cultivation has gone up due to the steep increase in prices of fertilizers. After all this, we are just offered Rs. 16-17 a cane. But the cost of a cane works out to Rs. 18-19 for us if we include the cutting and loading cost,” said T. Saravanan of Thiruvalarsolai. But with just three days to go for Pongal, he has no other option but to sell the cane at whatever price that is offered by traders. “We have been suffering losses for the past three years, despite a good harvest,” he rued. Echoing similar sentiments, P. Raghu, a farmer of Nadupadugai near Thirukattupalli, who has been assisting his brother in overseeing the harvest, alleged that farmers have been left with little bargaining power as they can hardly leave the cane unsold. “We need to get at least Rs. 20 apiece, but are being offered much less. Going by the present situation, there could be still some cane left on the field after Pongal,” he feared.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bittersweet-harvest-for-senkarumbu-farmers/article38245843.ece

Located at the centre of the State and well-connected by roads, air and rail, Tiruchi receives both business and tourist travellers in large numbers. Thanks to the several well-known ancient temples in and around its peripheries, it has been a favourite destination for temple tourism for long. It receives pilgrim tourists from Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka too. Though the tourist arrival from Malaysia and other countries is almost down to nil due to curbs on air travel, the city witnessed good flow of domestic travellers after lifting of restrictions. Besides tourists from different parts of the State, those from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka made a pilgrimage to the city. The hotels that faced one of the toughest periods over the last two decades due to the extended closure of business for many months began to operate with their full capacity following good pick-up in occupancy rates in November and December. The closure of places of worship on Fridays and weekends and stringent travel restrictions have again put a break on the recovery of the hospitality industry, which is said to be one of the highest livelihood generators. According to sources in the industry, there are about 120-130 hotels and there are about 3,000 rooms in Tiruchi. The imposition of fresh restrictions by the State government has had an immediate impact on the occupancy rate. It has come down to 20% to 30% from the modest 60%. There are hotels that have recorded zero bookings on weekends. The unhealthy business scenario and the huge loss have forced many hotels to lay off their employees. The range of job cuts is said to be between 30% and 50%. “We get bookings mainly for holidays, weekends and auspicious days for marriages. Where do we get guest when places of worship are shut on weekends? Hence, we have no other options but to reduce the staff strength till the situation becomes normal,” said a proprietor of a hotel in Chathiram Bus Stand. S.A. Mubashir, joint secretary, Tiruchi Tourism Federation, said it was unfortunate that the hospitality industry continued to face the brunt of the restrictions. Irrespective of small and medium-term players it had hit every stakeholder in the industry. The latest restrictions would bring fresh hurdles to its long-term revival.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:28 IST,TAMIL NADU||Thatchankurichi prepares itself to hold jallikattu on Jan. 13||The State government has given permission to conduct jallikattu at Thatchankurichi village in Gandarvakottai taluk in Pudukottai district on Bhogi on January 13.   An order has been issued by the Animal Husbandry, Dairying, Fisheries and Fishermen Welfare Department to hold the bull-taming event at Thatchankurichi subject to adherence to the Standard Operating Procedures for prevention of COVID-19 spread. The jallikattu will be the first officially permitted event in Pudukottai district as part of Pongal festivities.   Official sources told The Hindu on Tuesday that organisers were making arrangements for the upcoming event at Thatchankurichi. Double barricades had been erected along the arena to prevent entry of spectators. The organisers had also erected a separate stage for VIPs to watch the event.   Revenue authorities had inspected the venue and planned to conduct another round of checks on Wednesday ahead of the event. Nearly 75% of the arrangements had been made at the venue, which would also have a separate checking point to screen the participating bulls and a collection point where the animals finally reached after being released from the vaadivaasa l for the owners/handlers to pick up their animals.  The event would be conducted as per the Standard Operating Procedure laid down by the State government, said a revenue official in Pudukottai. Identity cards would be given to the bull owner and handler to gain entry into the venue. Anti-doping tests would be conducted on the bulls by officials of the Animal Husbandry department. Not more than 300 tamers would be allowed to take partin the event. Double vaccination certificate and COVID-19 negative report from the RT-PCR test conducted 48 hours before the event would be checked before allowing officials, organisers, bull owners and tamers at the venue, the official further said. Periya Suriyur  Meanwhile, arrangements are under way at Periya Suriyur village on the outskirts of Tiruchi city to conduct jallikattu as part of Pongal festival. As is the customary practice, the organisers have planned to conduct the event on the second day of the Tamil month Thai on January 15, which is celebrated as Maatu  Pongal.   A jallikattu organising committee has been constituted at Periya Suriyur to conduct the event, which is to be held in a sprawling open area situated on the northern side of the village.   An organising committee member said arrangements at the venue, including double barricading along the arena and erecting a stage for important people to watch the event and vaadivasa l from where the participating bulls were to be released one after the other during the course of the event, had been made.  The venue would have a separate checking point where the participating bulls would be screened by a veterinary team. Health officials would screen all tamers before they were allowed to participate. Official sources said a senior revenue official had inspected the venue at Periya Suriyur and submitted a report to the District Collector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thatchankurichi-prepares-itself-to-hold-jallikattu-on-jan-13/article38245849.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 04:19 IST,TAMIL NADU||Yet another wet spell out in the open||The cold winds and rain have forced people to stay indoors, but some of the city’s pavements and public areas continue to be the dwelling places for the homeless.  Inclement weather is just one of their many inconveniences in life. This year’s unseasonal rain in late November had seen many homeless people coming to the government-run shelters. “We have around 133 destitute pavement dwellers on record in our three shelters. Many of them have stayed on from the earlier spell of wet weather,” P.M.N Mujibur Rahuman, Corporation Commissioner of Tiruchi, told The Hindu .  “Some of these people include those who have got lost due to mental retardation, and have wandered a long way from home. If we find such cases, we coordinate with the police department and try to track down and reunite them with their families as soon as possible,” he added. The city’s indigent people were reluctant to approach the shelters, said the official. “They choose to earn by begging outside, even though food and clothing is free at our homes. We respond to public alerts issued on the Corporation WhatsApp number (83001 13000), but do not force anyone unduly to stay in our shelters,” said Mr. Rahuman. There is very little documentation available on the homeless people in Tiruchi, because they are a floating population, according to social workers. “Some of them live in Tiruchi for a few months, then shift to nearby cities like Thanjavur, before coming back here. Many wander about the city the whole day and return to their homes to rest in the night. Quite a few have mental health problems and may be victims of sexual harassment. It is a variegated community,” said M. Sheikh Abdullah, managing trustee, PSR Trust, a student-run NGO in Tiruchi. Mr. Abdullah is surveying the homeless population in the city as part of his Masters degree in Social Work, and says he has observed the people sheltering in four zones in Tiruchi during rain. “The homeless tend to move between Srirangam, railway junction, Mannarpuram and Rock Fort, because there are plenty of covered places to stay here,” said Mr. Abdullah. The easy availability of food handouts in these areas is a key factor. “With so many charitable organisations and philanthropists engaged in food donation, especially during the pandemic, many homeless people are actually dumping surplus packets in some areas,” he said. Equipping the homeless with vocational skills could alleviate the problem, said Mr. Abdullah. “We could emulate skill development programmes from other cities such as Hyderabad and Bengaluru to give these people a chance to break the circle of poverty and vagrancy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/yet-another-wet-spell-out-in-the-open/article38245824.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 04:20 IST,TAMIL NADU||Campus closure takes a toll on visually challenged students||The lockdown has caused a shortage of scribes and audio recordings of study material, leaving many visually challenged students in Tiruchi, especially those attempting competitive exams, in the lurch. The shift to online classes and widespread closure of college campuses have together created a tough situation for visually challenged aspirants to government and banking exams.  Periyar College M.Phil student R. Sabiulla, 26, told The Hindu that it had become difficult to plan lessons without assistance from sighted volunteers.  “I have been preparing for competitive exams such as TNPC, NET, SET and banking for the past five years. I have attempted Group IV and Group I, and now I am trying banking exams. I was attending TNPC preparatory classes at the District Central Library for the last three Sundays, but the January 9 lockdown has put my study plan in doubt,” he said. For the moment, he is being helped by his family friends, who read out textbooks that he converts into audio format through the ‘InstaReader’ app. “Getting a government placement is my ambition, as I feel it will secure my future. But managing both my regular academic work with exam preparation during lockdown is really tough,” he said, adding that he had to give up his exam attempts twice because scribes were unable to come to the venue. I. Abdul Jaffer, one of the prime movers of the Jagadjothi Readers Circle of Visually Challenged reading circle initiative in Tiruchi, said audio recordings had got staggered due to a shortage of young volunteers. “When we started in 2015, we had at least 150 volunteers, mostly college students, helping us out with creating an audio database of study material and also as exam scribes. But with many campuses closed now, we do not know who to approach for help. We rely on a handful of readers for audio recordings, so what used to be done in a week can now take several months,” said Mr. Jaffer, a visually challenged senior history teacher at a government school in Kattur. Many visually impaired students had lost touch with regular academics because of these problems. But Mr. Jaffer and a team of tech-savvy people with visual disability have continued to hold online classes during the weekends for blind students. “We are using Zoom on our phones for online classes. But we are unable to give them a hands-on experience, so it is still small in scale. For those who cannot afford the devices, we offer the lessons in audio format, saved in a common Google Drive folder,” he added. Interested volunteers may contact Mr. Jaffer on his mobile number 9443188383.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/campus-closure-takes-a-toll-on-visually-challenged-students/article38245839.ece

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:33 IST,TAMIL NADU||Farm produce sale moves to top gear ahead of ‘Pongal’||Sale of farm produces such as sugarcane, turmeric, palmyra tubers, vegetables etc. has moved to top gear in the southern districts. As the ‘Pongal’ is fast approaching, sale of sugarcane, turmeric, vegetables and new vessels to be given as gifts to the newly married women has moved to feverish pitch here since Monday. Ignoring the COVID-19 restrictions, the people throng the market to buy them. The Maharaja Nagar ‘Uzhavar Sandhai’ that received 40 tonnes of vegetables on Monday sold it at lightning pace. With the crowd surging the market, nearby open spaces were converted into vegetable market to mitigate the crowd. Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai have started receiving sugarcane loads from Madurai, Theni, Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts and the traders from these places sell a bundle of 10 sugarcanes for Rs. 350 while the price of sugarcane bundle in Nagercoil is Rs. 550. “The price will increase further on Wednesday and Thursday if fresh loads are not received,” the traders say. Harvesting of turmeric cultivated on over 100 acres in Sawyerpuram, Thangammalpuram, Sivaththaiyapuram, Sakkammalpuram and Servaikaaranmadam, which would usually supply the plant up to Delhi, has commenced. A turmeric plant, which was sold for Rs. 20 last year, is being sold now for Rs. 14. Since the farmer has to spend up to Rs. 7 for a plant and work in the field for six months to grow the plant, this selling price has not enthused the growers. “Since the traders are sceptical about the sale of turmeric due to COVID-19 related restrictions, we received only a few buyers this year and we’re getting lower price this year. We expect more traders to come to our village for buying the turmeric before Thursday,” says farmer T. Kesava Selvan of Thangammalpuram. Another problem the farmers faced this year was the short supply of Di-Ammonium-Phosphate which has affected the quality of the plant. Tenkasi district, the ‘vegetable basket’ of southern Tamil Nadu, is busy sending out several truck loads of vegetables to various destinations of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The Kamaraj Wholesale Vegetable Market in Paavoorchathram is so vibrant as it is sending the trucks with vegetables to other markets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farm-produce-sale-moves-to-top-gear-ahead-of-pongal/article38245853.ece

M. Gandhiraj, Commissioner, Udhagamandalam Municipality (UMC), said that starting from Wednesday, all fruit and vegetable shops will be shifted to the Shanthi Vijai Girls Higher Secondary School at the ATC Junction. “The provision stores in the market have each been marked, and will be allowed to function on alternative days. For instance, shops marked A will function on one day, while shops marked B will function the next,” said Mr. Gandhiraj, who added that similar steps were taken to minimise crowds at the market during the first and second waves of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the 82 shops at the Farmers’ Market on Charring Cross in Udhagamandalam have been shifted to the NCMS parking lot nearby. The shops which were functioning at the Farmers’ Market have already been moved to the new location starting from Tuesday, while work is on to get the shops from the municipal market shifted to the new location.

The aim is to decongest the Green Circle, a gateway to the Fort City from the highway that carries 80-100 vehicles per minute. Formed a decade-and-a-half ago, the Green Circle junction is a concrete structure with landscaping and flash LED lights. It is maintained by the Vellore Institute of Technology. The roundabout serves as a major intersection for vehicles going to Chennai, Tirupattur, Chittoor through Katpadi and into the heart of the Fort City off the NH 48. Traffic snarls are common at the junction during peak hours as vehicles take a long time to cross the roundabout. “As of now, the Green Circle will retain its space. On the other hand, traffic islands around it will be reduced to provide more space for motorists,” said an official of the NHAI. According to the plan, 20 metres of the traffic islands will be reduced to provide space for motorists. Digital traffic signals will be relocated to the resized portion of the islands with reflectors and warning signs. Two high-mast lamps were also removed to facilitate the work. They will soon be reinstalled. Officials said more road space would also help large vehicles that ply between Vellore town and Katpadi and Gudiyatham and Chittoor negotiate the roundabout easily. At present, all vehicles from Chennai are allowed to take the service lane near the Green Circle to reach Vellore’s Old Town and Katpadi, resulting in traffic chaos at the Green Circle. The work started after a series of meetings between the district administration, the traffic police, the Vellore Corporation and highways officials. Vellore Collector P. Kumaravel Pandian and SP S. Rajesh Kannan inspected the Green Circle last month. A few traffic changes have been in place to ease the traffic flow at the Green Circle since last week. Accordingly, vehicles coming from Chennai have to proceed straight on the highway taking the service lane near a petrol pump. Motorists have to make a ‘U’ turn below the road overbridge on the service lane to reach Katpadi. Vehicles from Chennai that go to Vellore’s Old Town can take the service lane near the Green Circle to reach the Fort area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traffic-islands-resized-around-green-circle/article38246196.ece

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:35 IST,TAMIL NADU||GCC can’t allot over 50% wards for women: HC||R. Parthiban of West Mambalam had filed the petition contending that the legal provisions, relating to reservation for women candidates in the urban local bodies, originally provided for only one-third of the seats to be reserved for them. However, in 2016, the laws were amended to the effect that not less than 50% of the seats should be reserved for women in the elections to the post of ward councillor. ‘Discrimination’ Observing that the phrase “not less than 50%” should not be construed to mean that reservation for women could be provided even beyond 50%, the petitioner said it would amount to discriminating against male candidates. Providing a break-down of the wards that had been reserved for various categories in the GCC, the petitioner said 89 had been reserved for women (general), 16 for the Scheduled Castes (women) and 16 for the Scheduled Castes (general). The rest of the 79 wards alone had been left open for male candidates from the general category. The petitioner said only 84 wards should be reserved for women (general) and an equal number provided to male candidates in the general category.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gcc-cant-allot-over-50-wards-for-women-hc/article38245749.ece

The conference was held in 2019 and 2020 despite COVID-19, as the intensity of the epidemic was not high in January of both the years. It is being held uninterrupted since 1990. Chairperson of the Mela Reception Committee Mathe Ganga Devi will chair a meeting of the committee in Bagalkot on Wednesday, to decide the course of action. “I think we will have a small event. A small group of seers and devotees will conduct the religious rituals and prayers. However, the public gathering will not be held,’’ said a member of the committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sharana-mela-likely-to-be-a-low-key-event-this-time/article38246111.ece

The seer, who was camping in Kerur village for his month-long discourse, suffered a fall in the bathroom of a devotee’s house on the outskirts of the village. He called his assistants who then brought him out. They noticed that there was a swelling in the leg. A local doctor saw him and urged the devotees to admit him to a hospital. The seer was rushed to the Kanheri Math Hospital near Kolhapur in Maharashtra. A medical scanning revealed that he has suffered a fracture in his hip and shoulder. He has extra-capsular fractures of the proximal femur and another fracture in the shoulder blade, a medical report said. Both can be cured easily with a surgery, it added. The Kanheri Math has a tie-up with other private hospitals in Kolhapur that have facilities such as a major operation theatre that employs surgeons. The math is consulting with specialists and will go ahead with a surgery, a math officer said. The decision was delayed as the seer was reluctant to undergo surgery and was favouring getting Ayurveda treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seer-injures-himself/article38245902.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 03:55 IST,KARNATAKA||Volunteers back in action as cases rise||The last few weeks have been a busy time for Satish Rao, a volunteer with Project StepOne, a non-profit collective of technology and healthcare professionals volunteering to fight COVID-19. With cases rising in the city, he spends the better part of the day on the phone reaching out to people who have tested positive, reassuring them and checking to see if they need additional medical attention. “There are many people currently under home isolation. With the Delta variant still in circulation, many people are worried. We try to create awareness and educate them about the dos and don’ts. In case they need counselling, we refer them to the certified counsellors,” said Mr. Rao. And his is not the only volunteer group that has seen a spurt in activity after a period of calm following the second wave. Several volunteer organisations, like Project StepOne, that were active during the first and second waves have been reactivated. Cyclists’ group Relief Riders, a cyclists’ group that helps deliver medicines and other essentials to those under home isolation, is one such group. Sathya Sankaran, Bicycle Mayor of Bengaluru, who is the convenor of Relief Riders, said on last count, there were 275 volunteers. “We restarted a couple of days ago in Hyderabad and Bengaluru, and since then, we have had many new sign-ups,” he said. Following protocols Despite restarting just a couple of days ago, the volunteer group has already begun delivering medicines and groceries to people in home isolation. “Our volunteers are always double masked. We follow all COVID-19 protocols, including sanitising,” Mr. Sankaran added. Tauseef Ahmed, a volunteer with ERT, which helps the State Government with the COVID-19 helpline’s Bengaluru webpage, said that there were at least 10 volunteers working on the site’s chat support. “We have also started rechecking the vendors listed on the website for oxygen, food and others so that people can get accurate information,” he said, and added that the group has remained active even after cases subsided after the second wave. The Bengaluru COVID-19 Volunteers, a city-based volunteers’ group, and COVID-19 Resource Volunteers, a pan-India group, also recently restarted their aid efforts. “During the second wave, we were jolted into action given the number of positive cases and those needing medical attention. The restrictions now are limited to weekends. However, the number of cases may peak in a couple of weeks,” said Shama Karkal, a volunteer with both groups. Tanveer Ahmed from Mercy Mission that was active during the second wave, said that the group members have remained active, helping senior citizens, cancer patients and others. “Our ambulances are functional and we still have a lot of oxygen concentrators,” he said, hoping the public health situation doesn’t spiral out of control like it did during the second wave.  We have started rechecking the vendors listed on the website for oxygen, food and others so that people can get accurate information.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:06 IST,KARNATAKA||Govt. weighing the options to handle Mekedatu padayatra||As the Congress padayatra seeking implementation of the Mekedatu drinking water project completed the third day on Tuesday attracting thousands of party workers, the State Government, it is learnt, is still weighing the options before deciding on its approach to handle the situation. While another FIR naming 40 Congress leaders was filed for flouting COVID-19 norms, Health Minister K. Sudhakar on Tuesday threatened legal action against KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar for spreading false information and refusing to cooperate with a government official. The second FIR filed by Sathanur police comes a day after it filed an FIR against 30, including Mr. Shivakumar and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah. Since the latter did not attend the padayatra owing to ill-health, his name does not figure in the second FIR filed by Kanakapura police. The FIR has been filed under provisions of the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act, 2020, based on a complaint by the local tahsildar. Government sources acknowledged that it is worried about the padayatra entering Bengaluru, but it is also unlikely to use force to disperse the crowd. Use of force on workers and leaders could not only lead to a law and order situation but also provide sympathy to the Congress, sources said. Petition in High Court Another source said that the Government was also awaiting the outcome of the public interest litigation (PIL) petition that has been filed in the Karnataka High Court. “If the court takes a stern decision, the Government could crack down on the padayatra citing court orders and Congress leaders will also have to abide by the court decision,” sources said. When his reaction was sought on the padayatra, Home Minister Araga Jnanendra, who briefed presspersons after the COVID-19 management meeting, said the Government was still thinking about handling the padayatra. “We have told the police not to allow any gathering or protest meetings in view of new COVID-19 rules coming into force.” Meanwhile, seeking an apology or documentary proof from Mr. Shivakumar for his statements on COVID-19 management in the State, Dr. Sudhakar warned that action would be initiated under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act 2020, and IPC for making baseless allegations. “By making false allegations on COVID-19 management, Mr. Shivakumar has been instilling fear that is against law. He has to apologise or provide proof to justify his statements.” The Health Minister’s statement came in the light of Mr. Shivakumar accusing the Government of fudging COVID-19 case figures to curtail his padayatra and also make money and attempting to declare him as COVID-19 positive, among others. ‘Not scared about FIR’  In Kanakapura, Mr. Siddaramaiah, who joined the padayatra after taking a break on Monday, said the party was not scared about the FIR, and added that it had been filed with a mala fide intention since the padayatra would raise awareness about BJP’s “wrongdoings” in delaying the project. “The BJP is letting down people of Karnataka only to strengthen its position in Tamil Nadu. This padayatra is to prevent it and the BJP is scared about the success of the padayatra.”  On COVID-19 concerns, Mr. Siddaramaiah asked why was such concern not there for several programmes, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s election rally that had attracted thousands. “Is there separate law for us and them?” Reacting to Mr. Jnanendra suggesting a lockdown if cases increase, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that Government should first provide financial relief to the vulnerable sections before imposing a lockdown. “The Government has not paid relief announced during the first lockdown,” he claimed. Refuting allegations that his Government delayed submission of a DPR on the Mekedatu project, Mr. Siddaramaiah claimed that a DPR was prepared in 2013 that estimated a cost of Rs. 5,912 crore and a revised estimate DPR of Rs. 9,500 crore was submitted in 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-weighing-the-options-to-handle-mekedatu-padayatra/article38245720.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 03:55 IST,KARNATAKA||15% of beds in government hospitals occupied in Bengaluru||Despite the spike in COVID-19 cases in Bengaluru which recorded a positivity rate of 8.66% and 10,800 new positive cases on Tuesday, hospitalisation remains low. As per the latest COVID-19 war room report released by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Tuesday, just around 224 of 1,538 beds in 22 government health care facilities were occupied. This includes beds in four government medical colleges, 16 government hospitals and two COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs). At present, around 15% of beds in government hospitals are occupied. Of the 841 general beds, only 136 are currently occupied. Among HDU beds, the occupancy percentage is 11% while of the 80 available ICU beds, around 30 are currently occupied. On the other hand, of the 90 beds available in COVID Care Centres, 71 are occupied; only 21% of the beds are vacant. The total number of active cases is 58,917. According to BBMP Chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta, over 90% of people with COVID-19 do not need hospitalisation or additional medical attention. “We are monitoring daily hospitalisations including occupancy of different categories of beds - general, high dependency units (HDU), intensive care units (ICU), intensive care units with ventilators (ICU-V). Currently, the situation is under control and there is no shortage of either beds, medicines or oxygen,” said Mr. Gupta. On January 1 this year, 52 out of 1,926 beds in government health care facilities were occupied. The positivity rate then was just 1.04%, according to the war room report. However, while cases have increased, the number of beds in all categories in government-run health care facilities has decreased to 1,538 from 1,926. While the number of beds in HDU, ICU, ICU-V have decreased, the number of general category beds has increased. This coincides with the State Government’s recent direction to private hospitals to hand over 30% of beds under the government quota. With this, there are now nearly 4,000 beds available in Government-run and private health care facilities across the city, Mr. Gupta added. Mr. Gupta said given the dynamic situation, the BBMP will look at increasing beds and testing when required. “Citizens need not panic. We are prepared to tackle the spike in cases,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/15-of-beds-in-government-hospitals-occupied-in-bengaluru/article38245708.ece

As of Tuesday, 145 police personnel have tested positive for COVID-19. While 137 are currently under home isolation, the remaining have recovered and reported back to duty. The city police along with doctors and other COVID-19 warriors were among the first to receive both doses of the vaccine. Taking note of this, City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said the emphasis is on ensuring that all police personnel get a booster dose without delay. A nodal officer of the rank of Additional Commissioner of Police has been appointed to supervise this exercise. “We are giving emphasis on vaccanications and ensuring that members of the force get their booster dose. The drive was launched a few days ago, and to date 1,283 personnel got their booster doses,” said Mr. Pant. With the number of cases on the rise, jurisdictional officers have been given a set of SOPs to be followed which includes sanitisation and home quarantine. However, the unprecedented surge has personnel worried. “Since the police are COVID warriors and first responders to the enforcement duty, we have be mentally and physically strong. Luckily, not even a single case in the BCP required hospitalisation. But we are not taking any chances, and are looking at the option of having a COVID Care Centre ready in case of an emergency situation,” said a senior senior policer And while the cases are mild, police personnel at the ground level are apprehensive as they don’t want to infect vulnerable members of their family. “We are grateful for the support from the department but still we worry about our families and relatives. We don’t want to spread the infection,” said a police personnel who tested positive and is presently under home quarantine. West Division worst hit The West Division is among the worst hit. So far, 60 personnel from the division have tested positive for COVID-19. “We have to monitor Majestic and market areas. There are also commercial hubs where footfalls remain high,” said a police official. According to a senior police officer, the total strength of police personnel in the city is 19,094. Of these, 15,346 police personnel have received both doses, while the remaining 3,748 have got their first dose. The department has already started to give booster doses and also directed the remaining personnel to get their second shot soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/145-police-personnel-have-tested-positive-for-covid-19-in-city/article38245703.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 03:55 IST,KARNATAKA||Experts divided over ICMR advisory on ‘purposive testing strategy’||COVID-19 experts in Karnataka have expressed mixed views over the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) latest advisory on ‘Purposive Testing Strategy for COVID-19’ that said contacts of COVID-19 patients do not need to be tested unless identified as high-risk based on age. According to the advisory issued on Monday, asymptomatic patients undergoing surgical or non-surgical invasive procedures, including pregnant women in/near labour who are hospitalised for delivery, should not be tested unless warranted or symptoms develop. It said no emergency procedure, including surgeries, should be delayed due to lack of a test. Besides, inter-State travellers also need not be tested. However, COVID-19 experts in Karnataka said the advisory is against the basic principle of containing the pandemic. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force and member of State’s Clinical Expert Committee, said the advisory is debatable and requires consensus from public health experts and epidemiologists. “It goes against the basic principle of containing the pandemic. If primary contacts are not traced and tested, they can spread the infection easily,” he said. Asserting that the testing strategy should be individualised, the doctor said important aspects that need to be considered include the proximity between the positive patient and the contact and the duration of exposure. “Whether they are in the same building, whether the place is well ventilated, whether the infected person had a cough and other symptoms: all these need to be considered before deciding on whether to test or not,” he said.Epidemiologist and public health specialist Sunil Kumar D.R., who heads the department of community medicine at Akash Institute of Medical Sciences, said contact tracing and testing is a key strategy for interrupting the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing COVID-associated mortality. “Giving an advisory that testing is not required for asymptomatic contacts, asymptomatic patients undergoing surgeries, and for persons taking inter-State travel will increase the caseload and healthcare system may be overburdened with shortage of healthcare staff. If asymptomatic patients are not tested prior to surgery, healthcare workers will be at risk,” said Dr. Sunil, who is part of BBMP’s death audit committee. However, V. Ravi, member of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), termed the ICMR advisory as a practical piece of guideline, specific to Omicron variant. “As the incubation period is so short and considering the pace at which the infection is spreading, it is practically not possible to trace contacts of all positive cases,” he said. Asserting that the onus is now on people, Dr. Ravi, who is the nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said: “If people know they have been exposed and have developed symptoms, they can come forward and get tested. The advisory should not be interpreted that testing is not at all required for contacts.” U.S. Vishal Rao, member of the State’s Genomic Surveillance Committee, also termed the advisory as an excellent step. “At this juncture when the pandemic is raging, if you go on testing you will overwhelm the diagnostics. This will not even translate into an effective intervention for asymptomatic individuals,” he said. Pointing out that there is compelling data to show that Omicron will not increase hospitalisation or fatality, Dr. Rao said: “The advisory is a more mature step towards the direction of understanding that as we move towards this phase of endemicity we will have to lower the burden on the healthcare system. This should nor be misconstrued as a premature claim of victory against the virus. The ICMR is only asserting a citizen-driven responsibility and not a State-driven enforcement.”  It goes against the basic principle of containing the pandemic. If primary contacts are not traced and tested, they can spread the infection easily. C.N.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:06 IST,KARNATAKA||Bribery case: HC directive to special court||In a relief to five leaders of the BJP and the Janata Dal (S), the High Court of Karnataka has asked a special court to re-examine the order of taking cognisance of offence in the absence of sanction for proceedings against them based on a private complaint of alleged acts of giving and accepting bribe in the process of luring an MLA to switch political party. Justice Sunil Dutt Yadav passed the order while disposing of petitions filed by Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, BJP MLA for Yelahanka S.R. Vishwanath, MLC C.P. Yogeshwar, and MLA for Kolar K. Srinivasa Gowda of the JD(S). The petitioners had questioned the orders passed by the special court, set up to exclusively deal with criminal cases related to MPs/MLAs in Karnataka, taking cognisance of offences against them on the private complaint lodged by social activist Abraham T.J. The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is also arraigned as an accused in the case. For switching parties It was alleged in the complaint that Mr. Gowda had accepted Rs. 5 crore as an advance payment from Dr. Narayan and Mr. Vishwanath, who were assisted by Mr. Yogeshwar, of the total offer of Rs. 30 crore as “bribe” to quit the JD(S) and join the BJP. Pointing out that Mr. Gowda, in February 2019, himself had disclosed in a press conference about the alleged offer of Rs. 30 crore and advance payment of Rs. 5 crore by the three BJP leaders, the complainant had said that Mr. Kumaraswamy had tried to convince Mr. Gowda to stay back in the JD(S). Also, the complainant had claimed that Mr. Gowda had expressed his helplessness to Mr. Kumaraswamy (who was then the Chief Minister) by telling that he [Mr. Gowda] had to return Rs. 5 ctore to BJP leaders if he failed to join the party. As Mr. Gowda told Mr. Kumaraswamy that he had already spent Rs. 5 crore given by BJP leaders, it was claimed in the complaint, Mr. Kumaraswamy had offered to arrange Rs. 5 crore from his own resources to enable Mr. Gowda to return Rs. 5 crore to the BJP leaders. The complainant had alleged that acts of five political leaders amount to corruption under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The special court in March 2021 issued summons to the petitioners and Mr. Kumaraswamy while holding that there is a “deemed sanction” to proceed against them as the Governor of Karnataka had not responded to Mr. Abraham’s request for grant of sanction within three months from submission of request. Observing that the sanction undoubtedly had to be taken, the High Court set aside the cognisance taken against the petitioners by the special court and directed the special court to call upon the complainant to obtain sanction for proceeding against the petitioners. The High Court has also extended the benefit of this order to Mr. Kumaraswamy though he has not filed a petition as the issue related to legal position.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bribery-case-hc-directive-to-special-court/article38245718.ece

On January 10, six people were killed when a speeding truck carrying crushed stones, hit a median and toppled over two cars and a bike on the highway, was an accident waiting to happen. The stretch is currently being widened to a 10-lane national highway, work for which is underway in several areas. On each side, lanes have been blocked. ‘Obstacle course’ “The stretch is like an obstacle course or a ghat section with zig-zags.,” said one motorist. But that is not the only problem. “To top this, trucks deployed for ongoing road work are usually speeding, which only adds to our dread of the commute,” said another motorist. On Monday too, one such truck while traversing an under-construction patch took a sharp turn, hit the median and fell over vehicles on the adjoining lane killing six. “There have been many complaints of trucks deployed for road works overspeeding and taking sudden turns on the highway. The way they overspeed and take sharp turns to traverse road blocks, I have myself felt they may topple anytime,” said Suresh Kumar, a resident of Kengeri. In the wake of the tragic accidents, motorists are demanding stricter enforcement. “Police have neither put in place enough restrictions nor are they enforcing speed limits. The way the agency is carrying out road works is also causing a lot of inconvenience. They should try to create minimum disturbance to the traffic as it is a busy highway with not many parallel routes,” said Sundar N., a resident of Kumbalgodu. A senior police official from the area said they had flagged certain issues with National Highways Authority of India carrying out the work and will soon put in place more restrictions to make it safer for motorists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ongoing-roadworks-make-highway-accident-prone/article38245704.ece

While physical consultations have not increased, people are turning to doctors seeking help online.  According to integrated healthcare platform Practo, there has been a 21% increase in GP consults in Bengaluru since December 31. “People in the age group of 21-30 years constituted 45% of all online consultations. Those aged between 31 and 40 years comprised 41% of consultations, while senior citizens covered 14%. Concerns were mostly raised about COVID-related symptoms such as fever, sore throat, headache, body pain, and stuffy nose. There were also queries about Omicron, COVID vaccine booster doses, and vaccines for children, among others,” a spokesperson told The Hindu .  Across the country, with close to 38,000 infections recorded on January 4, COVID-related doctor consultations saw a massive jump of 50% the next day, Practo said, adding that this was the highest single-day increase in doctor consultations in 120 days since the decline of the deadly second wave. “More than 50% of all doctor consultations are for GPs and pulmonologists with major concerns like fever, sore throat, headache, body pain, stuffy nose, Omicron spread, COVID -19 vaccine booster doses, and vaccines for children, among others,” a statement from Practo said. Around 85% of these queries were come from metro cities. As far as the percentage of growth in queries was concerned, Mumbai saw the highest growth in GP-related consultations since January 1 at 132%, followed by Kolkata (106%), Delhi NCR (95%), Bengaluru (75%), Chennai (47%) and Hyderabad (42%). On the other hand, physical consultations have not seen a major change yet and footfalls are slowly picking up now, said doctors. Former president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA), R. Ravindra, said hospital footfalls had drastically come down and people were opting for online consultations well after the second wave almost till September 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/online-doctor-consultations-up-amidst-omicron-scare/article38245712.ece

That means only 5% of the patients are actually required to visit hospitals to undergo certain procedures and surgeries. This will hugely reduce the load on the medical system,” he said while speaking atFuture Ready organised by Microsoft. Technology offered the rich what they always had in a better format while technology would give the poor what they never dreamt of having, he said, adding, “That’s the beauty of technology. It is going to democratise and disrupt healthcare delivery.” Further elaborating on dominant tech trends in healthcare, Dr. Shetty said,artificial intelligence and software-driven Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) would help doctors to make better diagnoses and quick decisions. In the next five years, intelligent EMR would make better diagnoses than doctors. In fact, in some seven years, doctors would be mandated to get a second opinion from the software before they decide on treatments. By that time, healthcare will also become safer for the patients, which is not the case today, noted Dr. Shetty, chairman of Narayana Hrudayalaya. “If a solution is not affordable, it is not a solution. We are talking about AI in healthcare. AI can diagnose better than human doctors. What we have to explore is a hybrid system where human doctors and AI will work as a team. AI will not replace a radiologist, but it will surely replace doctors who do not use AI,” warned Dr. Shetty.  That’s the beauty of technology.

Observing that flyover has not been completed even though huge amount of public money has already spent on construction, the court directed the BBMP Commissioner to submit a detailed plan along with time-bound deadline to complete the flyover. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition filed in July 2021 by Adinarayan Shetty, a resident of Koramangala 5th Block, complaining about the hardship caused because of the incomplete flyover. The Bench noted that the BBMP counsel even now is unable to tell the court the outer limit for completing the flyover even though the court way back on July 29, 2021 had set August 30, 2021 as the deadline for the BBMP to file its statements indicating the outer limit to complete the flyover project. As BBMP counsel pointed out various problems, including issue of legality over cutting of trees etc., which have delayed execution of project, the Bench questioned why the BBMP commenced the project without sorting out all the issues. The tender was floated for construction of the flyover in 2014 and the contract was awarded and work order was issued in favour of M/s Simplex Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. in May 2017 for construction at a cost of Rs. 203 crore. The construction was supposed to be completed by November 2019 as 30 months were given for completion from the date of issuance of work order, the petitioner had said while pointing out that the work had not progressed even after BBMP granted additional time till December 2020 by imposing penalty on the company.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-pulls-up-bbmp-for-failing-to-specify-time-frame-for-completion-of-flyover/article38245691.ece

Centenary auditorium here on Thursday. Agriculture Minister P. Prasad will inaugurate the programme at 10.30 a.m. Fisheries Minister Saji Cherian, Kerala Rail Development Corporation (K-Rail) managing director V. Ajithkumar, K-Rail project planning director P. Jayakumar and K-Rail joint general manager G. Anilkumar will discuss the project and answer questions. Representatives of political parties, various organisations and experts are invited to the programme. A total of 19 km of the semi-high-speed rail corridor will pass through the district. A total of 42.08 ha of land in four villages — Mulakuzha and Venmony in Chengannur taluk and Nooranad and Palamel in Mavelikara — will be acquired for the project. The K-Rail station will come up at Chengannur, near Main Central Road. It will be constructed 4.3 km away from the Chengannur railway station. Last-mile connectivity Officials said that last-mile connectivity to tourist destinations and other places in the district would be provided by e-vehicles, cab feeder services and so on. Special arrangements would be made for Sabarimala pilgrims, they said. Last month, protesters tried to block the survey for K-Rail at Nooranad. The agitators demanded that the alignment of the SilverLine be changed by avoiding wetlands and paddy fields in the area. Local residents have formed action councils and launched agitations against the project. The government last week issued a notification for conducting a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) study ahead of acquiring land for the project in the district. The 529.45 km SilverLine project to be implemented at a cost of Rs. 63,941 is expected to reduce the travel time between Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod to less than four hours. The rail line will pass through 11 districts. The maximum speed of trains will be 200 kmph. The K-Rail will charge Rs. 2.75 a km. The travelling time between Chengannur and Thiruvananthapuram by SilverLine is estimated to be 46 minutes. It is expected to cover the distance between Chengannur and Kottayam in 16 minutes, Chengannur-Ernakulam in 39 minutes, Chengannur-Cochin International Airport in 49 minutes, Chengannur-Kozhikode in one hour and 54- minutes, and Chengannur-Kasaragod in three hours and eight minutes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/silverline-outreach-in-alappuzha-on-thursday/article38246054.ece

Sudhakaran in connection with the murder of SFI activist Dheeraj Rajendran at Idukki Government Engineering College. After visiting Dheeraj’s house at Trichambaram in the district, CPI(M) Kannur district secretary M.V. Jayarajan told mediapersons that it was a premeditated murder. “The KPCC leader, who publicly called for violence is also responsible for the murder. The leader is teaching the ranks not Gandhian methods but violence.,” Mr. Jayarajan said. The murder was not committed by students but was an instance of planned operation. DYFI national president A.A. Rahim said the KPPC president was promoting violence. It was a premeditated murder. The Youth Congress had planned such clashes in several engineering colleges. The Congress was trying to provoke riots across the State, he said. CPI(M) leader P. Jayarajan alleged that with Mr. Sudhakaran’s “Kannur style” was disturbing the peace in the State. Murder condemned Responding to the criticism, Mr. Sudhakaran said that Congress would not promote violent politics for any reason. But the communist leaders, who had turned colleges into violent places, had no moral right to accuse any other party for the violence in Kerala, he said. Mr. Sudhakaran said more KSU activists than SFI activists had been killed in colleges. He said the Congress strongly condemned the murder at the college in Idukki. The party had appointed a committee to probe the murder of Dheeraj and necessary action would be taken after receiving the report, Mr. Sudhakaran said. Meanwhile, the police have beefed up protection for Mr. Sudhakaran. A police team has been deployed near the Kannur DCC office. Security has also been beefed up at Congress offices in CPI(M) strongholds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-stoking-violence-on-states-campuses-says-cpim/article38245976.ece

Justice N. Nagaresh observed that the Act banned only the naming of commercial entities after India, Bharat or Kerala. The court made the observations while allowing a writ petition filed by the Kerala Deaf Cricket Association against the refusal by the Registration Department to register the association because of prefixing Kerala before the association's name. The Department took the stand that no society with a word ‘Kerala’ could be registered in view of the the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act of 1950. The court pointed out that the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 was enacted to prevent the improper use of certain emblems and names for professional and commercial purposes. The court held that since the association was not a one related to any trade, business, calling or profession, the provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 could not be applied to the petitioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-permits-associations-to-use-name-of-states/article38245985.ece

They include those who had invested heavily in mechanised laundries at railway premises in Kerala, at Ernakulam and Kochuveli, on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) model. “Many like me are running pillar to post, seeking funds to maintain the costly machinery and the building which are idling due to the pandemic,” said Antony Tharu of Kalamassery, who said he invested Rs 6 crore in one such unit in Ernakulam that is capable of cleaning 5 tonnes of laundry. “I also invested in a joint venture partnership mechanised laundry which has a capacity of 10 tonnes in Kochuveli, which operated for four years. The construction of the laundry in Ernakulam was almost over and the machinery was installed, when the pandemic struck, curbs were imposed on trains and linen supply was halted. If not Railway laundry, permission must be given to source laundry from hospitals and other sources,” he said. “Investors like me have been in a Catch-22 situation during the past two years, since banks and other financial institutions are knocking at our door, seeking repayment of loans taken for the units. The High Court intervened in the issue and directed the Railways to look into the issue. The Railways, in turn, directed the zonal Railway authorities to consider our plight. A few zones – mainly in northern India, began to disburse funds for the upkeep of laundries, based on a directive by Railway Board,” Mr. Tharu said. He produced copies of letters sent by the Railway Board to zonal General Managers, based on requests to invoke the Force Majeure clause when train services were restricted and there was no linen supply to passengers. Railway sources said authorities of select zones would have made payments on the basis of advice given by legal and financial advisors, since there were different business models. A few zones were now providing linen and pillow as a takeaway package, for Rs 150, considering issues like hygiene, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mechanised-laundry-operators-of-railway-in-deep-crisis/article38245997.ece

The ecological condition of the river had come under repeated threats in the wake of incidents of discolouration and discharge of effluents into it. Senior board officials said that the latest incident was serious even though they had come across such episodes earlier. The board carried out a monitoring along the river after carbon dust particles were found in the river. There are certain units engaged in the manufacturing of rubber products such as tread and conveyors, where mixing of carbon is done. Based on the initial findings, it has been decided to issue directives to such a unit found violating the norms repeatedly. If required, the security deposit would be insisted on to immediately complete the control measures required, according to the officials. The rubber processing units in the industrial region were issued several directives earlier to comply with the rules. The investigations carried out by the board had found that crumb rubber units had discharged effluents into the river illegally. The units found violating the norms would face action as per the provisions of the Environment Protection Act and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The board has found that the effluent treatment facility in some of the units was not functioning properly and as per the norms. With the treatment facilities remaining defunct, the units were suspected to have discharged untreated water and effluents either into the river or the land close to the river. However, the board officials said that they had not yet been able to ascertain the reason behind the discolouration of the river reported last week. “Even though samples were taken, we are yet to track the exact source behind the incident,” they said while recalling the acute shortage of manpower being faced by the board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rubber-product-units-under-scanner-for-periyar-pollution/article38245998.ece

Anilkumar. The civic body is conducting a study to fix the zones. The proposals will be placed before the council for follow-up action. “Like the law that regulates illegal dumping of waste in the open, illegal street vending stalls cannot be allowed in violation of the rules,” said Mr. Anilkumar. The corporation has initiated removing illegal vending stalls based on a directive issued by the Kerala High Court. It had also asked the authorities to ensure immediate rehabilitation of street vendors as per Street Vending (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act 2014. The previous council had issued vending permit and identity cards to about 1, 989 persons. The agency appointed by the corporation had found that only about 800 of the 1, 989 street vendors were eligible to conduct business. However, trade union representatives in the town vending committee demanded that all the 1, 989 persons be provided with the permits, and it was approved. Mr. Anilkumar said that the ongoing drive was aimed at removing unauthorised street vendors and it would continue. The corporation would not allow illegal units as such activities were affecting the normal movement of people, besides resulting in encroachment of public spaces, he said. The civic body will designate vending and non-vending zones in the city based on the proposal to be placed before the council. The decision to step up the process emerged after it was found that many were operating multiple units in various parts of the city. The inspections had also revealed that several persons were not functioning after getting permits. There was no order in place and it had resulted in confusion in identifying genuine street vendors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-to-expedite-identification-of-street-vending-zones-in-kochi/article38246001.ece

The City Mobility Plan (CMP) that was readied by Urban Mass Transit Company (UMTC) in 2015 had shed light on such areas. They include Container Road, Stadium Link Road, Panampilly Nagar Avenue — all four-lane roads, the Thammanam-Pullepady Road that is awaiting four-laning, and the Mattancherry BOT Bridge-Kundannoor Junction corridor. Stakeholders’ meet A participatory event chaired by Mayor M. Anilkumar and included stakeholders like MVD officials, KSRTC and private bus operators is over. Supply-side surveys of city buses is also over, in which the routes and bus stops were marked using GPS. A demand-side survey of mofussil buses and city buses is under way. In this, details like the number of passengers boarding and alighting at each bus stop and their travel pattern are collected. Regular discussions are on with stakeholders, sources said.  This is being done as part of Mobilise Your City (MYC) programme in India, which is being implemented by French Development Agency AFD in collaboration with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  In India, MYC’s projects to improve urban mobility in a sustainable manner are being done at Ahmedabad, Kochi and Nagpur to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in different modes of urban transport. In Kochi, the AFD has inked an MoU with the Kochi Corporation. The bus route rationalisation project was awarded to Systra Consortium that is led by its French counterpart, which is an internationally-known transport planning company having strong presence in India through its subsidiary Systra India, and another member JungleBus, a consultancy that is specialised in the digitalisation of transport. The supply-demand data will help build a digital replica of the public transport network in Kochi. In the second stage, experts will build on the conclusions of the diagnosis, to propose bus-route rationalisation scenarios that will be subsequently evaluated, they added. Parameters of the proposed network like access, comfort, reliability, safety, financial viability, sustainability and affordability will be considered to maximise ridership and to minimise operating costs. Route restructuring, route numbering, fleet analysis, operations plan, financial analysis and recommendations for implementing the plan too will be readied. After the stakeholder consultations, the preliminary restructuring (rationalisation) plan will be revised and a proposal readied in line with the KMTA Act, before submitting it to AFD and implementing agencies in Kochi like KMTA and KMC. A capacity-building exercise to impart knowledge of bus route rationalisation principles, various planning and mapping tools also will be done to help stakeholders, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bus-route-rationalisation-to-benefit-corridors-sans-public-transport/article38246003.ece

This is because vehicles that come in two lanes from the Palarivattom side and from Ponnurunni through the underpass of the railway bridge have to jostle for space on the eastern (Thripunithura) side of the flyover where there is hardly two-lane width. This, in turn, obstructs the free-left turn that leads to Thripunithura, apart from the bell mouth that leads to Kaniampuzha Road/Vyttila Mobility Hub. The ensuing wait by vehicles waiting to cross over to these roads, SA Road and towards Alappuzha often extends to 15 minutes. Regulations planned The traffic regulations that have been planned include prohibiting right turn from the Palarivattom side towards SA Road. Motorists must cross the flyover and take a U-turn in front of Decathlon (before Thykoodam Bridge), return to Vyttila and turn left towards SA Road. This will help cross over to SA Road in approximately three minutes, as compared to the 15 minutes wait at Vyttila Junction. Vehicles from Ponnurunni/railway bridge underpass too will not be permitted to turn right towards SA Road, the police said. Another option is to proceed to the city through Subhash Bose Road. Vehicles from Kaniampuzha Road ought to use the road through Vyttila Hub to proceed to Alappuzha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traffic-to-be-streamlined-at-vyttila-from-january-16/article38246011.ece

Using in-house acrylic acid as feedstock, SAP technology is used in hygiene products like diapers and other incontinence products. Sanjay Khanna, executive director in-charge (Refineries), inaugurated the SAP demo plant in the presence of Ajit Kumar K., executive director (Kochi Refinery), Ravi Kumar V., chief general manager, R&D, Sriram S., chief general manager, E&AS, and other senior officials, said a communication from BPCL here. BPCL R&D developed the technology for production of hygiene grade super absorbent polymers (SAP). The process has been developed in-house and patented by BPCL. SAP is produced using acrylic acid which is manufactured at the new Propylene Derivatives Petrochemical Complex at Kochi Refinery. Mr. Khanna said the technology, piping and instrumentation diagram, detail engineering and equipment specification were all developed in-house jointly by Corporate Research and Development Centre (CRDC) and Kochi Refinery team. No external agency was engaged in the project. Both the polymerisation reactor and the drying units were shifted from BPCL’s Corporate Research and Development Centre at Noida. Other units like feed preparation unit, milling, coating and packing units were indigenously engineered and procured by the project team. The project was completed in just seven months, he added. SAP is a polymer that can absorb and retain extremely large amounts of a liquid relative to its own mass. Therefore SAP is one of the key components in sanitary napkins, baby diapers, and adult diapers. Presently, manufacturing units of these products in India are importing SAP. Large quantities of napkins and diapers are also being imported. The commencement of production of SAP at Kochi Refinery could result in setting up of ancillary industries based on SAP in the vicinity including at the KINFRA’s new Ambalamugal petrochemical park.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sap-demonstration-plant-at-kochi-refinery-inaugurated/article38246008.ece

For the youngster doing his journalism course in the Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia, also known as RUDN University, in Moscow, 2021 turned out to be one of the most memorable years in his action-packed life. During the last summer, he hitchhiked across Russia in an adventure that lasted 27 days. He travelled from Tuapse along the western coast of Russia on the Black Sea to Vladivostok on the eastern coast near the Sea of Japan. “It would be hard to pick one memorable episode from that trip. But reading Sanskrit at a Buddhist monastery in the far east of Russia would be one,” said Mr. Presheed. He is now publishing stories from that trip every week along with his online newsletter, which he publishes in English, Russian, and Spanish. Other than his newsletter, learning new languages is one of his passions. While he had more than functional proficiency in Russian in which he is pursuing his course, he is learning Spanish as well. Hilarious video Mr. Presheed has shared a hilarious video on Reddit of him trying to teach his classmates from across the world what he described as the ‘Kochi slang.” The video had gone somewhat viral in the WhatsApp groups back in Kochi. His tryst with Russia started back in 2018 when he spent a month there watching the football World Cup games and exploring the country in between with what little he had saved from his part-time job at a French sporting goods dealer between his classes at IIT-Madras. “I came with a friend who was a cycling fanatic and so we brought along our cycles. We visited Moscow, St. Petersburg, Petrozavodsk, Kaliningrad, and Nizhny Novgorod staying mostly at hostels,” he recollected. He was already disillusioned with his IIT life even prior to that Russian trip but returned even more so.

The process is an exothermic reaction where hydrogen and chlorine are burnt at a temperature of 4,000 degree centigrade to produce hydrochloric acid. Up till now, the towers of the reaction units used to be cooled using water while the extremely high temperature went waste. TCC is now able to produce around 40 tonnes of steam per day, resulting in savings of Rs. 3 crore a year. This is the first time in India that a company has deployed the technology to recover heat from the synthesis unit. The technology has been provided by a German company and components for the heat recovery system were fabricated in Pune under the Make In India programme, company sources said. The new technology was introduced about six months ago, helping TCC cut the use of furnace oil, which is a major cause for environmental pollution. The induction of the new technology is another instance of TCC leveraging its strengths and resources. The company has been identified as one of the cheapest suppliers of hydrogen in the State for motor vehicles. The public sector company was commissioned in 1951 with its registered office at Eloor in Udyogamandal, near Kalamassery. TCC is a chlor alkali unit, where hydrogen is a byproduct from caustic soda production. The supply of comparatively cheap hydrogen is expected to strengthen its financial performance and profitability after it came back from losses. Hydrogen production is expected to be around six tonnes per day in the near future. TCC has already started using excess hydrogen as feedstock in place of furnace oil for its boilers, cutting a substantial quantity of carbon emissions.  TCC is now able to produce around 40 tonnes of steam per day, resulting in savings of Rs. 3 crore a year The new technology was introduced about six months ago, helping TCC cut the use of furnace oil||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/travancore-chemicals-inducts-tech-for-recovery-of-heat-for-reuse/article38246009.ece

In a statement issued here, the AIXEU said it was the largest employees’ union in the company, affiliated to Bharatiya Mazhoor Sangh. It had also the largest membership base, the press communication claimed. The communication alleged that the Air Indian Express company management had “wronged” the cabin crew members, who had offered selfless and courageous service during the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing back thousands of stranded Indians from different parts of the world. The employees served the country with honour and valour, claimed the communication. It also alleged that the action of the company management to reduce the contract period of cabin crew members to one year and then fixing the contract period of other departmental staff at five years was “unjust”. At a time when the cabin crew members were already facing salary cuts and shortage of flying hours, the “arbitrary action of the management to reduce the terms of the employment contract is inimical and pernicious”, the union said in its statement. The strike by the employees was also being “organised against the iniquitous practices of the management in the matter of recruitment”. The union alleged that the company had raised “huge sums of money from aspiring job-seekers” under the “pretext of application money”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/air-india-express-staff-union-to-go-on-strike/article38245994.ece

Justice N. Nagaresh passed the judgment recently while disposing of a writ petition filed by K.P. Mohmmed Asharaf from Kannur challenging the rule. Ultra vires The court declared that Rules 9(4A) and 9(4C) of the Kerala Municipality (Property Tax, Service Tax and Surcharge) Rules, 2011, were ultra vires the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994. The court pointed out that as per Section 233(2)(a) of the Kerala Municipality Act, the government shall, by notification, fix the minimum and maximum limits of rates of basic property tax applicable to one square metre plinth area of the categories of building in accordance with the use and the date on which they would come into force. Therefore, there should be a minimum and maximum limit of rates of basic property tax . Subject to limits Section 233(3) provides that the council of the respective municipality shall fix the tax subject to the limits fixed by the government in accordance with the category of buildings referred to in sub-section (2). The court also pointed out that Section 233(4) provides that the property tax fixed for the first time under sub-section (3) shall be in force for a period of five years and the 25% increase provided is applicable only after the expiry of first five years period, during revision. There was nothing in Section 233(4) to assume that a 25% increase on the pre-existing tax levied on annual value of building is provided while fixing the property tax under Section 233(3) of the Act, the court added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-strikes-down-rule-on-property-tax-fixation/article38246019.ece

The first of its kind initiative in the State, the target is to declare Kollam a totally Constitution literate district on August 14 midnight. “Indian Constitution, the most-elaborate in the world, is the supreme law of the nation. Though the document clearly defines the rights and responsibilities of each citizen, very few are clearly aware of it even after 72 years. It is an attempt to ensure that we, as the citizens of India, are able to understand and uphold the integral values advocated by our constitution,” says V. Sudesan, Deputy Development Commissioner and faculty, KILA. As part of the campaign, the entire population of Kollam above the age of 10 will be briefed on the preamble of the Constitution and the historical background of the document, its basic principles, fundamental rights of citizens, and legal remedies. Everyone, including government institutions, private establishments, socio-cultural organisations, and educational institutions, will be made participants while local bodies will spearhead the campaign. Uphold values “The idea is to equip the people to uphold constitutional values in personal life, family life, and socio-political, economic, and cultural life,” he adds. Around 20 to 25 individuals from each municipality and 10 to 15 persons from each grama panchayat will be selected for training and they will be called senators. The Kollam Corporation will have 100 to 150 senators and KILA will select all senators as per specific guidelines. Squads of trained senators will be formed and they will offer two to three sessions for each family. Support of socio-cultural organisations will be sought in coordinating activities at each ward. Since students are a target section, special handbooks will be prepared and distributed through educational institutions. In the second phase, five forums from equality forum to the district-level secular forum will be constituted. “Equality forum is the basic unit that includes families and they will be taught about the Constitution in the simplest terms. A specially designed preamble of the Constitution in Malayalam and a handbook prepared by KILA will be distributed to all families and institutions in the final stage,” adds Mr. Sudesan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-solemn-resolve-to-be-constitution-literate/article38246043.ece

Though the Rubber Board focusses mainly on increasing the production and productivity of natural rubber, it addresses the concerns of the manufacturing industry, particularly the non-tyre sector, which accounts for less than 30% of the natural rubber consumption, but earns an equal percentage through the export of rubber-based goods,'' he said. Representatives of rubber industry and exporters’ association attended the event. Third-party testing The new laboratory, according to the board, will enable the exporters to conduct independent third-party testing of rubber products for compliance with European Community regulations. It will also help manufactures in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector to design product formulations.

The notification issued on December 31 was for Economics teachers. A note under the ‘Name of post’ said that “Higher Secondary School Teacher (Junior) means part-time post of HSST teacher”. Higher secondary school teachers pointed out that the post of junior teacher was a full-time job at present, with all the statutory benefits. There has been a demand by various teachers’ unions to elevate junior teachers as senior teachers once they complete five years of service. An expert panel appointed during the United Democratic Front (UDF) government of 2011-16 had recommended that junior teachers with eight years of service can be considered for promotion. But the proposal is yet to be implemented. At a time when the State government was going ahead with follow-up steps after merging the directorates of education for high schools and higher secondary schools, the PSC’s move would have far-reaching consequences, the teachers claimed. K.K. Sreejesh Kumar, general secretary of the Kerala Aided Higher Secondary School Teachers Association, said on Tuesday that there were apprehensions if there were plans to abandon the post of junior teacher altogether. As the New Education Policy of the Union government envisages Classes 9 to 12 as one block, there could be a drop in the number of posts of teachers in the higher secondary sector in the future. Those appointed as part-time teachers might be asked to take care of classes in the high school section also. Special rules “It is learnt that the State government is considering special rules on the work time of teachers after the merger process recommended by the Khader panel. There is lack of clarity on this. At a recent meeting with teachers’ union representatives, though the General Education Minister said that the government was going ahead with the merger, the details were not specified,” said Mr. Kumar. Technical problems Against that backdrop, the PSC move would simultaneously affect job aspirants and junior teachers, he said. Some other teachers said that any mention in the notification could create technical problems for those appointed to the post. They are demanding that the PSC issue a clarification to clear the air.

Launching a self-defence training programme for girl students in Kozhikode district under the aegis of Samagra Shiksha Kerala (SSK) here on Tuesday, she said various organisations were still begging for the 30% reservation of seats in elections for women and had not progressed to demand it. “We are still living in a society where mothers feel it is their duty to prepare their daughters for the kitchens in another household,” she said. “The girls in our households are made to believe that they are to be dependent and submissive while the boys are encouraged to be dominant. This situation should change,” said Ms. Sathidevi, while pointing to the need for improving self-esteem, confidence and determination of women. “The SSK is planning not just to train them physically, but also to improve their confidence to face difficult situations,” she said, appreciating the girl from Kozhikode who recently handed over an eve-teaser to the police. Ms. Sathidevi said she hoped that the new generation would change the perspective that women needed to suffer everything in silence and pointed out that the changes in Kerala society over the last half a century did not happen overnight, but were the results of deliberate efforts from various quarters. ”We need democracy even inside houses. Children should be allowed to voice their opinions on important matters that concern them,” she added. SSK District Coordinator A.K.

A people's vigilance committee has also been formed to support the police covering abandoned buildings and isolated street corners. Efforts are under way to install additional closed circuit television cameras in public places to improve surveillance. Many local residents and traders have expressed their willingness to set up remote surveillance measures to monitor miscreants. Night patrol squads As part of improving the night surveillance, the local action committee will be forming its own night patrol squads to cover the city and other vulnerable residential areas. There will be efforts to shut shops engaged in secretly selling banned pan masala and tobacco products, they said. According to the members of the local action committee, the police had been ignoring their complaints for months without conducting any flash inspection or taking into custody suspected carriers. The alleged laxity had been encouraging many to continue the business and make isolated areas safe havens for their trade, they claimed. “The bus stand premises and some of the unoccupied shops are mostly the meeting points of drug addicts and carriers. We resorted to an open street protest recently as the police failed to come up with quick action,” said a local action committee member from Payyoli. Some of the local traders said the beach road was also a haunt of drug addicts and suppliers. There were even occasions when such persons turned aggressive on local people who questioned their activities, they said. Meanwhile, police sources from Payyoli station said there were many incidents in which police squads exposed the operation of drug carriers. “Local squads were closely associated with the District Anti-Narcotic Special Action Force to monitor the suspected chain of drug carriers and their agents.

The Forest and Wildlife officials were hopeful that the leopard might turn up again to take the second cub on Tuesday night. The Wildlife authorities had kept an iron cage next to the abandoned building where the leopard cubs were found on Sunday. As expected, the mother leopard turned up on Sunday and Monday nights looking for its cubs. The leopard was caught in the camera traps thrice on Sunday night. However, on Monday night, the leopard came and gingerly took away one of the two cubs kept inside the iron cage. The leopard managed to carry the cub without getting trapped. “In fact, it has reduced our burden. We expect the leopard to take away its second cub too, maybe tonight (Tuesday),” said Palakkad Divisional Forest Officer Srinivas Kurra. Mr. Kurra said they would wait for two more days for the mother leopard to rejoin its cub. The leopard is believed to have carried the other cub to a safer place either inside the forest or somewhere in the periphery. Wildlife officials fed the remaining cub with goat milk on Tuesday. It was also examined by a veterinarian. Officials said they would place the cub in the cage on Tuesday night too, expecting the mother come and take it away. The two female cubs found in the building were less than 10 days old, and they were hardly able to move. Their eyes were not fully open. The Forest and Wildlife department was concerned about the rehabilitation of the cubs. “Our first priority is to help the cubs rejoin their mother. It will be possible only in the initial three-four days,” said Chief Wildlife Warden K.V. Uthaman. Residents alarmed Meanwhile, local residents were alarmed over the presence of the leopard. They demanded that the Wildlife authorities catch the big cat and drop it deep in the forest along with the cubs. The Wildlife authorities said they were concerned about the safety of both the people and the animals. “We are trying our best to rehabilitate the cubs in the most natural way even while addressing the concerns of the local presidents,” said Mr. Kurra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mother-leopard-takes-away-a-cub/article38246188.ece

The bodies of Chandran Mayurathil (68) and wife Daivana, aka, Devi (55) were found in a pool of blood in their house on Monday morning. The arrested has been identified as Sanal. He had reportedly escaped to Mysuru after committing the murders. According to the police, Sanal was reportedly summoned by his younger brother who told him that their parents had been murdered by robbers who raided their house. Sanal returned to his house in an autorickshaw on Tuesday morning. On seeing the locked gate, he left the place in the same autorickshaw. However, local people alerted the police and nabbed him soon. Delusional behaviour Sources said Sanal was a drug addict, and had been under treatment for delusional behaviour. An engineering undergraduate, he maintained minimal social contacts and was withdrawn and broody at home after he returned from Mumbai, where he had worked in a jewellery. Sanal has reportedly admitted to the crime. However, the police are yet to establish the motive. He reportedly killed his parents by hacking and stabbing them with knives.

He said the CPI(M) was not showing any grief over the death of an activist, rather it was trying to convert the occasion to attack the Congress. He said it was still unclear what exactly happened on the campus. The police and those present at the scene should make the story clear, he said. “What happened was unfortunate. The Youth Congress will never justify it. The Youth Congress does not want to be counted as an organisation that makes benefit out of political clashes and murders,” he said. Do not preach He said CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and DYFI leader A.A. Rahim should not offer preach to the Congress about planned murders. “The CPI(M) has shown Kerala what organised murders are. They are the godfathers of planned murders,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youth-congress-will-not-justify-murder-says-shafi/article38246014.ece

The meeting, convened by Arjun Pandian, Additional District Magistrate of Sabarimala, reviewed the arrangements in place for accommodating the pilgrims on the festival day. The protocol for crowd control will be formulated during a meeting to be convened at Pampa on Wednesday. Authorities are anticipating about 1.5 lakh devotees to turn up across different vantage points for Makarajyothi darshan this time. “Pilgrims will be restricted at Pampa in view of the Thiruvabharanam procession on the Makaravilakku day and there will be restrictions on Kerala State Road Transport Corporation bus schedules and at both Nilackal and Pampa,” said the official. Cleaning works The cleaning works at Pandithavalam and Annadana Mandapam, from where the most number of devotees are expected to view the Makaravilakku, are nearing completion . Anticipating a heavy rush, the Travancore Devaswom Board has set up 240 toilets in two additional blocks. An emergency medical care system will be opened in the newly constructed building at Pandithavalam. The presence of the Fire and Rescue Services too will be ensured at the location. The number of sanitation workers at the hilltop will be raised from the current strength of 173. In view of the anticipated rise in footfall, police deployment in and around the hilltop will be intensified. Taking into consideration the possibility of pilgrims camping at the location from Wednesday onward, exit points are being set up to ensure a safe return of devotees after the Makaravilakku darshan. The devotees will be prevented from climbing on top of buildings at the Sannidhanam to view the Makaravilakku. The entrance to these buildings will be locked on Wednesday and the keys will be kept at the police control room. Power and water supply As part of crowd control, the authorities have been also directed to ensure adequate supply of water and power at these locations. While 10 water points have already been established, Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Sanghom volunteers will be deployed at more locations to supply drinking water. Additional stretcher units will be deployed at Sopanam, Vavarunada, Annadana Mandapam, Pandithavalam, and Saramkuthy.

It viewed the “repeated CPI(M) attacks” against KPCC president K. Sudhakaran as a concerted endeavour to thwart the enterprise to transform the Congress into an election-winning machine with a proactive presence in the State. Recently, CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had alleged that Mr. Sudhakaran had drawn violent criminals into the Congress fold under the pretext of converting the party into a semi-cadre organisation. ‘Mafia style’ The SFI activist’s murder by “hoodlums” in Idukki was a direct fallout of Mr. Sudhakaran imposing his “mafia-style” politics on the Congress, he had claimed. CPI(M) State committee member M.V. Jayarajan had accused Mr. Sudhakaran of publicly advocating violence and vandalism to derail the K-Rail project. CPI(M) workers marched to Mr. Sudhakaran's house here on Tuesday and burnt an effigy of the KPCC president. The CPI(M)'s perceived attempt to single out Mr. Sudhakaran for criticism has arguably bolstered the KPCC's president's position in the party. Support The ‘A’ and ‘I’ factions, which had accused Mr. Sudhakaran of arbitrariness in nominating KPCC office-bearers, appeared to have rallied behind him for now. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala slammed the CPI(M) attempt to pin down Mr. Sudhakaran. Character assassination KPCC working president Kodikunnil Suresh, MP, said the CPI(M) had launched a character assassination campaign against Mr. Sudhakaran the very day the latter assumed charge as KPCC president. “It seems the CPI(M) is fearful of Mr. Sudhakaran continuing at the helm of the KPCC,” he said. Leader of the Opposition V. D. Satheesan, reckoned to be part of the official KPCC group, denounced the CPI(M) attempt to blame Mr. Sudhakaran for the "one-off" tragedy in Idukki. Meanwhile, the KPCC criticised the CPI(M) for targetting Congress workers, KSU activists and party offices across the State in the wake of the Idukki incident. It has decided to launch a major campaign to highlight the CPI(M)'s "cult of violence".||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-attacks-bolster-sudhakarans-position-in-kpcc/article38246018.ece

Besides preventing overcrowding in jails, it significantly helps avoid the stigma attached to conviction, mingling of offenders with hardened criminals, preserves family and social life, and aids offenders’ transformation. ‘Nervazhi’ primarily targets young offenders – those in the 18-30 age group, a good number of them first-time offenders, so that recidivism, the tendency to repeat offences, is reduced, say department officials. The basic life skills training will be provided through The Blue Point, a city-based non-governmental organisation. Life skills are seen as important in giving convicts and undertrials a sense of direction, developing their personality, and ultimately their rehabilitation. A Blue Point representative says the training is intended to equip convicts and undertrials face day-to-day challenges in their life. Over two days, using a participatory approach of discussions, activities, and group work, topics such as self-awareness, understanding oneself (thoughts, feelings, and behaviour), positive thinking, emotional control, goal setting, decision making, empathy, relationship management, and effective communication, are covered. The training will be conducted for three or four batches of 30-odd prisoners. Talks are under way with the department to expand the training to other prisons such as the women’s jail too, says Blue Point staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/life-skills-lessons-for-prisoners-at-district-jail/article38246164.ece

The current case fatality rate (CFR) in the State is 0.94%. The State’s claim to the lowest COVID-19 CFR of 0.3% to 0.4%, something that set it apart from the rest of the country, began falling apart since October last, after the authorities began the death reconciliation exercise. The State was forced to initiate a death reconciliation exercise following the Supreme Court’s intervention and a directive to all State governments to ensure ex gratia payment to all families who lost their relatives to the pandemic. Wide disparities The wide disparities in the CFR between districts had been brought forth by many public health experts. They had appealed to the government to rectify the anomalies in reporting COVID deaths. The death reconciliation exercise has now added a whopping 19,343 deaths to the State’s official toll and this constitutes 39% of the current cumulative toll of 50,053. The process is continuing and with over 10,000 appeals for inclusion on the official toll list still pending, the proportion of under-counted could rise further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-covid-19-toll-crosses-50000-mark/article38245988.ece

On Tuesday, an early win for the police came in Wayanad. Undercover officers busted a ‘criminal conclave’ at a forest resort in the district. They seized contraband, narcotic drugs, and arrested several participants. The police claimed the detainees included wanted men from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. A gang leader had convened the gathering under the pretext of celebrating his marriage anniversary. Plainclothes officers had staked out at the resort posing as guests to effect the arrests. Arrest The police claimed that law enforcers had arrested 13,032 wanted persons between December 18 and January 9 and detained 215 of them under the provisions of KAPA. Law enforcers also raided 16,680 locations, confiscated 5,987 mobile phones allegedly used for criminal purposes, and cancelled the bail of 61 recurrent offenders. Thiruvananthapuram Rural police recorded the highest number of arrests (1,506 persons). In December last, State Police Chief Anil Kanth launched a special drive, themed ‘Kaval’ (Guard) to crack down on crimes that created insecurity in society, ravaged the environment, and undermined citizens’ confidence in law enforcement. It entailed a crackdown on petty crimes such as drug peddling, street violence, and thuggery. The police had also increased its street presence to make public places safe for women at all hours. The special drive entailed active crime mapping. The police had plotted crime-prone spots and detailed the nature of crimes reported from different localities. They kept an active on offenders, particularly those out on bail or parole. Mr. Kant had also recommended the vigorous application of the Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act to deter repeat offenders. He also asked the police to protect the dignity of citizens at all costs. Their life and property were paramount. Moreover, particular focus should be given to the marginalised section of society.

She was speaking after inaugurating the prize announcement ceremony of ‘Hack 4 Health by eHealth,’ a virtual hackathon, through videoconference on Tuesday. The Minister said the State’s Health department had created a globally acclaimed brand following concerted efforts of decades, but the task on hand now was to improve the quality of services further by leveraging modern technology. Hackathon The hackathon, she said, was held with the aim of using technology to improve treatment facilities. It would motivate many start-ups to come up with the best solutions for the benefit of the State’s health sector. The 48-hour hackathon was organised by eHealth under the Health department and the Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-DISC), in association with the Kerala Start-up Mission (KSUM), to get the best solutions for eight problem statements identified by the Health department. The KSUM had shortlisted around 68 start-ups for the hackathon, and eight of them emerged winners. Acutrotechnologies, EXPRESSbase Systems, Qkopy, Lares.AI, and Waggle LAB, bagged the first five places respectively, by scoring top marks in the evaluation. These five start-ups will be awarded a grant of Rs.1 lakh each. Linsys Innovations, Bagmo, and AIMed Solutions are the other three winners. Meanwhile, all the eight start-ups will get opportunities to associate themselves with the future activities of K-DISC, eHealth, and KSUM. K-DISC will take the projects through the emerging technologies initiative and try to implement the projects in the Health department. K.M. Abraham, Executive Vice-Chairperson, K-DISC, in his presidential address, said the State was in the middle of becoming a leader in health electronics and health application platforms. K-DISC and eHealth were collaborating on three major projects: real-time retinal image quality assessment and feedback generation using artificial intelligence (AI), blood bank facility at General Hospital and associated blood storage centre; and block chain-enabled vaccine coverage analysis. The hackathon was a continuation of that partnership, he added. Rajan N. Khobragade, Principal Secretary, Health, and Chairman, eHealth Kerala, delivered the keynote address on ‘Technology intervention in Health department’. John M. Thomas, Chief Executive Officer, KSUM; Mohammed Y. Safirulla, Project Director, eHealth; and Vinod Raj V., technology manager, eHealth, were present.

Disease transmission seems to be the highest in the 20-40 years age group, a possible indication of the increased social interactions and gatherings amongst this age group over Christmas and New Year, Health Minister Veena George said here on Tuesday. Talking to mediapersons here, she said that COVID transmission among health-care workers also seemed to be rising. Hospital beds The Health Department has reviewed the COVID situation in districts as well as the preparation, including the availability of hospital beds for both COVID and non Covid care, ICU/ventilator and oxygen beds, and availability of oxygen. Cases were rising in all districts, with most cases being reported now from Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, and Thrissur, she said. Ms. George said that samples from case clusters from all districts were being sent for genomic sequencing and that there was no indication of a wide-spread transmission of Omicron virus variant. According to experts, Delta and Omicron variants were currently in circulation in the State and as Delta variant was known to cause a more serious illness, the public should be on guard and ensure that all universal precautions against COVID-19 were being followed strictly, she said. Unnecessary travels and public gathering should be strictly avoided. In view of the new COVID situation, 13 committees had been reconstituted under the Health Department, each of which would be in charge of various aspects of COVID management, including surveillance, infrastructure, and logistics. The State is now manufacturing 416.63 metric tonnes of oxygen. Testing guidelines have been revised as per the directives of the Centre and the ICMR. Ms. George said that the elderly and those with co-morbidities should take extreme care to ensure that their risk factors were well within control. Districts had been directed to ready at least one COVID first-line treatment centre each. COVID brigade The State had also sought assistance from the Centre for reconstituting the COVID brigade, as the need for more healthcare workers would arise soon, she said. The State has now fully vaccinated 81% of those above 18 years while at least one dose has been administered to 99%. In the 15-18 year age group, 39% (5,93,784) have been delivered the first vaccine dose. In the past two days, 60,421 persons have received the precaution dose, the priority now being for healthcare workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/disease-transmission-highest-in-20-40-age-group-veena/article38246160.ece

The Minister stressed the need for board offices to impress on the public that their complaints would be addressed immediately. All offices should be made worker-friendly. They should also have landline facility, he said. There are 16 welfare fund boards under the Labour Department in the State, and nearly 70 lakh workers are members of these boards. They include pensioners too. Ineligible people had become members of some welfare boards, thus affecting the purpose of their existence, the Minister said. This was a problem that should be addressed seriously. It should be ensured that only the eligible were members of welfare schemes, he said. Self-sufficient Special drives and campaigns should be conducted by each welfare fund board to increase its membership. There was a need to increase income in order to make welfare funds more attractive. They should be able to become self-sufficient through an increase in income and efficient functioning. Some board officials were not working efficiently to enrol eligible people into welfare schemes and get subscriptions. This should be corrected, the Minister said. Officials should act to prevent dual membership in the welfare fund boards. The Minister said a centralised software would be implemented for the 16 boards under the Labour Department. This would help prevent dual membership and disbursal of benefits in a time-bound manner. The State government’s online taxi system was a revolutionary step in the transport sector. Similar to other online taxi aggregators, the government, Kerala Motor Workers Welfare Fund Board, and ITI Ltd., were implementing the online taxi service ‘Kerala Savari’.

Supplyco ventured into the e-commerce avenue a month ago when the scheme got under way in Thrissur. Mr. Anil said the company had been able to transition from one that distributed essentials through the Kudumabashree to an enterprise that developed its own delivery network. The entire chain of Supplyco supermarkets would come under the network within two months, he said. Mr. Anil added that the a wide range of items including essential commodities, vegetables, fruits as well as the products of Milma, Horticorp, Kepco, and Matsyafed would be available for online sales. Agriculture produce will also be soon procured directly from farmers for the purpose. The initiative was bound to fetch them greater returns, he pointed out. Customers could place orders through the ‘Supply Kerala’ mobile application to purchase products from Supplyco. As part of steps to encourage online sales, Supplyco would provide 5% discount from the total bill amount for home deliveries. The products purchased would be delivered within 24 hours. Presiding over the function, Transport Minister Antony Raju said mini-outlets of Supplyco would soon come up in all KSRTC depots across the State.

Prof. Pillai had come for severe admonishment by the Governor, who ridiculed his vocabulary, while citing a letter the Vice Chancellor had written to him. “Look at the language he has used.... How do you feel about it as a Keralite,” he asked mediapersons adding that the quality of writing made it hard for him to show face outside the State as the Chancellor of the university. Mr. Khan also felt the VC “does not know how to talk and convey a message. ” In response to the criticism, Prof. Pillai on Tuesday wrote, “I have remained vigilant in ensuring the grammar and spelling of my life did not err. I do not see it as a flaw that my hands shiver when my mind is shaken. I have also aspired to imbibe the valuable lessons taught by my mentors.” He added that he did not wish to comment on the issue further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ku-vc-responds/article38246021.ece

The companies use the produce for either export or sale through a chain of their retail shops in the country. But of late, the honeymoon seems to have come to an end with the companies dictating terms on the variety and extent of the crop to be sown, which has been drastically changing the cropping patterns. Profit margins of farmers have come down as they have lost the option to choose the crop and the decisions are no more based on the suitability of the soils or areas based on the studies in the agriculture research stations. The market dynamics of these companies have been determining the total cropped area, the villages where they should be grown and the price at which the farmers should sell. In grip of middlemen Not all companies have their own staff to monitor all the operations and they just decide the type of crop a farmer needs to grow and then allow a local middleman to do the rest on their behalf. At an interactive session of leaders from the Rythu Coolie Sangham and the A.P. Rythu Sangham, University of Hyderabad Sociology Professor N. Purendra Prasad expressed his dismay at the way the middlemen were controlling the crop area, the variety and the price a farmer would get by handing over the final produce at the village collection centres. “While on paper and in the contract the companies promise a good price, at the end of the harvest season, the farmer gets the promised price only for a small quantity of his crop. For the rest (lower grade), he has to depend on the local businessmen to bail them out, which has been seen in the case of bananas, tomatoes, onions (in Kurnool), mango, sweet lime, curry leaves and pomegranate,” said Mr. Purendra. “When the total earnings of farmers for their crop in a season is now calculated, it just offsets the input cost or cost of production and they are left with a meagre profit,” he said referring to the ground-level feedback from the recent 800-km padayatra of the Rythu Coolie Sangham.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/horticulture-farmers-at-the-receiving-end/article38245661.ece

Vinod Kumar has asked the Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled States and its Central leaders to come for a debate on welfare in their States compared to Telangana. Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, he said that the BJP leaders, who had been visiting Telangana for the last couple of months, were making baseless charges against the TRS government and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. He stated that the development schemes being implemented in Telangana were not found anywhere in the country and they could know about the strides taken by Telangana by consulting the authorities of Central government departments. He alleged that the BJP was also using its leaders to visit Hyderabad for its political ends and cited that they had spread misinformation that national president of the party J.P. Nadda had come here on the issue of its State president Bandi Sanjay’s arrest, when he was actually here to participate in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) meeting and his visit was scheduled much before Mr. Sanjay was arrested. Mr. Vinod Kumar offered to arrange four helicopters for Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled States to visit any corner of the State and also participate in a debate at Ravindra Bharathi, a cultural events venue, here for arguing over development in their States compared to TS. Stating that TRS would not keep quiet if ‘misinformation and false charges’ were made by BJP against the State government or the Chief Minister, he termed BJP as anti-people and anti-democratic. He alleged that the party had exploited voters in the name of constructing Ram temple at Ayodhya but the TRS did not publicise its work of reconstructing the Yadadri temple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/trs-leader-calls-bjp-cms-for-debate/article38245599.ece

Farmers from various auction platforms in SPSR Nellore and Prakasam districts conveyed their stand to YSR Congress Party MP from Ongole M. Srinivasulu Reddy and urged him to take up their concerns over contract farming with Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. Concerns over scrapping of Tobacco Board The farmers, led by YSRCP farmers’ wing Prakasam district president Mareddy Subba Reddy, also expressed concerns over the alleged downsizing of the Tobacco Board which had been acting as a facilitator between the growers on the one side and the domestic cigarette manufacturers and exporters on the other, and ensured the farmers a fair price for their produce. Giving a patient hearing to the farmers from southern black soil(SBS) and southern light soil (SLS) region, the Lok Sabha member assured the growers that he would lead MPs from tobacco growing areas ahead of the Budget session of the Parliament and impress upon the Centre to drop the planned contract farming system and any move to scrap the Tobacco Board. Farmer leader from Ongole II platform V.V.Prasad expressed fears that if contract farming became a reality, farmers, a majority of them small and marginal as also tenant, would end up as farm labourers with big corporate firms ruling the roost in future.. They made a mention of bad contract farming experiences of their counterparts in countries like Malawi and Zimbabwe, where the corporate firms imposed unfavourable contract conditions for farmers who suffered because of realisation of low prices for their produce. At times of crop failures due to vagaries of monsoon, the corporate firms after advancing farm inputs on credit were sure to takeover their land at low prices, they feared.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mp-promises-to-take-up-tobacco-ryots-fight-against-contract-farming/article38246120.ece

Speaking on the occasion, he said that the YSRCP government had completely stalled the developmental activity and put heavy financial burden on people by imposing multiple taxes like tax on garbage and collection of amount under One Time Settlement for registration of houses sanctioned by previous governments. “There is no economic activity in Andhra Pradesh and thousands of people lost their livelihood, he said. The so-called welfare schemes and direct cash transfers would not ensure livelihood for them since such benefits would provide relief only for a couple of days for poor people,” said Mr. Murali Mohan. “The TDP government used to provide essential goods during Sankranti to make everyone celebrate the festival. But the YSRCP government has stopped such schemes. People have realised that the government’s so-called schemes will make their lives miserable in future,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/peoples-lives-turned-miserable-in-ysrcp-regime-says-tdp-leader/article38246153.ece

The annual exhibition is timed around this part of the year, when the temple city is abuzz with visitors, who make good use of the annual vacation between the New Year and Sankranti. The exhibition, formally inaugurated by Mayor R. Sireesha on December 24, has so far earned a decent revenue, say Lepakshi officials. Even the artisans and weavers, who have arrived from across India, seem to be elated in view of the improved sales, which show a slight improvement over the previous year when the pandemic fear was at an all-time high. Another highlight of this year’s expo is the higher footfalls from local residents, compared to the pilgrim inflow. A variety of silk and cotton saris, dress material, chikan work, and linen range are an instant hit. Not just saris and the handloom range, even the earthenware, fashion jewellery, metal artifacts and wooden art pieces have caught the attention of the visitors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lepakshi-exhibition-registers-higher-sales/article38246122.ece

The meeting remained inconclusive though some of the exhibitors presented their case before the committee. The exhibitors contended that the uniform rule for all theatres would push the theatre managements into doldrums. The managements would incur losses. The prices fixed for theatres in rural areas were meagre and would not be sufficient to meet the day to day expenses also, they contended. The committee asked them to come up with details of expenditure incurred by the owners. It stated that it was not correct to give a blanket statement that the exhibitors would run into losses if the ticket prices were fixed by the government. Also, it was not appreciated if the exhibitors said that they would not get even minimum expenditure. The government would examine if they submitted the details of theatre maintenance etc., the committee pointed out. The committee chairman, some members such as Krishna district Joint Collector did not turn up for the meeting. The committee would meet again after the Sankranti festival. However, the schedule is not fixed. Vemuri Bala Ratnam of Sri Krishna theatres, Sri Thummala Seeta Ram Prasad (Sree Lakshmi Rama Pictures (distributor), Sri Mutyala Ramdas, Vice president Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce, Vadde Om Prakash NArayan, member of Central board of Certification and film critic, Jupalle Rakesh Reddy, and Gampa Laskhmi are members of the Committee apart from the officials. Principal Secretary Home is Chairman of the committee, while Principal Secretary (Revenue), Principal Secretary (MAUD), Principal Secretary (Finance), Commissioner and ex officio member I&PR department, Secretary law department, Joint Collector Krishna district are the members. The committee was asked to take factors relevant to the fixation of rates of admission viz. classification of theatres such as multiplexes, AC cinema halls and non-AC halls with due regard to the location and the amenities required to be provided to the cinegoers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/meet-on-ticket-pricing-inconclusive/article38245819.ece

The BJP has demanded that the cases against party leader Srikanth Reddy and others be withdrawn at once. Addressing the media on Tuesday, BJP State president Somu Veerraju said that BJP workers had been threatened by the YSRCP leaders with dire consequences. “We have records to prove it. YSRCP MLA Silpa Chakrapani is the prime accused,” he said, and added that the party leader’s vehicle had been set ablaze on the police station premises itself. While the police had said about 150 miscreants were present, the DGP was underplaying it saying only 50 people gathered. The police had saved Mr. Srikanth Reddy, but surprisingly, a case under Section 307 was filed against him instead of the people who were responsible for the clashes. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who had come to power by seeking one chance, was causing mental agony. False cases were being slapped for questioning the government , he alleged. ‘No permissions’ “The government is behaving in a partisan manner and supporting only one community. The government should withdraw the cases filed against Mr. Srikanth Reddy and other leaders,” he said. Referring to the district SP, Mr. Veerraju said there were no permissions for the construction of the mosque. “How can it be constructed without necessary permissions? Why did the MLAs support the construction in a locality inhabited by the Hindus?” he questioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/withdraw-cases-against-party-leaders-in-atmakur-bjp/article38246124.ece

S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was out to take people for a ride yet another time in the name of Smart Townships scheme. In a statement, he said on the one hand the government was not in a position to continue the schemes it had already launched and pay salaries to its employees.

Directions were issued to heads of health facilities and officials to ensure that the services are unaffected. Health Minister T. Harish Rao on Tuesday issued instructions to arrange separate Operation Theatres (OT) and wards for pregnant women and others detected with coronavirus. If the facilities are available, they should not be referred to tertiary care hospitals in Hyderabad. The aim is to reduce the burden on the latter. At a video conference held with District Medical and Health Officers (DMHO), heads of the hospitals, Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Urban PHCs on Tuesday, Mr Harish Rao discussed several issues, including extending vaccination timings and providing healthcare services on Sundays. He also told officials to ensure Basti Dawakhanas, PHCs, and sub centres remain open on Sundays too till the third wave of the COVID pandemic recedes and new infections show a definite drop. Vaccination, testing, and distribution of home isolation kits should be taken up, he said. Citing instructions from the Central government, Mr Harish Rao said that COVID vaccination should be provided at PHCs till 10 p.m. Since families, including children, would visit their respective native places during Sankranti festival, PHC staff were instructed to go door to door to vaccinate those in the 15-18 year age group. Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy, who attended the meeting, said all regular services, including emergency and elective, in government hospitals are functioning as usual.  Vaccination, testing, and distribution of home isolation kits should be taken up. COVID vaccination should be provided at PHCs till 10 p.m., Mr Harish Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/uniterrupted-care-for-pregnant-women-and-covid-patients/article38245928.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao has once again started planning for the ‘Third Front’ by meeting Left Party and other national leaders and has been talking of Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raids only to “save himself from prosecution for his corrupt deals”, charged Telangana BJP president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Tuesday. “We will not spare KCR, we will probe his corruption and send him behind bars. He was involved in ESI and Sahara cases and the CBI is already probing into them,” he claimed, at a public meeting held in Mahabubnagar in support of the agitating employees against GO 317 zonal transfers. The BJP leader said the ‘rubbish’ GO has to be put into dustbin for causing so much of distress and divide among the employees yet the Chief Minister does not appear to be in a mood to relent. “He (CM) did not respond when farmers and students were committing suicide, so employees taking the extreme step too is not going to change the heart of this tyrant,” he charged. Employees and teachers should endure the TRS regime for another two years after which he was sure the BJP will form the government when the transfer orders will be withdrawn. “It will be our first step and justice will be done to employees, teachers and unemployed youth. We are fighting for your cause, getting thrashed by the police and going to jail so join us in the struggle,” he said. Mr. Sanjay Kumar challenged the Chief Minister to explain how many extra acres of agriculture land got water from the irrigation projects taken up after the TRS came to power. The district has been among the neglected ones, he said. The BJP leader also criticised Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao for meeting and dining with CPM and Majlis Party which had opposed the formation of Telangana. Party vice president D.K. Aruna said none of the pending irrigation projects of the district have been completed by the TRS despite lofty claims. Former minister Eatala Rajender, former MP Jitender Reddy and others also spoke.  KCR was involved in ESI and Sahara cases and CBI is already probing into them... It will be our first step and justice will be done to employees, teachers and unemployed.

A query under the Right To Information Act has revealed that the department has not kept even records of tree felling permissions up to date. Details provided are only partial, and not complete, allege the activists. P.Uday Krishna, an environmental activist working for free translocation of trees marked for felling, filed an RTI application with the department, seeking to know the number of trees approved for felling and for translocation by the Tree Protection Committee since 2008, along with the details of compensatory plantations and status of translocated trees. The department, instead provided only the details of trees felled, retained and translocated for various projects since 2016. A further query citing a project in Kukatpally for which 91 trees were felled, has yielded the reply from the DFO, Hyderabad that after reorganisation of the districts in 2016, the jurisdiction went to the Rangareddy district. Though the details of that particular project were provided upon asking, several others from the same jurisdiction did not find any mention. Conversely, details of trees felled in Hayatnagar and other locations of Rangareddy district found mention in the records shared, which left the applicant baffled. “I merely sought permissions accorded by the tree protection committee since its formation, without mentioning the jurisdiction. If the committee gave permission in Rangareddy district, even those details should have been included, which were not. I can ask only the sites which are in my knowledge, but there may be several which even I do not know,” said Mr.Uday Krishna, adding that even the permissions given for felling inside the KBR Park were missing. One more glaring lapse was missing information about the compensatory plantations and status of the translocated trees. Except for two projects, no details about the compensatory plantation was provided by the department. “It is the responsibility of the tree protection committee to monitor the survival of the translocated trees, and trees planted in compensation, which it is not fulfilling,” alleged Mr Uday Krishna. As per the information parted with, since 2016, a total of 3,500 trees were axed for various government and private projects in and around the city. A total of 1500 trees were retained and more than 4406 trees were translocated. Roads & Buildings department has turned out to be the major feller of trees, with more than 2,500 trees axed in its name for various projects including road widening and the construction of new secretariat. Mr.Uday Krishna however, contends that the actual number of trees permitted to be felled is much higher than the stated, and the department has not shared complete details.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/clueless-about-compensatory-afforestation/article38245938.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:13 IST,TELANGANA||Revanth accepts KTR’s challenge on agri growth||Telangana Congress committee president A. Revanth Reddy said he was accepting the challenge of Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao on agriculture growth in Telangana, and suggested him to choose the venue, date and time while appealing to him not to go back on the challenge thrown by him. At a press conference on Tuesday, he described Mr. Rao’s claims on agriculture growth as bogus and said he would prove what the Congress contributed from 2004 to 2014 and how the TRS created agrarian crisis since 2014. “I will also compare how much better present Congress governments in other States are doing on the agriculture front. I will take a delegation of TRS ministers to Congress-ruled States to prove my claim,” he said. The TPCC chief, who was accompanied by senior leaders Mohammed Ali Shabbir, Balram Naik, Mallu Ravi, Anvesh Reddy and others, said free power, farm loan waiver, completion of pending projects while starting new projects, ensuring input subsidy to farmers who lose crops due to vagaries of weather, support price to all the crops and increasing the MSP of paddy from Rs. 450 to Rs. 1,060 were some of the achievements that he wanted to bring to the notice of the TRS that has been claiming that the Congress did nothing. Quoting government figures of over 75,000 farmers dying from 2014 to 2018, he said it should also reveal how many died since 2018. Most of the farmers who died were aged between 18 and 58 years, he said. Mr. Revanth Reddy recalled that the Congress-led UPA government had waived off farm loans of nearly Rs. 72,000 crore of 4.30 crore farmers across the country and the then united Andhra Pradesh was the major beneficiary, where loans of nearly Rs. 13,154 crore of over one crore farmers were waived off in a single instance. Nearly 38 lakh farmers, who already repaid their loans, were given incentives of Rs. 5,000 each to the tune of nearly Rs. 1,800 crore. The entire process of waiving off farm debts was completed within 100 days without any glitches. “Its been three years and TRS is yet to fulfil its farm loan waiver promise.” He said that the Congress government issued GO Ms 421 on June 1, 2004, to provide financial assistance up to Rs. 2 lakh to the families of farmers who committed suicide besides extending other assistance to the affected families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/revanth-reddy-accepts-ktrs-challenge-on-agri-growth/article38245957.ece

We surmise it is dateable to the megalithic period,” said S. Haragopal who discovered the site along with Muralikrishna, and Mahesh. Interestingly, the 15-foot-high conical menhir discovered in a raised area has a petroglyph incised into it. “We were led to the site by villagers. Earlier, there were burial circles and other relics were scattered over 15 acres of land. But more land is now being used for agriculture. In the process we are losing our precious history,” said Mr. Haragopal. As the site is located beside the road, the historians are worried that the whole site will be destroyed for development activities. In the past, a group member Ahobilam Karunakar had discovered a neolithic stone axe and a hundred holes in the bedrock in the vicinity of the menhir. Earlier, similar megalithic sites with menhirs, stone circles and other funerary structures have been discovered in other parts of the State of Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/prehistoric-burial-site-found-in-village-near-suryapet/article38245949.ece

A Cabinet sub-committee comprising Ministers K.T. Rama Rao, V. Srinivas Goud and P. Sabita Indra Reddy in addition to Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar held detailed review on the salient features of the draft sports policy on Tuesday. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Rama Rao lamented that there were no playgrounds in the educational institutions across the GHMC limits and students were herded into classes. “How can the students be fit and active without basic exercises like jogging and walking?” Accordingly, steps should be taken to set up grounds and stadia wherever feasible and the government could consider providing financial incentives department wise for promoting such activities. These activities could be incorporated in the works being taken up under Palle and Pattana Pragati programmes launched for comprehensive development of rural and urban areas. In this context, the Minister said Odisha government had successfully created sports infrastructure and a delegation of officials could go to the State on a study tour. Similarly, in cities like Ahmedabad, infrastructure was created, but with focus entirely on cricket. Officials concerned should focus on development of hockey, cricket and other sports for preparing a model while equal focus should be on para athletics. The meeting resolved to take the measures discussed to the notice of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao who was of the view that encouragement of good coaches would augur well for helping budding sportsmen to hone their skills.It was also resolved to prepare a draft policy incorporating necessary changes in the next meeting and secure approval of the Cabinet before the next Assembly session. ‘Rehabilitation centres’ Minister K.T. Rama Rao expressed concern that though there were associations for all games including a State Olympic Association, no one knew what their functions were. “The posts in these associations have become political rehabilitation centres. There should be no political interference in sports and I am prepared to quit from the sports posts I am holding,” Mr. Rama Rao asserted. He recalled allocation of seven acre land for snookers in Nanakramguda and said lands allotted for sports promotion were being misused by some private individuals. Officials should take steps to reclaim such lands and ensure that they were used for promotion of sports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-gearing-up-to-introduce-new-sports-policy/article38245941.ece

Jayaprakash Reddy has threatened to sit on a dharna in front of Pragathi Bhavan seeking fulfilment of assurances given by Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao before the 2018 elections. “I will sit on a dharna for one day and I hope the police will give me permission as they are doing for the programmes of the Telangana Rashhtra Samiti (TRS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),” he said at a press conference here. He wanted the Chief Minister to give straight answers on his promises including unemployment dole of Rs. 3,016 per month, farm loan waiver up to Rs. 1 lakh at one go, interest free loans to the Self Help Groups and regularisation of plots and buildings in the panchyat layouts under the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA). “None of these promises is fulfilled and it means nothing but deceiving people,” he said. Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy said the UPA government had waived farm loans at one go as promised by Sonia Gandhi in 2004 and it was the Congress that introduced Arogyasri scheme and fee reimbursement scheme that had benefited millions of people. All these schemes were now almost defunct and that was the contribution of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) to Telangana, he said. The one lakh farm loan had now increased to Rs. 2 lakh with interest because the TRS government has failed to honour its own promise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/jagga-reddy-to-stage-dharna-in-front-of-pragati-bhavan/article38245943.ece

A tech major which is into manufacturing, and support had back-to-work plans in the first week of January. However, plans are now on hold.  A mid-level employee from this company told The Hindu that third wave and the Omicron variant had put these plans on hold.  There has been hesitancy on account of the new variant among employees to return to work, he said. “The management had made plans for a return to office in the beginning of this month. They had sent feelers and communications to staff maybe in October or November of a return to work plan. Initially, it was supposed to be a phased approach, with the number of people reporting to office increasing slowly. In December, they said that there would be a return to work policy. But the management took cognisance of the third wave, and also of Omicron, and deferred plans. We are working from home now,” he said requesting anonymity. A clearer picture would emerge in a couple of months, he added. For other large companies, including that of a banking conglomerate with a substantial operational presence in Hyderabad, there has been no change since the first wave. “We are still working from home. There is no change. We are only getting advisories about how to stay safe. It appears that work from home will be the case for us, at least for the foreseeable future,” said a senior employee. Syed Sulaiman (named changed), a techie with Tech Mahindra, too pointed out that the company was in no mood to take any chances, and work-from-home mode was on.  Speaking to The Hindu , Bharani Kumar Aroll, president, Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association, said that very large companies were working with a 5% headcount.  On the other hand, medium-sized companies were working with comparatively larger numbers. “They are likely to decide on calling back staff by March or a little later. It is a wait and watch situation. With respect to the hybrid model of working, the frequency has reduced. This is in case of small and medium companies,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/back-to-work-plans-on-hold/article38245944.ece

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N. Tukaramji of the Telangana High Court, pronouncing the verdict, said due process of law was followed while taking the action against Golden Jubilee Hotels. There was no reason to interfere with the RBI’s decision, the bench stated. The Reserve Bank of India’s Master Directions on Fraud had a comprehensive mechanism before classifying a bank account as fraud. It is based on the documents supplied by the borrower. “It is not a case where the forensic auditor on his own prepares some documents. The borrower is well aware of all such documents based on which the forensic audit takes place,” the Telangana High Court bench observed. The bench said tere was no provision for grant of opportunity of hearing as requested by the petitioner since that matter was still pending before the Supreme Court, the highest court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/petition-against-rbis-classification-dismissed/article38245940.ece

The decision has been taken as per the Government Order Ms No 1, General Administration Department, dated 01.01.2022, and GO Ms No 6, GAD, dated 09.01.2022 to prevent the spread of COVID-19/Omicron, temple sources said.

Meanwhile, the Endowments Department has made arrangements to celebrate Vaikunta (Mukkoti) Ekadasi festivities internally within the precincts of Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple in Bhadrachalam of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district on January 12 and 13. Devotees will not be allowed to take part in Uttara Dwara Darshanam and other events at the shrine as part of precautionary measures to stem the spread of coronavirus, according to temple sources. The authorities have made arrangements to refund money to devotees who had earlier booked sector-wise tickets for Uttara Dwara Darshanam online, following the government order not to allow devotees to take part in the mega religious event in the interest of public safety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mukkoti-ekadasi-events-inside-temples/article38245959.ece

Notably, a formal announcement for the the recruitment of vidya sahayaks or primary schoolteachers was made by the State’s BJP government in March last year when Bhupendrasinh Chudasama was the Education Minister.  However, things did not move forward as the Centre had asked State governments to increase the reservation quota for persons with disabilities from the present three per cent to four per cent, said State Education Minister, Jitu Vaghani. “This matter got delayed because of some administrative processes. After the Centre's directive to increase the quota, the Social Justice and Empowerment Department and my department recently finished all formalities, and now we will soon start the process to recruit nearly 3,300 primary schoolteachers,” Mr. Vaghani told reporters in Gandhinagar. While 1,300 teachers will be recruited for Classes 1 to 5, nearly 2,000 teachers will be taken in for Classes 6 to 8, he said, adding that those who have cleared eligibility test in the past will be considered for recruitment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/gujarat-to-recruit-3300-primary-schoolteachers/article38246037.ece

Das was 63. The popular actor was suffering from renal ailments for years. He was admitted to the private hospital on December 9 last year and was on ventilator support. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik condoled the actor’s death and announced that Das would be laid to rest with full state honours at Cuttack on Wednesday. Das is survived by his son and daughter-in-law. Born in Mayurbhanj district on February 11, 1959, he made his debut in the art film 'School Master'.  The versatile actor had won the State government's best actor award for his performance in 'Laxmi Pratima' (1998), and 'Pheria Mo Suna Bhauni' (2005). His acting in 'Pua Mora Bholashankara' will always be remembered, his co-worker Bapu Lenka said.   He was hugely appreciated for hosting the reality show 'Ashara Aloka' .  The actor had also tried his luck in politics. In 2014, he had joined the ruling Biju Janata Dal, but quit the party and later joined the BJP in 2019. Governor Ganeshi Lal, his Andhra Pradesh counterpart B B Harichandan, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, and people from different walks of life condoled the popular actor's death. BJP national vice president Baijayant Panda said in a Twitter post, “I am crestfallen hearing the news. It is an end of an era.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 05:35 IST,||Post-retirement jobs luring bureaucrats||Odisha’s former Director General of Police Abhay did not even get a day’s off to reflect upon his achievements in his three-decade-long service. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik appointed him as the head of the newly created State’s task force for narcotic drugs moments later he left his office. Mr. Abhay is not an exception. Since 2010, except two former heads of State bureaucracy, all Chief Secretaries have landed new jobs soon after their superannuation. While Ajit Kumar Tripathy and A.P. Padhi went on to become the State Election Commissioner shortly after their stint as the CS, Tarun Kanti Mishra was made the Chief Information Commissioner. Former CS Bijay Kumar Pattnaik was with the State Human Rights Commission and the Odisha Staff Selection Commission. No doubt, Mr. Abhay as the former Director General of the Narcotics Control Bureau had a rich experience in tackling drug menace. The 1986-batch officer would chair the task force for the drugs related issues in the State, in the rank and status of CS. His predecessor R.P. Sharma was appointed member of Lokpal after his retirement. Some officers had taken voluntary retirement months before their superannuation to get new jobs. Former Additional Chief Secretary U.N. Behera took over the chairmanship of the Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission by taking voluntary retirement. Former DGP Satyajit Mohanty became the chairman of the Odisha Public Service Commission in similar fashion. It seems different positions are kept vacant for serving IAS and IPS officers so that they could stretch their active service period for a few more years with sinecures. “We don’t see any difference or remarkable changes in functioning of the institutions where retired bureaucrats are reappointed,” said Sudhir Mohanty, a Right To Information activist who had several run-ins with the bureaucracy. Prasanna Mishra, a former Coal Secretary at the Centre, said, “Lure of post-retirement jobs affects objectivity and neutrality of government employees. Those who are in sensitive positions and assured of post-retirement jobs will show their allegiance to political bosses during their regular service.” “The fundamental principle of bureaucracy is one should be loyal to the system, not to any political dispensation. An avoidable favouritism is now being shown. The post-retirement posts should be made regular and offered to serving officers within the retirement age of 60,” he suggested. “The Naveen government is functioning on the basis of 5Ts (Team work, Technology, Transparency, Transformation and Time limit) principle. The transparency component is, however, missing when these post-retirement appointments are made,” Mr. Mishra pointed out. In the past, there had been huge hue and cry when the officers of the Odisha Administrative Services were re-appointed in different positions after their retirement. Serving officers had alleged that the natural career progression was derailed due to post-retirement recruitments. When senior officers in the bureaucracy were trying to stretch their service period, the teachers in the State-run Utkal University were too not behind. The Utkal University Teachers’ Association (UUTA) recently resolved to continue its struggle to extend the retirement age of university faculty members to 65 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/post-retirement-jobs-luring-bureaucrats/article38246040.ece

In the letter written to the President on Monday, he also pleaded for “euthanasia” if his demand cannot be fulfilled. “All the constitutional rights of the citizens of the country are being violated. The three pillars of democracy — the Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive — are being destroyed. The media is also working at the behest of these three....there is a sense of fear among citizens,” the letter stated. The CM’s father heads the Rashtriya Matdata Jagriti Manch which creates awareness towards voting. Right to vote “The right to vote is the supreme right of democracy which is being executed through the EVMs. No nationally or internationally recognised institutions or governments have certified the EVMs as cent per cent accurate. By conducting polling using the machines in India, the constitutional right of my vote is being violated. There is no guarantee whether my vote is cast in favour of whom I pressed the button through the EVMs,” he said. It is the constitutional duty and the responsibility of the Election Commission and the Central government to introduce such a transparent system of voting and counting in the elections which can be evaluated by the public, the voters, themselves. Many developed countries have adopted ballot paper, he said. “In such circumstances when all my rights are being violated, then the very purpose of my life is getting lost, and my conscience is not allowing me to live any longer. Honourable President Ji, you have taken an oath to protect the Constitution, but my constitutional rights are not being protected, due to which I have no option but to die,” he said. He urged the President to issue an order to conduct elections using ballot papers and said, “if ballot paper is not possible, then he should allow me euthanasia on National Voters' Day on January 25 this year”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/baghels-father-seeks-use-of-ballot-papers/article38246028.ece

A large number of doctors went on the strike boycotting OPD services across the State under the banner of the Haryana Civil Medical Services’ Association (HCMSA). Three major demands The Association is seeking three major demands: stop direct recruitment for Senior Medical Officers (SMOs), fix 40% quota for in-service doctors for admission to post-graduation courses and create a specialist cadre of doctors.The emergency services, such as post-mortem and COVID-19 duties, were not affected as already announced by the Association. ‘Cannot strike’ Announcing the decision to invoke ESMA, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij, in a tweet, said: “ESMA has been invoked in Haryana. Now health workers cannot proceed on strike for six months. The step was taken after a group of doctors decided to go on strike and create hurdles in the prevention of COVID-19.” Mr. Vij told media persons that the government had “in-principle” agreed to the demands of the doctors and it was conveyed to them on Monday, but they still decided to go ahead with their plan to hold the strike. Fight against COVID-19 He said a force seemed to be behind them to disrupt the fight against COVID-19 in the State.  HCMSA vice-president and Gurugram Deputy Chief Medical Officer M.P. Singh told The Hindu that their demands had gone unheeded for long and they were forced to go on the day-long strike.  Mr. Singh said doctors would proceed on an indefinite strike from January 14 if the government failed to come up with a concrete offer in response to their demands. “The direct recruitment for SMOs puts the in-service doctors at disadvantage and limits their career growth. Similarly, the in-service doctors should be given a fixed 40% quota in PG courses to provide them a level playing field. Also, creation of a specialist cadre would ensure that the doctors hired under the cadre are not diverted to other duties,” said Mr. Singh. The civil hospitals and the community healthcare centres in the State witnessed long queues of distraught patients all through the day with the OPD services not running.

Talking to reporters on Tuesday the State unit Shiv Sena president M. Tombi said, “There are four or five politicians in most of the constituencies who are hopeful of getting a BJP ticket. Those who are denied the same will revolt. Is the BJP leadership fully prepared to cope with such a situation?” Some such politicians had declared that those who miss out on tickets shall not extend cooperation to the ticket winners. He recalled that Manipur has already seen three killings using sophisticated guns and many others had sustained life-changing bullet injuries. Long before the allotment of the party tickets, BJP members had allegedly resorted to violence in Bishnupur district. Shots were fired during the scuffle. The party had organised an internal meeting for opinion polls to single out the politicians who have the best chance to get elected. However, there were objections on several issues including the voters’ list of the eligible office bearers. During the pandemonium some office bearers ran out. Mr. Tombi said, “The party which is sowing the seeds for clashes cannot ensure peace in the State. It is surprising that the BJP is grooming some politicians even in those constituencies which have BJP MLAs”. So far three persons had been shot dead and many others wounded. He demanded that the government take steps to contain lawlessness. Meanwhile, official sources said all gun owners who have not deposited their licensed guns despite government order have been asked to do so at the earliest. Official orders said guns found after the last date, would be treated as illegal weapons.  The party which is sowing the seeds for clashes cannot ensure peace M.

The work was earlier affected as the farmers faced difficulty in getting bank loans. The Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation has allotted 722 MW plants to 623 farmers under the KUSUM scheme. The Centre’s PM-KUSUM (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan) Scheme envisages income generation for farmers from their infertile land with the establishment of solar power plants. While the farmers can sell the power generated from the solar plants to power distribution companies, the solar pumps can also be installed for irrigation of farmlands. Rajasthan became the first State to complete the selection of farmers for installation of solar plants on their land in July 2021 with the capacity exceeding the targets set by the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. 11 plants installed Additional Chief Secretary (Energy) Subodh Agarwal said here on Tuesday that 11 of these plants had so far been installed in the State. “The loans to be sanctioned without collateral security for the solar plants of half kilowatt to 2 MW will speed up the work and help achieve the targets set in the renewable energy sector,” Mr. Agarwal said. Mr. Agarwal said the electricity generated at the solar plants would be purchased at Rs. 3.14 per unit for 25 years following the signing of power purchase agreements. The discoms will deposit the loan instalments directly with the banks and the remainder amount in the bank accounts of farmers. The farmers who do not have money to invest can lease out their land to private developers and receive an annual income. The availability of power near the sub-stations will also help reduce transmission losses as well as expenses for expansion of infrastructure of discoms. The Congress government in the State had adopted the solar energy and the wind and hybrid energy policies in December 2019 with the plans to develop a capacity of 38,000 MW renewable energy. Energy security Mr. Aggarwal said the KUSUM scheme would ensure energy security for farmers, as they could generate revenue from their barren lands. It would also later provide for solarisation of tubewells and lift irrigation projects of the government sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/solar-power-all-set-to-brighten-lives-of-farmers/article38245820.ece

Justice Dinesh Mehta of the Jodhpur Bench of the High Court asked the NTA on a plea by Pakistani immigrant Sandeep Kumar. Mr. Kumar had moved the High Court saying he was denied a seat in a medical college despite securing 80% marks in NEET because his LTV has expired and was awaiting renewal by Pakistan for long. While asking the NTA to admit Mr. Kumar to a medical college, the Bench ruled that the validity of his admission will depend on the outcome of his petition. Mr. Kumar had submitted that he was a Pakistani national and had come to India with his parents and siblings in 2011 through a valid passport under the LTV. He submitted to the court that his visa had expired in October 2017 and a request to extend his visa has been pending since then. During the previous hearing in August last year, Mr. Kumar had expressed his desire before the court to appear in the NEET exam but was apprehensive that his application may be rejected for want of LTV. The court had then asked the NTA Director and the Convener, the Rajasthan NEET-UG Admission Board, Jaipur, to accept his examination form. In its hearing on Tuesday, the court also gave Additional Solicitor General Mukesh Rajpurohit four weeks to submit his reply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/give-provisional-admission-to-pak-immigrant-says-high-court/article38246026.ece

If at all Ms. Mayawati later decides to contest, the call would be taken by her, he said.  The BSP is contesting in all 403 seats in the State. Mr. Misra added he will also not contest the State elections, which will be held in seven phases starting from February 10. Since elections are being held in five States, including Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, the BSP president will not contest the polls and help party candidates win, he said. Later, he told PTI, “The decision of the party for now is that Mayawati ji and I will not fight the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election. However, future decisions will be taken by Mayawati ji herself.” Ms. Mayawati is neither a legislator nor an MP. Mr. Misra is a Rajya Sabha member. The BSP has decided to contest all the 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh alone. It has entered into an alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab. Over poll surveys claiming that the BSP is already ‘out of the race’ for power in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Misra claimed his party will form the government in the State and Mayawati will take over as the Chief Minister for the fifth time.  The BSP is trying to revive its 2007 winning formula of Dalit-Brahmin combination in the State. As part of their time-tested social engineering, Mr. Misra has been criss-crossing Uttar Pradesh to promote bhaichara (brotherhood) among the Dalits and the Brahmins.

Bishnoi belongs to a lower middle class family; his father is a staunch Congress supporter while his grandfather was a supporter of a Communist leader, the family said. Hailing from Nagaur in Rajasthan, the family now based in Assam, is facing the heat after Niraj’s arrest. His sister who’s pursuing law and did not wish to be named, claimed that her brother hadn’t created the application against Muslim women but against those posting messages against Ram Mandir.  “My brother had created the application but it wasn’t anti-Muslim. The application was self-generating and was coded in a way that names and pictures of those posting against Ram Mandir would pop up as ‘Bulli Bai of the day’,” she told The Hindu, adding that there was “no auctioning” of women like it was in ‘Sulli Deals’ application.  “The word ‘deal’ wasn’t used in this app. It featured women. And I understand that it would enrage any woman whose photo would feature there,” she said. A senior police officer, however, denied the sister’s theory of coding, and said Niraj had coded the application in a way that it would throw up names of one of the 102 Muslim women whose names had been fed by him into the app. The family said that as the word spread back in the villages in Rajasthan and Assam, people started believing that Niraj was trafficking in women. “Someone told my mother that Niraj was buying women for Rs. 2 lakh each and selling them for Rs. 4 lakh. Now what should I tell her? She fell sick and was hospitalised,” claimed Niraj’s father Dasrath Bishnoi. Four of Mr. Dasrath’s brothers are still based in Rajasthan, including two who are Army officers. Mr. Dasrath was brought to Assam by his maternal uncle in 1986 when he was in his early teens and after studying for two years, he started working with his uncle. Ten years later, in 1996, he opened his own grocery store in Jorhat. Talking about his own political views and that of his father, which he is sure have not influenced his son, Mr. Dasrath said that his father, who used to reside in Rajasthan with his brothers and passed away in 2012, used to support a Communist leader. “I have always been a supporter of the Indian National Congress,” he said. “My son is an introvert and is very sensitive I feel. The politicians and TV news show anchors should speak responsibly. They don’t know who might get influenced by their words,” the father said. Niraj was arrested by the Delhi Police Special Cell for creating the ‘Bulli Bai’ application – a crime he has admitted to committing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bishnoi-a-radicalised-lone-wolf/article38245809.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 04:13 IST,||Most serious patients unvaccinated: doctors||As the pandemic is peaking, most COVID-19 patients on ventilator beds or oxygen support in two city hospitals are unvaccinated, said doctors. The situation, however, is different in some other hospitals. In Lok Nayak Hospital, of the nine patients on ventilator beds on Tuesday, four were unvaccinated, two were partially vaccinated and only one was fully vaccinated. The vaccination status of two were unknown. In Holy Family Hospital, of the nine patients either on ventilator or oxygen support, six were unvaccinated, two were partially vaccinated and all of them were above 50 years of age. Sumit Ray, head of the Department of Critical Care at Holy Family Hospital, said: “One of the nine patients is fully vaccinated, but has been undergoing chemotherapy. Also, all four patients on the ventilator are unvaccinated. Most with serious illness are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.” Of the nine patients, seven were above 60 years of age and two were above 55, added Dr. Ray. But all eight patients on ventilator beds in Ganga Ram Hospital were fully vaccinated, said S.P. Byotra, Head of Department of Internal Medicine at the hospital. Deputy Medical Director of Lok Nayak Hospital, Ritu Saxena, said all the nine patients on ventilator beds at the hospital have comorbidities. The situation is similar in his hospital, said Dr. Byotra. “All patients on ventilator beds have comorbidities. They have kidney disease or heart disease and it is primarily due to these conditions that they are on ventilators,” he added. In Aakash Healthcare, all 13 people in ICU have taken either the first or second dose of the vaccine. “Twelve of them need only minimal oxygen supply and all of them have comorbidities. One does not even require oxygen support,” said Kousar Shah Ali, COO of Aakash Healthcare. 23 deaths Meanwhile, the upward trend in cases continued with the test positive rate (TRP) increasing to 25.65%, which is the highest in about seven months, according to a government bulletin. With a fall in tests compared to Sunday, the number of fresh cases in 24 hours was 21,259, which is less than 22,751 on Sunday. But twenty-three new COVID-19-related deaths were reported in 24 hours — the highest in the current wave — taking the total deaths to 25,200. The number of active cases has also shot to 74,881 from 65,806 a day earlier. But the rate of increase of both TRP and new cases have slowed down over the past three days compared to last week when the daily spike in new cases was as high as 94.5%. For instance, the TRP was 25.65%, 25% and 23.53 % on Tuesday, Monday, and Sunday respectively. Noting that there have been 70 deaths since the last week of December, the government issued an advisory to hospitals, directing them to ensure that specialists attend to COVID-19 patients with comorbidities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/most-serious-patients-unvaccinated-doctors/article38245802.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 04:13 IST,||Two years on, chargesheet in Delhi riots case says ‘no evidence’ against BJP leader||Nearly two years after Nisar Ahmed, a Delhi riots victim, filed a complaint regarding vandalism and ransacking of his house and shop in north-east Delhi’s Bhagirathi Vihar, Delhi Police has said that it has found “no sufficient evidence” against BJP leader Kanhaiya Lal, one of the accused in the case. Mr. Ahmed had also alleged that burqa-clad women were being killed and thrown into the Bhagirathi drain. In a chargesheet filed in Mr. Ahmed’s case before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg, police have kept Mr. Lal, a BJP councillor from east Delhi’s Johripur ward, in column 12. Column 12 in a chargesheet means that there is not enough evidence to make a person an accused in a case. Another accused, Mukesh Masterji, has also been kept in column 12. “The name of Kanhaiya Lal and Mukesh Masterji have been kept in column no. 12 of the chargesheet, as no sufficient evidence has come on cases filed against them. The hon’ble court may summon them for trial, if it thinks fit,” the chargesheet stated. Eight other accused have, however, been summoned through notices under several IPC sections pertaining to rioting, arson and criminal intimidation. Mr. Ahmed in his complaint said: “On February 24, 2020, at around 4 p.m., some locals started protesting in support of CAA and the accused persons, including Mr. Lal, purportedly started setting up mics and speakers in the locality and raised inflammatory slogans against Muslims. The crowd swelled to around 600 people and started randomly checking IDs of passers-by who if found to be a Muslim, were brutally beaten and thrown into the Bhagirathi Vihar drain.” The complainant alleged that repeated calls to the police went unanswered. The next day, a mob came to his house, vandalised his garment shop and ransacked his house. He and his family fled the place following the incident, he added. Mr. Ahmed initially claimed that the police told him to file an unnamed complaint but he refused to do so. He later filed a written complaint naming all the accused at the Gokalpuri police station. “Mr. Lal attempted to intimidate and get the applicant to change his statement,” the complaint stated. Thereafter, Mr. Ahmed allegedly started receiving threat calls from Mr. Lal and other accused asking him to withdraw the case. Mr. Ahmed was also provided with witness protection as he is a key witness in several other cases. He received a copy of the FIR only three months later after moving the Delhi High Court. Complaint merged However, his complaint was merged into an unnamed FIR of one Aas Mohammad regarding burning and looting of his property. A magistrate’s court had in October 2020 pulled up the police for clubbing the complaints into a single FIR and ordered them to file an FIR in his case. Police had challenged the order before a sessions court through a revision petition. The sessions court too had rapped the police stating that there was “complete lack of supervision” and FIRs had been clubbed “to protect the accused”. A separate FIR was then registered in July last year against all the 10 accused. Mr. Ahmed’s lawyer, M.R. Shamshad, has moved a protest application challenging the removal of Mr. Lal and Mr. Mukesh under the penal charges.  Mr. Ahmed told The Hindu : “Mr. Lal led the mob which vandalised my house and shop and gave anti-Muslim speeches, my family and I are eyewitnesses … how can they give him a clean chit? I hope the court takes note of our protest petition.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/two-years-on-chargesheet-in-delhi-riots-case-says-no-evidence-against-bjp-leader/article38245797.ece

The proposal to introduce the CU-CET, which is also held by the NTA, has been placed as an additional item on the agenda of the Academic Council meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Students and teachers of the university, however, said that the proposal to change the entrance examination format is being placed without any deliberation and discussion with the JNU community. They also accused Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar of “bulldozing” the decision in the AC meeting conducted online. The NTA has been assigned the task of conducting the CU-CET as a single window opportunity for students seeking admission to both undergraduate/integrated and postgraduate programmes at participating universities/institute(s) across the country. Currently, 12 Central universities hold their admissions using the CU-CET. Delhi University has also recently expressed its intent to adopt the CU-CET. The teachers said for the AC meeting on Wednesday, the extra agenda item was circulated just two days before, leaving no time for discussions. They also said that it has failed to consider the multidisciplinary courses offered by JNU that are not common with other universities and require a unique admission process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/jnu-mulls-changing-entrance-exam-format-for-admissions/article38245805.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 04:13 IST,||Umar Khalid referred to web series to create a perception, court told||Former Jawaharlal Nehru University student leader Umar Khalid was “trying to create a perception” by referring to web series like “ Family Man “ and “ Trial of Chicago 7 ” and did not want to argue on the legal merits of the case, the prosecution told a Delhi court on Tuesday. It was arguing against his bail in the “larger conspiracy” case pertaining to the north-east Delhi riots under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.  Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that the fact that Mr. Khalid wanted to equate his trial in the case to the web series was “very unfortunate”.  “When you have nothing on merits, you want a media trial and create headlines…you want to create a perception,” Mr. Prasad said. “You don’t refer to the web series ‘ Grahan ’ which pertains to the 1984 riots.”   He said when law is being argued in the hearings, it doesn’t get covered but “when ‘ Family Man ’ is argued, then everything gets covered”. “You don’t want to argue anything on law, but you want to argue on something which is relevant in media,” Mr. Prasad told the court.  Taking exception to Mr. Khalid’s argument that the police and the investigating officer were “communal”, the prosecution said the probe agency was not of a particular person but it was a State. “The first conviction in the riots case was that of a Hindu,” Mr. Prasad said.  The prosecution said Mr. Khalid was part of a conspiracy whose main objective was to “ sarkar ko ghutne par laana hain ( bring the government to its knees)”.  “The ultimate object of rioters was to overawe the government and undermine the authority of the government which enacted the Citizenship [Amendment] Act and to destabilise the democracy,” Mr. Prasad said.  Mr. Khalid, through his advocate Trideep Pais, earlier argued that he had no role to play in the conspiracy and had merely sent a few messages on the Delhi Protest Support Group’s WhatsApp group.  To this, Mr. Prasad, while referring to Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, said it was not a crime to purchase a battery in Nalini’s (convict) case. “The north-east Delhi riots were not spontaneous. This fact has also been appreciated by the High Court,” he said. The prosecution will further argue against the bail next on January 24 and 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/umar-khalid-referred-to-web-series-to-create-a-perception-court-told/article38245804.ece

Also, there is an increase in the sub-lineages of Delta too,” the official said. Of the 675 samples, whose genome sequencing was done from January 1-9, 82% showed Omicron variant of the virus and 14% was Delta and its sub-lineages. “Of this 14%, about 50% are sub-lineages of Delta. These sub-lineages are the ones like Delta plus that was seen earlier,” the official said. Jugal Kishore, head of the Community Medicine Department at Safdarjung Hospital, said that the Omicron was not a big worry as it was causing a mild infection. The Delhi government is currently not sending all positive COVID-19 samples for genome sequencing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/city-witnessing-steady-rise-in-omicron-variant/article38245801.ece

According to sources present in the meeting, Mr. Baijal said despite COVID-19 restrictions, people’s involvement on the occasion of India’s 75 years of Independence through innovative ways would be befitting. Mr. Baijal advised officials to document the events in the form of electronic and physical booklets and publications. Achieving the goal of 100% digital delivery of government services in Delhi by August 2023, when the celebrations would conclude, should become part of the initiative, the L-G said. He also said that he would take up the matter with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for seamless implementation. He instructed the archives department and the commissioners of the municipal corporations to identify the monuments not already under the ambit of the Archaeological Survey of India and the localities associated with unsung freedom fighters and undertake their maintenance and conservation.

It is a landmark housing rights scheme, TMC leader Kiran Kandolkar said, adding that providing such rights was the Constitutional duty of any government and is interpreted as a fundamental right under Article 21. “Within 250 days of coming to power, the TMC will ensure all Goan families residing in the State before 1976 are given title and ownership rights of the land under their possession. We also plan to give 50,000 subsidised homes to the homeless,” Mr. Kandolkar said.

Many truckers, stranded on the highway for the past several days, blamed the traffic management authorities for not allowing them to move on, causing them huge financial losses as perishable goods they carry have been damaged. The highway was closed for traffic due to a landslide in the Mehar area of Ramban, the official sources said. Work was on to clear the highway of the debris and shooting stones, which pose a grave danger to the lives of the people, they said. Massive traffic jams were seen at many places on the highway. The 270-km Jammu-Srinagar national highway was reopened for traffic on Monday after it remained closed for the past three days owing to heavy snowfall and multiple landslides. While passenger vehicles and some vehicles carrying essentials were allowed to move towards the Kashmir Valley on Monday, others remained stranded on the stretch. Some vehicle owners protested over their halt on the highway and said the perishable items in their vehicles have destroyed. “We have been stranded on the highway for the past five days. We are carrying vegetables and most of them have perished. If they can allow vehicles carrying chicken, why have they halted vehicles carrying vegetables. It has caused us a grave loss,” a trucker, Sadiq, told reporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/srinagar-highway-closed-after-fresh-landslides/article38246036.ece

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:46 IST,||Lockdown in China amid Omicron fears||Several cities in China have locked down hundreds of thousands of their residents and carried out mass testing amid concerns that the spread of the Omicron variant could threaten the country’s “zero COVID” strategy. Cities in central Henan province as well as the municipality of Tianjin in the north, near Beijing, have reported local spread of Omicron cases, prompting the sweeping measures. The timing is of particular concern for China’s authorities with both the Winter Olympics in Beijing and the annual Chinese new year holiday in the first week of February. Henan accounted for most of the 110 new local cases reported in China on Monday – a high number for a country following a “zero COVID” approach including continued restrictions on international travel for close to two years – with the rest in Tianjin and in northwestern Shaanxi. Xi’an, the capital of Shaanxi, had been the epicentre of an outbreak in December, reporting 2,000 cases in recent weeks, prompting days of a strict lockdown. Residents in recent weeks took to social media to complain of food shortages as well as medical treatment being denied for other illnesses because of the stringent measures. After a pregnant woman posted on social media saying she had lost her baby after being prevented entry into a hospital, authorities moved to sack local officials and instructed hospitals to accept patients, as many residents questioned the costs of all-out containment. The situation in Xi’an has since somewhat eased and after weeks of a lockdown, Xi’an reported 13 cases on Monday, with the focus now shifting to Henan in central China. The concern in Henan and Tianjin is because the Omicron variant has been detected in the community. Zhengzhou, Henan’s capital, on Monday closed schools and carried out mass testing. At least two Omicron cases have been reported in Henan with the number expected to rise. Fresh restrictions On Tuesday, Hong Kong, which last week put in place a 6 p.m. curfew for dining venues, announced fresh restrictions citing community transmission, although the Special Administrative Region only reported 21 cases on Tuesday, of which 13 were imported. Nevertheless, because of the continuing “zero COVID” approach in Hong Kong, the city moved to close kindergartens and primary schools after three children tested positive, having been infected by their parents. The latest cases in Hong Kong have also triggered a political controversy after as many as a dozen senior government officials as well as 20 lawmakers last week attended a birthday party of 200 guests, with two attendees later testing positive. Senior officials, including the Home Secretary Caspar Tsui and the head of the police force, were among the dozens of guests subsequently sent to the government’s centralised quarantine facility in Penny’s Bay and were reprimanded by the government for attending the event.  Hong Kong has also announced a two-week suspension of flights from eight countries — India, Australia, the U.S., the U.K. Canada, France, Pakistan and the Philippines. On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Hong Kong will, starting January 15, also ban travellers from all “high risk” nations from transiting through Hong Kong airport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/lockdown-in-china-amid-omicron-fears/article38245553.ece

Speaking at a press conference, regional director Hans Kluge warned that the Omicron variant represented a “new west-to-east tidal wave sweeping across” the European region. 50 countries hit “At this rate, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) forecasts that more than 50% of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks,” Mr. Kluge told reporters. The WHO’s European region comprises 53 countries and territories including several in Central Asia, and Mr. Kluge noted that 50 of those countries had confirmed cases of the Omicron variant. According to the WHO, 26 of those countries reported that over 1% of their populations were “catching COVID-19 each week” as of January 10, and that the region had seen over seven million new virus cases reported in the first week of 2022 alone. Mr. Kluge said the “unprecedented scale of transmission” now meant countries were seeing rising hospitalisations from COVID-19, but added that mortality rates were still stable. The wave “is challenging health systems in many countries where Omicron has spread at speed,” Mr. Kluge lamented. A panel of WHO experts also warned that repeating booster doses of the original COVID vaccines is not a viable strategy against emerging variants and called for new jabs that better protect against transmission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/who-warns-of-virus-surge-in-europe/article38245555.ece

The “historic” procedure took place on Friday, the University of Maryland Medical School said, in a statement, on Monday. While the patient’s prognosis is far from certain, it represents a major milestone for animal to human transplantation. The patient, David Bennett, had been deemed ineligible for human transplant — a decision that is often taken when the recipient has very poor underlying health. He is now recovering and being carefully monitored to determine how the new organ performs. “It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” the Maryland resident said a day before the surgery. Mr. Bennett, who has spent the last several months bedridden on a heart-lung bypass machine, added: “I look forward to getting out of bed after I recover.” The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorisation for the surgery on New Year’s Eve, as a last ditch effort for a patient who was unsuitable for conventional transplant. ‘Breakthrough surgery’ “This was a breakthrough surgery and brings us one step closer to solving the organ shortage crisis,” said Bartley Griffith, who surgically transplanted the pig heart. “We are proceeding cautiously, but we are also optimistic that this first-in-the-world surgery will provide an important new option for patients in the future.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pigs-heart-beating-inside-human/article38245549.ece

Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko was speaking following Monday’s U.S.-Russia negotiations in Geneva that launched a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbour Ukraine. Moscow has demanded wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies, which in turn have threatened severe sanctions for any attack. A meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday. “It’s no exaggeration to say that a moment of truth is coming in our relations with the alliance,” Mr. Grushko was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. Moscow has demanded wide-ranging security guarantees from Washington and its NATO allies and insists it has been promised that NATO would not expand eastward. “Our expectations are entirely realistic and we hope that this will be a serious, deep conversation on key, fundamental problems of European security,” Mr. Grushko said, referring to the talks in Brussels. He said Russia would demand a comprehensive response from the alliance to its demands. “We will push for a concrete, substantive, article-by-article reaction to the Russian draft agreement on guarantees,” he added. In December, Russia unveiled proposals to contain the United States and NATO in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, saying that the U.S.-led alliance should not admit Ukraine or Georgia as new members. After more than seven hours of negotiations in Geneva on Monday, the Russian and U.S. officials both offered to keep talking, though there was not any breakthrough.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ties-with-nato-have-reached-a-moment-of-truth-russia/article38245548.ece

The talks were hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron with then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel also in attendance.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 00:00 IST,||Hate speech in the time of free speech||The rising frequency of hate speech in India has not gone unnoticed. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a petition on the events organised by the Hindu Yuva Vahini in Delhi and by Yati Narsinghanand in Haridwar on December 17 and 19, 2021, respectively, wherein calls to violence were made against Muslims. But the laws dealing with hate speech are ineffective and deficient. So, the Supreme Court has been asked to review hate speech laws and various High Courts have been called upon to provide interpretation of ingredients of hate speech. The lack of clear legislative guidance has meant that we are seeing discordant judicial outcomes. Nevertheless, this growing incidence of hate speeches, especially those targeting minorities, in combination with the judicial ambiguity has provided an opportunity to chart legislative reforms. Criminalising hate speech Hate speech is neither defined in the Indian legal framework nor can it be easily reduced to a standard definition due to the myriad forms it can take. Black’s Law Dictionary has defined it as “speech that carries no meaning other than the expression of hatred for some group, such as a particular race, especially in circumstances in which the communication is likely to provoke violence.” Building on this, the Supreme Court, in Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan v. Union of India (2014), described hate speech as “an effort to marginalise individuals based on their membership in a group” and one that “seeks to delegitimise group members in the eyes of the majority, reducing their social standing and acceptance within society.” The current legislative set-up has several provisions to criminalise offences which can be characterised as hate speech. The High Court of Karnataka, in Campaign Against Hate Speech v. The State of Karnataka (2020), was of the opinion that the Indian Penal Code illegalises speeches that are intended to promote enmity or prejudice the maintenance of harmony between different classes. Specifically, sections of the IPC, such as 153A, which penalises promotion of enmity between different groups; 153B, which punishes imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration; 505, which punishes rumours and news intended to promote communal enmity, and 295A, which criminalises insults to the religious beliefs of a class by words with deliberate or malicious intention, contribute to combating hate speeches. The Supreme Court has upheld the view that the objective behind such provisions is to “check fissiparous communal and separatist tendencies and secure fraternity so as to ensure the dignity of the individual and the unity of the nation”. The Supreme Court, in State of Karnataka v. Praveen Bhai Thogadia (2004), emphasised the need to sustain communal harmony to ensure the welfare of the people. In the Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan case, the Supreme Court underlined the impact hate speech can have on the targeted group’s ability to respond and how it can be a stimulus to further attacks. The Madras High Court has on several instances dealt with the issue of hate speech, characterising it as small spark capable of merely lighting a lamp to destroying a forest. In G. Thirumurugan Gandhi v. State (2019), the Madras High Court explained that hate speeches cause discord between classes and that responsibility attached to free speech should not be forgotten. Summing up these legal principles, in Amish Devgan v. Union of India (2020), the Supreme Court held that “hate speech has no redeeming or legitimate purpose other than hatred towards a particular group”. Despite judicial guidance from the Amish Devgan case, uncertainty around interpretation of hate speech has resulted in the adoption of varying standards. The Madras High Court, in Maridhas v. State (2021), quashed an FIR alleging hate speech involving targeting of minorities by holding that the ‘YouTuber’ is entitled to protection under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and distinguished this case from the application of the ‘Who? What? Where? test’ laid down in the Amish Devgan case. Per contra, the Madras High Court, in the case of Fr. P. George Ponnaiah v. Inspector of Police (2022), gave no relief to the petitioner by holding him to be a person of influence. By doing so, the High Court has failed to appreciate that a YouTuber with more than 4 lakh subscribers and a periodic record of publishing motivated content would have more influence than a priest with a limited audience from an isolated incident. It is trite that statements made by ‘persons with influence’ having the mere likelihood of breach of peace have to be construed to constitute hate speech. Unfortunately, divergent decisions from constitutional courts expose the lack of established legal standards in defining hate speech, especially those propagated via the digital medium. Policy prescriptions The Law Commission of India, in its 267th report, recommended the insertion of two new provisions to criminalise and punish the propagation of hate speech: Section 153C and Section 505A of IPC. Section 153C was drafted to cover an offence committed when any person uses threatening words which are intended to cause fear, or commends hatred for the purpose of inducing violence through words, spoken or written, visible representation or signs on the grounds of race, caste, religion, sex, gender identity and other characteristics. Section 505A was to include provisions penalising causing of fear, alarm, or provocation of violence. Furthermore, the 189th Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, in 2015, recommended the incorporation of separate and specific provisions in the Information Technology Act to deal with online hate speech. None of the recommendations have been acted upon and this has partly given rise to ambiguity in construing hate speech by various constitutional courts. Much of the existing penal provisions deal with hate speech belong to the pre-Internet era. The need of the hour is specialised legislation that will govern hate speech propagated via the Internet and, especially, social media. Reference can be drawn to the Australian federal law called the Criminal Code Amendment Act, 2019, which imposes liability upon Internet service providers if such persons are aware that any abhorrent violent material, which is defined to include material that a reasonable man would regard as offensive, is accessible through the service provided by them. Action commonly taken against modern-day hate speeches have a whack-a-mole effect wherein the underlying objective of inciting communal disharmony or hatred, despite the detention of the offender, survives through digital or social media platforms for eternity. Thus, taking cue from best international standards, it is important that specific and durable legislative provisions that combat hate speech, especially that which is propagated online and through social media, is enacted by amending the IPC and the Information Technology Act. Ultimately, this would be possible only when hate speech is recognised as a reasonable restriction to free speech. Manuraj Shunmugasundaram is Advocate, Madras High Court and Spokesperson, DMK.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 03:33 IST,||Treating the planet well can aid progress||The 2020 Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), titled “The Next Frontier – Human Development and the Anthropocene” (https://bit.ly/3qeEgE3) proposed a planetary pressure-adjusted Human Development Index (HDI). Ever since the UNDP took up computation of the HDI driven by the vision of Mahbub ul Haq and articulated by Amartya Sen in 1990, there have been adjustments such as inequality-adjusted HDI. Besides, there was computation of several other indices such as Gender Development Index, Gender Inequality Index, and Multidimensional Poverty Index to flag the issues that warranted the attention of policymakers. Human-induced change The environment is one such issue now considered to be an essential component to be factored in to measure human development. The concept of the planetary boundary was introduced by a group of scientists across the world, led by J. Rockström of the Stockholm Resilience Centre in 2009. This was to highlight that human-induced environmental change can irrevocably destabilise the long-term dynamics of the earth system, thereby disrupting the life-supporting system of the planet. Both global and local evidence indicate that biodiversity loss, climate change, land system/land-use change, disruption of biogeochemical cycles, and scarcity of freshwater availability are a threat and increase the vulnerability of society. The purpose of the planetary pressure adjusted HDI, or PHDI, is to communicate to the larger society the risk involved in continuing with existing practices in our resource use and environmental management, and the retarding effect that environmental stress can perpetuate on development. Impact on country rankings When planetary pressure is adjusted, the world average of HDI in 2019 came down from 0.737 to 0.683. This adjustment has been worked out by factoring per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emission (production), and per capita material footprint. The average per capita global CO2 emission (production) is 4.6 tonnes and the per capita material footprint is 12.3 tonnes. The global ranking of several countries was altered, in a positive and negative sense, with adjustment of planetary pressure. Switzerland is the only country in the group of high human development countries whose world rank has not changed with adjustment of planetary pressure, although the HDI value of 0.955 has come down to 0.825 after the necessary adjustment. Among 66 very high human development countries, 30 countries recorded a fall in rank values ranging from minus 1 for Germany and Montenegro to minus 131 for Luxembourg. It succinctly brings out the nature of planetary pressure generated by the developed countries and indirectly indicates their responsibility in combating the situation. In the case of India, the PHDI is 0.626 against an HDI of 0.645 with an average per capita CO2 emission (production) and material footprints of 2.0 tonnes and 4.6 tonnes, respectively. India gained in global rankings by eight points (131st rank under HDI and 123rd rank under PHDI), and its per capita carbon emission (production) and material footprint are well below the global average. Challenges in India, SDGs Nevertheless, India’s natural resource use is far from efficient, environmental problems are growing, and the onslaught on nature goes on unabated with little concern about its fallout — as evident from a number of ongoing and proposed projects. At the same time, India has 27.9% people under the Multidimensional Poverty Index ranging from 1.10% in Kerala to 52.50% in Bihar, and a sizable section of them directly depend on natural resources for their sustenance. Kerala has an exemplary achievement in human development with an HDI value of 0.775, well above the all-India average. However, on the environmental front there are several challenges which warrant concrete actions; otherwise, the gains of human development may not be sustained. The twin challenges of poverty alleviation and environmental safeguarding that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi first articulated in her lecture during the Stockholm conference on the human environment in 1972 still remain unattended. Fifty years have passed. There is little change in the scenario. In fact, the situation is much more complex now.  Since the Stockholm conference was held, there have been several summits and initiatives by the United Nations, the latest being the adoption of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) with a specific target to meet by 2030. The SDGs have acquired high priority in the context of the issue of climate change and its impact on society. Human-induced climate change has emerged as an important issue of global deliberations. The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2021 laid stress on limiting global temperature rise at the 1.5° C level and strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty. This was reaffirmed in the Conference of Parties (COP) 26 at Glasgow in 2021.  ‘No poverty’ and ‘Zero hunger’ are the first and second SDGs. According to NITI Aayog (2020-21), out of 100 points set for the grade of Achiever, India scored 60 (Performer grade, score 50-64) for no poverty and 47 (Aspirant grade, score 0-49) for zero hunger, with wide State-level variations. India’s score in the SDGs of 8, 9, and 12 (‘Decent work and economic growth’; ‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’ and ‘Responsible Consumption and Production’, respectively) — considered for working out planetary pressure — are 61 (performer), 55 (performer) and 74 (front runner), respectively. Better awareness now There are wide gaps in managing the environment. The Chipko movement (1973) in Uttarakhand and the Silent Valley movement (the late 1970s) in Kerala are two of the most well-known modern-day people’s movements for environmental protection in India that inspired several other environmental movements during the last five decades. Subsequently, there is now widespread awareness about the environment and several initiatives both at the level of the government and the community. However, standalone environmental safeguarding actions are not sufficient to navigate the Anthropocene (the “unofficial unit of geologic time to describe the most recent period in earth’s history when human activity started to have a significant impact on the planet’s climate and ecosystems”). It is now well established that there are interdependencies of earth system processes including social processes, and their relationships are non-linear and dialectic. Therefore, the central challenge is to nest human development including social and economic systems into the ecosystem, and biosphere building on a systematic approach to nature-based solutions that put people at the core. Local level involvement It is now essential to consider people and the planet as being a part of an interconnected social-ecological system. Social and environmental problems cannot be addressed in isolation anymore; an integrated perspective is necessary. This can be conceived and addressed at the local level, for which India has constitutional provisions in the form of the 73rd and 74th Amendments. The remarkable advances in earth system science and sustainability research along with enabling technology of remote sensing and geographic information system have helped to document and explain the impact of human activities at the ground level and stimulate new interdisciplinary work encompassing the natural and social sciences. They also provide insights into how to mitigate these impacts and improve life. What is required is a reorientation of the planning process, adoption of a decentralised approach, a plan for proper institutional arrangements, and steps to enable political decisions.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 03:45 IST,||Making a case for side hustling||Piyush, 32, works in an IT start-up in Bengaluru. He teaches data science on an online platform on weekends, and is also independently working on an AI initiative with a team of developers. His typical workday involves going to office from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., going to the gym to work out, and then working on his own initiative post dinner from 10 p.m to 12 a.m. He keeps what he does outside the work under wraps and talks about his life with a few friends at office in hushed tones. When a senior leader hears rumours, she avoids talking to Piyush because he is a good worker and she does not want to lose him. Like Piyush, there is a trend among employees to hold multiple jobs in the form of moonlighting, i.e., take up freelance projects or work on a part-time basis or start an entrepreneurial venture while holding a full-time day job. In a survey we conducted, we found that more than 45% of the respondents either themselves engaged in side hustling or knew of someone close who was hustling. Leaders in traditional organisations, however, either turn a blind eye to this or have hushed conversations with the employees to conform to the contracts signed. Assumptions and the reality Organisations have typically assumed that activities outside work may deplete individual resources, which could result in poorer performance at work. Thus, they ban employees from side hustling. Engagement in another paid activity is seen as a distraction, breach of contract, and leading to likely conflict of interest. It is common for organisations to have clauses in their employment contracts which restrict or prohibit having secondary sources of income. Organisations assume that side hustling is an attempt to make more money. However, when we asked side hustlers about their motivations for holding multiple jobs, their reasons ranged from seeking creative outlets to escaping from the mundaneness of their day jobs to learning new skills. It would be safe to say that the major drivers are non-pecuniary benefits that their full-time job is unable to cater to. Most also saw the side job as something that helped them be more motivated in their main jobs. They saw their side hustle as an investment in their own careers and life, as a route to their next change in job, and as security in case the organisation ran into difficulty. Several spoke of other benefits: they said the side job was a stress buster, added to their self-esteem and confidence, and helped them make good use of their free time. The opposing perceptions of organisations and employees and acknowledgement of the current context, where organisations are unable to promise lifelong employment, and the ubiquity of gig work, when juxtaposed, highlight the need for organisations to not look at side hustles as a zero-sum game. Having multiple jobs could have the potential for positive spillovers from one domain to the other. For instance, enhanced skills through side projects could be transferred on the job, leading to better performance at work; or a happy employee is likely to be more productive than one who is feeling trapped in the restrictive work contracts. Rather than look the other way to what employees do outside the organisation or keep forcing archaic contracts and rules, it would perhaps be better for organisations to adapt to make the most of the current reality. It may thus be wiser for organisations and leaders to recognise their own limitations in satisfying the entire gamut of needs of an employee. Denying employees’ requests for engaging in side activities might leave them disgruntled and unhappy, resulting in lesser commitment and engagement at work. Individuals with diverse needs Companies need to recognise that they don’t own the employee. It is best to accept that employees are not just employees but individuals with diverse needs, motivations, aspirations, and interests. Rather than create a system where employees are forced to hide what they do in their free time, perhaps it may be more appropriate to create a psychologically safe environment. It would, then, be possible to acknowledge that while the organisation accepts their other parts of work, boundary conditions of the organisation need to be met. Organisations can set boundaries around no use of company resources and proprietary information and time committed to the organisation. Such companies will have an edge over the others. It is time to recognise that stifling opportunities for employees to pursue their passions or building diverse skill sets not only puts the onus back on the organisation to manage the whole individual and his/her career and life but also leaves the employee with little agency.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 03:33 IST,||Young knights||A few days after he expectedly won his fifth World chess championship in a row, Magnus Carlsen suggested he might abdicate his crown — unless Alireza Firouzja qualifies as his challenger for the next World title. The Norwegian genius spoke of how the recent performances of the 18-year-old Iran-born French player motivated him. The teenager is now the frontrunner to be Carlsen’s rival for next year’s World title match. A few years later, an Indian could be facing the World champion across the chessboard in a title match, for the first time since 2014. It may be no exaggeration to say that India currently possesses the world’s most exciting group of chess prodigies. Players such as Arjun Erigaisi (18), Nihal Sarin (17), R. Praggnanandhaa (16), D. Gukesh (15) and Raunak Sadhwani (16) are capable of breaking into the elite of world chess. And there is much promise outside that bunch too, like Bharath Subramaniyam, who became India’s 73rd Grandmaster on Sunday, at the age of 14. The list of the world’s top juniors is a reasonable indicator of the future stars. In the latest list released by FIDE, five of the top 13 are Indians. Among the seniors, Viswanathan Anand continues to be the highest ranked Indian. The five-time World champion, who single-handedly revolutionised chess in the country, is the World No. 16. It is no mean feat considering Anand is 52 and keeping him company are six other Indians in the top 100. Among countries, India is ranked fifth. In the women’s list, Koneru Humpy is ranked third and Dronavalli Harika eleventh. Not many exceptional talents are coming through from among the junior girls, though. That is one deficiency the All India Chess Federation could look into. The federation also needs to do all it can to ensure that Indian chess retains its momentum. Never has it seen so many gifted youngsters making rapid strides on the global stage at the same time. That they are being trained, among others, by Anand is one of the most positive developments in Indian chess in recent times. Conducting a few top-tier tournaments that could pit India’s best against the world’s strongest, in addition to the large number of open events that are already there, is something the administrators have to do on a regular basis. At present, there is only one; and that too, thanks to Tata Steel. Chess has recently become more mainstream in India, and the huge increase in popularity of live streams of chess events suggests even better days are ahead. If there is a time to tap the huge potential of the game in the country where it originated 15 centuries ago, it is now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/young-knights/article38245406.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 03:46 IST,||Rot in the Malayalam film industry||Malayalam films are going places, with refreshingly new narratives and experiential filmmaking. But that belies the rot that has afflicted the industry, a glimpse of which came in view in 2017 when a popular woman actor bravely stood up against those who abducted and sexually assaulted her in Kochi. The investigation team soon reached for actor Dileep, who was booked on charges of conspiring to carry out the sexual assault. The case, tried in-camera, has since seen several twists and turns with an unsuccessful demand by the survivor for a change of judge and the resignation of two special prosecutors ostensibly miffed with the trial proceedings. A new case has also been launched against Mr. Dileep, in the wake of a flurry of allegations levelled by one of his former acquaintances, for threatening to harm the police officials probing the sexual assault case. Back in 2017, the outpouring of solidarity with the survivor was as pronounced as the misogynistic statements from members of the Malayalam film fraternity and the complicit silence of industry bigwigs. Standing with the survivor, a group of women working in Malayalam movies came together to form a ‘Women in Cinema Collective’ (WCC) with a vision for “equal spaces and equal opportunities for women in cinema” and sought the Chief Minister’s intervention to deal with issues of gender bias and workplace harassment in the industry. The move was widely welcomed when the government constituted a three-member committee headed by former High Court Judge K. Hema and comprising veteran actor Sharada and former civil servant K.B. Valsala Kumari to study the gamut of gender issues in the industry. The committee submitted its report in end-2019. It has been kept under wraps ever since. Two years later, the government’s cavalier disregard for the issues raised in it has riled many women. The culture department officials are reportedly poring over the committee findings and recommendations, but what will become of it is anybody’s guess. The government has been largely circumspect in its responses. Meanwhile, the contention that the report should remain confidential has angered many who had mustered the courage to depose before the committee to recount their horrific experiences. Actor Parvathy Thiruvothu minced no words in calling out the apathy and systemic oppression in the face of what now seems to be an endless wait for justice. Many skeletons such as the existence of sex racket-facilitators in the industry would tumble out if the report was released, she told a news channel. If an actor of her standing fears for her life, the magnitude of the threat is imaginable. Strikingly, disparity in compensation, an unsafe working environment, sly demand for sexual favours in return for work and denial of work if that’s unmet were some of the issues the women in the industry hoped would get addressed by way of an institutional mechanism, maybe a tribunal as in other industries, in the aftermath of the Hema Committee report. But speaking out has had its consequences, as several of them realised when made to face loss of livelihood. That’s one of the reasons many others have chosen to side with the eloquently silent and superstar-driven cine association that works more like a clique of domineering men. Neither the course of the assault case nor the fate of the Hema Committee report instils confidence in those who seek gender justice and parity in the film industry. But the fight will go on regardless, as the survivor of the assault, who, a few days ago, broke her five years of silence to thank those who stood by her in testing times, and the members of the WCC have pointed out. anandan.s@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rot-in-the-malayalam-film-industry/article38245419.ece

The petitioner, Mr. Prasannadas Patwari, had alleged that Mr. Yagnik had used the “religious symbol” of the “Cow and Calf” for furthering his election prospects and had therefore committed a corrupt practice. The court, rejecting the contention, referred to a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Ramanbhai Ashabhai versus Dabhai Ajitkumar where in the court had observed that any particular object, bird or animal could be regarded as a symbol of Hindu religion. The court held that though in India a high spiritual and mystical significance was attached, a pictoral representation of a cow or a calf did not symbolise the religion. The court said that it was not possible to say that by looking at the picture of cow and calf, the whole religious concept was evoked in the mind of the viewer. Even in common experience it was seen that cows were grossly neglected by Hindus and they were left strolling on the roads seeking food from garbage, the court said. If the cows with their ribs and bones projecting out did not evoke any religious sentiments or a protest on the grounds of religion, it was difficult to say that a mere picture of a calf and cow would, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cow-and-calf-not-religious-symbol/article38245414.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:46 IST,||Govt. set to hold 35.8% in Vodafone Idea||The board of directors of Vodafone Idea Ltd. late on Monday approved the conversion of interest — related to spectrum auction instalments and on AGR (adjusted gross revenue) dues to the government — into equity. This means that after conversion, the government would own 35.8% of the telecom carrier. This is as per a scheme offered by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for settlement of dues. “The Net Present Value (NPV) of this interest [on spectrum auction instalments and AGR dues] is expected to be about Rs. 16,000 crore as per the company’s best estimates, subject to confirmation by the DoT,” Vodafone Idea said in a filing. “Since the average price of the company’s shares at the relevant date of 14.08.2021 was below par value, the equity shares will be issued to the government at par value of Rs. 10 per share, subject to final confirmation by the DoT.” The conversion will result in dilution to all existing shareholders, including promoters. “Following conversion... promoter shareholders would hold around 28.5% (Vodafone Group) and around 17.8% (Aditya Birla Group), respectively,” it added. In light of the conversion of interest into equity, the company added, the promoters had mutually agreed to amend the existing Shareholders’ Agreement for “reducing the minimum qualifying threshold from 21% to 13% for the purpose of exercising certain governing rights, such as appointment of directors and of certain key officials”. Earlier, the DoT had provided various options to the company, including deferring payment of Spectrum Auction Instalments due up to four years, excluding the instalments due in respect of Spectrum Auction 2021; one-time opportunity to opt for deferment of AGR related dues as determined by the Supreme Court in the AGR case, by a period of four years with immediate effect; one-time opportunity to exercise the option of paying interest for the four years of deferment on the deferred spectrum instalments and AGR dues via conversion into equity of the NPV of the interest amount. In October, the telco had opted for deferment of spectrum auction instalments and of AGR-related dues. Shares slide On Tuesday, shares of Vodafone Idea plummeted to 21% to Rs. 11.80 on the BSE. Separately, Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) on Tuesday said it would opt for conversion of interest related to AGR dues into equity and that post-conversion, the Centre’s holding in the telco is expected to be about 9.5%. The NPV of the interest amount is about Rs. 850 crore, the company said in a filing.

India and the U.S. have had a number of persistent challenges in their bilateral trade relationship, including in agricultural trade. “India’s agreement to allow U.S. pork imports for the first time is great news for U.S. producers and for Indian consumers,” U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai said via a statement on Monday in Washington. Ms. Tai had met Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal to renew the TPF.  Days ago, The Hindu had reported that India would resume the export of mangoes and pomegranates to the U.S., under a new agreement signed by the two countries, also a result of the TPF engagement.  “This new opportunity marks the culmination of nearly two decades of work to gain market access for U.S. pork to India — and it signals positive movement in U.S.-India trade relations,” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in the joint statement with Ms. Tai. Mr. Vilsack said the imports would begin “as soon as possible.” The U.S. is the world’s third-largest pork producer and the second-largest exporter, as per U.S. government estimates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-agrees-to-allow-import-of-us-pork-products-says-tai/article38245391.ece

This excludes companies in financial services and oil and gas. “This marks the first year-on-year decline in 12 quarters,” Crisil said in the report. “As many as 27 of 40 sectors tracked by Crisil Research are likely to see their EBIDITA margins shrinking,” Crisil added. However, revenue momentum was sustained, driven by price increases rather than volume growth, it said. Consumer sector Margins in the consumer discretionary sector likely fell 130-150 bps year-on-year, while in export-linked sector the drop is believed to be between 200-250 bps. Information technology services likely saw margins contract 230-250 bps due to increased sub-contracting, while steel products and pharmaceuticals may log a contraction of 110-130 bps each due to rising input costs, according to the report. Costs not passed on “Companies were unable to fully pass on soaring input costs, especially key metals and energy prices,” said Hetal Gandhi, director, Crisil Research. “Flat steel prices were 48% higher year-on-year in the third quarter, while aluminium was up 41%.” “The price of Brent crude surged nearly 79%, while those of spot gas and coking coal rocketed almost 5.4 and 2.4 [times], respectively, year-on-year,” she said.

Inflation expectations play a vital role in regulating households’ consumption behaviour and consequent savings, said the paper titled ‘Taking Cognisance of Households’ Inflation Expectations in India’. The paper is authored by Devendra Pratap Singh, Aditya Mishra and Purnima Shaw of the RBI. The findings of the paper are of the authors and not of the RBI, the authors said. Especially in the case of a developing economy, it is desirable for households to save in financial instruments like debt or equity, which can be used further into production-enhancing activities, they said in the paper. If households expect inflation to pick up in the medium term and they suspect low returns due to low real interest rates, it may be preferable for them to invest in commodities such as precious metals, jewellery and the like, than saving in term deposits, they said. The authors said that similar to India, inflation expectations are biased and not efficient in other countries too, such as the US, England, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, Czech Republic, Philippines and Russia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/households-expecting-higher-inflation-affects-bank-savings/article38245386.ece

In its latest retail business survey, RAI said the sector witnessed 26% growth last month from a year earlier.. “Retail business was on a steady growth trajectory during most of December, however, the pace of growth was seen dropping off significantly towards the last week of December due to the fresh sets of curbs imposed in most parts of the country owing to the third wave of the pandemic,” RAI CEO Kumar Rajagopalan said in a statement. The impact can be seen at the category level, with the beauty, wellness and personal care segment dipping 7%, compared with December 2019 sales, RAI said. It also said it had appealed to the Centre to instruct States to refrain from imposing curbs based on positivity rate and consider hospitalisations as the criteria to determine restrictions instead, as most of the population is vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/retail-sales-rise-7-over-pre-pandemic-level-rai/article38245388.ece

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:45 IST,||New Zealand squares series||Ross Taylor ended his 15-year Test career by taking a wicket with his part-time off-breaks that clinched victory for New Zealand over Bangladesh by an innings and 117 runs and tied the two-match series here on Tuesday. In dimming light and with Bangladesh nine wickets down, the crowd at the Hagley Oval began baying for Taylor, the 37-year-old batter retiring from Test cricket after his 112th match. When the light became too poor for the quicks, New Zealand captain Tom Latham bowed to the crowd’s demand and Taylor’s third ball brought a false shot from Ebadot Hossain, who skied to Latham. A defiant 102 by wicketkeeper Liton Das made Bangladesh a hard nut to crack, forcing a match which many thought would be over quickly into the final session of the third day before the last wicket fell 20 minutes from scheduled stumps. Das batted almost one-handed for much of his innings after being struck on the glove. He weathered a barrage of short-pitched bowling to post his second Test century, off only 106 balls. Bangladesh rallied around his resilient example to keep New Zealand waiting, but the end came swiftly after his departure as the tourists were dismissed for 278. A slice of history It was significant that the final catch was taken by Latham as the captain had an outsized influence on this match. He scored 252 — his second Test double century — in New Zealand’s first innings of 521 for six declared, then took six catches as Bangladesh was bowled out for 126 and 278 after the follow-on was enforced. In doing so, Latham became the first player in Test history to score 250 and take six catches in the same match.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/new-zealand-squares-series/article38245664.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:50 IST,||Kohli-Rabada contest lights up the opening day at Newlands||Batting was challenging. There was a cloud cover, the pitch sported grass and the surface offered seam movement and bounce. In these conditions, Virat Kohli reserved his best. His 79 of character sparkled in India’s total of 223 after the side elected to bat. India hit back with Jasprit Bumrah who moved the ball across the left-handed Dean Elgar to have him caught at first slip. A big strike. At stumps on day one of the third Freedom Test at Newlands on Tuesday, South Africa was 17 for one. The decider on the boil. Kohli walked in early, at 33 for two, after the fall of Mayank Agarwal’s wicket in the 13th over and was the ninth batter dismissed at 211 when Kagiso Rabada snared him outside off. Kohli began by cover-driving left-armer Marco Jansen. He did not desert a shot that has given him so many runs. Kohli, however, was conscious about which deliveries to play the stroke. Fascinating match-up The match-up between Kohli and Rabada, in his 50th Test, was fascinating. Rabada fired one inches outside off, Kohli left it alone. When Rabada pitched it up, Kohli cover-drove, When he erred in line, Kohli worked him off his hips. Kohli’s game had footwork, balance and timing — the three key ingredients that define batting. And the manner in which Kohli leaned into his off and cover drives, executed the on drive, essayed the flick and drove the ball straight. was exemplary. He defended with assurance and found the gaps with a surgeon’s precision. India was jolted at the start. K.L. Rahul, made to play deliveries a lot closer to his off-stump, succumbed to a Duanne Olivier ball that landed short and bounced around his off-stump. Rabada, bowling a teasing line, got Mayank Agarwal to edge one around the off-stump to the cordon. Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli began rebuilding the innings. Pujara, mixing caution with aggression, held firm. Between periods of solid defence, he pulled Olivier past the ropes, and then flicked and glanced Lungi Ngidi for boundaries. It took some smart bowling from Jansen after lunch to end Pujara’s (43) determined tenure. The versatile left-armer switched to round the wicket and brought the delivery into the right-hander with the angle. Ajinkya Rahane did not last long, done in by a fuller delivery from Rabada that held its line and found the edge. Interestingly, Rahane reviewed but replays confirmed the nick. Rishabh Pant gave Kohli support and applied himself. The ‘conversation’ the team management had with him appeared to have worked. The southpaw was not stroke-less but batted more responsibly. A backfoot punch through covers and a pull off Rabada stood out. Pant (27) added 51 valuable runs with Kohli for the fifth wicket when he, attempting to glide a Jansen delivery of extra bounce, ended playing into wide gully’s hands. R. Ashwin did not last long, edging a delivery angled across from Jansen. If you ‘feel’ for these balls, you are in trouble. Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, finally seeing some action, had Shardul Thakur taken low by Keegan Petersen at short-cover. Replays confirmed the catch was clean. The Indian innings was wrapped up soon. In his milestone Test, the reliable Rabada scalped four. And the impressive Jansen took three.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-rabada-contest-lights-up-the-opening-day-at-newlands/article38245625.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:46 IST,||On-field uncertainty is welcome, off-field it can be troubling||These are stimulating days for Test cricket. In New Zealand, Bangladesh win their first Test there for perhaps the most historically significant recent event. And in South Africa, just when the question, ‘how can this Indian team be beaten?’ was being asked, the hosts show how. The Ashes meanwhile is no whitewash, England’s last-wicket pair hanging on to ensure that. Bangladesh lost the following Test by an innings, England might revert to type in the final Test and India could well show South Africa who is boss in the decider in Cape Town. But no matter. For a few brief shining moments, the underdogs had caused a surprise and made us feel good about ourselves. The off-field uncertainty thanks to Covid-19 might be troubling, but the uncertainty on-field, the unexpectedness, is the bedrock of competitive sport. The race is not always to the swift etc. Does Australia’s Ashes win mean that their cricketers are now forgiven for their boorish behaviour and for bringing the game into disrepute with their entitled conduct in South Africa not so long ago? Steve Smith, captain when some players used unfair tactics (‘Sandpapergate’), who was then banned was back as captain for a Test when Pat Cummins had to pull out. But it is more interesting than that. Change of image  Australia are a proud sporting nation, and nothing gives them greater pride than thrashing England at cricket. Under new skipper Cummins, they have not only done that, they have also looked un-Australian (in a good way) by being mostly well-mannered and applauding their opponents. Perhaps this has confused England more than their bowling has! As the writer Greg Baum has pointed out, Australians have subtly moved away from the ‘hard but fair’ formulation of the past which had suggested these terms were mutually exclusive, and are playing hard and fair. If so, it is a commentary to the effect a captain can have on a team.  Eliminating racism In South Africa, the Social Justice and Nation-Building (SJN) Commission, in a 235-page report concluded that Cricket South Africa’s administration, its current director Graeme Smith, head coach Mark Boucher and AB de Villiers all engaged in racially prejudiced conduct. Institutional racism is a biggie that the former apartheid country has been dealing with for decades now, and if the Commission is to be believed, it is taking time to eliminate it fully. I remember Omar Henry, the first modern player of colour to play for South Africa, sitting leaning against a wall outside the stadium after a day’s play in a Test back in the 1992-93 series. “I am waiting for my son to pick me up,” he said, and when I asked him about the team bus he went silent. I hadn’t fully understood the implications then. Many of the later players have gone public with their stories since. Institutional racism is also what England’s First Class player Azeem Rafiq’s televised responses to a committee brought to the fore. Majoritarianism isn’t unique to cricket teams, it is a failing with governments and nations too. It is convenient to point out that till the big picture is corrected, the smaller pictures will remain askew. But it can be argued that sorting out the problem at different different levels — sporting, cultural, literary, educational — can be a way of clearing up the big picture too. In the short-term, cricket has to deal with Covid-19. It has done rather well here with bubbles, quarantines, safety requirements and the cooperation of the majority of the stake-holders, from players to spectators. In the long-term, however, there are issues like player behaviour, racism, and — this following the revelation by Australian youth cricketer Jamie Mitchell that he was sexually abused by an official on a tour — predatory behaviour by coaches and officials. There is something about the pandemic that encourages introspection either as an individual, or, as in this case, a sport. What we once thought unimportant becomes significant, and what was once believed to be of no consequence assumes greater proportions. If player behaviour at the Ashes has come as a surprise, it might have to do with the fact that the rival captains Joe Root and Cummins are essentially non-confrontational men; the Australian has said he would rather keep the energy for his bowling. Respect for opponent It does take two hands to clap. John McEnroe, the one-time bad boy of tennis never behaved badly when playing Bjorn Borg because it was a waste of effort, and also because, as McEnroe said, he respected Borg. Respect for an opponent was one of the unwritten rules of cricket, now formally written into the Laws in the Preamble. It is ironic that sledging, once identified with Australian cricket (with India at the other end of the spectrum) is now an Indian strategy too. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/on-field-uncertainty-is-welcome-off-field-it-can-be-troubling/article38245395.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:50 IST,||There’s still a lot in the wicket, says Rabada||“There is no greater teacher than experience,” said Kagiso Rabada as he celebrated his 50th Test with a four-wicket haul at the Newlands here on Tuesday. “The game is in the balance. We would have liked to win the toss. We did well to restrict India to 223, we need to bat well.” About his contest with Virat Kohli, the pacer said, “I was trying to swing the ball away, not bowl at his pads. Credit to him, he batted very well. He ‘left’ well too.” Rabada said, “There is still a lot in the wicket. You don’t have control over conditions. Batters have to grind it out.” About left-arm quick Marco Jansen, Rabada said, “He has a burning desire to play, he’s a tough character... that’s the first thing you look for in a player. He has the X-factor, he has natural talent, he can win games for you.” Indian batting coach Vikram Rathour said, “These are challenging conditions. We were expecting 50 to 60 more runs. We were below par today. There were some soft dismissals towards the end. But we have the bowling to come back in the match.” On Kohli’s batting, Rathour said, “Virat played a phenomenal innings. One good thing today was that he batted with a lot more discipline. “They bowled well to him initially, they did not give him deliveries to drive, cut and pull. He battled through that phase. Left a lot of deliveries, showed patience.” January 11 was coach Rahul Dravid’s birthday and Rathour said the team would cut a cake in the evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/theres-still-a-lot-in-the-wicket-says-rabada/article38245630.ece

Ashmita took the first available opportunity of 2022 to serve a reminder by knocking out fifth-seeded Russian Evgeniya Kosetskaya from the $400,000 India Open here. Before the bigger names in all sections won as expected on the opening day, the left-hander from Guwahati saved three game-points for a 24-22, 21-14 victory over Kosetskaya, the 2018 European championship runner-up. Ashmita, the fourth highest-ranked Indian in the world list at 84, held a 19-16 lead in the first game before the Russian clawed back. Undeterred, Ashmita continued to attack and saved three game points from 19-20. Eventually, she converted her first game point. In the second, it was Ashmita all the way. Sindhu took just 27 minutes to beat K. Sri Krishna Priya. Second-seeded Thai Busanan Ongbambrungphan also advanced to the second round after her opponent, Canada’s Wen Yu Zhang, withdrew. In the midst of one-sided encounters, that saw K. Srikanth and Sameer Verma stay on course for their third-round meeting, it appeared as though World champion Loh Kean Yew dropped the opening game only to get some extra on-court time. He breezed past Xiaodong Sheng, a Canadian of Chinese origin, in the next two.  Important results (first round, Indians unless stated):   Men: K. Srikanth bt Siril Verma 21-17, 21-10; Sameer Verma bt Saurabh Verma 21-7, 21-7; Loh Kean Yew (Sin) bt Xiaodong Sheng (Can) 16-21, 21-4, 21-13.

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 04:37 IST,||There is a lot of talent: Shankaraiah||For long, P. Shankaraiah, former Sports Officer of Integrated Tribal Development Authority (ITDA) in Khammam, has been promoting archery amongst the rural boys and girls, and has been largely successful in contributing in his own way in setting up five training centres in the district. With Anil Kamineni, president, Telangana Archery Association, showing a lot of interest in giving a new direction to the sport, youngsters are hoping for a better future. The training centres in the district are at Bhadrachalam (girls), Dammapeta (boys), both run by Gurukulam, one at Kachanapalle, under the aegis of Tribal Welfare Girls School, one at Kinnerasani, which is the most full-fledged of all and started in 1998, and one at SAI Khelo India centre in Khammam district headquarters. “About 120 boys and girls are training at these centres. There is a lot of talent but the archers need the right kind of equipment and play facilities,” said Shankaraiah. Open grounds The 60-year-old added that the centres need more open grounds for daily training under different wind conditions as it will help the archers to fine-tune their skills. It is a pity that the SAI Khelo India Centre doesn’t have a coach now. Other centres are manned by G. Morappa (former international gold medallist), Hemalatha (Bhadrachalam), Sandeep (Kinnerasani) and former National gold winner P. Prasad (Dammapeta). “If we get the equipment and exposure to major events at the right time, we can win medals,” said one archer, even as the others nodded in approval. “Despite making a mark at the School Games Nationals, the archers are struggling when they are graduating to the next level for obvious reasons,” said Shankaraiah, who appealed to the ITDA that he would like to stay connected with the sport. Initiatives “We sincerely hope that the authorities take the right initiatives to promote archery in a big way and come up with a programme which should produce champions. There are few better places than Khammam district in Telangana to look for young archery talent given their natural skills. “All they need is the right kind of support at the right time,” Shankaraiah concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/there-is-a-lot-of-talent-shankaraiah/article38245911.ece

The 37-year-old took the last Bangladesh wicket to ensure New Zealand won the second Test here and drew the series. “Tim (Southee) kept telling me to chuck it up so I chucked it up. Tom said it was the most pressure he felt in the whole game,” Taylor said. It was only the eighth innings in his 112-Test career that Taylor has bowled his off-breaks and only the second match in which he has taken a wicket, after collecting two against India 12 years ago. Latham said he was aware of the crowd wanting Taylor to bowl but it was the umpires who forced the decision when they said the light had faded too much to allow any more fast bowling. “I guess the way it worked out couldn’t have been scripted,” Latham said. “To grab (the catch) and sign off a Test like that and for Ross to have another Test wicket under his belt was pretty special. It was a massive Test for Ross, this one.” Taylor still has one-day series against Australia and the Netherlands before he ends a 16-year international career in which he has amassed a host of records.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/finishing-with-a-flourish/article38245918.ece

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:45 IST,||Ishan Pandita rises to the occasion||Ishan Pandita once again proved the super-sub as he found the target for Jamshedpur FC minutes from the final whistle against SC East Bengal in an 11th round match of the Indian Super League at Bambolim on Tuesday. The result took JFC to the top of the table with 19 points from 11 matches as East Bengal continued at the bottom with six. East Bengal’s nice defensive organisation bothered Jamshedpur from the beginning. East Bengal’s interim coach Renedy Singh kept his faith in an all-Indian lineup and almost pulled off a coup but for Pandita’s goal. Pandita has scored all his goals in ISL as a substitute. The opening half ended barren with Jamshedpur’s famed attack-line failing to fire a single shot on target. The contest was quite even with East Bengal keeping its shape and attacking on the breaks. In the second half Jamshedpur put more resolve in its offence. The break almost came Jamshedpur’s way in the 52nd minute when Jordan Murray saw his looping header come off the crosspiece. East Bengal suffered a blow in the 57th minute when it lost the mainstay of its defence, Adil Khan, to injury. Jamshedpur FC’s Scottish coach Owen Coyle infused more attackers by introducing Pandita and Alex Lima in the final quarter of the action. Pandita finally rescued JFC in the 88th minute with a glancing header from a Greg Stewart corner.  The result: Jamshedpur FC 1 (Pandita 88) bt SC East Bengal 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ishan-pandita-rises-to-the-occasion/article38245672.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:50 IST,||Technology under scrutiny yet again||The umpiring, rather the technology used in officiating, has been under sharp scrutiny in the series. If technology, with all the scientific advancement, cannot give the right answers, what’s the point in having these gadgets at all. First it was the case of Rassie van der Dussen in the second Test at the Wanderers. When the front and the only clear view gave the true picture of a bump-ball catch by Rishabh Pant, the third umpire looked at the side view, which was a lot less revealing, and gave the evidence to overturn a decision as inconclusive. The decision made a mockery of all the technology available. And here at the Newlands, India captain, Virat Kohli was on 39 on Tuesday when he appeared to nick the ball while attempting to essay a glance off a Duanne Olivier ball outside leg. The South African, convinced Kohli nicked it, celebrated, but the umpire remained unmoved. South Africa went for a review and it was over to umpire Allahuddin Palekar. While the earlier replays revealed little, once the snicko came into the picture, a thin spike was clearly visible when the ball passed the bat, and it was not close to the pads or the thigh. A spike on the sniko is a spike, big or small and there were sufficient grounds for the TV umpire to overturn the decision. However, umpire Palekar felt otherwise. A thin spike was apparently not enough to overturn the verdict. The ICC has introduced technology and then it has tied itself in a tangle giving weightage to an umpire’s on-field decision before technology is used. So had the on-field umpire declared Kohli out, the third umpire might well have come up with the same verdict. Just as in the case of leg-before decisions when an umpire’s call decides whether a ball just brushing the stumps, sounds the death knell for the batsmen or not. Either you depend on technology or you don’t. This in-between stand is being counter-productive to the whole idea of employing technology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/technology-under-scrutiny-yet-again/article38245623.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:50 IST,||‘Rabada will break all SA records’||For someone who is among the South African greats, Makhaya Ntini is strikingly unassuming.  Baring his heart in an exclusive chat with The Hindu , Ntini said, “Malcolm Marshall was my hero maan . I tried to do everything the way he did. I modelled my bowling action after him. He was the greatest of them all.”  Ntini played a huge part in South Africa becoming a strong Test team. In 101 Tests, he had 390 wickets at 28.82 (Strike Rate 53.4). Add to this his 266 ODI scalps at an economy rate of 4.53, and you are looking at a formidable paceman. Strong and skilful Ntini is delighted at Kagiso Rabada featuring in his 50th Test here. “He is strong, fit, bowls fast, is skilful. He moves it both ways, has a very good short ball. He is hostile.” Rabada he said would “break all South African records. He already has more than 200 wickets. I think he will play way more than 100 Tests and finish with over 500 Test wickets. Something no South African bowler has accomplished. When he gets to 500 Test wickets, I will celebrate!” About Marco Jansen, Ntini said, “I don’t want to praise him too much. These are early days. He’s a left-armer, has the ability. “But in Test cricket if you bowl 20 overs in a day, you got to bowl with the same intensity the next day. You got to be as quick in your last spell as in your first.” Improved Indians About the Indians, Ntini said, “It is very effective, that’s why you are so good overseas now. Bumrah’s approach and action are different. It makes a huge difference.” Ntini added, “Shami’s seam position is excellent. And who would have thought Shardul could be so aggressive and thrustful.” Ntini, now, wants to focus on coaching. “I would love to come to India,” he said.  Marshall was my hero. I tried to do everything the way he did. He was the greatest of them all||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rabada-will-break-all-sa-records/article38245618.ece

As expected, homegrown talent and top-ranked Ashleigh Barty was given No. 1 seeding in the women’s singles draw when the list was released on Tuesday. Defending champion Naomi Osaka is seeded 13th. Daniil Medvedev is seeded second, followed by Alexander Zverev at No. 3, Stefanos Tsitsipas at No. 4 and Andrey Rublev at No. 5. Rafael Nadal is seeded sixth, followed by Matteo Berrettini. The 25-year-old Barty has two Grand Slam singles titles — the 2019 French Open and last year’s Wimbledon — but she dearly wants to win a Major on home soil. No Australian woman has won the title here since Chris O’Neill in 1978. Garbine Muguruza will be No. 3 seed, Barbora Krejcikova No. 4 and Maria Sakkari fifth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-given-pride-of-place-despite-uncertainty/article38245627.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:20 IST,||The Djokovic saga ‘damaging on all fronts’: ATP||The ATP on Monday responded to Novak Djokovic’s stunning victory over the Australian government in his “visa battle”, by calling the argument over his vaccination status “damaging on all fronts”. The ruling by a judge in Melbourne overturned the cancellation of Djokovic’s visa on COVID-19 health grounds, and ended the unvaccinated player’s detention in an immigration facility, potentially clearing the way for him to play in the Australian Open that starts next Monday. Had done everything The ATP, the governing body of men’s tennis, said it sympathised with both Djokovic and the Australian public and stressed it had done everything it could to head off potential problems for players entering the country to play the Australian Open. “The ATP fully respects the sacrifices the people of Australia have made since the onset of COVID-19 and the stringent immigration policies that have been put in place,” said the statement. As for the World No. 1, the ATP said: “In travelling to Melbourne, it’s clear Novak Djokovic believed he had been granted a necessary medical exemption in order to comply with entry regulations. “The series of events leading to Monday’s court hearing have been damaging on all fronts, including for Novak’s well-being and preparation for the Australian Open. Medical exemption requests are made independently of ATP,” the body said. Pro vaccination But the statement made clear that Djokovic could have avoided the problem. “ATP continues to strongly recommend vaccination for all players on the ATP Tour, which we believe is essential for our sport to navigate the pandemic... We are encouraged that 97 per cent of the Top 100 players are vaccinated leading into this year’s Australian Open,” it said. In another development, the Prime Ministers of Australia and Serbia on Tuesday discussed Djokovic’s visa. Australian PM Morrison and his Serbian counterpart, Ana Brnabic, agreed in their telephonic conversation to keep in touch over the 34-year-old’s disputed visa, Morrison’s office said. “The PM explained our non-discriminatory border policy and its role in protecting Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Morrison’s office said in a statement. Brnabic asked Morrison to ensure the tennis star was treated with dignity, public broadcaster Radio Television of Serbia reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-djokovic-saga-damaging-on-all-fronts-atp/article38245990.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 06:50 IST,||Tata Group is title sponsor||The Tata Group has replaced Vivo as the title sponsor for the Indian Premier League 2022 and 2023 editions.  “We are delighted with Tata Sons having come on board as the title sponsors for IPL. The situation arose with Vivo being unable to continue its association. Tatas will be the title sponsors for the next two editions,” IPL chairman Brijesh Patel told The Hindu after the IPL governing council meeting on Tuesday.   With Vivo deciding to pull out of its existing contract running till 2023, the Tata group stepped in, thus extending its association with Indian sport from tennis and badminton to cricket. The Hindu understands that the Tatas will have to shell out more than Rs. 440 per year that Vivo was paying, due to the increase in number of matches per edition from 60 to 74.  Brijesh confirmed that the governing council finalised the mega-auction in Bengaluru next month and ratified the decision to award the Letter of Intent (LoI) to the promoters of the Ahmedabad and Lucknow franchises. “As of now, the IPL auction will be scheduled in Bengaluru on Feb. 12 and 13,” Brijesh said. “The two new teams will get two weeks to finalise their pre-auction signings and submit the names around Jan. 25.” The recent COVID-19 surge has yet again put a question mark on the fate of the IPL’s 15th edition, with last year’s tournament being suspended midway through before being moved overseas. The governing council has decided to wait and watch after discussing the issue. “It is too early to take a call on the IPL venues due to the dynamic COVID-19 scenario. We are hoping that we’ll be able to stage it in India. For that to happen, we will wait as late as possible,” Brijesh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tata-group-is-title-sponsor/article38245622.ece

The result took JFC to the top of the table with 19 points from 11 matches as East Bengal continued at the bottom with six. East Bengal’s nice defensive organisation bothered Jamshedpur from the beginning. East Bengal’s interim coach Renedy Singh kept his faith in an all-Indian lineup and almost pulled off a coup but for Pandita’s goal. Pandita has scored all his goals in ISL as a substitute.  The result: Jamshedpur FC 1 (Pandita 88) bt SC East Bengal 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ishan-pandita-rises-to-the-occasion/article38245913.ece

He then asked Sumantra to fetch Rama. When Rama alighted from the chariot, Dasaratha feasted his eyes on Him. Rama walked majestically like an elephant. Rama’s handsomeness was pleasing like the moon. Rama paid obeisance to his father, and Dasaratha felt that Rama looked just the way he (Dasaratha) had looked in his youth. Dasaratha conveyed to Rama his decision to appoint Him as his successor. Dasaratha then offered advice to Rama, said Navalpakkam Vasudevachariar in a discourse. He said that Rama was by nature humble and righteous. But still, he wished to tell Him some things. Rama should be humble always, and not give in to anger. The reason for this piece of advice was because a high position automatically makes a person proud, and Dasaratha wanted to warn Rama about what power could do to a person. Rama should strive to keep His ministers happy, said Dasaratha. He should ensure the happiness of His people by keeping the granaries in His kingdom full. In other words, He had to make sure that His kingdom was prosperous so that His subjects would not lack anything. Rama took leave of His father. Once it was decided that the coronation would be the very next day, in the star Pushya, Dasaratha again sent for Rama. When Rama arrived, Dasaratha told Him that he had become old. He had completed his debts to devas, sages and ancestors. The planetary positions in his horoscope were not good. This usually meant that the king would soon die. People of Ayodhya also wanted to see Rama as their ruler. And so Dasaratha was desirous of celebrating Rama’s coronation as soon as possible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/dasarathas-decision/article38245582.ece

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 03:32 IST,||Toughest creatures of the world||Abhi: Sid, what’s your biggest fear?  Sid: Cockroaches.  Abhi: Really? Then, here is some bad news for you. A study has found that cockroaches are becoming resistant to various insecticides.  Sid: Oh, no! If this continues, their population will explode. Probably they will outnumber us, humans, and take over the planet, becoming the single dominant species.  Abhi: That’s a good plot for a sci-fi.  Sid: Cockroaches live forever and they are immune to nuclear radiation, aren’t they?  Abhi: Well, that’s a myth. Cockroaches are not immune to nuclear radiation. They are just 5 times more resistant than humans to radiation. Fruit flies, parasitoid wasps and some scorpions are more tolerant of nuclear radiation than cockroaches, for that matter. However, we have to give it to the cockroaches for being incredibly adaptive. They can survive in any environment because of their eating habit. They can go without food and water for weeks. Did you know cockroaches can live without their head for weeks? If our head is cut off, we would die of bleeding. But cockroaches have an open circulatory system and they continue to breathe through their spiracles. Their neck would seal off by clotting, even if their head is cut. There is no uncontrolled bleeding. But they would die of starvation as they won’t be able to eat without their head.  Sid: Incredible, I say!  Abhi: Have you heard of tardigrades?  Sid: No, what are they?  Abhi: Scientists call them the most resilient in the animal world. If you are picturing a huge animal like dinosaur or elephant, stop there, because tardigrades are actually microanimals. They are about 0.5 mm long when they are fully grown! They are short and plump, with four pairs of legs, each ending in claws or sucking disks. The animal can survive extreme temperatures, extreme pressures, air deprivation, radiation, dehydration, and starvation. Tardigrades are prevalent in mosses and lichens, and feed on plant cells, algae, and small invertebrates.  Sid: That’s amazing! I have read somewhere that even Pompeii worms, which live near the hydrothermal vents (openings in the sea floor out of which heated mineral-rich water flows) in the depths of the ocean, are resilient.  Abhi: Tell me more.  Sid: They are among the most heat-tolerant multicelled creatures. They can withstand temperatures above 80 degrees C. Scientists believe the worm is able to tolerate scorching temperatures because of a mutually beneficial relationship it has with a fuzzy bacterium. The bacterium appears to insulate the worm, protecting it from the heavy metals churned out by the hydrothermal vents.  Abhi: This worm reminds me of the insect that thrives in freezing temperature, as low as 58 degrees C?  Sid: What is it?  Abhi: The red at bark beetle, a North American beetle, is found in areas from North Carolina to the Arctic Circle. Their larvae can endure even more remarkable lows — around 100 degrees C.  Sid: How does the beetle achieve this?  Abhi: By accumulating antifreeze proteins and glycerol in its tissues, it is able to avoid freezing.  Sid: With climate change getting acute, I think we should also prepare ourselves for such extreme living conditions.  Abhi: Well, that’s a bit of a stretch. We won’t face such extreme living conditions, at least in our lifetime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/toughest-creatures-of-the-world/article38245372.ece

The “historic” procedure took place Friday, the University of Maryland Medical School said in a statement. While the patient’s prognosis is far from certain, it represents a major milestone in medical history. The patient, David Bennett, had been deemed ineligible for human transplant -- a decision that is often taken when the recipient has very poor underlying health. He is now recovering and being carefully monitored to determine how the new organ performs. "It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it's a shot in the dark, but it's my last choice," the Maryland resident said a day before the surgery. Bennett, who has spent the last several months bedridden on a heart-lung bypass machine, added: "I look forward to getting out of bed after I recover." The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorisation for the surgery on New Year's Eve, as a last ditch effort for a patient who was unsuitable for conventional transplant. Muhammad Mohiuddin, who co-founded the university's cardiac xenotransplantation program, added the surgery was the culmination of years of research. 10 unique gene edits Bennett's donor pig belonged to a herd that had undergone genetic editing procedures. Three genes that would have led to rejection of pig organs by humans were "knocked out," as was a gene that would have led to excessive growth of pig heart tissue. Six human genes responsible for human acceptance were inserted into the genome, for a total of 10 unique gene edits.AFP  This was a breakthrough surgery. It brings us one step closer to solving the organ shortage crisis. Bartley Griffith, Surgeon||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/a-new-milestone-in-medical-history/article38245377.ece
12 January 2022||January 12 2022 03:32 IST,||Robot with brain navigates a maze||Psychologists often employ mazes in their laboratories to test the learning capacity of the subject of their experiments, most commonly rats or mice. A group of researchers have extended the set-up to a robot, which has successfully learnt to navigate the twists and turns of a maze on its own. The results of the study, published earlier in December 2021 in Science Advances, could pave the way to applications of neuromorphic (circuits that mimic neuro-biological architecture present in the nervous system) devices in the field of health and beyond. While machine learning and neural networks have been a rage in recent times owing to the success they have enjoyed in a variety of fields, a software-based approach does have its own drawbacks, including increased power consumption. Learning from our brain In an effort to develop energy-efficient solutions, scientists and researchers are turning to the human brain. This is because our brains are thinking machines that are almost unrivalled in low power consumption, achieved by how it combines memory and processing. Researchers at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Germany have taken a first step in that direction by equipping a robot with a human-like brain. The arrangement has enabled the robot to learn how to manoeuvre a maze on its own. The robot used for the research is a Mindstorms EV3, a robotics kit made by Lego. Equipped with wheels, sensors, and some traditional software as well, the robot was sent into a two sq mt maze made out of black-lined hexagons in a honeycomb-like pattern. Right or left? Programmed to turn right by default, the robot learns its designated path to the exit using visual cues that make it turn left. The robot remembers the corrective stimulus in the neuromorphic device during the next effort.  The robot took 16 attempts to find the exit successfully (the video can be seen on YouTube at v.gd/robotmaze ). The knowledge acquired about the maze is generalisable, meaning it can navigate any other path that it is given in one go once it has learnt to move this specific route.  The robot’s ability to navigate the maze is a success story for the unique integration of sensors and motors and the organic polymer material employed. The potential of these smart devices is huge and we could be on the cusp of something big in neuromorphic devices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/robot-with-brain-navigates-a-maze/article38245380.ece

12 January 2022||January 12 2022 05:30 IST,||On the sugar trail||KKN Nallasamy has had white sugar with his tea for only three months in his lifetime.  The 72-year-old farmer prefers using country sugar, made right beside his sugarcane fields at Kavindapadi village in Erode district, 98 kilometres from Coimbatore. “A terrible drought struck us some 20 years ago and our crops failed,” he recalls. “I could not make naatu sakkarai (country sugar) and hence had to buy white sugar. But after three months I stopped using it,” he pauses, chuckling about how it did not feel or taste quite right.   Kavindapadi is a major supplier of country sugar in the State. Sugarcane fields are spread out across the village — the strapping purple stalks are fed well by the Lower Bhavani Canal. “Our country sugar is used to sweeten panchamirtham at the Palani Murugan temple,” says KKN Eswaramoorthy, Nallasamy’s son. The 45-year-old manages 12 acres of the crop, and also makes and sells country sugar.  “Kavindapadi’s population is around 10,000, of which around 2,000 of us are involved in farming,” he says. The village has two major white sugar mills in the vicinity; ironic in a place known for country sugar. “Several farmers sell their sugarcane to the mills, while some sell their crop to commercial jaggery units in the region,” explains Eswaramoorthy, just as his mother walks by to offer us tea — with country sugar.  The sugar adds a mellow nutty flavour to the tea, something that Eswaramoorthy swears by. “It has grown in popularity over the last decade or so, which is why I decided to market it on Facebook,” he explains. The page Sugarcane Jaggery Powder, that he started in 2015, is a direct link between the farmer and consumer. “If I sell through the agent in my village, the product will change three hands before reaching the consumer, and I end up making very less,” he says. And so he started his own brand, the first in his village to do so. “Traditionally, pongal was made with naatu sakkarai ,” says Eswaramoorthy. “Jaggery is the same, made into balls,” he adds. Somewhere along the way, jaggery, probably owing to its shape — there is also ‘achchu vellam’, shaped into small rectangles — gained in popularity.  “Over the years, commercial units started adding white sugar while making jaggery, and people ended up getting used to what is an unnatural sweeter version,” he explains. A soothing concoction Around a kilometre from his farm, M Maranayakkar is overseeing work on his field. It is a cloudless day, and the sun beats down on us. S Sengottayan and his team of eight are churning out a batch of 90 kilograms of country sugar. The 67-year-old owns a wooden cane crusher, and works for farmers in the region. Once hired, he, along with his team, sets up a clay stove by the land-owner’s field, harvests sugarcane and churns it into sandy brown country sugar. “Five hundred litres of juice will yield around 100 kilograms of sugar,” explains Sengottayan, walking over to a gigantic skillet made of mild steel — it can hold 1,000 litres — where sugarcane juice simmers, giving off sweet-smelling fumes. The juice simmers for two hours; 500 grams of baking soda and 100 grams of calcium carbonate are added at various intervals; 50ml of coconut oil is drizzled in just before it is taken off the fire. Sengottayan gives the shimmery concoction a mix with a mammoth ladle. “Careful now,” his wife Sellammal signals us a warning. “A drop of that can drive a hole into the skin.” But she casually walks around it, sending several ripples glide through the liquid — that has now reached the consistency of honey — with another ladle. The juice has reduced to half its volume. Suddenly, there is a commotion among them — it is time. They gather by the vessel: four of them tip it into a similar skillet. In one quick move, the semi-solid beauty slides into the waiting container. Sengottayan quickly mixes it with a wooden implement. The golden, gooey substance changes colour right before our eyes. “This will turn powdery in 30 minutes,” Sellammal tells us.  Sengottayan scrapes a tiny bit off the ladle and offers it for us to taste: he calls it javvu mittai (sticky candy). It sticks to our fingers as we pull it apart to eat it. The mittai is intoxicating — imagine the sweetness of a hundred sugarcanes condensed into a sticky concentrate that melts in the mouth. “Nice, isn’t it?” chuckles Sengottayan. “I get to eat this every day.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-the-sugar-trail/article38246025.ece

A probe began after a 50-year-old woman, identified as Anwari Abdul Shaikh, told VP Road police that an infant had been kidnapped by one Ibrahim Shaikh on January 3, after which a case was registered for kidnapping and trafficking of minor, the police officer said. “We first arrested Ibrahim Altaf Shaikh (32) based on human and technical intelligence, and then, based on his interrogation, raided areas in Sion, Dharavi, Malad Jogeshwari, Nagpada in Mumbai and Kalyan and Thane. This led to further arrests of two women and four men,” he said. “They told us the child had been sold for Rs. 4.8 lakh to a person in Tamil Nadu. Two teams were sent there and a search operation was mounted in three districts for four days,” he said. “Mumbai police succeeded in arresting one woman and four men from Selvanpatti in Coimbatore, all of whom were brought here,” he added. The child was sold to one Anand Kumar Nagarajan, a civil engineer living in Selvanpatti, and it has been revealed that accused Ibrahim Shaikh was in a live-in relationship with the infant’s mother, the official informed. “Ibrahim Shaikh claims he is the father of the child, so we will be conducting a DNA test. The infant’s mother had gone for some work on December 1 and has not been traced as yet. The infant is in a secure place as per an order of the Child Welfare Committee,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/11-held-for-kidnapping-baby-selling-her-in-tn/article38245817.ece
