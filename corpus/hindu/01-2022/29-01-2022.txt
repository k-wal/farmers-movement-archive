The BJP legislators were suspended for a year for “grossly disorderly conduct” in the House during the monsoon session in 2021. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and C.T. Ravikumar quashed the resolution of July 5 last year as “unconstitutional” and traversing beyond the powers of the Assembly. The court said it was illegal to suspend a sitting legislator beyond the ongoing session. “A suspension beyond the remainder period of the ongoing session would not only be grossly irrational measure, but also violative of the basic democratic values owing to unessential deprivation of the member concerned, and more importantly, the constituency would remain unrepresented in the Assembly. It would also impact the democratic set-up as a whole by permitting the thin majority government [coalition government] of the day to manipulate the numbers of the Opposition party in the House in an undemocratic manner,” Justice Khanwilkar observed. The court held that the such suspensions would cripple the Opposition’s ability to effectively participate in the discussion/debate in the House owing to the constant fear of its members being suspended for longer period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-quashes-a-years-suspension-of-12-maharashtra-bjp-mlas/article64991178.ece

The government’s response follows a report in The Hindu earlier this week that the Pakistan government had sent a proposal from the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) to allow a group of 170 pilgrims to fly directly from Karachi and Lahore to places of worship in India.  The MEA also confirmed that it hoped to secure clearances to transport food aid to Afghanistan over the land to Pakistan, which is otherwise closed, shortly.  “There is an interest on both sides to expand the agreed list of shrines and mode of travel. Let me underline that India has a positive approach on this matter and is willing to engage the Pakistani side,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi in response to a question from The Hindu. The government hoped that the current time period when COVID-19 restrictions were in place could be “utilised to hold discussions under the bilateral protocol”, he said and hoped to facilitate “early exchange of visits to all shrines of interest to pilgrims”. While the MEA’s statement indicates the permissions requested for flights beginning January 29 have not been granted at present, the offer of talks with Pakistan on renegotiating the joint protocol is a rare departure from other issues where both sides have suspended talks for several years.  Sources noted that India had conveyed its position to Pakistan through formal channels as well, and officials on both sides could meet early next week to iron out the details of how to upgrade the protocols.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/willing-to-talk-to-pakistan-on-pilgrim-flights-mea/article64991177.ece

Presenting the budget for 2022-23 here on Friday, Chairperson of Corporation Council Standing Committee on Taxation, Finance and Appeals Shobha Rajesh said that documentation in the corporation is now in the paperless format. “It is proposed to develop a system by which people can view online the action taken on their applications,” she said. Ms. Rajesh said that the corporation will continue with the present online system of payment of property tax from which it expects a revenue of Rs. 80 crore in the 2022-23. The corporation has added more than 2.05 lakh houses into the tax net and survey work is on to find houses that are left out. A revenue vigilance squad headed by the Deputy Commissioner (Finance) is set up to find revenue leakage and plug it. Though there is a demand for revision of building licence fee, it has been decided to revise the fee from the next fiscal. The corporation is expecting revenue of Rs. 4 crore from building licence fee in 2022-23. The corporation has proposed to bring a new bylaw to regulate illegal advertisement hoardings while expecting a revenue of Rs. 7 crore from advertisement tax in 2022-23. It is expecting Rs. 4 crore from the State Government in the form of 2% surcharge collected over stamp duty for effecting sale of immovable property. Encouraged by proper segregation of dry and wet waste on people’s doorsteps, the corporation has planned to launch a drive to encourage more households to process waste in their houses itself. Ms. Rajesh said that the financial bid of Hyderabad-based National Federation of Farmers Procurement, Processing and Retailing Co-operative of India Limited for processing legacy waste at Panchanady Landfill Site has been sent for approval of the State Government. With an opening balance of Rs. 327.81 crore for 2022-23, the corporation expects a revenue of Rs. 578.65 crore during the year and estimates the expenditure to be at Rs. 561.35 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/city-corporation-to-develop-citizen-portal-to-help-monitor-services/article64991412.ece

Speaking after a roundtable to discuss their course of action with regard to the ongoing employees’ protest on the PRC issue, the RTC union leaders said they had welcomed their merger in the government with the hope that their longstanding demand forreinstatement of the old pension scheme would be heeded. “However, aside from keeping it in abeyance, certain new policies of the management forcedus to adopt the path of confrontation,” they said. They said the employees were deprived of the Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme (SRBS) and many other benefits in phases. They said a strong wave of resentment had been brewing among the employees against the management due to its ‘unilateral’ decisions involving their welfare. Their hope that the benefits of the PRC would be extended to them as they were now government employees, had also been dashed. Because of the PRC being declared by the government, the RTC employees,under the PublicTransport Department (PTD),would be deprived of two PRCs (2021 and 2025), they said. State conveners of the United Front Y. Srinivasa Rao and Parisetty Damodar Rao pointed to the difference between the salaries of the RTC employees and other government employees. “We have no clue as to how the management intends tobridge this gap. We also have no idea about what scales are being implemented for us as PTD employees as we have been kept in the dark,” they said. They said the injustice being meted out to the RTC employees even after their merger in the government should be addressed immediately. If their demands were not met, they would not hesitate to join the protests being staged by the PRC Sadhana Samithi, they warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ready-to-join-prc-protest-say-public-transport-department-employees/article64991183.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:33 IST,||Power sector staff to go on State-wide stir||The AP State Power Employees’ Joint Action Committee (AP-SPEJAC) has announced its decision to go on a State-wide work-to-rule protest from February 21 to 28 against the framing of new service regulations allegedly without their consent, and the proposed handing over of the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of Sri Damodaram Sanjeevaiah Thermal Power Station (SDSTPS) at Krishnapatnam to private players for 25 years. Prior to that, the employees will attend to duties by wearing black badges from January 29 to February 5, give mass representations to the Chief Minister through social media / post cards and submit representations to the statues of freedom fighters from February 3 to 5 and stage lunch-hour demonstrations from February 7 to 16, and relay hunger strikes from February 17 to 28. JAC chairman P. Chandra Sekhar, secretary general P. Prathap Reddy and convener B. Sai Krishna said in a notice issued to Energy Secretary N. Srikant on Friday, that the Minister for Energy and Adviser to the Government had directed the managements of the power utilities, in a meeting with a delegation of the JAC in December 2021, to refrain from framing new service regulations in the DISCOMs but to no avail, as a fresh set of regulations were laid down in blatant disregard to their order. Subsequently, the JAC informed the Minister that the managements of power utilities were not giving appointments, they were foisting false cases, resorting to forcible transfers and creating fear psychosis among the employees and workers, thereby avoiding an amicable settlement of issues. As far as the attempt to privatise the SDSTPS was concerned, the JAC leaders said the government had resolved to hand over its O&M to private players by merely quoting high variable costs. This decision of the government would have a cascading effect on other projects due to the differential treatment given to private companies and AP-Genco in terms of the honouring of payments. This action might lead to the collapse of Genco itself since it does not have the LC payment facility unlike its private counterparts, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/power-sector-staff-announce-agitation-programme/article38342106.ece

Satyanarayana Murthy and D.V.S.S. Somayajulu resumed the hearing of the ‘three capitals’ cases on Friday. However, after listening to arguments on the continued relevance of some petitions, which were filed long before the government had withdrawn the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and CRDA Repeal Acts of 2020, the court adjourned the hearing to February 2. Advocate-General S. Sriram appeared for the State. Advocates for the petitioners stressed on the need to quickly adjudicate the matter by drawing the court’s attention to the fact that the government had no change in its plan as it made a statement in the Legislature that the intention behind the passage of the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Repeal Bill, 2021 was only to bring a comprehensive Bill for the development of three capital cities. Senior advocate Jandhyala Ravi Shankar said apart from contractual obligations of the State government and human rights violations, issues like the role of the Union of India in matters relating to the provisions of AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, ‘change of policy with the change of government’, the role of Parliament vis-a-vis establishment of a capital city, whether or not the State has legislative competence etc., should be looked into by the High Court as the State’s decision to develop three capitals would have consequences for many generations to come.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hearing-of-three-capitals-cases-posted-to-feb-2/article38342067.ece

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:32 IST,||Don’t want wars, but won’t let interests be ignored: Russia||Russia on Friday sent its strongest signal so far that it is willing to engage with U.S. security proposals and reiterated that it does not want war over Ukraine. “If it depends on Russia, then there will be no war. We don’t want wars. But we also won’t allow our interests to be rudely trampled, to be ignored,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian radio stations in an interview. Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border as it presses demands for a redrawing of post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe. Mr. Lavrov said the West was ignoring Russia’s interests but there was at least “something” in written responses submitted by the U.S. and NATO on Wednesday to Russia’s proposals. Mr. Lavrov said he expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken again in the next couple of weeks. Their last meeting in Geneva produced no breakthrough but both sides agreed to keep talking. Mr. Lavrov said, without giving details, that the U.S. counter-proposals were better than NATO’s. Russia was studying them and President Vladimir Putin would decide how to respond. While the U.S. and NATO responses have not been made public, both have stated they are willing to engage with Moscow on a series of topics, including arms control. The U.S. Ambassador to Moscow, John Sullivan, said Washington had raised the possibility of “reciprocal transparency measures... including on offensive weapons systems in Ukraine, as well as measures to increase confidence regarding military exercises and manoeuvres in Europe.”  The head of Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency told Reuters that Russia was prepared to attack Ukraine but added: “I believe that the decision to attack has not yet been made”.  Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia, said his country had absolutely no interest in a war and that conflict would break out only if Belarus or Russia were directly attacked. The Kremlin said Mr. Putin would spend a “lot of time” discussing European security issues with Chinese President Xi Jinping when he visits Beijing next week for the opening of the Winter Olympics. Mr. Putin also plans a meeting with German business people, following talks with Italian executives on Wednesday at which he underlined the importance of energy ties between Russia and Italy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/we-dont-want-wars-says-russia/article64991186.ece

It held ‘cadre’, and not class or group or the entire service, as the unit for the purpose of collection of quantifiable data for giving promotion quotas. The court stuck firm by the decisions of its Constitution Benches in the Jarnail Singh and M. Nagaraj cases that the question of adequate representation of SC/ST communities ought to be left to the respective States to determine. “Determination of inadequate representation of SCs and STs in services under a State is left to the discretion of the State, as it depends upon myriad factors which this Court cannot envisage… Laying down of criteria for determining the inadequacy of representation would result in curtailing the discretion given to the State governments,” a Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao, Sanjiv Khanna and B.R. Gavai noted. “In addition, the prevailing local conditions, which may require to be factored in, might not be uniform… In the light of Jarnail Singh and Nagaraj, we cannot lay down any yardstick for determining the inadequacy of representation,” the Bench said. In respect of the unit of collection of quantifiable data, the court held that the State is “obligated to collect quantifiable data on the inadequacy of representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes” for reservation in promotions in public employment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-must-decide-on-scst-quota-in-promotions-court/article38342103.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:09 IST,||State struggling to meet 2021-22 target under Jal Jeevan Mission||The State is struggling to meet the water connection targets for 2021-22 under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), the Centrally assisted rural water supply initiative. With just two months left in the fiscal, the State is nowhere near achieving the objective of 29.38 lakh functional household tap connections (FHTCs). A recent assessment by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA), which is leading the implementation in the State, has revealed that only 5.56 lakh connections have been issued till January 20, 2022. A senior KWA official blamed COVID-19 for the slow pace. Urgent action Noting that urgent action is needed if all rural households are to be provided connections by 2024, the KWA has issued orders appointing 'charge officers' to monitor the progress of the drive at the divisional level. The officers also include senior staff of the KWA such as the technical member and chief engineers. Implemented on a 50:50 cost-sharing basis by the Centre and the States, the JJM envisions individual tap connections in all rural households in the country by 2024. In Kerala, JJM projects were launched in April 2020, one year after the rollout by the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti. At the time of the Kerala launch, only 17.5 lakh of the 67.15 lakh rural households in the State had piped water supply. The State government hopes to cover the remaining households by 2024. The State had fallen way short of the target in 2020-21 also; only 4.04 lakh connections could be given against the targeted 21.42 lakh. Consequently, the target for 2021-22 was pegged at a steep 29.38 lakh connections, which included the backlog. ''Out of this, only 5.56 lakh connections have been provided till January 20, 2022. At present, only 38% of rural households could be covered with FHTCs. Hence, urgent action on a war-footing is required to cover the remaining 62% households. Effective team work and close monitoring of works are required to achieve the goal of 100% coverage by 2024,'' the KWA noted in a January 22 order appointing the charge officers. ''The pandemic is the main reason for the shortfall. Many of our staff have tested positive. Contractors are also finding it difficult to mobilise their workforce. But we are trying to speed up the work wherever possible,'' Sreekumar G., technical member, KWA, said. Monitoring the progress of the work aside, the charge officers are tasked with sorting out issues related to land, road cutting and deployment of workforce. In May 2021, the Centre had urged the State to give priority to ongoing/completed schemes of the erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme that could be retrofitted/augmented to provide FHTCs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-struggling-to-meet-2021-22-target-under-jal-jeevan-mission/article64991288.ece

Parallelly, counsel for the girl’s parents told the judge they did not have faith in the police investigation and sought a probe by an external agency. During the hearing, Additional Public Prosecutor T. Senthil Kumar submitted that Muthuvel, who shot the video, was not cooperating with the inquiry. Despite the court order, he was insisting that summons be served on him. Mr. Senthil Kumar said that as soon as the mobile phone with which the video was recorded was handed over to the investigating officer, it was sent for a forensic analysis to Chennai. “We do not know how many videos have been shot, and the same is being ascertained,” he said. The authorities were also probing the call made by the girl to Child Line, two years ago, allegedly complaining about her step-mother. Mr. Senthil Kumar contended that a political blame-game was on and there was a clear case to create confusion despite the fact that the investigation was progressing properly. Arrests were made immediately. A total of 63 persons had so far been examined, and senior police officers were monitoring the probe, he said, adding that though the video was shot earlier, it was released much later (after the girl’s death). Advocate M. Karthikeya Venkitachalapathy, representing the girl’s parents, submitted that they had lost faith in the police investigation and sought a CBI probe as opposed to their original plea for a CB-CID probe. According to him, the girl’s “dying declaration” was leaked to the media. After the phone was handed over to the police, a new video pertaining to the issue was “leaked”, he submitted. He also doubted the forensic analysis. The Immaculate Heart of Mary Society, in an impleading petition, submitted that the school was established in 1859 by the congregation at Michaelpatti near Thirukattupalli in Thanjavur district. Senior counsel Fr. Xavier Arulraj said the girl’s death was a loss to the school and the majority of students of the institutions run by the Society were Hindus.

A month prior to that [9/11], they moved to their respective positions. That is what is relevant in this [Delhi riots] case also,” he submitted before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat. He said the key conspirator of 9/11 had never visited the U.S. or Malaysia, where the plot was hatched, and then referred to the fact that despite conversations in the Delhi Protest Support Group pointing to a violent protest, Mr. Khalid continued to be part of the WhatsApp group and “remained silent”. The defence counsel had earlier argued that Mr. Khalid sent only five messages on the group. Amravati speech  The prosecution also played Mr. Khalid’s Amravati speech of February 2020 and argued that he had attempted to create an “ aatank ka mahaul ” (feeling of terror) among Muslims. The SPP said at one point in his speech, Mr. Khalid used the term “We, Muslims” even though he claims to be an atheist.  Mr. Prasad said contrary to the public perception, the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest sites that sprang up in the run-up to the riots were not “organic” and had been carefully “planned” beforehand. “The issue was not CAA-NRC… you had to somehow embarrass the government,” the prosecutor submitted, adding that the attempt was to create “a facade of secular protests”.

Only the batches certified by the Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli, shall be used in the clinical trials, which will be conducted at nine sites, including the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences in New Delhi and Patna. The trial sites include institutes in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The chimpanzee adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine (BBV154) will be administered through an intranasal route, and each single dose is 0.5 ml. Subject to conditions The DCGI has stated that this permission is subject to the conditions prescribed in Part A of Chapter V of the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019 under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. “It may kindly be noted that merely granting permission to conduct clinical trials with the vaccine does not convey or imply that, based on the clinical trial data generated with the vaccine, permission to market this vaccine in the country will automatically be granted to you,” the DCGI said. The controller explained that the Phase 3 clinical trials should be conducted as per protocol titled “A Phase III randomised open label multi-centre study to compare immunogenicity and safety of BBV154 with Covaxin and to assess lot-to-lot consistency of BBV154”. ‘Easier to administer’ Experts have noted that an intranasal vaccine as a booster will be easier to administer in mass vaccination drives. By reducing the need for needles and syringes, among others, such vaccines would also impact the overall cost of a vaccination drive, Bharat Biotech chairman Krishna Ella had said.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:34 IST,||Engage in debates in the House, not in ridiculing each other: SC||A nation aspiring to be a “world leader” should debate on the welfare of its citizens rather than make Parliament a stage to exchange jeers and launch personal attacks on one another, the Supreme Court said in a judgment on Friday. To see Members of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies ridicule each other instead of engaging in constructive debates in Houses is hardly worthy of the claim that “we are the oldest civilisation on the planet and the world’s largest democracy”. With the completion of 75 years of Independence and ambitions of becoming a world leader, elected members should at least know that they are expected to show statesmanship and not brinkmanship in the House. “For becoming world leaders and self-dependent/reliant, quality of debates in the House ought to be of the highest order,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said in the judgment. Legislature is the first place where justice is dispensed to the common man through a democratic process, it observed. Intransigent place The order dealt with the year-long suspension of 12 BJP MLAs from the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for disorderly conduct. Parliament or the State legislatures are no places to create a ruckus. “It is a place where policies and laws are propounded for governing the citizenry. It is here that the entire range of activities concerning the masses until the last mile, are discussed and their destinies are shaped,” Justice Khanwilkar, who authored the judgment, wrote. The goal of the House was to ensure the welfare and happiness of “we the people of this nation”. The court pointed out that Parliament and Assemblies were becoming more and more an intransigent place. “The philosophical tenet that one must agree to disagree is seldom seen during debates... It has become common to hear that the House could not complete its usual scheduled business and most of the time had been spent in jeering and personal attacks against each other,” it noted. The Bench, including Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and C.T. Ravikumar, said disheartened observers felt it was high time to take corrective steps. Justice Khanwilkar observed, “Aggression during the debates has no place in the setting of country governed by the Rule of Law. Even a complex issue needs to be resolved in a congenial atmosphere by observing collegiality and showing full respect and deference towards each other”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/engage-in-debates-in-the-house-not-in-ridiculing-each-other-sc/article64991166.ece

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:35 IST,||Study raises concerns on NeoCov||A single molecular change in the lab enabled a coronavirus called NeoCov to “efficiently infect” human cells using the same pathway that the SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect human cells, researchers from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China said in a report that is yet to be peer-reviewed. NeoCov has so far only been seen in bats and no instances have been reported in people. With NeoCov closely related to the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses — traditionally more lethal but less transmissible than SARS-CoV-2, the study has raised concern that this too may lethally proliferate in people. In their study, which is available on the online pre-print server bioRxiv.org, the scientists set out to find out the ways in which NeoCov, a coronavirus known to be 85% similar to MERS coronaviruses, infected animal cells. The SARS-CoV-2, for instance, spreads the way it does because it has figured out a way to use the enzyme called human angiotensin converter 2 (hACE2) to infect cells. The scientists reported that they have, for the first time, shown NeoCov too uses bat ACE2. However this ACE2 is specific to the sub-species of bat and when the scientists checked if the NeoCov could use hACE2, it turned out to be a “less favourable” mode of entry. A single molecular barrier, close to where the virus bound to cells, “restricted” the human ACE2 from aiding a NeoCov infection. However when a mutation was artificially introduced, it made the NeoCov 15-30 times more efficient at infecting human ACE2. Moreover, the study said, the infection could not be suppressed by antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV.  Vinod Scaria, principal scientist, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, told The Hindu that an artificially created mutation in the lab didn’t imply the same could easily occur in natural settings.  Rajeev Jayadevan, physician and former president of the Indian Medical Association, in a Twitter thread said that NeoCov was discovered in 2013-14 and “nothing has happened”. Despite similarities, the ACE2 receptors of bats and people were different and the odds of a sudden jump were low.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wuhan-study-raises-concerns-on-neocov/article64991147.ece

Responding to the recent outreach of Home Minister Amit Shah, Mr. Singh says the politics of hate and development cannot co-exist. Edited excerpts:  How do you see the latest overtures by the BJP? It is part of their clever political strategy. They want to isolate the Jat community and they want to send a message to other communities by giving us a tag of Jat leaders. It is not a well-intentioned invitation. Looking at our struggle and the way people are accepting us, I cannot accept it. What is the core difference between BJP and RLD? It is their divisive politics. You cannot get away by saying that economy is okay, the farm sector is doing fine but we want to alienate Muslims. The two things can’t coexist. True development can’t happen without social harmony. But you have worked with the BJP in the past. In fact, in 2009, when you were last elected an MP, you were in an alliance with them. At that time, there was a structure of the National Democratic Alliance for coordination. [Now] You can see centralisation of power in BJP, both the government and the party. They are not being able to manage their allies. JD(U) is the latest example. Don’t you think the recent BJP invitation was a result of fault lines that emerged in the alliance on ticket distribution? These things happen. There are always a few issues and everyone can’t get what they want. We both have sacrificed and are united in this contest. Did the Jat pride get hurt because of the SP’s big brother approach? In every alliance, you talk on unequal terms. Your negotiating power is limited to your presence and your numbers. Every big organisation will try to squeeze the smaller one. It is always about what best you can achieve. And I think we have. Is your core voter aligned to the idea of the RLD being presented as a party of farmers and workers? If I am ambitious or maybe audacious, like Chaudhary Charan Singh was, I don’t think those who are our well-wishers would mind it. They will want me to go ahead with my work. Even a section of the media tags us as a Jat party, but I reject that. Caste is something in India that you are born into. I am proud of it but that is not my sole socio-political identity. What is your take on the Muzaffarnagar riots and what are you doing to heal the pain? There could be deep-rooted problems related to social cohesion and the riots were just one thing that came up. We are trying to rebuild social ties that were snapped. That doesn’t happen overnight. The electoral process has a role to play here because when people vote together they start realising the importance of interdependence. When Hindus and Muslims vote together for us, it will help rebuild harmony. That’s the real social engineering. But you haven’t given ticket to Muslims in any of the six Assembly seats in the district with around 40% Muslim population. Were you apprehensive about the polarisation of votes? We don’t believe that the votes will be polarised. If we believe that, it will strengthen the BJP’s argument. Not giving ticket to Muslims in Muzaffarnagar was not a conscious decision. We have given two out of three in Shamli, four out of seven in Meerut. So there is representation. When you are in an alliance, you have to also take into account what your alliance partner wants. The SP seems to be avoiding embracing Muslim community in public. I can only say you cannot combat polarisation by being a silent spectator to hatred. You have to be aggressive and vocal. The BJP is highlighting the Samajwadi Party as a political entity that protects criminal elements. Even Chaudhary Ajit Singh once described it as a goonda party.  I have no qualms in saying that during that phase we were in Opposition. Even Akhilesh ji after having sat for five years in Opposition realised it. There has been a growth in his personality and leadership.  Why are you not contesting the Assembly election? My vision is at the national level; there is a strong political vacuum for voices that are connected with the grassroots, who understand farmers’ issues and are vocal on these issues. I think that is the constituency that I need to represent and my ambition is to help our party grow across regional identities.

Shiv Sena leader and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab said, “This is for the first time that a court has interfered in the proceedings of the legislature. We will go through the detailed order but since it has been mentioned that constitutional positions shouldn’t be kept vacant for more than six months, similar rule should be applied for vacant 12 MLC posts where the Governor, despite State Cabinet clearing the names, is not giving a go-ahead.” Sena MLA Bhaskar Jadhav, who was the pro tem Assembly Speaker when the incident took place and BJP MLAs allegedly hurled abuses, said the court has given the verdict but ultimately it is the Assembly Speaker who will decide on whether to allow the re-entry of MLAs. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and State Minister Nawab Malik said the decision to suspend MLAs was not taken by the State government but by the legislature. “Let the full order copy be received by legislative Secretariat. Future course of action will be decided after reading it,” the NCP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/action-sought-on-vacant-mlc-seats/article38342020.ece

The district administration had made adequate arrangements to prevent any untoward incident. Earlier, the police had booked hundreds of students for protesting in more than 12 districts.  The Opposition mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) had supported the students’ protest and at many places the student wing of these political parties could be seen enforcing the bandh.  Jan Adhikar Party leader and former Madhepura MP Rajesh Ranjan, alias Pappu Yadav, hit the roads in Patna with his supporters. He attacked the Central government for “committing fraud on students preparing for competitive examinations”. The student wing of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Left parties too came out on the roads. The ruling NDA constituents Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) extended their moral support to the bandh. In Patna, the bandh supporters burnt tyres on Ashok Rajpath and demonstrated at Dak Bungalow thoroughfare. They even clashed with police personnel who stopped them from marching towards the Raj Bhavan. In Vaishali, Supaul, Samastipur, Buxar, Jehanabad, Bhagalpur, Katihar, Darbhanga, Begusarai, and Munger the supporters disrupted movement of trains. Meanwhile, one of the six teachers of coaching institutes who were booked by Patna district administration allegedly for inciting students, appealed to students to stay calm. “I appeal to you all with my folded hands to stay away from such a bandh call as miscreants can take advantage of your protest and moreover, the Central government has conceded to all your demands”, Faizal Khan, who is popular as “Khan Sir”, said in a video.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-bandh-evokes-mixed-response/article64991175.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:35 IST,||Congress draws up list of key issues||Ahead of the Budget session, the Parliamentary Strategy Group of the Congress virtually met on Friday and decided to work with like-minded parties to raise important issues such as the Omicron variant, the alleged Chinese intrusion, inflation, the recent incidents of hate speeches and targeted violence against religious minorities. A virtual meeting, presided by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, saw Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge identify several issues, including some that could not be taken up in the previous session. Some of these key issues include disinvestment of Air India, a relief package for the families of COVID-19 victims, the downturn in the Indian economy among others. Since the first part of the Budget session, that gets underway on January 31, will have about 10 working days and there will not be enough time for separate discussions on each issue, some of the concerns will be put forth by the Congress members in the Motion of Thanks to the presidential address. Zero Hour Party leaders will also use Zero Hour — when an individual MP can raise any issue of public importance — to flag some of these concerns. Ms. Gandhi is also learnt to have told the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, to ensure that the first speaker from the party or senior leaders don’t end up exhausting the time allotted to the party. The strategy group also discussed reports of violence against Christians and their places of worship during Christmas from different parts of the country. Ms. Gandhi is then said to have informed her colleagues about receiving a letter from a senior party member from Karnataka about such attacks. Apart from Ms. Gandhi, Mr. Kharge and Mr. Chowdhury, the strategy group includes senior party leaders A.K. Antony, K.C. Venugopal, Anand Sharma, Jairam Ramesh, K. Suresh, Manickam Tagore, Manish Tewari and Gaurav Gogoi. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also a member of the group but he did not attend Friday’s meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-draws-up-list-of-key-issues/article64991146.ece

We would lay our lives for the cause of farmers and to save the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb [syncretic tradition] of the region,” said Mr. Yadav after taking a pledge over foodgrains with RLD chief Chaudhary Jayant Singh.   Mr. Yadav and Mr. Singh held joint press conferences in Muzaffarnagar and Meerut. Party sources said the conferences were called after the BJP tried to create confusion among different communities. Mr. Yadav said the BJP was busy raising dated questions while the youth was being humiliated on the streets in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for asking for employment. “Those who are talking of palayan [exodus], we will ensure their political exodus from the State in March,” he said. Taking a dig at Yogi Adityanath, Mr. Yadav said he had already been sent to political oblivion by his party after denying him ticket from Ayodhya or Mathura.  On the question of defections in the SP, Mr. Yadav said workers moving from one party to another was common before elections. “But the real big-ticket defections have happened in the BJP and it has not been able to find their replacement,” said Mr. Yadav, referring to the switching of three OBC Ministers from the BJP to the SP. Both the leaders accused the BJP of flouting COVID-19 rules during the door-to-door campaign and appealed to the Election Commission to take note of it. Mr. Yadav reiterated the SP’s promise for setting up a corpus for farmers, ensuring payment of sugar cane dues on time and 300 units of free electricity. Earlier, he cast aspersions on the government for not being able to reach Muzaffarnagar on time. “My helicopter was not allowed to take off without any apparent reason. I thank whoever made this visit possible,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sons-of-farmers-take-pledge-of-solidarity/article64991160.ece

Generally, the proportion of enterprises owned by Scheduled Caste entrepreneurs in the overall national tally of MSMEs is 6%.  Tamil Nadu with 42,997 enterprises and Rajasthan with 38,517 units occupy the second and third slots, according to the data furnished by the Office of the Development Commissioner in the Union Ministry of MSME exclusively to The Hindu regarding the number of SC-owned enterprises covered under the Udyam system of registration.  The fourth, fifth and sixth slots belong to Uttar Pradesh (36,913 units), Karnataka (28,803 enterprises) and Punjab (24,503 units) respectively. As on January 23, 2022, the number of SC-owned enterprises at the all-India level was 4,53,972, of which micro enterprises accounted for 4,50,835, small — 3,004 and medium — 133. The Udyam system of registration, which came into force on July 1, 2020, is a pre-requisite for any MSME (regardless of the social category of ownership) to avail itself of concessions or benefits from the Central and State governments and the last date for migration to Udyam has been extended up to March 31, 2022, said K.K. Sharma, General Manager, National SC/ST Hub. Government schemes Mr. Sharma, however, clarified that this stipulation is only in respect of MSMEs, which want to get covered under schemes of the governments including priority sector lending of banks. Otherwise, the enterprises, which had registered themselves under the previous system such as Udyog Aadhar Memorandum (UAM), can carry on their business. A perusal of the data on registration of enterprises under the two systems — Udyam (July 1, 2020 to January 23, 2022) and UAM (September 1, 2015 to June 30, 2020) — revealed that under the latter system, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were in the first, third and fourth places with 1,46,244 enterprises; 1,33,552 and 1,08,715 enterprises respectively whereas, under Udyam, their numbers stood at 23,195, 36,913 and 19,875 respectively. Asked about the wide variation in the numbers of registered units with regard to the northern States, Mr. Sharma and Milind Kamble, founder chairman of the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (DICCI), explained that the Udyam system of registration is more streamlined than the previous Udyog Aadhar Memorandum. There is no room for duplication under the new system, which has a provision for integration with the GSTN (Goods and Services Tax Network).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/6-of-msmes-owned-by-sc-entrepreneurs/article64991149.ece

Addressing the annual PM’s National Cadet Corps (NCC) rally at the Delhi Cantonment, Mr. Modi said steps are being taken to empower the Corps and a high-level review committee has been formed. Over one lakh new NCC cadets have been added in border areas in the last two years, Mr. Modi said, calling upon more girls to join the organisation. Calling on NCC cadets to ensure that their schools and colleges are free from the menace of drugs, Mr. Modi said, “You know very well how much drug addiction ruins our young generation. Therefore, how can drugs reach the school-college where there is NCC-NSS? As a cadet, you yourself should be free from drugs, as well as make your campus free from drugs.” The Prime Minister said India’s youth has taken the nation to the top 3 in the world in terms of start-ups and unicorns created during COVID showing their strength. Over 50 unicorns came into existence during COVID, Mr. Modi stated. “It is your responsibility to ensure that the things you’ve learned in the NCC are put into action not only when you’re in your uniform, but also in society. You can form several teams in your areas, apply it in your societies and make changes at the ground level,” he said. Referring to the NCC as an elective course in academic curriculum, the PM said 90 universities across the country have chosen the NCC as an elective subject. Stating that the number of girl cadets shows that India’s ideas are changing, Mr. Modi said the nation needs their participation and service and there are immense opportunities for women in several sectors. “Now the daughters of the country are taking admission in Sainik Schools. The daughters of the country are flying fighter planes in the Air Force.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:34 IST,||Verdict a slap on face of MVA govt.: Fadnavis||The Supreme Court’s decision overruling the Maharashtra Assembly’s suspension last year of 12 BJP MLAs was a “tight slap on the face” of the ruling tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, former Chief Minister and BJP Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said on Friday. Mr. Fadnavis stated that the Uddhav Thackeray-led government (of the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress) often acted as though it was above the Constitution. He accused the MVA of ‘conspiring’ to suspend the MLAs as they had been fighting for the rights of the OBC community. “I would like to thank the Supreme Court for its decision. It has rightly pointed out that the government had acted ‘illegally’ and ‘irrationally’. The government feels they are above the Constitution and hence they had suspended the 12 MLAs on a false narrative based on events in the presiding officer’s [Shiv Sena leader Bhaskar Jadhav] chamber that never occurred,” he said in Goa. ‘Gross injustice’ Mr. Fadnavis, who is also the BJP’s Goa election in-charge, further demanded an apology from the MVA government as its undemocratic action had been “a gross injustice” to the people who had elected the 12 MLAs. The legislators were suspended on July 5 last from the Assembly after the government accused them of allegedly misbehaving with Mr. Jadhav. However, based on pleas field by these MLAs, the Supreme Court today had held that a resolution suspending them beyond the period of the remainder of the session held in July 2021 was “unconstitutional” and “irrational”. Mr. Fadnavis noted that the top court had unequivocally said that wherever the State Legislature did not respect the Constitution, the court would have to intervene. “The Supreme Court had even given a chance to the government to correct itself and had directed the legislature to revoke the suspensions of the MLAs after they had presented themselves in the Assembly…But this government is so arrogant that it refused to take back its decision. Accordingly, the apex court had to step into the affairs of the legislature and the court has now quashed the resolution. We demand an apology from the government for its unconstitutional conduct,” he said. Mr. Fadnavis alleged that the order suspending the BJP MLAs could not have been issued without the tacit consent of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/verdict-a-slap-on-face-of-mva-govt-fadnavis/article64991164.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:34 IST,||SC quashes suspension of 12 BJP MLAs||The court held that the such suspensions would cripple the Opposition’s ability to effectively participate in the discussion/debate in the House owing to the constant fear of its members being suspended for longer period.  “There would be no purposeful or meaningful debates but one in terrorem and as per the whims of the majority. That would not be healthy for the democracy as a whole,” it observed. It explained that suspension was essentially a disciplinary measure.   Justice Khanwilkar said, “Suspension for a period of one year would assume the character of punitive and punishment worse than expulsion. Suspension for long period and beyond the session has the effect of creating a de facto vacancy though not a dejure vacancy”.  Suspension of members or their withdrawal was meant to protect the House from disturbances or obstruction. The power of suspension was different from the privilege to inflict punishment on a member, he stated. The law required the Speaker to adopt a “graded approach”, based on objective and rational standards to ensure that the House functioned smoothly. The Bench had orally agreed during the hearing that prolonged suspension was worse than disqualification from the House.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-quashes-suspension-of-12-bjp-mlas/article38342034.ece

India’s comments come against the backdrop of Russia’s discussion with the permanent members of the UN Security Council. The Embassy of Russia in a statement said the military situation is linked with the West’s quest for dominating the energy sector. “We have been closely following the developments relating to Ukraine, including ongoing high-level discussions between Russia and the U.S. Our Embassy in Kyiv is also monitoring local developments. We call for a peaceful resolution of the situation through sustained diplomatic efforts for long term peace and stability in the region and beyond,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. The military situation has prompted the United States and the United Kingdom to evacuate their officials from Ukrainian capital Kyiv, though India has not evacuated its diplomats. Deputy Chief of Mission of the Embassy of Russia Roman Babushkin on Friday said that tension is being generated to prevent Europe from collaborating with Russia on the energy front. ‘Artificially created’ “Tensions are artificially created provoking the conflict to disable Europe from cooperating with Russia which is being increasingly sanctioned. This is a clear act of unlawful competition and narrow-minded geopolitics,” said Mr. Babushkin. “The West is yet to respond to the Russian red lines with regard to the non-expansion of NATO eastwards, non-deployment of offensive weapons near the Russian borders and refusal of provocative military activities. Russia has no logic and interest to attack anyone — we are for pragmatic and mutually respectful dialogue,” said Mr. Babushkin.

Nageswara Rao, Sanjiv Khanna and B.R. Gavai noted. “In addition, the prevailing local conditions, which may require to be factored in, might not be uniform… In the light of Jarnail Singh and Nagaraj, we cannot lay down any yardstick for determining the inadequacy of representation,” the Bench said. In respect of the unit of collection of quantifiable data, the court held that the State is “obligated to collect quantifiable data on the inadequacy of representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes” for reservation in promotions in public employment. The court underscored that the “collection of information on inadequacy of representation of SC/ST communities cannot be with reference to the entire service or class/group, but it should be relatable to the grade/category of posts to which the promotion is sought”. Explaining why ‘cadre’ should be the unit for the purpose of collection of quantifiable data in relation to promotional posts, the court said otherwise the entire exercise of reservation in promotions would be rendered meaningless if data pertaining to the representation of SCs and STs is done with reference to the entire service. The term ‘cadre’ means the strength of a service or part of a service sanctioned as a separate unit. It is the choice of a State to constitute cadres. The entire service cannot be considered to be a cadre for the purpose of promotion from one post to a higher post in a different grade. Promotion is made from one grade to the next higher grade, in relation to which cadres are constituted||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-must-decide-on-quota-in-promotion-sc/article38342035.ece

This is the first export order for the missile, a joint product of India and Russia. The contract was signed by Delfin N. Lorenzana, Defence Secretary of the Philippines, and Atul Dinkar Rane, Director General of BrahMos Aerospace Pvt. Ltd., in a virtual ceremony. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Mr. Lorenzana said it was an absolute honour to be the first foreign nation to acquire the supersonic cruise missile system. “As the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missiles, the BrahMos missiles will provide deterrence against any attempt to undermine their sovereignty and sovereign rights, especially in the West Philippine Sea,” he said. “Equipping our Navy with this vital asset is imperative as the Philippines continues to protect the integrity of its territory and defend its national interests.” Stating that BrahMos missiles would certainly beef up the firepower of the Philippine Navy, particularly the Philippine Marine Corps coastal defence regiment, Mr. Lorenzana said the system would provide counter-attack capabilities within the Philippine exclusive economic zone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/philippines-inks-375-mn-brahmos-missile-deal/article64991168.ece

Let me underline that India has a positive approach on this matter and is willing to engage the Pakistani side,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi in response to a question from The Hindu. The government hoped that the current time period when COVID-19 restrictions were in place could be “utilised to hold discussions under the bilateral protocol”, he said and hoped to facilitate “early exchange of visits to all shrines of interest to pilgrims”.  While the MEA’s statement indicates the permissions requested for flights beginning January 29 have not been granted at present, the offer of talks with Pakistan on renegotiating the protocol is a rare departure from other issues where both sides have suspended talks for several years. Sources noted that India had conveyed its position to Pakistan through formal channels as well, and officials on both sides could meet early next week to iron out the details of how to upgrade the protocols which mandate up to 20 visits by each side to the other, of groups, including Hindu, Muslim and Sikh pilgrims. The new proposal, sent by the PHC, calls for pilgrim flights every month from each country to the other side, to give a push to its “faith tourism initiative”. “Even if there is some delay in agreeing to the flights, it is heartening that both governments are positive about the proposal,” its head Ramesh Kumar Vankwani said.

Bharti shares gained 1.23% to close at Rs. 715.90 on the BSE as investors cheered the investment plan. Bharti and Google will work together to build on the Indian firm’s extensive offerings that cover a range of Android-enabled devices to consumers via innovative affordability programmes. Together, the companies would continue to explore further opportunities to bring down the barriers of owning a smartphone across a range of price points, in partnership with various device manufacturers. “Today, we announced a deepening of our already very strong partnership with Google,” Gopal Vittal, MD & CEO, Bharti Airtel (India and South Asia), told analysts on a conference call. “Our partnership is really related to strengthening what we have been already working on for over a decade and, in specific, on three broad areas to fire up the digital ecosystem — devices, networks and cloud adoption.” Mr Vittal, however, clarified that Bharti Airtel has no plans to build its own device but instead intends to partner across the ecosystem to accelerate the adoption of smartphones from feature phones. Replying to a query on conflict of interest given that Google had also invested in Jio, Mr. Vittal said digitally connecting a large market like India with 1.3 billion people, required a “multi-pronged approach”. In a joint blog post, Jamie Rosenberg, vice-president, strategy & operations, Platforms and Ecosystems at Google, and Sanjay Gupta, country head & vice-president, Google India, said that with this partnership, the company is excited about creating new and innovative business models to help grow the Android OEM ecosystem in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/google-to-invest-up-to-1-bn-in-bharti-airtel/article38342039.ece

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:34 IST,||Mantras of the Goddess||We wear flowers because they give fragrance to our hair. In the past, men too wore flowers. But devotees of Ambal need no ornamentation for, they bear Her feet on their head. Abirami Bhattar emphasises this in verse six of his Abirami Andadi, said M.A. Manickavelu in a discourse. Appar said Lord Siva’s feet were like flowers on Appoodi Adigal’s head. Bhattar says that mantras about Abirami are always in his mind. Mantras can be recited in three ways — vachika, upamsu and maanasa. In the vachika method, a mantra is recited audibly so that others can hear it. In upamsu, the person recites the mantra in a low voice, which cannot be heard by others. In maanasa japa, he recites the mantra in his mind. No one hears the mantra, not even the one reciting it. Mantras bring benefits to the one doing japa. Maanasa is said to be the best form of reciting a mantra, but it is difficult, because it requires intense concentration. If we utter the beejaksharas of the Goddess, we will receive Her blessings. Mantras of the Goddess are of many kinds — ekakshari, panchakshari, navakshari and shodakshari. Each mantra has a dhyana sloka which must be recited first. Dhyana slokas have descriptions of the different forms of Shakti. When we recite a mantra, we must keep in mind the form described by the dhyana sloka of that mantra and focus on the form of the Goddess described in that particular dhyana sloka. Bhattar speaks of mantras in verse six, to show that he always keeps the form of Goddess Abirami in his mind. Bhattar talks of paddhati, which is a reference to Agamas. He also uses the word ‘pannudal,’ which means repeating. Kamban says of Hanuman, ‘pannuvan.’ This is because of Hanuman’s repetition of Rama nama.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mantras-of-the-goddess/article38342047.ece

Addressing ex-servicemen in the State, Mr. Shah said, “Under the leadership of our young Chief Minister Dhami in the next five years, we promise a government that works with speed and transparency,” adding that the Dhami government had “the blessing” of Mr. Modi. The Home Minister’s statement comes as Congress, the Opposition party in the State, continued to attack the BJP for having three Chief Ministers in its five-year term. Mr. Dhami took charge in July 2021. Mr. Shah spent the day campaigning in Uttarakhand for the February 14 Assembly polls, starting with a visit to Rudranath Temple, followed by a door-to-door campaign in Rudraprayag and addresses to ex-servicemen, women and Scheduled Caste groups. Policies for the forces In his speech to ex-servicemen, Mr. Shah appealed to them to lead the way towards good governance in the State by choosing the BJP. To cite BJP’s policies for the forces, he highlighted the steps taken by the Modi government, which included increasing the defence budget, implementing the One Rank, One Pension scheme and the 2016 surgical strike over the Line of Control. Hitting out at former Congress Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Harish Rawat, Mr. Shah said the Rawat government had been one of “corruption and scams”, while there had been no allegation of corruption against the BJP government since it took office in 2017. He said if the government in Uttarakhand changed, projects like the Char Dham road, construction of toilets and distribution of gas cylinders would get stalled despite the Centre sending funds. In a dig at Mr. Rawat’s seat being changed, Mr. Shah said he had “finally set his own seat”. “You have done enough, now it’s the turn of our young Chief Minister,” Mr. Shah said. He said there was a need to improve education, health and employment to stop the migration of the youth from the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dhami-will-lead-govt-for-5-years-shah/article64991157.ece

Sivadasan, in a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, said, “The very natural process of childbearing cannot become a disqualification.” Denying a woman the opportunity to join the service also impacts her seniority, he said. He also pointed out that in 2009 the SBI had corrected its anachronistic practice of asking women candidates to declare details of their menstrual cycle to defer posting/promotion during pregnancy. CPI MP Binoy Viswam also wrote to Ms. Sitharaman. “Insulting pregnancy is a crime towards motherhood.

The last version, published in 1966, does not reflect the ground reality any more. The update is aimed at reflecting the contemporary set-up in the administration of museums. The 1966 version was only for the then Madras Government Museum and the National Art Gallery at Egmore and the Government Museum at Pudukottai, the first district museum in the State. “Other district museums were guided by the manual that was issued for these two museums. Many museums have been established since, but the manual does not reflect the reality any more,” a source pointed out. In December 2021, the government constituted a committee to update the manual. The decision was made after a panel from the office of Accountant-General pointed out that the manual had not been updated for over five decades. The manual lays down the procedures to be followed in the Department of Museums, the mandate of each post and the registers and other documents to be maintained by the Department.  An official told The Hindu that the committee should emphasise the administration of the Treasure Trove Act, 1878, and the procedure for acquiring treasure trove articles. “Though the existing manual mentions that the Revenue Department should bear the expenses towards shifting a trove from the site to the museum, quite often the Revenue Department rejects the responsibility.”  The official hoped the updated manual would mandate filling of posts being managed with the existing staff members. Besides the headquarters museum in Chennai, there are 23 district museums across the State, and at least seven of them are additionally held by curators. “Seven curators are given the additional charge of seven district museums. This should be avoided,” he said. The 23 district museums are located in Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Erode, Kancheepuram, Kanniyakumari, Karur, Krishnagiri, Madurai, Nagapattinam, Palani, Pudukkottai, Ramanathapuram, Salem, Sivaganga, the Nilgiris, Theni, Tiruchi, Tirunelveli, Tiruvannamalai, Tiruvarur, Vellore and Virudhunagar. Of them, the museums in Cuddalore, Pudukkottai, the Nilgiris, Tiruchi and Tirunelveli are functioning at heritage buildings. There is also a fossil museum in Ariyalur. Besides the 24 museums under the control of the Department of Museums, the Department of Archaeology maintains 14 archaeological site museums. Meanwhile, a new site museum at Kondagai in Sivaganga is being constructed to showcase the artefacts excavated at Keeladi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/museum-manual-being-updated-in-tn-after-over-five-decades/article64991230.ece

Panneerselvam, now a Member of the Legislative Assembly representing Bodinayakkanur, and his son P. Ravindranath, a Member of Parliament representing Theni, have approached the Madras High Court to quash two First Information Reports (FIRs) registered against them for allegedly furnishing false information regarding their assets and income in the election affidavits filed in 2021 and 2019 respectively. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar on Friday directed the Theni District Crime Branch and the complainant, P. Milany, to respond by Tuesday. In their identical quash petitions, the father-son duo, belonging to the AIADMK, stated that the complainant was a member of their rival party, the DMK. However, he had suppressed the fact while lodging the complaint before a judicial magistrate designated as a special court for cases against legislators in Theni. The Magistrate too, without ascertaining the veracity of the complaint, forwarded it to the DCB and the latter immediately registered the two FIRs for the offence under Section 125A of the Representation of the People Act of 1951, the petitioners said. They argued that the complaint was not maintainable at all since the complainant had already filed election petitions against them before the High Court on same grounds. Stating that even a member of an opponent political party was entitled to file election petitions challenging their victory and that they were already defending those petitions before the High Court, the duo said, the complainant would not be entitled to institute criminal proceedings too parallelly. They also contended that complaints regarding false affidavits could be lodged only with the Election Commission of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ops-son-move-court-to-get-firs-quashed/article64991255.ece

Passing orders on a petition seeking information on traffic flow on the Chamiers Road in Nandanam, State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj said there was only one website for the Tamil Nadu police which was also not in compliance with the provisions under Section 4 of the Right to Information Act. While other authorities like the Greater Chennai Corporation had an exclusive website, apart from the State government’s website, the Greater Chennai Police and its Traffic Wing did not have separate website to provide information to the people. Mr. Muthuraj referred to Maharashtra and West Bengal where the Mumbai police and Kolkata police had their own websites to provide information on each and every police station, contact details of police officials in-charge of the police station and so on. Invoking provisions under Section 3 and 4 of the RTI Act that explain the right to information of citizens and the obligation on the part of the public authorities toprovidesuch information, the State Information Commissioner said “every information shall be disseminated widely and in such form and manner which is easily accessible to the public.” Accessible information Quoting further from the Act, he said “all material shall be disseminated taking into consideration the cost-effectiveness, local language and the most effective method of communication in that local area and the information should be easily accessible, to the extent possible in electronic format, with the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, available free or at such cost of the medium or the print cost price as may be prescribed.” Mr. Muthuraj directed the Public Information Officer of the Greater Chennai Police to create a website without any delay in compliance with the provisions of the Act and publish information regarding police stations with jurisdiction, map, contact particulars of the police officials in-charge, apart from the online services offered to the people. On the issue raised by R. Natrajan, a research scholar, the Commission directed the PIO to disclose details on ‘free left’provision on Bus Route no. 471 in Corporation limits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-police-told-to-launch-website/article64991497.ece

The parties included the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar), led by G.K.Vasan; the Puratchi Bharatham, led by Kilvaithinankuppam MLA Jagan Moorthy; and the Samuga Samuthuva Padai, led by former IAS officer P. Sivakami. However, no representative came from the BJP, which faced the 2019 Lok Sabha election and the subsequent rural local bodies elections, apart from the 2021 Assembly election and another round of the rural local bodies elections, in alliance with the AIADMK. Two AIADMK leaders said the initiative for the discussions came from the smaller parties because party coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami were in the city to hold an inner-party meeting. If any agreement was clinched, it would be based on local conditions. No number of seats would be fixed in advance. At the district level, the party functionaries had short-listed candidates and forwarded the lists to the headquarters for clearance. The lists would be released in a few days, the leaders added. Briefing reporters after the two-hour meeting, organisation secretary D. Jayakumar, replying to a question on the party’s candidates for the post of mayors, said the question did not arise at all as there would be an indirect system of election for the post. Asked whether he considered the absence of the PMK a loss to his party, he replied that if others joined hands with his party, “everyone will benefit. This applies to all”. It was learnt that Ms. Sivakami sought 12 wards in the municipal corporations of Chennai, Avadi, Tambaram and Kancheepuram, besides the municipality of Uthiramerur. She also expressed her desire to contest from a ward in Chennai. BJP non-committal The BJP leadership in Tamil Nadu remained non-committal on its alliance with the AIADMK for the urban local bodies elections, with senior leader Pon. Radhakrishnan saying on Friday that president K. Annamalai was empowered to take a decision. “Mr. Annamalai has been given the power to decide on the alliance with the AIADMK. We are not ready to talk about it now as we have our interview process to select candidates. We cannot think about the alliance now,” he said after a meeting of the party members to discuss the preparations. Tamil Nadu co-in-charge Sudhakar Reddy said, “As a political party, we are getting ready to face the election. They [the AIADMK] are part of the NDA. You will come to know within a couple of days [about the alliance]”. ‘Started preparations’ Mr. Radhakrishnan said the party had started its poll preparations two months ago and would interview candidates over the next two days. Then, Mr. Annamalai would announce the candidates. The selected candidates would start filing nominations after January 31. He refused to answer the question of alliance even while the AIADMK entered into talks with the Tamil Maanila Congress. The relationship between the two parties is under strain following remarks made by BJP MLA and former AIADMK leader Nainar Nagenthiran against the AIADMK during a protest to seek justice for a girl student who died in Thanjavur district.

More than its interest in the usual reptiles, the duo found a new amphibious fish more interesting since last year — Mudskippers. They are found only in a few estuaries and mangroves unlike other fish and amphibious species, says Aravind Manoj, a techie. He and his his friend Sudharshan Kuselan are attempting to document mudskippers and their habitats and the duo has been in touch with academicians researching on the species. “We were actually looking for the dog-faced water snake in Ennore and that was when we chanced upon mudskippers. Initially, we were surprised to see this species and had several questions about them. So, I looked for more information about mudskippers and got to know they are rare and are found only in estuaries and mangroves.” They have taken images and are comparing notes with academicians researching mudskippers. Mr. Kuselan, who accompanies Mr. Aravind almost every time he goes ‘herping’, says they found only three mudskipper species in Ennore initially but later they found two more in the surrounding areas. Mr. Sudharshan into wildlife photography and he visits forest areas in and around the city. G. Mahadevan, Research Associate in Centre of Advanced Study in Marine Biology in Parangipettai, part of Annamalai University, says 13 mudskipper species are found in India. “My doctorate was in mudskippers and I have surveyed mudskippers in estuaries along with entire east coast upto the Sunderbans. In Tamil Nadu, they are found near Ennore, Pichavaram and Muthupettai.” Mudskippers are said to be ‘pollution indicators,’ he says: “When the pollution level in that locality rises, some studies suggest that the mudskippers move elsewhere. Since they burrow, they are believed to benefit the entire mangrove ecosystem.” He said he has read reports of mudskippers located from Gujarat in the north upto Karnataka in the South on the west coast.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mudskippers-spotted-at-ennore-estuary/article64991233.ece

Seethalakshmi, a trained carnatic singer and a teacher, came to Apollo Proton Cancer Centre a few months ago with an advanced stage of breast cancer which had spread to other parts of the body, particularly lungs. Ms. Seethalakshmi, who had stayed away from allopathic medicine and tried alternative medicine for a few years, was barely able to talk. Manjula Rao, consultant oncoplastic breast surgeon at the hospital, said that chemotherapy and targeted therapy significantly improved her condition. She was able to sing and resume online music classes for her students. However, she had to subsequently undergo a palliative mastectomy for her ulcerated breast tumour. According to the doctors, she could not be administered general anaesthesia for the procedure as her lungs were affected due to the cancer. Performing the surgical procedure under general anaesthesia was risky and may have necessitated ventilator and ICU care for many days,” said D. Indumathi, consultant anaesthesiologist at the hospital. She said it was decided to perform epidural anaesthesia, which involved delivering the anaesthetic through a small catheter placed just inside the epidural space that is outside the spinal cord. Mild sedation Ms. Seethalakshmi was counselled by the doctors to reduce her anxiety about the procedure. They said that it was decided to mildly sedate her during the procedure to mitigate the anxiety. On the day of the procedure, the doctors played soothing music for Ms. Seethalakshmi. As her sedation wore off, she chatted with the doctors and sang a few lines of the songKarpoora bommai ondru, composed by Ilaiyaraja for the movieKeladi Kanmani. “It is one of my favourite songs. It is a lullaby I sang for my children. There is a particular line in the song’s pallavi that can be sung properly only if your lung capacity is normal. Ever since my condition deteriorated, I used to sing this song often and record to see how well I was able to sing. With the treatment, I was able to get better and now sing it normally,” she said. She thanked the doctors and other staff at the hospital for their sensitivity and personal attention. Dr. Rao said that Ms. Seethalakshmi’s case was an example of how counselling, keeping the patient well informed of various options, and shared decision making, can help them go through critical surgery with such ease. Harish Trivedi, chief executive officer, and Rakesh Jaleli, medical director of the hospital, congratulated the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/music-helps-woman-remain-calm-during-mastectomy/article38342379.ece

Joseph Vijay has filed a new writ petition in the Madras High Court challenging a notice issued by Commercial Taxes Department on September 17, 2021 demanding Rs. 7.98 lakh as entry tax, along with penalty of Rs. 30.23 lakh for having imported a BMW X5 luxury car from the U.S. in 2005. Justice C. Saravanan on Friday directed the Additional Government Pleader Richardson Wilson to take notice on behalf of the department and obtain instructions by Tuesday. He clubbed the actor’s case with similar writ petitions already filed by film musician Harris Jayaraj and Adyar Gate Hotels for hearing them together. When the actor’s counsel A.N.R. Jayaprathap submitted to the court that government officials had threatened to initiate recovery proceedings him, the actor remitted Rs. 7.98 lakh under protest, the judge instructed the Additional Government Pleader to ensure that no coercive action was taken until the case was decided. The actor said he had imported the BMW, on payment of necessary import duty, since there were no authorised dealers in Chennai at that point of time. Then, there was also uncertainty over the applicability of Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor Vehicles into Local Areas Act of 1990. In one case related to entry tax, a single judge of the Madras High Court had followed Kerala High Court’s 1999 judgment in Fr. William Fernandez’s case and held that State government could not levy entry tax. However, another single judge had taken a contrary view and hence the matter was referred to a Division Bench. Finally, the issue got resolved only in 2017 when the Supreme Court overturned Kerala High Court’s verdict. In the meantime, Mr. Vijay said that he filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court in 2005 against demand of entry tax on his BMW and obtained an interim order to get the vehicle registered with the Regional Transport Office concerned. After using it for four years, he sold the vehicle to Deepak Murali in 2009. However, the 2005 writ petition remained pending and got dismissed by Justice M. Dhandapani only on June 28, 2019. Subsequently, the department had passed the assessment order and demanded the tax with penalty. Delayed response Since there was a delay in replying to the demand notice because the actor was busy with outdoor film shootings, the official concerned issued a recovery notice on December 17 stating that non-payment of Rs. 38.21 lakh could lead to attachment of bank accounts, movable properties and also civil arrest. “Therefore, the petitioner was constrained to pay Rs. 7.98 lakh under protest and challenge the September 17, 2021 order,” he said and urged the court to quash the demand notice as well as the subsequent recovery notice.  The actor said he sold the vehicle in 2009 but the writ petition remained pending in the court||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vijay-moves-hc-against-tax-on-his-bmw/article38342378.ece

He had taken the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and scored 249 marks. He was ranked 349 under the 7.5% reservation. K. Sivaprakasam, a retired zoology teacher of the Government High School at Indur in Dharmapuri district, said he was satisfying his dream and his parents’ wish. His son has just four months left to complete house surgeonship at the Kanyakumari Medical College Hospital. “I have mentored two students. One of my students, Sathish, has completed MBBS at the Coimbatore Medical College and is preparing for PG NEET,” Mr. Sivaprakasam said. Another student, S. Kumar, ranked fifth under the quota for government school students, was admitted to the Madras Medical College on Friday. Mr. Sivaprakasam’s parents are also retired government school teachers. His wife is an inspector at the Local Fund Audit Department. He said he had completed schooling at Thyagi Sivasubramania Siva Government Higher Secondary School and qualified as an MBC candidate. Mr. Sivaprakasam said his son had reasoned that he would deprive a younger candidate of a career if he chose to study. However, he was declared ineligible in the counselling hall as he did not do two years of higher secondary schooling. “I did one year of pre-university and joined college. Officials said I was ineligible to participate,” he explained, adding that he did not pursue the matter of how the selection committee considered him eligible if that was the case. “I had planned to forgo the seat anyway.” Director of Medical Education R. Narayana Babu said selection committee officials were flummoxed, too. “Two persons, one aged 58 and the other aged 61, had participated in the counselling. Both were rejected as they had done PUC, and did not have the mandatory 11th and 12th Standard,” he said. On how they managed to figure in the list of eligible candidates, Dr. Narayana Babu blamed it on the computerisation of data. “They have applied online, written the test, and based on the score they have been given ranks. There is no age bar on taking the test. All data are filled online. The computer generates all the details,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elderly-men-take-part-in-special-category-counselling-for-mbbs/article38342413.ece

An analysis of air quality data of cities including, Chennai, Coimbatore and Puducherry, by Greenpeace India has shown that the average pollution levels in these cities were much higher than the new WHO air quality guidelines. The study, which analyses data from the Central Pollution Control Board, indicates that air pollution was a public health crisis not only in north Indian cities but also in south Indian cities. Similarly, the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter that is 2.5 microns or less in size) has increasedby six to seven times inCoimbatore, andby four to five times inChennai and Puducherry. The levels arehigher thanthe World HealthOrganisation(WHO)revised standards but well within theNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Call for action Akanksha and Avinash Kumar Chanchal, the authors of the report, have called for a comprehensive, systemic and time-bound action to reduce the air pollution levels. “If we don’t act now, these south Indian cities too are not far from cities like Delhi in terms of the health and economic impact of air pollution,” they said. The Greenpeace study has suggested various steps to reduce pollution levels, among which is the need for introduction of new NAAQSbased on WHO air quality guidelines. Governments need to seek alternatives to burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry.It calls for establishment ofcar-free days or zones in cities toalleviate pollutionandillustrate that it is possible to travel about the city without private vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/air-pollution-level-in-coimbatore-exceeds-who-norms/article38342393.ece

Declaration mandatory Such declaration is mandatory for even obtaining building plan approval, property tax assessment and securing electricity as well as drinking water connection. Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu ordered that those applying for layout approval must be made to submit the self-declaration. The judges said no registering authority should register documents in respect of land notified as waterbodies in revenue records as reflected in the government website Tamil Nilam. Officials in charge of granting layout approval, building plan approval, property tax assessment and providing water and electricity connections must conduct physical inspections, besides crosschecking the records, to ensure that the property concerned had not been classified as a waterbody, prepare an official note and make it part of the records, the Bench ordered. The directions were issued while disposing of a batch of public interest litigation petitions which complained of large scale encroachments on waterbodies in the State. The judges directed the Chief Secretary to complete survey of all waterbodies through Differential Global Positioning System and then remove all encroachments before March 31 this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/registration-only-after-declaring-property-is-not-waterbody-hc/article38342478.ece

Meant for registered members of the Tamil Nadu Construction Workers’ Welfare Board, the scheme can be used for either building houses on lands of beneficiaries or purchasing tenements built by the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board. There are two streams under the scheme, one of which is a beneficiary-led contribution and the other is the purchase of tenements of the Urban Habitat Development Board. In the first stream, the minimum size of house is 300 square feet, for which the unit cost of Rs. 2.76 lakh and the additional cost of Rs. 1.24 lakh will be sanctioned. If the beneficiary opts for the other stream, the norms under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) will be followed with a maximum assistance of Rs. 4 lakh. An order, issued by the Labour Welfare and Skill Development department two weeks ago, said the actual number of members of the Construction Welfare Board, who would avail themselves of the scheme “is not known” and if the number of beneficiaries exceeded 10,000, it would be restricted to 10,000 in a year. Four instalments Pon Kumar, chairman of the Construction Welfare Board, said the assistance would be released in four instalments on the basis of verification by the authorities concerned. The government constituted committee at two levels – district and State – to monitor the selection and distribution of the assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-government-to-launch-a-housing-scheme-for-construction-workers/article38342384.ece

Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu directed the Commissioner to join the virtual court from the office of a Special Government Pleader on Monday. They said the department ought not to have stopped the inquiry just because the police had taken up parallel investigation. The judges called for the case diary from Idol Wing-CID since it was reported that the police were unable to pin down the mastermind behind the theft since the crime was committed before 2004 whereas the First Information Report (FIR) was registered only in 2018 following a complaint lodged by Rangarajan Narasimhan of Srirangam. During the hearing of a writ petition filed by the complainant in 2018 and pending since then, State Public Prosecutor Hasan Mohammed Jinnah told the court that the Idol Wing CID had completed the probe except for recovering the original idol. Stating that 85 witnesses were examined so far, he said 90% of the investigation was over. Only a few more witnesses had to be examined and then the agency would file a final report before the court concerned within three to four months. Asked about the details of the probe conducted and whether anyone had been pinned down, the SPP said the needle of suspicion was pointing towards N. Thirumagal, the then Executive Officer of the temple. When the judges wanted to know whether the kingpin in the offence had been identified since the HR&CE official might have only aided the commission of the crime, the SPP replied in the negative. Invites judge’s ire “That aspect is still under investigation,” he said, prompting the ACJ to retort: “Then, what is the purpose of investigation. You are totally wasting time.” On his part, Mr. Narasimhan told the court that the police had not even enquired with him although he happened to be the complainant in the case. Similarly, the HR&CE department had discontinued its fact finding inquiry in 2019 citing COVID-19, he complained. He told the court that Ms. Tirumagal was now the Additional Commissioner of HR&CE department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-summons-hrce-commissioner-to-explain-delay-in-investigation-into-peacock-idol-theft/article38342825.ece

Now, that’s about to change as Airports Authority of India has merged the two wings in the remote security hold area – east and west (for the boarding gates 11 to 13 and 14 to 16) – in the domestic terminal of the Chennai airport. This will help passengers, who reach the wrong boarding gate in either of these wings or if the airlines make any last minute changes for boarding. Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said if a passenger went to the wrong gate in the west wing instead of the east, then he or she had to walk all the way up, take an elevator or an escalator, cross quite a distance and then once again go one level below to reach the exact gate. With the merger of these two wings, an additional space of 1,015 sq. ft has been created, which means one or two additional boarding gates may be added in the near future as well. “There have been occasions when passengers have missed flights due to this separation of east and west wings and this merger is a quick and easy solution to the issue and passengers now can freely move all through from Gate 11-16 without a hassle,” according to a release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-wings-at-airport-terminal-merged/article38342377.ece

But, the government can support industrial associations that will benefit their members,” he said. Further, the government should support research and development activities with incentives. This is a time when the industries want to develop new products. So, those who take up research and development jointly with recognised research centres, should be able to reflect 200% of the amount spent as their expense. This was available earlier but the amount was reduced later, he said. According to the president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association M.V. Ramesh Babu, the Income Tax for proprietor and partnership firms should be reduced to 20 % from the current level of 30 %. Companies and corporates pay only 20 % now. Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) realise just 5 % - 6 % profit. Lower IT slab will improve the competitiveness of these units, he said. Further, the MSMEs are in dire need of more funds. The working capital is eroded because of high raw material prices. Hence, the working capital should be converted to long-term term loans and the government should make available funds for working capital. The number of rate slabs in Goods and Services Tax (GST) should be reduced to three from six, he said. J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, said the government should allocate funds only for the micro sector. The schemes are all for the MSME sector and the beneficiaries are small and medium-scale units. The micro units require funds without any criteria to meet the present challenges, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industries-struggle-with-high-raw-material-prices-expect-relief-measures-in-union-budget/article38342396.ece

There are 12 middle schools in hill areas in the union and 17 middle schools in the plains. As per the G. O. No. 404, Education, Science and Technology Department, dated May 25, 1995, teachers who are willing to serve in hill areas should be posted first. In case of secondary grade teachers, if no one is willing to serve in hill areas, direct recruits or junior teachers, irrespective of male or female teachers, should be posted to hill areas for a minimum period of one year or for a longer period if they are willing. But BT teachers claimed that their work period in hill areas was not considered for station seniority as they lose the chance of getting transferred to their native districts. The teachers said that though they were ready to work on a rotational basis in hill areas, their work period should be considered as union seniority and wanted counselling to be held on that basis. They claimed that even after working for 15 years in the district, a teacher could not get a transfer to her native district as she lost her station seniority. “An overall senior list for the union should be prepared and counselling should be conducted”, they said. Instead of filling four vacancies in a school, which has a strength of over 250 students, in the plains, four vacancies were filled in a school in hills with less than 25 students, they alleged. A total of 24 teachers boycotted the counselling and left the premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-boycott-general-counselling/article38342503.ece

In 2017, the villagers had gathered in front of the Tasmac shop and demanded its closure. It was said that they had not obtained permission from the police to stage a protest. They caused hindrance to the public and traffic. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that the villagers had approached the officials in a peaceful manner and asked them to close the Tasmac shop as it affected the entire village. They did not disturb the public, it was submitted. Justice K. Murali Shankar took note of the fact that the villagers had not used criminal force with an intention to prevent or deter the Tasmac staff from discharging their duty. They had only assembled and conducted an agitation to shift the Tasmac shop. No doubt, prohibition is a policy matter to be decided by the government. But, at the same time, the policy of prohibition is a Constitutional mandate and the government is having greater responsibility to function in larger public interest, the judge observed. In the case on hand, the petitioners did not indulge in any act of violence. Considering the same, the court has no hesitation to hold that the proceedings pending on the file of the District Munsif / Judicial Magistrate court, Tirupattur is liable to be quashed, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/case-against-23-villagers-quashed/article38342666.ece

The child was currently under the custody of the Child Welfare Committee in Virudhunagar district. The court was hearing the petition filed by A. Ambika of K. Puliyankadai in Salem district.

She said that she developed health issues following the birth of the third child. Also, she and her husband were unable to make ends meet. Therefore, the couple came to the conclusion that they would give it up for adoption as they were unable to take care of the child.

Later, the child was adopted by the Virudhunagar couple. However, the Virudhunagar couple were unable to get a birth certificate for the child as they had not followed the legal procedures for adoption. After it was brought to the notice of the Virudhunagar Child Welfare Committee, they took custody of the child. The couple was called for an inquiry. The petitioner, Ambika, said she had willingly given the child for adoption. She now wanted to take her male child along with her.

After distributing artificial limbs to beneficiaries under the auspices of the Rotary Club of Pondicherry Beach Town and Pondicherry Eves, Ms. Soundararajan said COVID-19 cases were declining in the Union Territory and that brightened the prospect of reopening schools here. Tamil Nadu, she noted, had decided to reopen schools and colleges from February 1 and had done away with Sunday lockdown and night curfew. In this context, the Chief Minister and Education Minister will have a consultation on reopening of schools in Puducherry too, she said. As far as the Union Territory is concerned, the Chief Minister and administrators have shared her own view that the Union Territory should be equipped to see off the worst phases of the pandemic without enforcing total lockdowns, which severely impact livelihoods, the L-G said. Set an example Puducherry has set an example in reining in the pandemic without resorting to a lockdown and by adherence to safety norms, she added. "Wherever we have introduced relaxations, the decision was guided by a detailed risk evaluation and adherence to guidelines. One cannot rule out a fourth wave. Vaccination, masking and other safety norms must be complied with," Ms. Soundararajan said. According to the Lieutenant Governor, the sting of the third wave was felt to a lesser extent, solely because of vaccination. This was an established fact across the world, she added.

The Electricity Department had presented its application for determination of the Aggregate Revenue Requirement and tariff petition for the financial year. Officials of the electricity department presented their views before the commission during the hearing. ‘Unrealistic rates’ Participating in the public hearing, V. Balasubramanian, president of Pondicherry State Students and Parents Welfare Association, said the proposed hike in tariff rates, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, was unrealistic. “Though the government had ruled out any hike in power tariff for the next three years during the last public hearing, it had hiked the surcharge for various slabs. This is highly objectionable,” he said. Stakeholders who attended the virtual meeting said consumers’ views and suggestions views were ignored by the commission before determining the multi-year tariff. On the contrary, the commission’s decision was based only on the proposal of the electricity department, seeking approval for tariff revision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jerc-holds-public-hearing-on-power-tariff-hike-in-puducherry/article38342768.ece

A meeting of the fishermen, led by association president S. P. Rayappan, passed a resolution to this effect here on Friday. The Sri Lankan Government has denied permission for the traditional fishermen from Tamil Nadu, in view of the COVID-19 situation, to participate in the annual festival of Saint Anthony’s Church which will be held on March 11 and 12. Stating that the century-old church was constructed by the fishermen from Tamil Nadu, the association said that 200 traditional fishermen should be allowed to participate in the festival by following the COVID-19 preventive norms.

The two hatcheries in the area are under forest protection and anti-poaching watchers are on round-the-clock the duty. Last year, the officials were able to collect a record 21,500 eggs, Mr. Venkatesh pointed out. “It was because of absence of human disturbance owing to COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns that large number of turtles came to the sea shore,” he said. A high rate of 98 per cent hatching was reported and the hatchlings were released into the sea.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:24 IST,TAMIL NADU||Thanjavur Collector receives multiple pleas over girl’s death||A group of residents of Michaelpatti approached the Thanjavur district administration on Friday demanding that ‘independent committees’ formed by political parties and religious outfits should not be allowed to conduct inquiries in their hamlet in connection with the recent death of a Class XII girl student from Ariyalur district. The girl’s father too petitioned the Collector, seeking action against school authorities for “forcing his daughter to end her life.” In the memoranda, one penned by members of Hindu and Muslim communities residing in Michaelpatti and the other by the villagers, the residents claimed they had been living in harmony for over five generations and no issues had cropped up among them based on religion. After the unfortunate death of the schoolgirl, some groups with religious affinity have started propagating that religious conversion was rampant in the village, particularly at the school, they said and condemned attempts to project the village in bad light. ‘Independent committees’ should be barred from entering the village and conducting inquiries about the cause of death of the schoolgirl, they said. [The State BJP, citing a short video clip, had claimed the girl took the extreme decision because of attempted religious conversion. While in another video clip, the girl complained of being burdened with non-academic work by her hostel warden and indicated she was not discriminated on religious lines. Both video clips are subject matters of police investigation, and the Madras High Court’s Madurai Bench is also seized of the matter.] The parent-teachers association president, residents, parents of students and alumni of the school, in a separate petition to the Collector, sought protection for the Christian Missionary School, where the Class XII girl had studied. They claimed that after the recent incident, some parties/outfits having strong religious affinity have embarked on a “smear campaign” to defame the 163-year-old school and its teachers and sought action against the organisations concerned. In his petition to the Collector sent through registered post, the girl’s father sought legal action against those who drove his daughter to take the extreme step and demanded the withdrawal of the recognition given to the school. Forced conversion As per the petition, he had received information from school authorities on January 10 that his daughter, staying at the hostel, was unwell and was asked to take her for treatment. As her health deteriorated, she was taken to the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital on January 15. “After examining her, the doctors suspected my daughter might have consumed some poison. She revealed that the school authorities had insisted that she convert to Christianity by stating that they would take care of educational expenses,” he claimed. The girl, her father further claimed, said she was taken to a church in the neighbouring Tiruchi district, where unidentified persons urged her to convert. When she refused, she was tasked with non-academic chores at the hostel, including cleaning toilets, he claimed. When she expressed her inability to bear the workload, the school authorities asked her to end her life, the father alleged. The district administration has forwarded his petition to the Thanjavur Superintendent of Police for inquiry, according to sources. Meanwhile, State secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) K. Balakrishnan affirmed the party’s solidarity with the management and staff of the school by calling on them on Friday. Talking to reporters here on Friday, he said the politicisation of the girl’s death by the BJP had caused immense stress to the teaching and non-teaching faculty of the school and expressed apprehensions that it could even prevent children of the region getting quality education. Urging the people not to pay heed to the BJP on the issue, he urged the state government to ensure a fair probe into the cause of the girl’s death. Claims such as the step-motherly treatment meted out to the girl by her family members should also be probed, he demanded. Mr. Balakrishnan urged the government to initiate action against the BJP State president, K. Annamalai, for what he called “raking up communal tensions”, which would harm social harmony in Tamil Nadu.

Talking to reporters at Mannargudi recently, Committee president P. R. Pandian said the Authority had come forward to function autonomously after the appointment of the permanent Chairman and all dams in the Cauvery Basin in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had been brought under its purview. A Monitoring Committee had also been formed, but the Karnataka government was trying its best to cripple the functioning of the autonomous body. Such being the case, it would be better to get the consent of the CMWA before initiating or implementing any drinking water project in the basin though there was no bar in execution of such schemes under the Cauvery Tribunal order. Urging the State government to set an example in availing the legitimate rights over the Cauvery water by the people of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Pandian exhorted senior officials to provide proper guidance to the government. If the Tamil Nadu government decided to avoid getting the Authority’s consent, it would definitely pave way for Karanataka to adopt the same route by going ahead with its objective of constructing a dam across the Cauvery river at Mekedatu. The policymakers and the bureaucrats in Tamil Nadu should refrain from indulging in any activity that might bring disrespect to CWMA and, thereby, provide an opportunity to Karnataka in achieving its ulterior motive to impound even the surplus water flow into Tamil Nadu, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-undermine-cauvery-water-management-authority/article64991274.ece

When N. Senthamaraikannan, 56, of KTC Nagar on Palayamkottai outskirts, working as a superintendent in the Puthukkudi Railway Station near Srivaikundam, was returning home on his bike on January 16, a car hit his two-wheeler even as he was crossing Kaalvaai village. He was admitted to the hospital but he died the same day. The police registered a case of fatal accident based on a complaint from his son S. Pradeep, 30. The police collected CCTV footages to identify the car. They found that it was a preplanned murder. They nabbed M. Mahesh, 33, of Vallanaadu and S. Sudalaimani, 29, of Kaliyaavoor, who were travelling in the car involved in the incident along with their associates Jegan Pandian of Moolikkulam in Palayamkottai, Kandakumar and Marthandam of Pakkapatti. As the duo was quizzed, they told the police that Senthamaraikannan had land dispute with the family of O. Samrat of Nazareth over the past 15 years. When Samrat went to Goa recently with his friends Mahesh, Sudalaimani, Jegan Pandian, Kandakumar and Marthandam, Samrat was killed in an accident in Goa on January 4 last. As Senthamaraikannan termed it as a ‘god’s punishment’ in the social media, his friends, in retaliation, knocked him down with the car to show it as an accident. Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar complimented Mr. Arul and his team for cracking the murder case. Efforts are on to nab Jegan Pandian, Kandakumar and Marthandam. Police are probing the angle of contract killing as the persons allegedly involved in this case are from ‘black spot villages’ with dubious background. “We suspect that Samrat, after entering an agreement with these suspected contract killers for killing Senthamaraikannan, might have taken them to Goa before orchestrating their plan. However, Samrat got killed in the accident in Goa before the plan was executed. Someone from Samrat’s family, after seeing the comment, might have carried forward the plan and got it executed,” a police officer privy to the investigation said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/road-accident-turns-out-to-be-a-murder/article38342475.ece

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:15 IST,TAMIL NADU||Recognition for artistes, social worker||It has been raining accolades in the region this week, as clarinet exponent A. K. C. Natarajan and water and sanitation expert S. Damodaran, both based in Tiruchi, and R. Muthukannamal, the last living Devadasi and ‘sadir’ dancer from Viralimalai in Pudukottai district, have been named as recipients of the Padma Shri awards this year. Mr. Natarajan, 92, and Ms. Muthukannamal, 85, have been honoured with Padma Shri for art, while Mr. Damodaran, 59, has received it for social service.  Talking to The Hindu at his home in Salai Road, Mr. Natarajan said, “I am grateful for this acknowledgement, because so many veteran musicians have missed getting it in their lifetime. I was pleasantly surprised when I was informed about the award on Tuesday evening,” he said.  Mr. Natarajan, who also sports the title ‘Clarinet Everest’ bestowed by his mentor nagaswaram maestro T.N. Rajarathinam Pillai, continues to perform with an ebonite instrument that is thought to be at least a century old. He has modified the ‘A Clarinet’ by reducing the original 14 finger holes to seven, closing the rest with wax. An anasu (a metallic horn in the lower portion) from the nagaswaram, was added to improve its looks by lengthening the instrument’s body. The clarinetist debuted at the age of 15 and started his career as a staff artiste in All India Radio Kozhikode and Delhi. After returning to Tamil Nadu in 1952, he became a popular instrumentalist in Chennai’s leading ‘sabhas’ and a regular at the Music Academy’s December season for 20 years. Like many artistes, his calendar is empty since March 2020’s lockdown. “It is tragic to see so many talented musicians and performers become destitute during the pandemic. I hope the authorities will help these people who have devoted their lives to keeping the artistic heritage alive,” he said. Legacy of dance Ms. Muthukannamal, 85, is a descendant of seven generations of ‘sadir’ dancers and believes that awards such as this will keep their legacy alive for future generations.  Her arangetram (debut) at the age of seven was attended by courtiers and emininet persons in Pudukottai. Her guru - her father Ramachandra Nattuvannar - had taught her and her sister the art form when they were three. She dedicated her life to Viralimalai Subramaniya Swamy Temple and lived the life of a Devadasi where she would dance four times a day during the daily pujas. She would also welcome the processions during the annual temple festival.  “I lived life on my own terms,” she said. She had to wake up at 3 a.m. for practice, and her father was a very strict teacher. Though the Devadasi system was abolished through the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act in 1947, she continued to perform at temple festivals until 15 years ago. She now teaches at workshops and travels to dance institutes across the State. There is no written evidence of the songs sung in ‘sadir.’ “It is all memorised. So the only way I could pass it on is to keep singing for my children and grandchildren,” she said. While the Devadasi system did not permit marriage, Ms. Muthukannamal chose a partner who approached her after being smitten by her dancing skill. After her partner’s demise, she lives with her son, two daughters and her grandchildren in Viralimalai. Social service As the first graduate in his family, from a very early age, Mr. Damodaran was determined to serve society in a meaningful way. “When we started Gramalaya in 1987, our work was related to economic improvement. But when we visited remote rural areas, we found people did not have drinking water and toilet facilities, which affected their entire life. So we shifted our focus to water and sanitation, and that has helped us travel so far,” he said. Today, as an approved key resource centre of the Ministry of Jalshakti, Gramalaya is involved in community-led sanitation programmes aimed at eradicating open defecation and replacing it with safe personal hygiene protocols and eco-friendly toilets. For the past six years, Gramalaya has been working in menstrual hygiene management among adolescent girls by promoting reusable cloth sanitary napkins. It is also looking at reducing malnutrition among young children. Making conservancy workers aware of the dignity of their labour is also on the agenda. “Our Harpic World Toilet Colleges in Tiruchi, Kochi and Kurnool (in collaboration with Reckitt and Jagran Pahel) help to build capacity and train workers in safe sanitation methods. We want to give them some pride in their work. Automating parts of their job helps us to avoid manual scavenging,” Mr. Damodaran said.  It is tragic to see so many talented musicians becoming destitute during pandemic. The authorities must help these people who have devoted their lives to keep the artistic heritage alive A. K. C.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:15 IST,TAMIL NADU||‘New target under revamped NEEDS an uphill task’||Commercial Banks and Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation (TIIC) face an uphill task in achieving the target set under New Entrepreneur-cum-Enterprise Development Scheme (NEEDS) that was tweaked after the change of regime in the State last year. The announcement by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Department on relaxation of educational qualification to HSC (Higher Secondary Certificate), increase of ceiling from Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 75 lakh and extending of 10% additional capital subsidy for eligible SC/ST and differently abled applicants was followed by scaling up of targets three or even four-fold for the districts. According to industry representatives, the increase effected in the target mid-way through the fiscal had made it all the more difficult for TIIC and commercial banks to reach even 30% to 40% of the target. The targetted number of beneficiaries, for instance, has been increased three-fold in Tiruchi district, and four-fold in backward districts in the delta region, according to the sources. The district-level committees have been holding their sittings for identifying potential beneficiaries under the scheme in recent months. The relaxation of the educational qualification for first-generation entrepreneurs from graduation to higher secondary qualification is a comforting factor. “It is not that first-generation graduates cannot be found, but identifying such graduates with a zeal for entrepreneurship is a challenge,” a senior official said. Hitherto, the minimum qualification for getting assistance was degree/ diploma/ ITI / vocational training from a recognised institution. Since the project cost allowed under NEEDS is Rs. 5 crore, which classifies the venture as small enterprise, first-generation entrepreneurs assisted under NEEDS justifiably deserve the increase in the maximimum limit of subsidy under the scheme from Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 75 lakh, the new order states. An additinal 10% capital subsidy is provided for SC/ST and differently abled applicants. Though these changes will have the potential to attract more number of applicants, the steep increase in the target for 2021-22 has placed the officials on their toes since the order took effect from September 2, 2021, it is learnt. The increased target could be reachable over a year-long period from 2022-23 onwards, according to a branch manager of a nationalised bank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-target-under-revamped-needs-an-uphill-task/article38342806.ece

Twice last month, Coordinator of Margadarshan Scheme at NIT-T, N. Sivakumaran, delivered talks on NBA accreditation from the perspective of mentee institutions, with focus on Self Assessment Report. Under the Hub ‘n Spoke system, NIT-T’s role as hub by way of guiding and dispersing knowledge to 10 to 12 technical institutions in Erode, Coimbatore, Tiruchi, Kanniyakumari, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Tirunelveli districts to encourage best practices has facilitated faculty and students from the mentee institutions to use NIT facilities to pursue research, undertake joint publications and other academic pursuits. Ten teaching faculty and 28 students from 12 mentee institutions have undergone internship at the NIT-T. As for students, the internship could make many among them realise the importance of GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering), said N. Sivakumaran, Margadarshak Coordinator, NIT-Tiruchi. As the top-ranked institution among NITs in the country, NIT-Tiruchi, with its mature systems and processes, has a responsibility to share the best practices, G. Kannabiran, Director in charge, said. The purpose behind the exercise is to make future engineers employable for jobs in the knowledge economy, according to the coordinators of the National Workshop on Outcome-based Education, including NBA accreditation process, organised by the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, NIT-T, last June. Participants were exposed to the components of self-appraisal, evaluation criteria of NBA, outcome-based education, and documentations required for accreditation process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nit-tiruchi-lays-emphasis-on-nba-accreditation/article38342464.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:15 IST,TAMIL NADU||This worker has cremated 3,000 bodies in 15 years||A. Nagarajan, the sole corporation sanitary worker deputed to Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, has buried over 3,000 unidentified bodies over the last 15 years. While earlier the patients had died of accidents or communicable diseases like chicken pox or dengue, these days, a majority of the patients died of COVID-19. The 49-year-old man began his career as a sanitary worker in the Tiruchi Corporation, after which he was deputed to the GH 15 years ago. His role: to bury unidentified and unclaimed bodies at the crematoria within the city. “To me, a government employee is a servant to the people. My job is to be of service to the people and I have been doing that with conviction,” he said. Mr. Nagarajan's day starts with going to the mortuary at the Tiruchi GH and taking stock of the bodies. The authorities would indicate unidentified bodies and ask him to take them to cremate at the Oyamari crematorium. Nowadays, a large number of those bodies are COVID-19 deaths, he said. The peculiar nature with COVID-19 bodies is that while family members are available, they cannot take part in the cremation. “Many reach out to me when they see me take the body and ask me to perform the last rites in a certain way, by chanting some prayers. It is painful to watch,” Mr. Nagarajan said. Mr. Nagarajan's family has been very supportive of his work. “Although they have not expressed any concern or fear, I make sure that everyone is safe,” he said. “During the peaks of both the waves, I slept at the entrance of the house and did not enter inside except to take bath,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/this-worker-has-cremated-3000-bodies-in-15-years/article64991272.ece

In this endeavour, it plans to partner with field experts, academic institutions and civil society organisations working for the welfare of senior citizens in rural and urban Tamil Nadu. A Directorate for the Welfare of Senior Citizens is also being planned. The draft document is based on Article 41 of the Constitution, which requires the State to secure the right to work, education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement.  According to the report Elderly in India, 2021 released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Tamil Nadu had 13.6% of senior citizens last year. It is projected to have the second highest proportion of people aged 60 and above (after Kerala), with 18.2% in 2031.  As per the draft policy, the State government will focus on health and nutrition, social security schemes, livelihood and income security, housing and environment, safety, institutional care, awareness and education, research and documentation, disaster management and set up the Directorate for the Welfare of the Senior Citizens.  Bringing the elderly back into the community in a meaningful manner is essential, as improved healthcare has increased the average life expectancy in the State. “Senior citizens should be allowed to lead a productive life and such policies will give them social relevance. We have to do more to facilitate inter-generational transfer of knowledge, so that young people can gain from the vast experience of the elderly in their midst,” a drafting committee official told The Hindu .  The policy also looks at introducing livelihood training and capacity building for active senior citizens, with the formation of elderly self-help groups linked to banking assistance for entrepreneurial ventures. It will be addressing the prevention of elder abuse, and envisages a system of rescue centres for victims, besides vigilance and security for old people living alone or as couples. “The problem of abandonment of the elderly, sometimes by their own family members, is growing. A policy to establish standard operating procedures for assisted living and retirement homes has to be formulated. Tamil Nadu has been a pioneer in geriatric care and policy. It is better for us to follow global standards when it comes to our ageing population, in anticipation of the challenges ahead,” said another expert involved with the draft policy. Comments and suggestions may be sent to elderspolicytn@gmail.com up to February 28.

Twelve teams, comprising a subject expert, four students, and forest department personnel, participated in the census, conducted in Kazhuveli sanctuary and Yedayanthittu estuary in Villupuram district, and Pichavaram mangrove forests in Cuddalore district. Tindivanam Forest Ranger, R.M. Perumal, and forest personnel guided the student volunteers, drawn from colleges in Mayiladuthurai and Tiruchi districts and Pondicherry University. The annual census is being done by the forest department in coordination with the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) with technical support from Universal Eco Foundation and Indigenous Biodiversity Foundation (IBF), a non-profit organisation. According to Villupuram District Forest Officer Sumesh Soman, the census is aimed at generating a baseline data, which can be used as a tool for preparing management plans, policy decisions and other interventions for bird sanctuaries and coastal habitats. Officials of the forest department said the census will cover the brackish wetland in Pichavaram forests and backwater and saltpans in Yedayanthittu estuary, Kazhuveli, and Oussudu bird sanctuaries. The volunteers would submit their field data by 10.30 a.m. on Saturday. After checking and cross-checking the data, a final report would be compiled by the forest department to initiate conservation initiatives. Officials said about 17,565 birds belonging to 47 species were spotted in Kazhuveli during the pre-bird census conducted by a team led by Dr. S. Balachandran, scientist at Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), on January 14 and 15.

Ponmudi on Friday announced that end-semester examinations for college students in their first to fifth semesters in the State, will be held online. Talking to reporters in Villupuram, Mr. Ponmudi said doubts had prevailed among a few sections on the conduct of semester exams as colleges are scheduled to reopen on February 1. “There need not be any doubt. The exams for students in semesters one, three and five in government arts and science colleges, private colleges affiliated to all universities, engineering and polytechnic institutions, will be held online. Students will attend practical exams and offline classes on days when there are no online exams,” he said, adding that the schedule of examinations had been sent by universities to the affiliated colleges. Two-language policy Replying to a question, Mr. Ponmudi said Tamil Nadu had adopted a firm policy of following the two-language policy but was not opposed to students learning other languages. Referring to Governor R.N. Ravi’s address that it was important for school students to learn other Indian languages, he said that there was no prohibition on students learning other languages. But what is perplexing is that none of the North Indian States were teaching students any of the South Indian languages as a third language, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/college-end-semester-exams-will-be-held-online-minister/article64991240.ece

Manickam Tagore has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention into the issue of the Sri Lankan government deciding to auction 105 fishing boats belonging to Tamil Nadu fishermen that were seized between 2015 and 2018, by the Sri Lankan Navy. In a memorandum, the Congress MP expressed his concern over the Sri Lankan Navy frequently arresting fishermen of the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu and seizing their fishing boats on the pretext that the fishermen were crossing the international maritime boundary line. When the fishermen are released from the jails in Sri Lanka they come out with the confidence that their seized boats would be returned to them through the efforts of the Union government. However, the fishermen who have already lost their livelihood due to the seizure of their boats now have totally lost confidence in their livelihoods as their boats are about to be auctioned, the MP said. The MP wanted the Prime Minister to strongly express the disapproval of the Union government over this auction, to Sri Lanka. He pointed out that the Ramanathapuram district fishermen associations have announced an agitation on February 2 to draw the attention of the Union government to this, and to stop the auctioning process by the Sri Lankan government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pm-should-stop-sri-lanka-from-auctioning-boats-of-t-n-fishermen/article64991254.ece

According to him, the girl’s “dying declaration” was leaked to the media. After the phone was handed over to the police, a new video pertaining to the issue was “leaked”, he submitted. He also doubted the forensic analysis. The Immaculate Heart of Mary Society, in an impleading petition, submitted that the school was established in 1859 by the congregation at Michaelpatti near Thirukattupalli in Thanjavur district. Senior counsel Fr. Xavier Arulraj said the girl’s death was a loss to the school and the majority of students of the institutions run by the Society were Hindus. Their faculty members included Hindus and Muslims. Contending that there was no necessity to convert the girl to Christianity, he said the institution had paid her fees. But bald allegations were being made. Larger conspiracy According to him, there was a larger conspiracy. The hostel warden, a senior citizen, is in jail and another warden was being questioned by the police. Mr. Muthuvel, who shot the video, “has criminal antecedents, and has attacked Christians before”, he submitted. Submitting a “confidential affidavit” to the court, he claimed that the girl was suffering from a medical condition and had lodged a complaint with Child Line against her step-mother.

They volunteered to send him inner wear, if he lacked clothes at home. Ayesha Sanadi, women’s wing leader, said this exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP that preached values like respecting women on the one hand, while retaining leaders who insulted women. Mr. Patil, however, released a video statement on Friday, saying the person in the picture was not him. My political opponents must have created a fake image to malign me, he said. This is different from the statement issued by Mr. Patil on Thursday. He had said the picture of him was posted on a social media platform without his knowledge.

Pharma courses against private college managements for charging extra fees, beyond the prescribed amount. For Pharma D. courses, colleges are charging an excess fee of anywhere between Rs. 80,000 and Rs. 1.2 lakh, while students have been asked to cough up extra fees in the range of Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 75,000 for B. Pharma courses. The committee has received both online and written complaints from students. Sources in the committee said that notices have been issued to colleges, following which some college managements decided to refund the excess fees. The cost of a Government quota seat in private colleges for B. Pharma and Pharma D. courses is Rs. 26,000 and Rs. 67,000, respectively. Thirty percent of the total seats are reserved as Government quota seats and students have been allotted seats by the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) based on the ranks obtained in the Common Entrance Test (CET). Rakshith S., a student from Doddaballapur, said that there has been an increase in demand for pharmacy courses over the past few years as many of the students in low income families from rural areas could not pursue medical and dental courses as the fees have increased drastically. “So we aim to join pharmacy courses and now colleges have started charging excess fees. Many of us will have to give up on our dreams of pursuing professional courses all together,” he said. Another student who was admitted in the B. Pharma programme said that many had already paid the extra fees and did not want to raise a complaint as they had completed the admission process. “We do not want to risk losing out on our seats,” she said. Jayakara S.M., Vice-Chancellor of the Government-run Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, said that they would issue a notice to colleges if they did not refund the excess fees charged from students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-accuse-pharmacy-colleges-of-charging-excess-fees-60-complaints-filed/article38342339.ece

A book titled “The policies and programmes of the Government of Karnataka in the last six months and the future impact of these programmes” was released on the occasion of the Government completing six months on Friday. ISEC Director D. Rajasekhar said that the report comprises nine chapters covering as many themes. According to him, the programmes over the last six months have potential to bring changes in the lives of both farmers and urban dwellers apart from elderly among other vulnerable sections. Particularly referring to the Nagarotthana scheme of urban development under which infrastructure development is being taken up in various towns in the State, Dr. Rajasekhar said it had the potential to reduce the burden on Bengaluru as it sought to distribute economic and job opportunities among other cities and towns in addition to infrastructure. He said the study had also analysed the importance of various other programmes, including upgrading of 750 primary health centres, setting up 750 Farmers’ Producers’ Organisations, infrastructure development of 750 village panchayats, providing scholarships to children of farmers and enhancement of pension under social security schemes besides implementation of new education policy. Mr. Bommai told the ISEC Director to continue the process of assessment of Government schemes on a regular basis.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the direction after noticing that the State Government has released only Rs. 13 crore of the total Rs. 20 crore required by the KSLSA to be paid to victims of crimes during the year 2020-21. The Bench was hearing a PIL petition filed in 2017 by the People’s Movement Against Sexual Assault, Bengaluru, on the issue related to delay in payment of compensation to victims of crimes, particularly victims of sexual assaults. Though the KSLSA had requested release of Rs. 20 crore for payment of compensation long ago, the Government had not released the amount. Following this delay, the High Court had directed presence of the Principal Secretary, Department of Women and Child Development, to appear before the court. Subsequently, the Government released Rs. 13 crore and informed the court that it can release the remaining Rs. 7 crore for which the KSLSA has to send a requisition. However, counsel for the KSLSA has clarified that request for release of remaining Rs. 7 crore was already sent to the Government and it would be repeated again if needed. The KSLSA is the nodal agency for disbursement of compensation under the victim compensation scheme in Karnataka and it is obligation of the Government to release amount required to be paid to the victims as per the scheme formulated based on the apex court’s directions. Following this, the Bench directed the Government to immediately release the remaining amount while adjourning further hearing till February 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-fiat-to-karnataka-govt-on-compensation/article64991336.ece

Addressing presspersons in Hubballi on Friday, association president Sunil R. Karikatti, vice-president Ravi Patil, secretary Mahantesh Nayak and executive committee member Manjula M. said that university vice-chancellor Mahadev Chetti is violating statutes with impunity and has lost his moral right to continue in the post as he is an accused in a criminal case. “We demand that the Governor and the Government sack him immediately to protect the dignity of the university,” they said. Elaborating on the various illegalities said to have been committed by the vice-chancellor, Mr. Nayak said that whether it is recruitment of officers, assigning officers for in-charge duty, appointment of registrar, administrative staff, re-employment of retired personnel or any other issue related to the teaching and non-teaching staff, Prof. Chetti has violated rules, regulations and statutes. “For the first time we are forced to go on an agitation because of this blatant misuse of power. After 14 days of peaceful agitation, the Governor himself visited the protest site and promised to resolve the pending issues related to the promotion and other benefits of the staff. After holding a meeting with us, the Governor has written to the vice- chancellor to immediately take steps to resolve the issues and fulfill our demands. But till date nothing has happened,” he said. Prof. Sunil Karikatti said that because of lack of appointments, the University was now functioning with only 50% of the sanctioned posts and the teaching staff was handling additional responsibilities in the interest of the students and university. However because of the abuse of power and blatant violations by the Vice Chancellor the ranking of the university had gone down 9th to 17th position, he said. Criminal case He said that amid all these illegalities, following an order of the District and Sessions Court in Dharwad, issued on January 1 , 2022, Mr. Chetti and his wife have been named as accused in a criminal case. The Governor and the State Government should immediately consider it seriously and sack him to save the reputation of the prestigious institution, he demanded. Mr. Patil said that the teachers will be once again approaching the Governor, the Higher Education Minister and the Chief Minister seeking immediate action against the vice-chancellor and also in connection with their long-pending demands. “We will wait for 15 days for the competent authorities to act. If nothing happens, we will resume our agitation,” he said. To a query, he said that they are still waiting for the visit of the Principal Secretary of the department which was announced during the legislature session. “If the Principal Secretary wants us to meet him, we will go and air our grievances before him. We want our genuine demands fulfilled,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/uas-teachers-set15-day-deadline-for-removal-of-vice-chancellor/article64991360.ece

Part of four-lane project of National Highway 66, the stretch comprising a vehicular underpass at Basrur Moorkai and a flyover at Shastri Circle, was opened for traffic in May 2021, a decade after the flyover project was initiated. Though there was no official inaugural programme, the facilities are in use since then.  Mani Ranjan, a resident of Kundapur, told The Hindu that non-commissioning of the street lights has put the life of road users, vehicles as well as pedestrians, under grave risk. He said though the street lighting infrastructure was in place since May last, it is not commissioned.  His plea to the State Government and Udupi Deputy Commissioner to direct the National Highways Authority of India to commission street lights on the stretch did not yield any response. To his complaint on the public grievances portal of the Union Government, the NHAI said Navayuga Udupi Tollway Ltd., the concessionnaire of the four-lane project, was yet to be issued Provisional Commercial Operation Date (PCOD) and hence the lights were not energised. They would be energised after the PCOD was issued [by NHAI], the reply said. Wondering about the technicalities coming in the way of public safety, Mr. Ranjan said it was high time the district administration intervened in the matter and direct the NHAI to ensure adequate safety of road users. Pedestrians and other vehicle users on the service roads too were greatly affected because of lack of street lighting, he pointed out. Meanwhile, the NHAI is yet to respond to residents’ plea to allow vehicular entry and exit to and from the nearly two-km flyover stretch that acts as a massive wall separating the town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/street-lights-yet-to-glow-on-flyover/article64991402.ece

Ramdas took on party’s Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, it was the turn of BJP’s Chamaraja MLA L. Nagendra to raise questions on the repair of the roads that will be dug up for implementing the Central Government project, backed by the MP, to lay a pipeline for supplying cooking gas to houses. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Mr. Nagendra said the roads in the city, including the ones coming under his constituency, had been repaired at a cost of Rs. 300 to 400 crore over the last 3-4 years. But, the company executing the project is reportedly paying only Rs. 99 crore after digging up about 500 km of the road to lay the gas pipeline. “Who will bear the remaining among for repair of the roads”, he questioned. He said he had also written to the Mayor and Commissioner of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) in the regard. He said he has asked the MCC Commissioner how many kilometres of road will be dug up in his constituency and whether the cost had been calculated for its repair. He said he will not have any objection to the project sanctioned by the Centre and welcomed more such projects. He said he would leave it to the people to decide if he is wrong in raising questions over the repair of the roads that will be dug up for the project. Concern The elected representatives of MCC too shared the same concern over the threat to roads from the project. He said the MCC corporators did not know much about the company implementing the project and its owner. Mr. Nagendra, however, hit out at Mr. Simha for his reported remarks that he has also received as many votes as they had received from their respectively constituencies when he contested the elections to the Lok Sabha. The BJP MLA claimed that they had won because of the hard work of the party workers and party corporators and also pointed out that JD(S) had not fielded a candidate in the last Lok Sabha elections from Mysuru. He said a people’s representative should earn the trust of the people not by words, but by deeds. It may be mentioned here that Mr. Simha and Mr. Ramdas had locked horns on Thursday over the implementation of the project after it transpired that the BJP MLAs had asked the corporators not to back the project as it entailed digging up of the roads in some areas of teh city. Consequently, a meeting of the MCC Council convened on Thursday to discuss the piped gas project had to be adjourned due to lack of quorum after corporators stayed away from the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/who-will-repair-roads-to-be-dug-up/article64991392.ece

An annual tryst with the lake during winter, these birds fly over the Himalayas and tend to stop in the central Indian plains and the Deccan plateau before settling in parts of Karnataka, with Hadinaru being one of the well-documented sites. Bird watchers and expert aver the winter migration normally takes place during December but has been delayed by nearly a month this year. But notwithstanding the delay the arrival of the birds at the lake – which is about 25 km from Mysuru and in Nanjangud taluk – has been observed. C.S. Kulashekara, avid bird watcher and photographer, said excess rains has affected the migration pattern this year and is likely that many of them have dispersed. These winged beauties have bar-like stripes on their heads that enables to distinguish them from similar birds some of which fly from Eurasian countries and return during the onset of summer. Apart from Bar-headed Geese that roost in the warmer regions of the south of the country, there are other migratory birds too. Teals, pin-tailed ducks, shovelers, Gargini, Coot, Sandpipers, common pochards are a few others that roost in the region and Mysuru with its network of water bodies surrounded by fields support a high number of birds. Though the winter migration tends to commence in October and early November in January the delay this year means the peak of migratory season is still some weeks away. But bird watchers are cautious and say in case there is dispersal of the flocks as most water bodies are full, then one can only count scattered population groups. This year the rainfall between October and November was the highest in 50 years and not all species prefer a habitat flooded with water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/winter-trip-migratory-birds-keep-their-annual-tryst-with-hadinaru-lake/article64991339.ece

Mysuru has around 740-800 women pourakarmikas. As of now, they carry out the tasks of collection, segregation and disposal of solid waste, sweeping major streets and other sanitation tasks in each ward.  In an attempt to give them larger roles and engage them in tasks that were being handled by men all these years, the MCC is in the process of identifying women pourakarmikas interested in driving three-wheel and four-wheel vehicles that transported solid waste from households. Those familiar with driving skills are given priority and the MCC has also decided to make arrangements for their driving licence if they wish to take up the new task. MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj told The Hindu that the MCC came up with this idea as it wanted to give them larger responsibilities. The male drivers for vehicles transporting solid waste are outsourced.  More vehicles If women pourakarmikas come forward and show interest in the MCC’s initiative, they could take up the tasks of ferrying garbage collected from homes, driving the MCC’s designated vehicles, he added. “We are consulting the pourakarmikas. We have about 230 tipper autorickshaws that are used to transport solid waste in 65 wards. Sixty more vehicles are being procured,” the health officer explained. Dr. Nagaraj said not all ULBs in the State have vehicles transporting solid waste that are driven by women. Women pourakarmikas, in future, can get loans and buy such vehicles that can be outsourced to the MCC for the cleanliness tasks. Mysuru city has 2,000-plus pourakarmikas. Most of the garbage-transporting automobiles are driven by men and the pushcarts are operated by some women pourakarmikas. “The MCC is ready to train women pourakarmikas in driving our vehicles. We are also collecting information on those having DLs. They will be deputed to drive the vehicles once we get the new vehicles.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/soon-women-pourakarmikas-to-drive-vehicles/article64991386.ece

Bhamy V Shenoy, who has handled such projects in the Republic of Georgia, has said that given the benefits of the projects the councillors should have sought to expedite the project rather than create hurdles to it. The proposed piped gas supply to the city under a Central Government project was supposed to have been discussed and approved in the MCC Council meeting on Thursday. But the members abstained from the meeting apparently at the behest of a few local MLAs including S.A. Ramdas who are opposed to the project on the grounds that it entails digging up the roads which are already in bad shape. This led to the Mysuru MP, Pratap Simha, lashing out at Mr. Ramdas of his own party. Mr. Shenoy said all over the developing world even where there is no domestic natural gas supply, it is a preferred cooking fuel. Ridiculing the objections of the councillors he questioned whether the elected representatives will oppose repairing UGD on the grounds that roads will be dug. He said compared to LPG, piped gas is a preferred fuel for several reasons including relatively higher safety. It also ensures energy security as it is not easy to disrupt gas supply owing to strike by the employees. National policy Drawing attention to the country’s policy to increase its share of natural gas in the energy basket - from 6 per cent to 15 per cent in the next few years, Mr. Shenoy said one of the strategies to reach that goal is to supply gas to residences in most urban centres, and Mysuru is fortunate in being one such centre. He said the argument of the councillors and the MLAs lacked merit and supported Mr. Simha for coming out openly on the subject.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-should-approve-piped-gas-supply-project-without-any-misgivings/article38342713.ece

The second largest district of Kerala boasts an illustrious past, dating to the pre-historic period, as is evident from the remains such as dolmen, burial urns, and hero stones strewn across a wide area close to the Western Ghats. From the ancient times, the spices produced in the district, including cardamom and pepper, were exported through an old trade route from the area to the Muziris port, as excavations at Pattanam point out. The region’s hill produce was much in demand among early foreign traders. Its present population mostly comprises settler farmers, along with tribespeople and people of Tamil origin. The district is topographically divided into high range and low range. It holds a prominent place on the State’s tourism map with the emergence of Munnar and Thekkady as top destinations for international and domestic tourists. Wagamon, Ramakkalmedu, Panchalimedu, Calvery Mount, and the waterfall at Aruvikuzhy too attract tourists in droves. Heritage buildings In Devikulam and Peerumade taluks, a large number of heritage buildings connected to the British Raj era are kept intact. Udumbanchola has a large concentration of cardamom estates while Idukki taluk hosts one of the largest arch dams in Asia. The two villages of Vattavada and Kanthallur meet a major portion of the State’s vegetable demand. Garlic from Kanthallur and Marayur jaggery, which has the Geographical Indication (GI) tag, are Idukki’s unique products. The sandalwood division at Marayur is the only reserved sandalwood forest in the State. At Edamalakkudy, inside the Munnar forest division, is situated the only tribal grama panchayat in the State. The tribal population in the district consists of the Muthuvan, Mannan, Hill Pulaya, Urali, and Ulladan communities. District Panchayat President Jiji K. Philip says year-long programmes are being planned in connection with the golden jubilee. The administration intends to highlight the district’s unique features as part of the celebrations. Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine, who is in charge of the district, says the government has drawn up developmental projects in connection with the jubilee. The focus will be primarily on infrastructure building.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/idukki-turns-50-to-play-up-its-treasures/article64991284.ece

Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samithi president N. Badusha has alleged that a few top officials of the Forest department had conspired to hand over the forestland worth Rs. 200 crore here under the Meppadi forest range of the South Wayanad forest division to Elstone Tea estate Limited and the Meppadi Forest range officer was preparing a mahassar (detailed legal report) for the purpose. According to the verdicts of the Supreme Court and the Kerala High Court, all transactions related to land, which were under the possession of the British, were null and void and the ownership of the land was vested with the State government, Mr. Badusha said. The government had recently appointed a special officer to restore such land in the State, he said. The Wayanad District Collector had also reported that as many as 12 private estate owners were holding land earlier owned by the British, including the land under the possession of the Elsone Tea Estate, he added. Though the government had issued an order on May 2, 1981, to hand over the land to the Coffee Board for expanding the facilities of its research station, it was yet to be realised, he added. If the Forest department hands over the land, the organisation would legally challenge it, he added. SC directive However, South Wayanad Forest Divisional officer Shajna Kareem said the Supreme Court had directed the department to adopt steps to hand over the land to the estate in 2004. The department had filed an appeal against the direction but it was dismissed. The State government had also issued a similar directive in 2019. The Conservator of Forests (Palakkad) had issued a directive to adopt steps to hand over the land to the estate in accordance with the government order. The preparation of the mahassar was a part of the process, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bid-to-hand-over-land-to-tea-estate-slammed/article38342583.ece

The area covered by the mangroves is primarily owned by individuals. However, in the garb of construction of the bypass bridge, the mangroves were destroyed by piling it with soil, said Shaukat Ali Eroth, working chairman of the Mahe River Conservation Committee. Except for the construction of pillars for the bridge and a 3.5-metre area for the service road, the land cannot be used for other purposes under the law. But the activities here were similar to what had taken place in Kozhikode, where large areas of mangroves forest were destroyed to convert the place into a commercial site, he alleged. Mr. Ali said the COVID outbreak and subsequent lockdown had given further confidence to the violators of the law. “Behind this is the nexus of bureaucrat-political-land mafia who are creating commercial plots for private individuals in addition to filling the land for the bypass road,” he said. The matter needed to be thoroughly investigated and the wetland restored before the onset of the monsoon season, he said. The destruction of the mangrove forests in Pathikkal came to the notice of the Mahe River Conservation Committee activists, including C.K. Rajalakshmi and N.V. Ajay Kumar, who were part of a delegation that went to study the Mangat stream, which has been destroyed due to the laying of the bypass road.

The buses that will ply in the corridor, avoiding bus depots tucked inside towns, will be a mix of semi-sleeper and air-suspension buses. Once launched in the first week of February, the service could take up to three months to stabilise, says Biju Prabhakar, Chairman and Managing Director, KSRTC. These buses, which will operate through the bypass corridors in different districts every hour, are expected to take two hours lesser than the existing buses to cover the distance. They will operate on the lines of the Chill Bus service that the KSRTC introduced about four years ago. Feeder buses Feeder buses will operate from different towns to these stations to provide first and last-mile connectivity to commuters. They will offer free ride to commuters who have reserved tickets for bypass rider buses. The KSRTC SWIFT will begin operations with a fleet of 116 new buses to be purchased soon to replace 704 buses, the services of which were extended by a year or two due to inadequate number of buses in the agency. “It include eight new sleeper buses from the Volvo stable, 20 semi-sleeper buses, and 72 buses having air suspension,” says Mr. Prabhakar. City services in capital A total of 175 of the 310 CNG-run buses that will be procured too will operate under the banner of the KSRTC SWIFT in Thiruvananthapuram city, while the rest will operate fast-passenger services from the city to towns in the suburbs. A fleet of 50 electric buses that the KSRTC will procure will replace the existing city circular services there. Put short, the 175 CNG buses will supplement the fleet of 116 new buses with which the KSRTC SWIFT will begin its operations, sources said. The KSRTC SWIFT has in the meantime invited applications from qualified personnel below 45 years of age who are willing to be deployed as driver-cum-conductor in its fleet of long-distance buses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-bypass-rider-in-feb/article64991296.ece

Though the construction period was fixed at two years, the authorities have asked the contracting firm to speed up the process. “Our plan is to finish it within one-and-a-half years,” said CSML Chief Executive Officer S. Shanavas, as the demolition of the existing market began on Friday. The proposed three-storey market complex will have facilities like basement parking for 150 vehicles, dedicated pedestrian zones, exclusive area for auction, truck bays for loading and unloading, and smart waste compost machine. The ground and first floors will be earmarked for the existing merchants. The complex will have space to host more number of stalls than the existing ones. Merchants had started shifting to the temporary facility set up at a cost of around Rs. 5 crore from Thursday. The temporary stalls have been set up in 1.25 acres, around 100 metres away from the existing market. There is a loading and unloading area on the premises. K.G. Venugopal, president of Ernakulam Merchants’ Association, said traders would fully cooperate with the redevelopment of the market. “We hope the construction of the new market would be completed within two years,” he added. The project, which was caught in legal tangles, received a boost after the Kerala High Court granted permission to CSML to go ahead with it.

Districts in Category C The court issued the order as an interim measure after considering the fact that these districts were included in the Category C, considering the high test positivity rate (TPR). The petitioner submitted that the districts were included in Category C considering the sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases. The State recently issued an advisory that not more than 20 persons should assemble in these districts. However, the universities ignored the unprecedented spike in the number of cases. According to the petitioner, it was highly unwise for the universities to conduct the examinations and risk the lives of the staff and students as the TPR was hovering around 50%. The petitioner also submitted that the failure to reschedule the examinations, which were scheduled to be held on February 2 and 3, would result in the formation of clusters and serious spread of the disease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-puts-varsity-exams-on-hold/article38342615.ece

Two of the four wagons which got derailed toppled on their side in the impact. They had to be cut open and removed from the track using heavy machinery. That the accident occurred on the yard premises resulted in collateral damage to the signal and other points. Railway officials cited this as the reason for the delay in restoring train services. Food and water were provided to passengers of trains stranded at different places following the accident, they added. Three trains — No. 12522 Ernakulam Junction-Barauni Junction Raptisagar Weekly Express, No. 12678 Ernakulam Junction-KSR Bengaluru Intercity Express, and No. 22149 Ernakulam Junction-Pune Superfast Express — were running late by 2 to 7 hours owing to the rescheduling of their timings. Train No. 12082 Kannur-Thiruvananthapuram Central Janshatabdi Express and No. 22627 Tiruchchirappalli Junction-Thiruvananthapuram Central Intercity Express have been cancelled for Saturday, railway sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/train-services-restored-after-derailment/article64991278.ece

The committee made the observation in its report on the fire outbreak at the yard on January 18 submitted before the Southern Bench of the tribunal. “During my inspection on January 20, water hydrants were seen operational, and no fire or smoke was observed. There is no change in the general condition of the entire dumping yard, which was detailed out in my previous report dated July 28, 2021,” said A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, Chairman of the SLMC. The report said that solid waste dumping was spread over 110 acres, and the land was being set aside for disposal of bio-degradable, non-biodegradable and septage waste. Huge heaps of legacy waste deposits are a constant phenomenon at the yard, which is under the control of the Kochi Corporation. It is given to understand that the corporation had recently placed a proposal for bio-mining, which has begun at the entrance to the yard using certain machinery. However, the process is going on at a low pace. The previous proposal for a waste-to-energy plant has not materialised till date. The septage treatment plant remains closed for repair. As usual, plastic waste was found dumped in the open in the south-eastern side as well as at the entrance. There are no sufficient facilities to process plastic waste. There is a shed, which is not capable of accommodating the entire plastic waste coming to the yard, the report said. The SLMC chief said that the plastic shredding machine installed at the site was found kept idle like before. The report said that fire personnel were able to douse the flames during the same night itself. However, it is learnt that there was emission of heavy smoke due to burning of plastic. It recalled that a study was conducted by the National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, after the fire in 2019. The dioxin level was found to be dangerously high.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/slmc-unhappy-with-brahmapuram-yard/article38342604.ece

The court also took note of a report published by The Hindu on January 24 and a report of the Amicus Curiae on unauthorised setting up of bunks and temporary stalls on pavements causing obstruction to pedestrian movement.  The court asked the District Police Chief (Kochi City) to constitute a special team to inquire into the alleged illegal nexus, alliance, or consortium of persons abetting unauthorised street vending in the city.

Anilkumar has said. Complaints raised by Opposition councillors on the use of funds for the modernisation of anganwadis will be considered, he said at the council meeting on Friday. The Mayor recommended the standing committee on development to allocate funds for various zones under the civic body. M.G. Aristotle, Opposition councillor, said it was not practical to utilise around Rs. 24 crore within the remaining two months of this financial year. The fund could be allocated under the Pradhan Matri Awas Yojana (PMAY) scheme. Status report sought Mr. Anilkumar said that the status report on utilisation of funds for Kudumbashree and anganwadis should be submitted at the next review meeting of the People’s Plan programme. He, however, said that the demand for additional instalment towards repayment of loan for the Brahmapuram plant and the PMAY scheme could not be accepted now, as it should be submitted before the District Planning Committee. Mr. Anilkumar said the corporation had received Rs. 32.85 crore as the third instalment of the Plan fund. The government had allocated the fund after deducting expenses towards salary for anganwadi workers, repayment of loan under the LIFE Mission project, and loan towards the solid waste treatment plant from the total allotment of Rs. 41.65 crore, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-discrimination-in-use-of-development-funds-mayor/article38342601.ece

Of the 61 active clusters, 42 are based in schools and colleges. The remaining are institution-based clusters that include banks and offices, according to the district health wing. Despite the deployment of sectoral magistrates, action against overcrowding in malls, supermarkets, and religious centres has not been effective. A meeting convened by the District Collector on Thursday to review the pandemic situation agreed on the need to curtail rising footfall in public places, as the third wave had clearly turned into community spread going by the rapid increase in the number of fresh cases. The Health department said crowding was witnessed in public places even during the lockdown on Sunday. Besides crowding in supermarkets, there was heavy rush at meat and fish stalls on the day. Many were found not adhering to safety protocols like wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. Such instances will increase chances of further spread of the disease, as the Omicron variant has been affecting many, though symptoms in most cases have been found to be mild. According to the health wing, crowding in public transport facilities too is a matter of concern. Bus operators should take steps to avoid overcrowding in view of the worsening pandemic situation, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/increasing-covid-clusters-in-ernakulam-trigger-concern/article38342600.ece

But today, a portion of the nearly 200-acre polder flaunts lush greenery, thanks to the joint efforts of the Kottarakara municipality and Krishi Bhavan. "The land had been lying idle for the last 25 years and when two residents Paul and Manoj came forward, we offered them all support," says Thomas P. Mathew, ward member. Many arable pieces of land in the area were left uncultivated after a nearby waterbody started flooding the farms. "Most of the landowners are now expatriates and the decision was taken as part of the government initiative to make all local bodies fallow land-free. In the initial step five acres of land was cultivated with the help of funds sanctioned by the Local Self-Government and the Agriculture department under various schemes," says agriculture officer B. Pushparajan. Since the land was left fallow for nearly three decades, the task was not easy. "It was difficult to till the land at many parts as our machines got trapped in the loose soil. We are looking forward to the summer months to extend farming to more area." The officials had opted for Pratyasha seeds, a variety that takes around 115 days to harvest. The land was cultivated in November and the authorities are planning to conduct the first harvest within 25 days. Good yield "We are expecting a good yield and after the harvest, arrangements will be made to drain water from some stretches. In the next phase, a major portion of the polder will be cultivated," says Mr. Pushparajan. At present, the paddy field has become a local attraction, as several residents keep visiting the place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/paddy-cultivation-gets-a-boost-in-parayatt/article64991283.ece

KDF leader P. Ramabhadran was inaugurating a meeting to mark the beginning of the KDF silver jubilee celebrations here on Friday. ‘BJP’s agenda’ "The caste division in the MGNREGA scheme was implemented to ill treat Dalits. The BJP government is trying to segregate even the basic working class on the basis of caste and it is part of the Sangh Parivar agenda to implement caste- and religion-based divisions in all sectors," he said. During the pandemic Mr. Ramabhadran pointed out that many persons who earlier worked in other sectors had opted for the scheme during the COVID-19 pandemic. "In Kerala, many workers had lost their jobs in traditional sectors such as cashew and coir. They have been depending on the scheme during the last two years and there has been a huge increase in the number of workers, especially from the Scheduled Castes. But the SC workers have not received their wages for months," he said. ‘Pay the wages’ Mr. Ramabhadran demanded that the Central government approve the revised labor budget submitted by the State government and pay the wages of the Scheduled Caste workers.

"I felt it was a socially relevant theme and we tried to present it in a different way. The thread was developed by our scenarist Sudhish Gopinath and the film tries to pass on a beautiful message.

While the preview of the film was held simultaneously on two screens at Oscar Cinema in Sharjah, another show was held at Leena Theatre at Kottakal. The film had been screened at some major short film festivals in Pune, Mumbai, Goa, Rameshwaram, and Kalakari.

Booking offenders using surveillance cameras will be given priority. Warning messages have been circulated through the social media pages of the police. Parents or vehicle owners concerned will also have to face penal action in cases of underage driving. Mobile patrol squads and traffic police teams will be part of the surprise checks along highways. According to police sources, surveillance cameras with automatic number plate recognition feature and still cameras of the local patrol squads will be used for the drive. The details of the vehicles and owners will be tracked instantly using the updated mobile applications of the Motor Vehicles Department. The vehicles, if impounded, will be released only after the clearance of legal formalities by the parents or vehicle owners. Extending support to the campaign, many social media users have come up with a list of locations where instances of underage driving occur. The list mostly includes busy locations around some prominent educational institutions. “There should be a permanent system to monitor underage riders other than occasional checks. The police should cover the premises of educational institutions where young riders resort to road race,” says V. Mehaboob, a road safety volunteer. Meanwhile, checking squads say the intensified action is just one of the methods to discourage underage driving along with routine inspections. Besides remitting fines, the violators and their parents will have to undergo a training session on road safety before the impounded vehicle is released, they add.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-step-up-drive-to-check-underage-driving/article38342587.ece

The management had sought the help of the police to transport the granite after several rounds of talks failed. However, the local people, who have formed an action committee demanding the shutdown of the quarry on the ground that it had flouted many a norm and had caused damage to several houses and a 150-year-old temple in the vicinity, refused to budge. “At least 27 houses have developed cracks on them, of which, the condition is very bad for five houses. One house is on the verge of collapse. Besides, six wells have also developed cracks”, said K.C. Babu, a member of the action committee, who has been knocking on one door after another seeking help to shut down the quarry. Licence “The police are unable to help us as the quarry owners have the required licence. But how they acquired that licence is a mystery, as there are quite a few violations. I have complained to the District Collector, but there has been no reply. The replies I received for my petitions under the RTI Act show clear violations”, Mr. Babu said. Besides him, several local people have filed petitions in the Kerala High Court, demanding the shutdown of the quarry. The explosions happen less than 45 metres away from the nearest residence, when the recent Supreme Court order maintains that there should be at least 200 metres between the quarry and the nearest residence. There is only a less than 5-metre-wide pathway to the quarry, which, as per the norms, is not fit for heavy vehicles. Besides, it is located in plantation land. It is the damage caused to the 150-year-old Nellyadi Naduvathur Maha Siva Kshethram that has riled the local people the most. “There are several cracks on the walls of the temple, the gopuram, the sanctum sanctorum, the steps to the pond and so on. The water in the pond has been polluted by the quarry”, Mr. Babu said, adding that it was one of the biggest temples in north Kerala and that this specimen of architecture that houses unique sculptures and paintings, needed to be preserved for posterity. “The quarry management’s representatives do not turn up for discussions. We will not back down until the quarry is shut down. Or else, the District Collector or the police chief need to vouch for them”, Mr. Babu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tension-as-locals-stop-anappara-quarry-operations/article64991430.ece

In its 100-page judgment, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court comprising Justice K. Vinod Chandran and Justice Ziyad Rahman pulled up India’s premier agency for its apathetic attitude in collecting independent evidence. The investigators did not make a concerted effort to “go out in the sun” to collect independent evidence of the version of the accused, the court observed. In their anxiety to wrap up the case, the court said, the officers of the NIA even recorded the confessions made by the accused, clearly inadmissible under the Evidence Act. Unreliable confession The Division Bench also observed that “we do understand the inherent difficulty of an investigation in a case taken over by the NIA almost four years after the incident. The investigating officers were groping in the dark for almost four years, till the arrest of Shafas in another blast case.” His confession during interrogation in another blast case cannot be relied on, the court observed. The approver’s evidence, the court stated, failed miserably in the twin tests - “that of inherent reliability and credibility as also on the aspect of corroboration.” The prosecution failed to establish the conspiracy angle that the accused wanted to retaliate against the “perceived partisan attitude of the Executive and the Judiciary” in not granting bail to the Muslim accused involved in the Marad massacre of May 2, 2003. Twin blasts  The twin blasts that rocked Kozhikode city on March 3, 2006 have been one of the intriguing terror-linked cases in the State. Two people, including a police constable, had sustained injuries in the explosions. The only clues left behind were the anonymous calls from a public call office received at the collectorate and a local eveninger, Calicut Times, warning that bombs had been planted at these places and would go off within half an hour. Later some newspaper offices received a letter from a fictitious organisation, “Al Kanoun”, admitting to the blasts.  Initially, the case was investigated by a Special Investigation Team of the Kozhikode City police and later it was handed over to the Special Investigation Group – III of the Crime Branch – Crime Investigation Department on June 13, 2006. Subsequently, the NIA took over the case on December 8, 2009. The arrest of Abdul Halim, another accused who was acquitted by the NIA court earlier, by the Kochi police in July 2009 gave a fresh impetus to the investigation in the case. The Kochi police were then probing the blast at the Ernakulam collectorate. The arrest of Nazeer and Shafas by the Bangladesh police and later handed over to the Border Security Force gave leads to the probe team. Both of them hailing from Kannur had fled to Bangladesh after the terror-attacks in Bengaluru in July 2007.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/acquittal-of-kozhikode-blast-case-accused-leaves-nia-red-faced/article64991300.ece

Y.C. Abdul Nassar and wife Naseema were on cloud nine when they made it to Manali in Himachal Pradesh a few days ago. Their video would have been another run-of-the-mill travel video, but for Mr. Nassar’s smile, revealing his solitary tooth, that made him an instant travel hero. Retired life Mr. Nassar had retired from work as a mason a couple of years ago. However, to make money for the Manali trip, he worked continuously for about two months. “That was a resolve I had. I never wanted to take anything from my sons. I wanted to visit the places I loved with the money I earned,” he said, after returning from Manali. The couple had visited places such as Hyderabad, Mysuru and Munnar. However, Manali and Kashmir had remained a dream. “Parents spend their time earning money for their children, and often forget to live their lives. Money can’t buy you happiness, but visiting places like Manali can,” said Mr. Nassar. His short video has become an inspiration for many. “It’s an eye-opener. Visiting places in old age is no big deal. But motivating others to follow your trail is different,” said T. Checku, a retired expatriate who is preparing to travel with his wife. It cost the couple Rs. 30,000 to visit Manali, Agra and Delhi.

The report said the safety aspects of the dam were under the watch of the Empowered Committee constituted by the Supreme Court in 2010. This committee had, from 2010 to 2012, “looked into and thoroughly investigated” the safety aspects. The Empowered Committee, with the help of expert organisations, had then “arrived the conclusion that the Mullaperiyar dam is found to be safe in all respects, viz, hydrologically, seismically and structurally”, the CWC report said. In the last hearing, the court had made it clear that it would not intervene to “administer the dam” when a Supervisory Committee was already in place to examine the issue of safety of the dam and the management of its water level. Dam safety “The safety of the dam is related to the management of the water level. A Committee has already been formed for that... We are not here to do the administration of the dam," Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, heading a Bench also comprising Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, had said. The court had said it was only concerned about the safety, security and health of the persons living in the vicinity of the dam. The court had said the States should approach the Mullaperiyar issue in a dispassionate manner.  The Commission (CWC) said the Supervisory Committee had visited the dam during its annual meetings held at the project site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-of-mullaperiyar-dam-satisfactory-cwc-to-sc/article38342651.ece

A Bench comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao and B.R. Gavai also asked the government, represented by senior advocate P.V. Surendranath, not to insist on surrender of those prisoners out on interim bail or parole in view of the surge in cases again. “Now, you do not insist on people coming back. Examine the position in jails, if the position of COVID in jail is bad, see to it that people go home and come back,” it observed. It was hearing a batch of pleas challenging the State’s order asking prisoners who were released on parole or interim bail in the wake of the pandemic to surrender back to jails. One of the petitioners, Dolphy, who was released from the prison on parole, has rushed to the apex court after being asked to surrender back to jail despite the poor pandemic situation in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sc-asks-state-to-consider-releasing-more-prisoners/article38342621.ece

The work kicked off on Thursday with the setting up of an electric mast at Vadanakurissi, 3 km from Shoranur. Railway officials said that the electrification work on the 66-km route was expected to complete by October. About 1,300 masts need to be erected for the project. Mast erection will be followed by contilever assembly and wiring. Traction substation A traction substation is being set up at Melattur as part of the electrification project. Switching stations are coming up at Vadanakurissi, Angadipuram, and Vaniyambalam. The Shoranur-Nilambur line is one of the eight electrification projects being taken up in the Southern Railway. The other projects are Podanur- Pollachi and Palakkad- Pollachi- Dindigul, Salem- Vridhachalam- Cuddalure, Madurai- Manamadurai, Tiruchchirappalli- Manamadurai- Virudunagar, Tenkasi- Tirunelveli- Tiruchendur, and Tenkasi- Virudunagar. The Railways have allocated Rs. 587.53 crore for the electrification projects.

A district-level COVID-19 review meet that was held on Friday decided to revive rapid response teams (RRTs) and volunteer groups to intensify the pandemic-control measures. Janakeeya hotels and community kitchens will also be opened wherever necessary. Evening outpatient facility will be resumed in primary and community health centres across the district. General Education and Labour Minister V. Sivankutty, who chaired the online meeting, stressed the role of RRTs in local self-government institutions in ensuring the welfare of the large proportion of COVID-19-infected people who were quarantining at home. Priority must also be given to ensure all children aged between 15 and 18 years were vaccinated. He also called for steps to intensify containment efforts at the ward level. Control rooms and front help-desks must also be opened in hospitals and local body offices at the earliest, he said. Volunteer teams Mr. Sivankutty also issued directions to establish an adequate number of domiciliary care centres (DCCs) and COVID first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) in each local body.

Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan claims that the CPI has taken strong exception to the bid to defang the ombudsman via a "rash" executive order on the eve of the budget session of the Assembly. Kanam’s stance Mr. Satheesan appears to peg his argument on CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran's purported position that the government should have ideally introduced a Bill in the House to redeem anomalies, if any, in the Lok Ayukta Act, 1999. Bid to dilute Section 14 Mr. Satheesan alleges that the CPI(M) had conspiratorially pressed for an executive order in a Cabinet meeting last week to dilute Section 14 of the Kerala Lok Ayukta Act. It has not consulted its LDF allies. He alleges that the proposed Ordinance aims at forestalling the Constitutional and political fallout of possible adverse Lok Ayukta findings against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Higher Education Minister R. Bindu. The Lok Ayukta is currently investigating allegations of corruption and nepotism against them. The complainants, including Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, had moved the ombudsman for a "declaration" banning the leaders from holding public office under Section 14 of the Act. Mr. Satheesan also says the move to dilute the Lok Ayukta goes against the grain of the CPI(M) central committee's support for a powerful Lok Pal and Lok Ayukta. Minister’s claim flayed He slams Law Minister P. Rajeeve's claim that the Lok Ayukta Act violates Article 164 of the Constitution. CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has echoed a similar view. "How could a Minister deem a law passed by the Assembly as Unconstitutional? Such privilege is the preserve of the judiciary," he says.  In an article in the CPI(M) mouthpiece Deshabhimani , Mr. Balakrishnan suggests that the Lok Ayukta law in its current form could open the door for undue interference by the Centre in State affairs. He seems to hinge his argument on Section 14 that deems the Governor the "competent authority" to act upon an "adverse declaration" by the Lok Ayukta. As per the Act, the Lok Ayukta's declaration is binding on the competent authority and pointedly lacks an appeal provision.  Mr. Rajendran, in what appears to be a riposte to Mr. Balakrishnan's argument, says an Ordinance is no resistance against the trespasses on federalism. "Only a mustering of popular opinion could resist such overreach," he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-sees-dissension-in-ruling-front/article64991301.ece

Even though the graph rose furiously in the first two weeks, there is a slow down in the growth of new cases. On Friday, for the third consecutive day, the daily caseload crossed the 50,000 mark. Kerala logged 54,537 new cases when 1,15,898 samples were tested in the past 24 hours. The active case pool now has 3,33,447 patients, of whom 3.5% are currently admitted in hospitals or field hospitals. The number of recoveries reported on the day was 30,225. Hospitalisations continue to rise in proportion to the increase in new cases and on Friday 1,629 people were newly admitted to hospitals. The number of patients admitted with moderate or severe COVID in hospitals has risen to 11,698. ICU and ventilator occupancy shows a definite rise and on Friday 87 persons were newly admitted for ICU care, while another 31 persons were put in ventilator support. Toll rises to 52,786 The official case fatality now stands at 52,786, with the State adding 352 deaths to the official list of COVID deaths on Friday. These include 13 deaths which occurred in the last 24 hours, 258 deaths which have now been accepted as COVID deaths by the government. The cumulative case burden now stands at 58,81,133 cases. The third wave of COVID-19 in the State, fuelled by the Omicron virus variant, which began rising in the first week of January, is likely to start declining by February second week, Health Minister Veena George said here on Friday. The trend of the graph of new cases shows while the number of new infections daily continues to remain high, the graph has not been surging forward either. If December last week is taken as the baseline, the rate of increase on new cases was 45% in the first week of January. By the second week of January, new cases rose by 148%, which spiralled up to 215% in the third week. In the current week, the rate of increase had come down to 71%, Ms. George told mediapersons here. Next 3 weeks crucial That said, the next three weeks will be crucial for the State when new cases will continue to push up hospitalisation proportionately. ICU occupancy has not surged in proportion to the increase in new cases either in government or in private hospitals, she claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/case-graph-showing-signs-of-plateauing-in-the-state/article64991299.ece

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:11 IST,KERALA||An underwhelming experience||A short animation clip that accompanies the title sequence of Bro Daddy gives a hint of the kind of film that one is in for. In those few minutes, filled with some stale jokes, we are reminded multiple times of the very small age gap between John Kattadi (Mohanlal) and his son Eesho John Kattadi (Prithviraj). If that fact did not still get registered in your head, there is the rest of the movie where constant reminders of the same are served.  John and Anna (Meena) had married quite young and they are eager for their son Eesho, an advertising professional, to get married. Eesho, meanwhile, is in a relationship with Anna (Kalyani Priyadarshan), the daughter of John’s best friend Kurian (Lalu Alex) and Elsy (Kaniha). But what could have been an easy alliance is complicated by two ‘accidents’ that threaten to derail all their plans. Light-hearted  In his second directorial after Lucifer , Prithviraj chooses to scale down his ambition quite a bit to make a light-hearted family drama. The script by Sreejith N. and Bibin Maliekal draws on a subject that has been tackled earlier in films like Pavithram and Badhai Ho , but here they attempt to give it a slightly different packaging. The film seems to be placed in a social setting where abortion is almost considered a sin, that it feels like a counterpoint to recent films like Sara’s , which took a more progressive stand on such issues.  Much of the script is woven around the camaraderie between the father-son duo and their attempts to solve the mess. But, the film does not have much of a conflict that could make for a gripping narrative, the only one being that Kurian should not come to know of the ‘accidents’. Almost the entire second half is written in such a way as to delay the inevitable, with quite a few of it predictable from miles away. A separate comedy track involving event manager Happy (Soubin Shahir) further drags down the narrative, without managing any laughs. Mohanlal at ease Mohanlal appears to be more at ease and seemed to be enjoying the role, compared to most of his recent outings. Some of the humour involving him does work, while some other jokes in the movie are tasteless or stale, and fall flat. Quite a few of the jokes are written around the names of the characters. Whether by design or accident, the aesthetics of the whole film mirrors that of an advertisement with its settings in carefully curated, prim and proper upper-class homes. That one of the protagonists is an advertising professional and a key plot point is regarding an advertisement, also make one wonder whether all the artificial, curated look of the film was intentional.  A weak, predictable script makes Bro Daddy an underwhelming experience with a few bright spots.  S.R.

To find out, a team of scientists from the Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, spent many a night in people’s backyards, empty lots and underdeveloped sites looking for sleeping lizards. “Poking around in neighbourhoods at night with headlights and fancy camera equipment often drew a lot of attention from people and the police, and the team had to explain what they were doing on several occasions,” said Nitya Mohanty, quoted in a press release from IISc. The team was hunting for a species of lizards, Rock Agamas, to study how urbanisation has affected their sleep patterns. They found that urban lizards “use sleep sites that mirror the structural, thermal and light properties of natural habitats”. What’s more, city lizards choose sleep sites that resemble that of their rural counterparts in the type of surface and the amount of light and heat received.  The findings were recently published in the peer reviewed journal Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology . The authors noted that the remarkable flexibility in sleep behaviour displayed by urban lizards is likely to help them cope in a city.  Urban habitats can hamper an animal’s sleep quality and patterns due to higher temperatures, the presence of artificial structures like walls and buildings built by humans, and artificial light at night. “What’s interesting is that both rural and urban lizards are dependent on rough, rocky substrates. While scientists have a reasonably good understanding of how animal brains work during sleep, how they sleep in the real world is not well known,” said Maria Thaker, associate professor at CES and senior author of the study. “We wanted to understand where and how they sleep in the wild,” she said. To do this, researchers conducted night forays in rural and urban areas. The temperatures of both urban and rural sleep sites were found to be similar. Urban sleep sites were nine times more likely to be sheltered and covered as compared to rural sites, and this helped address the light problem in urban areas. “This indicates that the lizards try to mitigate urban stressors by being flexible in their sleep site choices, and end up picking sites that resemble their rural sites,” stated the release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/urban-lizards-seek-spots-that-mimic-natural-sites/article64991129.ece

Speaking at a programme in Bengaluru to mark the completion of six months by his Government, the Chief Minister remarked, “Every decision we will be taking from now onwards will be with full confidence, energy and swiftness.” Recalling that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked him to build a very strong State when he met him for the first time after becoming the Chief Minister, Mr. Bommai said, “We will work 24/7 to turn the Prime Minister’s wish into a reality.” “The last six months were the confidence building phase about facing any challenges. The next one year will be about bringing comprehensive development,” he said. Remarking that his Government would rise up to the expectation of various sections of people through development programmes, he expressed confidence that people would repose faith in him. Floods and pandemic Mr. Bommai explained that his Government had faced a tough challenge of floods on the one hand and pandemic on the other. “Though I was keen to help different sections of people through various new programmes, the resource crunch had put us in a dilemma,” he said. He remarked that his was a Government with conscience, humanity and sensitivity. “This is evident in our actions that have sent a clear message that we will not let down our people at any situation,” he said, while referring to some of the welfare measures taken up by his Government amidst pandemic-induced shortfall in revenues. Mr. Bommai said all decisions in the last six months had been guided by public interest and welfare. “I want to make it clear that none of the decisions made by my Government in the last six months have any personal interest,” he said. ‘Real spirit’ Ridiculing other political parties for “turning social justice into a political slogan”, he said his Government wanted to ensure social justice in its “real spirit” so that even the last man from the oppressed sections would live with self-esteem. In this context, he said his Government would bring about a comprehensive change in funding programmes related to the welfare of SCs, STs and OBCs in the next State Budget.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bommai-vows-to-work-247-to-fulfil-modis-wish/article64991126.ece

Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has appreciated the State Government’s initiative during a video conference with Ministers and officials of the southern states to review the situation arising out of Coronavirus (Cpvod-19) pandemic. Health Minister T. Harish Rao participated in the video conference which was attended by representatives from AP, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Mr. Harish Rao explained the State’s preparedness to tackle COVID-19, fever survey, progress of vaccination and related issues to the Union Minister. He recalled that Telangana was the first to launch fever survey during the second wave of the pandemic and the exercise yielded good results. The current round of the survey was launched after the instructions from Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. As many as 21,150 medical teams comprising members from Health, Panchayat Raj/Municipal Administration and other departments were engaged in the conduct of the survey. The teams were visiting every household to check the health status of individuals and home isolation kits were being provided to those found with symptoms of the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-lauds-the-fever-survey-of-telangana/article38342738.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:36 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Land registrations pick up||Registration of agricultural and non-agricultural properties is witnessing a steep surge in the last couple of days amidst reports that the government would announce revision of market values for different types of lands in a couple of days. The offices of the sub registrars (SROs) in urban and rural areas registered significant rise in the number of transactions since the past few days with the impending hike in the market values of lands. Senior officials said the preliminary exercise for revision of market values of lands have been completed and a final report will be sent to the government in a day or two. “This will be followed by issuance of a formal order by the government revising market value of lands,” a senior official said. Though the date from which the new market values will be effected has not been notified yet, senior officials say that the new values are likely to be effective from February 1. The trend of registrations could be seen from the fact that the SROs and MRO offices reported little over 11,000 transactions on Thursday itself as against the average 5,000 transactions per day. The revenue earned during the day too was no less impressive with the department registering Rs. 110 crore on a single day against the daily average of Rs. 45 crore. There were problems pertaining to the operation of Dharani portal in some SROs where the registrations were stopped for a few hours before the server was set right. But officials said these were mostly because of the registration process relating to agricultural properties. Registration of agricultural properties through Dharani involves slot booking, completion of the deed and processing application for new passbooks as well as processing certificates pertaining to general power of attorney. Of the 11,000 plus transactions reported on Thursday, over 9,000 pertained to agricultural lands thus compounding the problems of the officials. This has resulted in long queues of buyers/sellers at the SROs till late evening. “Registration of non-agricultural properties is going on without any interruption. But the server had slowed down in case of agricultural transactions owing to multiple issues that need to be processed.  The issue has been sorted out yesterday night and transactions are progressing normally today,” the official told The Hindu . It may be recalled that the government has revised the registration charges and stamp duties in June last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/land-registrations-particularly-of-agricultural-lands-pick-up/article64991121.ece

Telineelapuram is a designated Important Bird Area (IBA), where the migrant species have been succumbing to ‘Nematode infestation’ since December. The IBA is also home to painted stork ( Mycteria leucocephala ), which has not been infected with the Nematode infestation so far.  On an average, at least five spot-billed pelicans are dying every day. The total death toll has crossed 160, including six that died on Friday. Nearly 180 more adult spot-billed pelicans are surviving along with their chicks that are expected to be homebound by mid-Summer.  In-charge District Forest Officer (Srikakulam) S. Venkatesh told The Hindu on Friday that they had appealed to the experts from the WII, ZSI, and BNHS. They are likely to arrive at the scene within four days to launch the exercise to prevent the mass mortality and explore solutions for the infestation.  “Some samples, including specimens of the dead spot-billed pelicans, are being sent to the National Avian Forensic Laboratory (SACON-Coimbatore) for scientific study. At this stage of mass mortality of the winged guests from Siberia region, we are in desperate need of experts from the premier research institutes to save the habitat,” said Mr. Venkatesh. Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF-Visakhapatnam) P. Ram Mohan said that a strategy was being prepared with various stakeholders to rescue the remaining spot-billed pelicans at the Telineelapuram IBA. PCCF and Head of Forest Force (Andhra Pradesh) N. Prateep Kumar said that he was closely monitoring the mass mortality. No survey The Forest department authorities did not document the gender of the dead spot-billed pelicans since December 26. The further care of the chicks is in question in the absence of the gender data of the dead birds. If an adult female bird dies, its chicks will lose the feeding source. The chicks are also unlikely to return to Siberia in the absence of their mother. In Telineelapuram IBA, the spot-billed pelican returns with its chicks only when the latter is able to fly on its own.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-ropes-in-experts-to-prevent-mass-mortality-of-spot-billed-pelicans/article64991212.ece

Former Minister for Higher Education and Wakf K.T. Jaleel had been questioned in 2020 on the charge of accepting the consignments of the Koran and a vast quantity of dates that were imported by the consulate. Customs sources said they had sought the MEA’s permission to question the consulate officials as they enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The Customs charge is that the Kerala government had accepted copies of the Koran and dates that were imported by the consulate officials for their personal use in violation of the Customs Act. The former Minister’s initiative in distributing the Koran in some parts of northern Kerala had kicked up a political storm, as an allegation of violation of protocol was raised against him. It was further alleged that some packets of the holy book were taken for distribution in official vehicles of some departments under his administrative control. Defending his action, Dr. Jaleel had contended that the distribution of the holy book ought to be viewed only as a cultural activity. In the meantime, the trial in the gold-smuggling case, which too had been registered by the Customs in the wake of the dollar smuggling case, is set to begin by March, Customs sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/customs-dept-to-serve-notice-on-ex-staff-of-uae-consulate/article64991127.ece

When the case came up before Justice P. Gopinath on Friday, the actor submitted that the direction of the police was illegal and in violation of the orders issued by the Supreme Court. The police could not demand the accused to produce any evidence against him. The act of the police amounted to violation of the fundamental rights and was an infringement on his right to privacy, the counsel contended. The police had asked Dileep, his brother Anoop, and brother-in-law T. N. Suraj to produce their phones before the investigation officer. The phones contained several private messages and conversations, which, if released, could violate the fundamental rights of the actor, the counsel submitted. ‘Wrong precedent’ On the court’s direction that the phones shall be kept in the custody of the Registrar of the High Court and they shall not be removed from there without the direction of the court, the counsel submitted that such an order would set a wrong precedent. He also submitted that the actor had submitted the phones for forensic analysis. T. A. Shaji, Director General of Prosecution, submitted that the accused were not cooperating with the investigation. The refusal to hand over the phones amounted to violation of the court directives. The act of the accused submitting the phones for forensic examination was something unheard of. The counsel for the actor submitted that the case shall be considered on Saturday to provide an opportunity for senior counsel B.

The enumeration is part of the All-India Tiger and Mega Herbivore Estimation which is also under way in Bandipur, Nagarahole, and M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary. G. Santoshkumar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, said the field staff and officials were trained in the use of MSTRIPE Ecological App and it was being used to post data on a real-time basis and the exercise commenced on Thursday. In all, there are 43 beats coming under the BRT Tiger Reserve where 56 line transects too have been laid. The tiger enumeration also entails conducting line transect survey and sign survey. Details and data pertaining to both carnivore and herbivore animals would also be collected through direct sighting method. The indirect sightings of wildlife entails identification of scat, scratch marks, pug marks etc., the details of which would be uploaded using MSTRIPE, he said. The 2018 census pegged the number of tigers at BRT Tiger Reserve at 58 and it is expected to be higher this year, he added. The tiger reserve which is spread over nearly 540 sq km, was declared a tiger reserve in 2011 and has major forest vegetation types ranging from scrub jungles to evergreen, grasslands and deciduous. As per the 2018 NTCA report on tigers and co-predators 49 individual tigers were identified based on camera trap images and the survey indicated the presence of chital, sambar, gaur, elephant, wild boars, and barking deer in high densities. The report stated that 32 species of ungulates, carnivores, omnivores etc., were photo-captured in the tiger reserve and chital as the most commonly photo-captured species followed by brown mongoose. The NTCA report underlined that BRT supported a medium density tiger population but had the potential to become one of the source populations in the Western Ghats provided its connectivity with Bandipur-Mudumalai-Nagarahole-Wayanad complex was maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tiger-enumeration-under-way-at-brt-tiger-reserve/article64991122.ece

On January 3, it asked the court to postpone the case to January 28, saying it needed time to file a rejoinder. On Friday, when asked by a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, it said its officers were down with COVID-19. The case is now posted to February 25. The court issued notice to the bailed out accused persons on November 22 last. The CBI had argued that there may be a “larger conspiracy involving foreign powers” in the case, which stalled the technology to develop the cryogenic engine by decades. The CBI has challenged the bail granted at the “threshold” of the investigation. ‘Larger conspiracy’ “The frame-up led to the arrest of scientists. The technology for the cryogenic engine was deliberately stalled for at least two decades... May be a larger conspiracy involving foreign powers... Grant of anticipatory bail at the threshold may harm the investigation,” Additional Solicitor-General S.V. Raju, for the CBI, had submitted. The Kerala High Court had granted anticipatory bail to P.S. Jayaprakash, Thampi S. Durga Dutt, Vijayan and R.B. Sreekumar. The court had held that the accused “should not be made to face a similar situation of being forced to undergo the ignominy of being incarcerated in the prison for interrogation at this old age after their retirement for an incident that took place a quarter of the century ago.” The High Court also noted that there was no “indication or material, apart from the rhetoric that a foreign power has a hand in persuading the petitioners,” to implicate the ISRO scientists in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/top-court-again-adjourns-cbi-plea-in-isro-frame-up-case/article38342081.ece

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that Amul was the largest dairy cooperative society having enormous experience in milk processing. “Amul is into manufacturing chocolates directly from milk and competing with world-class companies,” he said. “Amul has started procuring milk in six districts – Prakasam, Chittoor, Kadapa, Guntur, West Godavari and Krishna – benefitting many dairy farmers. It is buying milk by paying more than the private dairies,” the Chief Minister added. “The farmers are the stakeholders in the society. Amul is paying a decent price to dairy farmers with no scope for cheating, adulteration and middlemen. It is sharing the profits as bonus every six months,” he asserted, adding, “Other dairies have started paying Rs. 5 to Rs. 20 per litre more after Amul’s entry.” “The government is setting up Bulk Milk Coolers (BMCs) and Automatic Milk Collection (AMC) units at locations where milk is being procured. They will come up in every village as Amul project expands,” he said. Stating that some vested interests had destroyed the cooperative dairies and many of them turned into private firms, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy alleged. “During my padayatra, many dairy farmers had said they were not getting the price equal to at least one-litere of mineral water bottle. Now, the government is taking measures to overcome such a scenario,” he said. ‘Focus on checking fraud’ Asserting that the government had laid focus on preventing fraud in milk procurement, he said 20 cases were registered at various locations. The accused had paid less than the prescribed price, he added. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy thanked MD of Amul R.S. Sodhi, MD of Kaira Milk Union Amit Vyas, MD of Banaskantha Milk Union Sangram Chaudhary, and MD of Sabarkantha Milk Union Anil Bayati for participating in the event. Ministers D. Krishna Das, S. Appalraju, and T. Vanitha, Chief Secretary Sameer Sharma, Agri Mission Vice-Chairman M.V.S. Nagi Reddy, Agriculture Special Chief Secretary P. Malakondaiah, Women and Child Welfare Principal Secretary A.R. Anuradha, APDDCF MD A. Babu, Animal Husbandry Director Amarendra Kumar, and Amul Senior General Manager J.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:31 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC registry directed to list PRC petition before a Division Bench||The Andhra Pradesh High Court registry has once again been directed to list the petition filed by AP Gazetted Officers’ Joint Action Committee chairman K.V. Krishnaiah against the government employees’ revised pay scales, to an appropriate Bench as decided by the Chief Justice. A single-judge Bench comprising Justice M. Satyanarayana Murthy passed the order on the grounds that any challenge to the PRC rules ought to be dealt only by a Division Bench (DB). Advocate-General S. Sriram informed the court that since it was a matter where statutory ruleshad been challenged, it should be heard by a Division Bench as per No. 14(a)(6) of the Writ Proceedings Rules, 1977, to which the judge agreed and ordered that the same be referred to a competent Bench of two judges. Petitioner’s plea Advocate P. Ravi Teja appeared for the petitioner, whose basic argument was that the employees had been kept in the dark about the recommendations of the Pay Revision Commission (PRC). He wanted a direction to the Chief Secretary, Principal Secretaries - Finance and Revenue, PRC Commissioner and Secretary (Union Ministry of Home Affairs) to notify the pay scales only after taking their representations into consideration. It may be noted that a Division Bench, comprising Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and B.S. Bhanumathi, said during a hearing on January 24 that it had no jurisdiction over the petition, observing that it appeared to be a service matter and even if it was a PIL, it was not maintainable before them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-registry-directed-to-list-prc-petition-before-a-division-bench/article64991206.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:31 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Buggana says no to Fiscal Council||Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy has turned down the possibility of setting up a Fiscal Council as being demanded by the opposition parties. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Rajendranath Reddy reminded the opposition parties that the Union government had ruled out the setting up of the fiscal council as recommended by the FRBM Review Committee. The Union government had reasoned that there were institutions such as the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), the National Statistical Commission, and the Finance Commission that were already performing some, or all of the proposed functions of the Fiscal Council, he said. Referring to the allegations that there was gross mismatch between the budgetary allocations and expenditure, the Finance Minister said the government was implementing the budget as per the FRBM rules. “It is not correct to compare the COVID year, 2020-21, with the normal years. The State finances are badly hit by the pandemic. The revenues dipped by Rs. 8,000 crore, while the government had to spend Rs. 7,120 crore on COVID control and health,” he pointed out. Dig at TDP The Minister also condemned the TDP allegation that the government was spending more on publicity rather than on welfare. The government spent more than Rs. 1.20 lakh crore on welfare. No other government in the country was spending such huge amounts on welfare, he added. “In fact, it is the TDP culture. The real estate, the MoUs with the private companies, the hype and unrealistic projections of development, and the watering down of the education, medical and health sectors were developments from the TDP viewpoint. But, for the YSRCP, human capital formation, betterment of education, medical and health, women empowerment, decentralisation of development, industrialisation and employment generation is development,” he asserted, and added that the opposition parties were expected to make constructive criticism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/buggana-says-no-to-fiscal-council/article64991209.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:31 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chief Minister urges Prime Minister to reconsider changes to IAS cadre rules||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to reconsider the proposal and retain the existing process of requiring State governments to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to officers going on deputation to the Central government. In the letter, Mr. Jagan “wholeheartedly welcomed” the initiative taken by the Union government to ensure that the departments and offices at the Central government were manned by able officers from the Indian Administrative Service. Such strong and sufficiently manned team at the helm of affairs in the Central government would be essential to ensure smooth and seamless functioning of the government, he said. “I strongly believe that States would benefit immensely from such well-functioning departments in the Government of India,” he said. “Further, more IAS officers from the State cadre in different levels at Central government will help the State in pursuing the issues pertaining to the State with the Government of India.” Flexibility Mr. Jagan, however, said that the proposed amendment may take away such an important flexibility from the State government to plan such deputation of officers. The proposed amendments in IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954, the concurrence of the State Government or the officer may not be necessary. The officers chosen by the Central government for central deputation may have to be relieved by the State government within the stipulated period irrespective of the willingness of the State government. Such untimely change in the leadership of a department/ project in the State Government would derail some critical projects taken up by the State. “Such sudden deputation orders to an officer without his/her willingness will affect the personal lives of such officer considering their families, children and their education and he/she may not be able to deliver to the best of his/her abilities in such circumstances”, he observed. The officers were given responsibilities in the State considering their skill sets and experience required to handle the most critical projects in the State. The State government, in general, issues the No Objection Certificates (NOC) to officers requesting for Central deputation after assessing his/her skill set, experience and the need of the officer to handle some critical departments/projects. Such requirement of NOC from the State government gave some flexibility to the State Government to carefully plan such deputation of officers from the State to Central Government without adversely affecting the State’s interests while duly meeting the requirements of the Central Deputation Reserve, he said. Hence, it was requested to reconsider the proposal and retain the existing process of requiring State Governments to issue NOCs to officers going on deputation to Central Government, he said adding, “I assure your kind self the highest support of Govt of Andhra Pradesh in your every step to make our country a better place.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chief-minister-urges-prime-minister-to-reconsider-changes-to-ias-cadre-rules/article38342751.ece

Only a ginger group of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s advisers are running the show. Except the advisers, the Ministers are not uttering a word on the government policies,” Mr. Ramakrishnudu observed in a statement on Friday. Mr. Ramakrishnudu said that the YSRCP government was so “undemocratic, unconstitutional and choking” that nobody was being given a chance to speak out against any injustice. Pointing out that only the advisers were issuing statements on all the subjects, Mr. Ramakrishnudu wondered how they could speak on issues relating to the government departments and employees. “Government Adviser Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy wields power in the State and Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy outside the State. The Ministers are silent spectators,” Mr. Ramakrishnudu added.

Speaking at an orientation session for Ministers, MLAs and MLCs on “Nadu-Nedu- Academic School Mapping”, the Minister said the very objective of the ongoing three-day session was to create awareness on the drive. “And yet certain people call it retrogressive,” he said. Mr. Suresh said the revolutionary changes ushered in the education sector at the behest of the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had already started showing positive results. He said because of the welfare programmes taken up by the government, the student enrolment in government schools had increased by more than 2 lakh new students. Unlike in the past when the government had to depend on the Centre for funds to improve the infrastructure facilities in schools, the YSRCP had initiated Nadu-Nedu under which funds were deposited in the accounts of the members of parents committee to maintain transparency, he said. Impressed by Nadu-Nedu, the neighbouring Telangana had also launched “Mana Vooru Mana Badi” programme on similar lines, he pointed out, and said that the government had been assuring time and again that not a single school would be closed down due to the school mapping and nor would the programme have any adverse effect on the teachers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/school-mapping-will-not-harm-teachers-interests/article38342835.ece

In the last 24 hours, the district recorded 1,211 new COVID-19 infections, according to the State COVID-19 bulletin released on Friday. During the same time, three persons died while undergoing treatment for the virus. The number of active cases stands at 12,272. But, the decline in the number of cases should not give room for complacency. A majority of doctors say that all COVID-19 protocols like wearing masks, maintaining physical distance in public places and sanitisation or frequent washing of hands will check the spread of the virus and prevent it from gaining virulence once again. Many people seem to be under the impression that the Omicron variant is harmless and taking the prescribed drugs would get them back to normalcy within two to three days. While this may be true to some extent, the infected persons should not forget that they have children, aged parents and those with co-morbidities at home, who could be easily affected by them, doctors said.. ‘Body pains’ “Omicron is generally starting with body pains and high fever, which is persisting for two to three days followed by cough for a day or so. However, cold is persisting among some patients for over a week. No other complications are being seen in 90 % of the cases. Those coming to the hospital are those over 50 years of age or with co-morbidities. In less than 10% of these case 2 to 4 litres of oxygen was given to improve their oxygen level,” K. Rambabu, Director of Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) and State Coordinator for COVID-19. “Those who have recovered from the virus should follow protocols and continue to remain at home at least for a week. Omicron variant is spreading rapidly and they can become super spreaders and cause danger to others. Those who do not have any symptoms should also follow the norms,” he says. “Omicron has developed the immune escape mechanism and those already affected by COVID-19 in the past and those fully vaccinated are also getting it. However, unvaccinated persons and those with co-morbid conditions are seen to be getting severe symptoms,” M.S.S. Mukherjee, senior interventional cardiologist, Medicover Hospitals, Hyderabad, said in a webinar organised jointly by the Praja Arogya Vedika, Jana Vigyana Vedika and AIDWA recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/district-reports-three-deaths-1211-new-cases/article64991135.ece

Addressing the media here, Mr. Vijaya Prasad said a compound wall was constructed about six months ago on a site. At that time, there was a dispute between the builders and the local farmers. Subsequently, a complaint was lodged with the Pendurthi police. Later, a police inspector had written a letter to the Mandal Revenue Officer (MRO) seeking that the boundaries at the site be fixed, Mr. Prasad said. A surveyor was sent and the boundaries were marked. A compound wall was later constructed after fixing the boundaries, he added. “Have the revenue officials informed the other party about the alleged encroachment before taking action? As per the procedure, before demolishing any property, the revenue officials should inform the police and take them to the site. Did they do that?” he questioned. The YSRCP leader said it was the Revenue Inspector and the VRO who had spoken “recklessly” and alleged that their intention was to defame the government. Disputing the charge that 20 to 25 persons had attacked the officers, Mr. Vijaya Prasad questioned why did not the revenue staff go for a medico legal case. When asked if he was trying to defend the accused, Mr. Vijaya Prasad said, “No. I am only trying to say that the process is not conducted. It needs to be investigated from all angles.” Collector’s warning With the District Collector taking up the issue with the Commissioner of Police, the Pendurthi police arrested four persons in the case. They were identified as Md. Ghouse (42), M. Parameswara Rao (36), V. Appalaswamy (31) of Kothapalem and B. Hari Babu (40) of Gopalapatnam. Two more persons, including the main accused, Doddi Kiran, are at large.

Twelve jute factories and two sugar factories were closed in the last couple of years owing to various reasons, such as steep hike in raw material cost and drop in demand for produce. With the strong competition from Bangladesh jute products, the jute companies in Vizianagaram stopped production. Some of them will not be revived in future too with the sale and conversion of properties for other purposes. Bhimasingi Sugar factory, which stopped production for ‘renovation’, had informed the government that there was no chance of taking up crushing of sugarcane in the near future. NCS Sugars which has its factory in Latchayyapeta near Bobbili also stopped crushing owing to lack of remunerative price for sugar in the market. “The government should announce a support price of at least at least Rs. 3,500 a quintal as against existing price of Rs. 3,100, so that the company will be able to meet the production cost. It should also provide incentives for farmers for growing sugarcane. This step will ensure assured sugarcane during crushing season. Earlier, we used to crush nearly 15 lakh tonnes of sugarcane, but it came down to 1.3 lakh tonnes last year. In the current year, crushing was halted with the lack of sufficient sugarcane for crushing,” said Narayanam Nageswara Rao, Managing Director of NCS Sugars. Former TDP MLC Dwarapureddy Jagadish said a comprehensive policy was needed to instill confidence among the industrialists to reopen the factories. “Many rice mills also closed down in the last few years due to various reasons. Proper support for agro-based industries will create economic activity in rural areas and provide livelihood to many people directly and indirectly,” he added. Lok Satta Party State president Bhisetti Babji, who staged many protests for revival of Bhimasingi Sugar factory, urged the government to take steps for revival of all agro-based factories to provide livelihood to farmers, villagers and others. “Many small-scale industries in Bobbili growth centre, industrial estates of Kothavalasa, Nellimarla and other areas are also facing many problems. They are unable to get bank loans also. All these factors are leading to migration of labourers from the district. The government should look into these issues to ensure livelihood for people of the backward district,” said Mr. Babji. ‘Hold meeting’ AITUC Vizianagaram district general secretary Bugata Ashok urged the government to hold a meeting with stakeholders for the revival of factories in the district. He alleged that many jute industries failed to clear Provident Fund and other dues to the workers in spite of many meetings organised by Labour Department officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fourteen-factories-wind-up-operations-in-vizianagaram-dist/article64991145.ece

November and December last showed the promise with industry getting back on its toes but the Omicron threat has now damaged the hopes, said Shankar Krishnamurthy, Hyderabad Chapter head of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI). However, he hopes that by March the situation would improve and the State government has been quite supportive in terms of not being too strict with the working hours and other issues associated with the functioning of restaurants. As a part of the efforts to bring hotels and restaurants on a single platform and work with the government, the hoteliers formed the Hyderabad chapter of NRAI, which was launched by Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, Industries and IT here on Friday. Mr. Jayesh Ranjan said the government understand the precarious situation of the industry and a representative body like NRAI would provide a better platform for the government to engage and extend help. Sampath Tummala, Co-Chapter head said the restaurant business is not recognised as an industry despite it contributing huge resources in the form of taxes to the State and Central governments. “The industry contributes much higher than film and entertainment industry but it is still regarded as the unorganised sector,” he observed. Mr. Tummala said the NRAI Hyderabad chapter will facilitate global brands investments in commensurate with the city stature apart from giving fillip for local brands to go global. The organised market share of restaurants in Hyderabad is around Rs. 6,037 crores. The NRAI Hyderabad chapter now has a membership of over 200 restaurants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/omicron-variant-has-hit-restaurant-industry-hard/article64991323.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the State government was contemplating to revive the Telangana Control of Organised Crime Act, 2001, against drug abuse and asked the Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy to come up with plans for its implementation. Addressing a State level conference of senior police and excise officials to discuss measures to tackle drug menace, Mr. Rao asked the police to take steps to deport foreign nationals who were involved in drug trafficking in the State. He called for innovative steps to curb drug abuse and wanted that about one thousand trained personnel should be exclusively appointed in a special wing to handle the job. The government will earmark the required funds to reward enforcement officers and give them acceleratory promotions for outstanding performance in dealing with the crime, he added. Mr. Rao asked the police officers not to spare anyone, however, big they may be if they were found to traffick in drugs.He advocated a two-pronged strategy to deal with the menace. One, people addicted to drugs should be referred to deaddiction camps with the help of their family members and, two, destroy the supply chain of drugs after identifying the youth attracted to it. The police should be armed with modern weapons in the fight against drug mafia. If needed, the officers could study good practices in this regard abroad. Officers in Punjab who were well experienced may be involved as resource persons to train personnel here. Mr. Rao said the State government will not mind any expenditure in the battle against drugs. But, it was focussed on getting to the roots of trade, distribution and consumption of contraband like ganja, narcotics and other substance. The consumption of ganja, cocaine and LSD was still in nascent stage in Telangana. It should be curbed in the initial stage itself before it expands its fangs. He reminded police officers that investments will flow to the State only if law and order was protected. The police took effective steps in maintenance of law and order. To continue the trend, a lot of responsibility was cast on the officers. He warned that the government will stop Rytu Bandhu and other government subsidies in villages if people did not pass on information about cultivation of ganja in their habitations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/strict-law-against-drug-abuse/article64991316.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 05:59 IST,TELANGANA||Nature lovers in an interesting race||Birds of different feathers flock together, birders from varied fields take different directions but with the same passion. And, not surprisingly, an undeclared race is on! It is a different race altogether where the best of birders from the City venture during the weekends to the neighbouring districts in search of the winged visitors and to freeze every minute detail of the birds in their cameras, with the ‘rankings’ changing every week depending on their 'findings'. Interestingly, the top five from Telangana as of now, in terms of completed checklists, are Chitra Shanker (1050), Srinivas Mallela (908), Aasheesh Pittie (847), Sriram Reddy (742), Gowtham ( 644 ) as per the e-Bird website, which is deemed an the authority in this regard. Just consider this, 56-year-old Chitra is an entomologist (study of insects) by profession working in Indian Institute of Rice Research (Rajendranagar), Srinivas is a chef, Sriram Reddy works with an international management and technology consultant firm. For someone who started bird watching and photography in 2018, Srinivas in the last 40 months observed 370 species and is keen to keep the number increasing for obvious reasons. Not many may be conscious of the gruelling schedules they have, often at the receiving end of the family members’ ire for not spending holidays at home! “Never ever during my 900-plus field visits, during which I have recorded 350 species with photographic evidence and 69 with audio recordings, did I feel disinterested. In fact, every trip gives you a whiff of fresh air and redoubled enthusiasm to find more and more birds,” says 34-year-old Srinivas. Some of the rare findings from this stable were the Speckled piculet at Gubbala Mangamma Thalli Temple (Bhadrachalam), Imperial eagle at Nizamabad and Srinivas owes everything in birding and photography to his mentor Bhaarat Vyas and to his fellow birders for always inspiring him to explore new frontiers. For her part, Chitra, who is into birding since her childhood and a member of the e-Bird since 2013, says she has checklisted 179 species of birds in a lake on the ICAR itself. “I love to look at the habitat, behaviour besides trying to find out how they travel from such far off distances like Siberia to descend on the City,” she said. “Numbers are not a priority. Yes, being at the top is some satisfaction but not the only thing, as I love studying these winged visitors and also getting involved in nature and conservation,” she said. By all means, these gifted photographers portray the lesser known facets of birds and their behaviour and hope many more take it up as a passion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nature-lovers-in-an-interesting-race/article64991329.ece

The cath lab was set up at a cost of Rs. 7.50 crore at the newly constructed block named cardiac emergency and trauma care centre on the premises of the hospital here. With the inauguration of the trauma care centre comprising 100 beds, the total bed strength in the district headquarters hospital has gone up to 550. Speaking on the occasion, Mr Harish Rao said the cath lab and trauma care centre were set up at the government hospital in Khammam, a major health facility in the State’s tribal heartland, to ensure prompt emergency medical services to patients with life threatening conditions and injuries. Three cath labs are presently functioning one each at the NIMS, Osmania General Hospital and Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad. Another cath lab will be set up in the government hospital in Adilabad, he said. Two cardiologists have been appointed and the requisite equipment including stents procured for the cath lab in the district headquarters hospital in Khammam.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:00 IST,TELANGANA||Needed a lot more gravitas||Had Good Luck Sakhi been a short story in a book, it could have been a young adult fiction that harks back to simpler times, narrating the story of a young woman from a village who dusted off her bad luck tag. As a film, it unravels like a throwback to less complicated narratives of the Hindi cinema of the 1970s. Kukunoor had stated that he wrote the story trying to keep the vibe of Hrishikesh Mukherji. The first hour pretty much exists in such a zone, despite the story being set in a fictitious Rayalaseema village where a Telangana origin Sakhi (Keerthy Suresh) takes centre stage.   It is tough to watch the opening portions without giving in to a big smile. A baraat is on the way to Sakhi’s house and a bunch of kids think it is fun to welcome the groom with crackers. Taken aback, the horse goes rogue and leaves the groom with a broken limb. Apparently, he is not the first groom to have suffered as a result of Sakhi’s bad luck. Nobody thinks the firecrackers are a problem! It all unfolds like a Hollywood musical, with Devi Sri Prasad setting the mood with the delightful ‘Adigo vastundi bad luck Sakhi…’ The milieu is charming. Chirantan Das’s cinematography captures the earthiness and the pop of colours. The portions where Sakhi meets her childhood friend ‘goli’ Raju aka Ramarao (Aadhi Pinisetty), now a theatre actor, are fun to watch, accentuated with the game of marbles and the village candy seller. The arrival of a former Colonel (Jagapathi Babu) who wants to mentor shooting enthusiasts in the village changes things. These portions are also set in a familiar zone, with humour pervading the narrative until the Colonel finds Sakhi and Suri (Rahul Ramakrishna) to be worthy of mentoring. The unspoken romance between Ramarao and Sakhi, the vicious nature of Suri and the growing confidence of Sakhi, coupled with her admiration and fondness for her guru are the various aspects the story deals with. Keerthy Suresh plays Sakhi with an innocent charm and Jagapathi Babu and Aadhi Pinisetty are adequate in their parts. There are a few good touches. For instance, the scene in which Sakhi speaks up in a panchayat and lets people know what she wants. Elsewhere, she shows that she is capable of defending herself when harassed. But all this does not feel enough as the story progresses. Nothing feels insurmountable in Sakhi’s journey — neither the conflicts that arise due to matters of the heart nor the troublemaker who surreptitiously tries to derail her. The story needed gravitas. We never get the feeling that Sakhi truly yearns to be a sportsperson. Above all, what made the Colonel open a shooting range in the village even before he knew there would be takers for it?  If the story had more depth, it could have been another Iqbal — an underdog story of small town aspirations and triumph against all odds. But it falls short. Kukunoor’s Telugu debut film could have been so much more.

Before this, the country’s largest EV charging station was in Navi Mumbai, with 16 AC and 4 DC charging ports for such vehicles. The EV charging station in Gurugram, with 72 AC slow-chargers and 24 DC fast-chargers, has been installed and is operated by a partner company of National Highways for Electric Vehicle (NHEV), as part of a pilot project to install charging stations on the Delhi-Jaipur and Delhi-Agra highways, and turn them into e-highways. The pilot project is aimed at demonstrating the competitive advantage of owning a charging station business over petrol pumps, in terms of ease in getting the necessary licensing, designing, commissioning, installation, electrification and safety certifications. 96 charging ports The station has 96 operational charging ports for electric vehicles and can serve up to 576 electric vehicles round-the-clock. The remaining four charging points will also become operational soon. One AC charger takes up to six hours to charge an EV and can charge a total of four vehicles in a day. While a DC charger can charge a vehicle in less than two hours and can comfortably charge 12 EVs every day. Future of transport Abhijeet Sinha, Project Director, NHEV, said that the electric vehicles were the future of transport, in preparation for which this station had been built as a prototype. Sudhendu J. Sinha, Adviser (Infrastructure, Connectivity – Transport and Electric Mobility), NITI Aayog, said that India was committed towards its fight against environmental degradation and in achieving carbon neutrality by 2070. He added that electric vehicles would help India significantly in achieving those targets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/indias-largest-electric-vehicle-charging-station-set-up-in-gurugram/article64991460.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 05:26 IST,||Voters in Swabhiman Anchal no longer fear election||For the first time, Ramdas Sisa may not need to carry a shaving blade to cast his vote. Or pretend to be drunk while walking back from the polling booth. The sexagenarian tribesman is looking forward to casting his vote without any fear in the upcoming rural polls in the Swabhiman Anchal. The tactics Mr. Sisa resorted to for years was apparently to avoid the wrath of the Left Wing Extremists (LWEs). He lives in Jodambo village, in the Swabhiman Anchal, also known as the Cut-Off Area in Malkangiri district that has witnessed several bloody attacks on the security forces by the outlawed CPI(Maoist). “After casting my vote I would earlier scrape off the indelible ink mark on the fingernail with a shaving blade to erase proof of my voting. Or, I would totter back home to escape the attention of the extremists,” Mr. Sisa said. His neighbour, Anand Silai, would head for a relative’s home from the polling booth to avoid being spotted anywhere near Jodambo post-polling. The villagers would be tortured if found to defy the Maoists’ diktat against participating in the election, they alleged. But now the fear of voting is gone, given the strong presence of security forces and the extremists beating a retreat, Mr. Sisa said. At Luchapani village under Papermetla gram panchayat, Dambaru Kila is happy that his elder son, Paul, who had to spend five years away from family due to the Maoist threat, would vote for the first time in the panchayat election. Khanda Hantal is the only candidate for ward member at Hantalguda village and doesn’t see any threat to his life. “Villagers are confident and excited to exercise their franchise this time,” he said. Panchayat polls are scheduled to be held in five phases in Odisha between February 16 and 24. Probably for the first time in decades, the election is expected to be held smoothly and helicopters won’t be used to air-drop the pollsters. The 2017 panchayat election could not be held following threats by the red rebels to unleash violence in the event of voting. The 2012 panchayat polls witnessed an extremely low voter turnout. This time Malkangiri district administration has treaded cautiously. District Collector Vishal Singh said all arrangements to hold the election in Swabhiman Anchal have been made fool-proof. Nominations for six panchayats — Jantri, Andrapalli, Dhuliput, Ralegaon, Kurmanoor and Poploor — were accepted at different gram panchayats. Maoists’ presence has only been reported in Dhuliput and Ralegaon panchayats. This time, 332 candidates filed nominations and 315 remain in the fray after scrutiny. Sarpanch candidates of Andrapalli and Kurmanoor gram panchayats have got elected uncontested. Keeping the threat perception in mind, 35 booths in Chitrakonda block have been relocated. “There are 222 booths in Chitrakonda, of which 51 are temporary booths due to lack of adequate infrastructure. Election in Chitrakonda block will be held in the fifth phase with the police and the administration staff in full strength,” Mr. Singh added. In 2019 general elections, polling booth in Panasput was set up under the supervision of the India Reserve Battalion (IRB) and once voting got over, the polling staff was airlifted. Deputy Inspector General of Police (south-west) Rajesh Pandit said adequate security arrangements are being put in place to prevent any untoward incident during the election. The government has assigned 10% extra polling staff to deal with any emergency while 30 security personnel will be on standby for every gram panchayat. After Dantewada, Bijapur, Bastar and Narayanpur region in Chhattisgarh, the Swabhiman Anchal is said to be India’s second worst region affected by the LWEs. The Border Security Force, Special Operation Group, IRB, District Voluntary Force and regular police personnel are now deployed in large numbers in the Swabhiman Anchal, situated at the tri-junction of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The region was cut-off from Odisha’s mainland by Balimela Dam Project in 1970s, leaving 151 villages surrounded by 62 km-long reservoir’s water channel on one side and difficult mountainous terrain on the other. The remoteness of the area helped the LWEs find a footing and by early 2000, they converted the area into a liberated zone for the CPI(Maoist) constructing memorials and buildings. The turning point came in 2018 when a bridge was constructed over the Gurupriya river . One of the most heavily protected bridges in the country, government agencies stepped into the remote areas with development projects. As per statistics, 81 violent incidents were reported from the Swabhiman Anchal since 2000. The LWEs killed 35 civilians branding them as police informers while 46 security personnel lost their lives and 29 Maoists were killed. In past two decades, 26 Maoists have surrendered expressing readiness to return to the mainstream.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/voters-in-swabhiman-anchal-no-longer-fear-election/article64991370.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 05:26 IST,||Crime, communal card strike discordant notes in musical Kairana||Renowned as the birthplace of Abdul Karim Khan, one of the foremost proponents of the Kirana gharana, Kairana in western Uttar Pradesh is making music of a different kind in the run-up to the Assembly elections. With Prabha Atre, the senior-most practitioner of the gharana being conferred the Padma Vibhushan, the town’s musical heritage is once again jostling with its present-day political notoriety. “Our election is being fought in courts,” said Mohd. Salahuddin, elder brother of Aleem, one of the 24 people who died in clashes with the Uttar Pradesh police during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in December 2019. “Yogiji [Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath] keeps raising the issue of Muzaffarnagar riots but who will compensate for the lives lost in the CAA protests during his tenure,” he asked. Slow probe In any riot, he said, people of two communities kill each other but here it is the State that opened fire and the responsibility has not yet been fixed. “Had it happened with non-Muslims, a proper investigation would have been conducted and an FIR lodged against guilty police officers,” said Salahuddin, resident of Lisadi Gate area of Meerut. “We have evidence and witnesses but the case is moving at a slow pace. The NHRC team has recorded our statements, has questioned the official version but its report is still pending,” he said. Mr. Salahuddin, who is differently abled, said he could understand the electoral compulsions of Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, but he could at least question the police action at his rallies and ask why did the police fire at the chest and heads of people, even if they were rioters. After Union Home Minister Amit Shah kicked off the BJP’s poll campaign from Kairana last Saturday, political observers said it was becoming clear that the BJP was trying to return to power in Uttar Pradesh by linking crime in the region to one community while fostering the fear of Muslim appeasement if the SP returned to power. On the same day, in Aligarh and Bulandshahr – where the SP-Rashtriya Lok Dal combine has put up Muslim candidates – Yogi Adityanath said the BJP had prevented Kairana from turning into another Kashmir. In Ghaziabad, he said, while the previous government built a Haj House, his government built Mansarovar Bhavan for pilgrims. While the BJP leaders describe these references as an assertion of an improved law and order situation and a moving away from the politics of appeasement during the BJP rule, observers put this as an attempt to further alienate Muslims from electoral politics. If Nahid Hasan, the SP candidate from Kairana, has been booked under several sections and the Gangsters Act, BJP candidate Mriganka Singh is facing a case under sections 406, and 506 of IPC. Communal colour  Rakesh Sharma, senior journalist with a vernacular newspaper, said Mr. Shah’s exodus pitch was not meant just for the constituency but for western U.P. “It should be seen in alignment with the clampdown on the stolen cars market in Meerut’s Sotiganj area. In Kairana, it was the issue of rangdari (extortion) that affected both Hindus and Muslims. Businessmen were killed in broad daylight and criminals found patronage of the leadership of one particular party,” said Mr. Sharma, explaining how a law and order issue got a communal tinge.  However, a senior police officer who has served in the region, said the crackdown on Sotiganj’s infamous Haji Galla and family was a routine exercise and happened whenever a strict police officer took charge. “We were surprised when it found mention in the PM’s speech twice,” he added. Observers said for nearly three decades, Meerut has been a BJP bastion and mention of law and order could only backfire. Old-timers pointed out that Munawwar Hasan, father of the incumbent Nahid Hasan, and Hukum Singh, father of BJP candidate Mriganka Singh, shared a healthy rivalry. “Both hail from the Gurjar community and khap and have affiliations across the religious divide. It all boils down to the control of resources. From sand and land to forest, all kinds of mafia operate in the region. After Hukum Singh’s death, Nahid had a grip on the businesses. The administration is after him and the BJP is giving it a communal colour,” said Sokhendra Chaudhary, a farmer leader supporting the SP-RLD. Interestingly, both Mr. Hasan and his sister Iqra studied abroad but have seamlessly blended with the local populace. The BJP, said observers, deliberately picked the SP as its principal opponent with the hope that Mr. Yadav would speak on Muslim issues in the elections. When the SP chose to break into the OBC caste calculus and kept Muslim faces away, the BJP got slightly rattled, they said. Recently, the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, an RSS affiliate, reached out to the community and criticised the hate speech made at the Haridwar’s Dharam Sansad. Apna Dal (Sonewal), BJP’s alliance partner, has put up a Muslim candidate in Suar constituency of Rampur. Data with the Delhi-based Centre for The Study of Developing Studies suggest that 8-10% of Muslims voted for the BJP in the last two Lok Sabha elections. Jamal Siddiqui, president of the BJP minority cell, said they aim to up this figure to 25%. By giving a “riot and goonda free” administration, Mr. Adityanath has emerged as a ‘messiah’ for Muslims in the State. “Saffron is also the colour of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti,” he said, adding that the Opposition was deliberately misinterpreting statements and actions. On the CM’s 80 vs 20 statement, he said, “Mr. Yogi only meant that 80% of the electorate is with the BJP. The 20% are the mafia and the power-seekers.” The Centre and State governments have not discriminated against the Muslims, said Mr. Siddiqui, praising Mr. Adityanath for introducing modern education in madrasas. ‘Electoral strategy’ Mr. Siddiqui said Kairana was chosen because it was “a weak constituency”. “Instead of seeing it from a communal angle, look at it as part of electoral strategy,” he said. Mirza Asmer Beg, professor of Political Science at Aligarh Muslim University, said the cosmetic overtures were not meant for Muslims but those in the majority community who were not ready to buy the party’s polarising pitch. “I don’t think the numbers indicate an ideological affinity towards the BJP. It is just that certain candidates command acceptance across social groups,” he said.  The reality, he said, was there was no difference left between the so-called fringe and the top BJP leadership. “The CM started with the abba jaan jibe, moved to 80 vs 20 remark and is now suggesting that the electorate sift the ballot paper on religious grounds.”   The electoral distancing is also reflecting in social behaviour. Mohd. Khalid, an insurance agent in Ghaziabad, said in the last couple of months, he was told apne bhaiyon se policy karwayenge (We will get the policy done by our brothers). “This was not the case earlier as I have hundreds of non-Muslim clients,” he said.  Bhagwan Swaroop, an electrician from Lodha block in Aligarh working in the NCR, said, Muslims could live comfortably in a Hindu locality, but Muslims don’t allow Hindu families to live peacefully in Muslim-majority areas when non-BJP governments rule the State.  Mr. Swaroop said the first thing that he did after reaching home was to turn on the news channels. “I get a sense that the BJP is the only party that is working for desh hit (national interest).”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/crime-communal-card-strike-discordant-note-in-musical-kairana/article64991371.ece

A single judge Bench of Justice Vibha Kankanwadi made the observation recently while hearing a bail application filed by godman Shankeshwar Dhakne and his disciple Sopan Dhanke, arrested for the alleged rape of a minor girl. The two accused lived in a temple at Badnapur in Jalna district along with the girl and her father. The girl in August 2021 filed an FIR against the duo for allegedly raping her, following which they were arrested.  Justice Kankanwadi, in her order, took note of the prosecution’s case that in 2018, a document styled as danpatra on a stamp paper of Rs. 100 was executed between the girl’s father and Dhakne.   “It is stated that the father of the girl has given his daughter on donation ( daan ) to the baba and it is stated that the said kanyadan has been made in the presence of god. When the girl as per her own statement is minor, then why the father, who is in all respect guardian, to the girl, give the girl as daan ?” the court said in its order.  “A girl is not a property, which can be given in donation,” Justice Kankanwadi said, adding this was a disturbing fact. The court noted it was concerned about the future of the minor girl and “cannot shut its eyes”. The court granted bail to the duo on a bond of Rs. 25,000 each and posted the matter for hearing on February 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/girl-not-a-property-to-be-donated/article38342638.ece

Tripathi was a restaurant manager who was forced to become a delivery executive after he lost his job to the pandemic. Like him, Hussain Ali, who worked in a private company manufacturing orthopaedic equipment in Haryana, lost his job when the lockdown was imposed in 2020. There was a sudden sense of insecurity and unimaginable worry about the future, said the 46-year-old. What to do next, how to earn a living, became his daily diet of unanswered questions.  A relative suggested he buy a pushcart and sell dairy products. Mr. Ali did not think twice because feeding his children was his topmost priority. In these last few months, he has managed to make ends meet by selling cheese, peas, soya chaap and khoya .  Scores of middle class people like Mr. Ali and Tripathi lost their jobs due to the pandemic and were pushed towards poverty. It forced many to adjust to lower living standards. Mr. Ali used to earn Rs. 20,000 a month to feed his family, which included his wife and five sons aged between 5 and 18 years. “When the lockdown was announced, we stopped going to work. Three months later, I received a call from the office asking me to look for a new job. I had worked at this place for eight years and I did not see this coming,” he said.  He tried looking for jobs but could did not find a suitable one due to the pandemic. “I had worked in a firm in Seelampur for 18 years before I joined the company in Haryana. When I returned to Seelampur for a job, the money offered was half the salary I was earning,” Mr. Ali said, adding that “it was then I took my relative’s advice as he was also selling dairy products”.  ‘Can’t pay school fee’ Three of Mr. Ali’s sons – studying in classes XII, VII and V – used to attend a private school but he had to take two of them out and admit them to a government school. He said the private school fee was beyond his reach. His son studying in Class V got selected under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and continues to attend the private school. His eldest son,18, is pursuing chartered accountancy. The sole breadwinner of the family, Mr. Ali leaves his home in north-east Delhi’s Bhagirathi Vihar at 8 a.m. every day, pushing his cart across Ganga Vihar, Yamuna Vihar, Noor-e-Ilahi, Subhash Mohalla and Ghonda before returning home in the evening. “I have lost 10 kg in these few months,” he said. Rampal Rawat, 48, is living through a similar experience. A resident of Dwarka and a native of Uttarakhand’s Pauri, Mr. Rawat was working at Delhi Golf Club till he received a message on his phone on May 23, 2020, that his full and final payment was ready and his services were no longer required. Over 60 employees of the food and beverages department were laid off during the pandemic. “I was a permanent employee of the club for 29 years and this is the treatment meted out to me. I was shocked when I received the message because we were not informed that something like this was going to happen. No notice was given,” he said, adding that talks with the management were ongoing and the team had even offered to continue at half the salary. The club has been closed since the lockdown was announced and employees have not been going since. Mr. Rawat, who used to earn over Rs. 60,000 a month, wasn’t able to get a job and has now set up a small restaurant in Pauri on rent. He said he used up all his savings in the last 19 months when he was without a job. “My daughter is in Class XI and my son has just completed higher secondary. He wanted to make a career in cricket and was earlier training for it. When I lost my job, he quit everything and is now pursuing graduation from Delhi University. The future of my kids is now looking dark,” he rued. According to a study by Pew Research Centre, the middle class in India has shrunk by 32 million (earning between Rs. 750 to Rs. 1,400 a day) and the number of poor (earning Rs. 150 or less a day) has increased by 75 million.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hit-by-pandemic-broken-by-poverty/article64991454.ece

The study conducted by the Delhi government also revealed, through the genome sequencing of the samples, that 14 of those 20 people were carrying the BA.2 virus, a sub-variant of Omicron. The Delhi government is investigating the severity and recovery among those found positive with the BA.2 sub-variant, the source said. “Samples of over 200 people, who tested positive for COVID-19 before or after their death, were sent for genome sequencing. Of the 20 results out so far, all are found to be infected with the Omicron variant. Results of the rest of the samples are awaited,” the source said. Among those 20 people, there could be some who were suffering from other diseases. They could have succumbed to other ailments and not to COVID-19, the source added. “The government is also looking into how many of the total Omicron cases in Delhi are of BA.2 sub-lineage,” the source said. The BA.2 is more prevalent in India now as opposed to the BA.1 virus, according to the Central government. Dr. Jugal Kishore, Head of Community Medicine Department at Safdarjung Hospital, said the doctors had initially come across the BA.1 sub-variant of Omicron and BA.2 was considered a minor mutation of the same variant. He added that there was no need to worry. “BA.2 was detected in the U.K. also and it was found to be slightly more transmissible. But its severity is the same as that of BA.1. Such mutations are bound to happen,” Dr. Kishore said. He added that the Omicron variant found in the samples of the 20 deceased doesn’t make it any more dangerous. “Omicron is the dominating variant right now, so it is natural that it will reflect in the deaths too. Also, most of the deaths are due to comorbidities,” he added. Cases fall Meanwhile, the test positivity rate (TPR) of COVID-19 fell to 8.6% on Friday, down from 9.56% recorded a day earlier, according to a Delhi government bulletin. The number of new COVID-19 cases over last 24 hours decreased to 4,044 from 4,291 on Thursday. Twenty-five new deaths were reported, taking the toll to 25,769, as per the bulletin. Of the total 15,420 hospital beds for COVID-19, 87.5% were reported vacant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/analysis-of-20-deaths-shows-omicron-presence-in-all-cases/article64991455.ece

A draft policy on this proposal will be kept in public domain for comments, according to the Delhi government. The policy will come into effect only after the government issues a notification, which will take more time, officials said. The Hindu had reported earlier this month that a proposal for the same was approved by departments and was pending before Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai. “It is a very ambitious policy being brought forth by the (Arvind) Kejriwal government,” said Mr. Rai.  The Minister said the air quality in the north India region worsens during the winter months. With this policy in place, vehicle owners will have to carry their up-to-date PUC certificate with them to the filling station. Thus, pollution level of every single vehicle in the city will be kept in check, he said. “The policy will effectively help us ensure that polluting vehicles do not ply in Delhi and residents can enjoy cleaner air. The policy is being placed for public opinion and review before being notified,” Mr. Rai said. He said the government is also working on setting up technology-based methods to ensure that vehicle owners as well as filling stations do not face any inconvenience and there are no long queues at the fuel stations because of checking of PUC certificates. “While the exact mechanism is being worked out, these methods can also include technologies similar to RFID,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/soon-no-fuel-at-stations-without-puc-certificate/article64991465.ece

A senior police officer said a total of 11 persons, including two juveniles, have been held so far. “Eleven persons were named in the FIR, out of whom nine (including seven women) were held on Thursday. Two others, a man and a woman, have been caught based on video footage of the incident,” the officer said, adding that more arrests are likely. The victim, the police said, is currently in a women’s shelter and will be asked of her choice of stay in a day or two. The woman, who is married and has a two-year-old son, was abducted, sexually assaulted, tonsured and paraded with blackened face and a garland of shoes around her neck in a colony in Shahdara. Her attackers were all members of a family which blamed her for the death of their minor son. The police said the teenaged son of one of the accused was in a relationship with the woman. He killed himself in November last year following a quarrel between his family and the parents of the woman. Viral videos  On Wednesday, a crowd could be seen following the victim and her attackers in viral videos of the incident. However, most residents of the colony told The Hindu that they didn’t see anything. A neighbour, requesting anonymity, said everyone in the locality was scared of the accused family because of their aggressive behaviour. He alleged that they sell illicit liquor for a living.  The incident was condemned by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir and DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal who demanded strong action against the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/two-more-arrested-in-shahdara-case/article38342435.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 04:11 IST,||No MPhil programme at DU from next academic session||The MPhil course offered by Delhi University will be discontinued from the next academic year, university officials said on Friday. A notification issued by the university stated that the Executive Council of DU had passed a resolution to discontinue the programme run in various departments, in line with the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. The NEP states that higher education institutes will have the flexibility to offer different designs of Master’s programmes, including a two-year programme with the second year devoted to research, for those who have completed the three-year Bachelor’s programme. Students who have completed a four-year Bachelor’s programme with research, could pursue a one-year Master’s programme. It has suggested that the MPhil programme be discontinued as undertaking a PhD shall require either a Master’s degree or a 4-year Bachelor’s degree with research. Reacting strongly to the university’s decision to discontinue the MPhil course, teachers at DU described the move as “unfortunate”. The teachers said the course had provided students an opportunity to pursue a short-term research programme, which gave them exposure to research work and added to their CVs. “Social scientists believe that students with MPhil do better in their Ph.D. This degree is being discontinued not because of any organic need of the system but because of NEP 2020. This policy is all about widening the gap between the haves and have-nots. Either commit to doing a Ph.D or remain without a research degree,” said Abha Dev Habib, secretary, Democratic Teachers’ Front and former member, Executive Council, DU. She added that the NEP, which is being promoted for the “choice” it gives to the students, is actually taking away students’ choices. “Students from disadvantaged backgrounds, especially women, looked up to M. Phil as a research degree they could afford before going towards teaching jobs,” Ms. Habib, who teaches at Miranda House, said. “It is extremely unfortunate that the NEP 2020 has discontinued it,” said Mithuraaj Dhusiya, Member, Academic Council, DU  Social scientists believe students with MPhil do better in their PhD.

The civic body also passed a resolution to provide bicycles to 5% of the grade-IV students of SDMC-run primary schools. The SDMC looks to cover 3,000 students under the scheme, for which the estimated cost stands at Rs. 90,00,000. The Bharat Darshan park, which houses replicas of 21 monuments, which were made using 350 metric tonnes of waste material, will get an additional 17 replicas of monuments in 14 States and UTs – including the likes of the Sheesh Mahal of Punjab and the Nishat Bagh of Kashmir. Besides this, the SDMC’s Standing Committee Chairman, B.K. Oberoi, said, a dinosaur park for children will also be constructed in its Waste to Wonder Park. He added that the civic body’s decision to provide bicycles to grade-IV students at its primary schools was aimed at “motivating the kids to come to school regularly”.

During the visit, Mr. Putin will discuss the ongoing crisis with Ukraine with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Kremlin said the two leaders will spend a “lot of time” discussing the security situation in Europe. “I think this time, of course, a lot of time will be spent on an exchange of views on international issues, including strategic stability in Europe, security guarantees for Russia, security in Europe and Russia’s dialogue with the United States and NATO, and regional problems,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Reuters. China, which has close relations with Russia but has been largely silent on the crisis in Ukraine amid a build-up of Russian forces along its borders, on Thursday called on the U.S. to address Russia’s “legitimate concerns” over NATO’s security presence, in what was its strongest statement of support for Russia so far. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday said it was “firmly opposed” to actions that increase tensions, when asked about the U.S. providing $200 million in military assistance to Ukraine. “Creating tensions does no good to easing the Ukrainian crisis, but only adds more uncertainties to the region and the whole world. China is firmly opposed to this,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. “Under the current circumstances, we call on all relevant parties to ease the tension as much as possible, avoid escalation of the situation, stop stirring up troubles and inciting opposition and confrontation.” Two dozen leaders The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday confirmed that Mr. Putin will be among more than two dozen world leaders attending the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing on February 4. While the U.S., the U.K., Canada and Australia have announced a “diplomatic boycott” of the games — their athletes will, however, be participating — Beijing has invited a host of other countries to the opening. Among the leaders attending are Mr. Putin, President Halimah Yacob of Singapore, President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi of Egypt, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, President Alberto Fernandez of Argentina and Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan. Presidents of five Central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — will also attend. The five leaders had been scheduled to attend the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi this week but the visit did not take place, citing the pandemic. Asked if India, which has been invited to the opening ceremony, would have diplomatic presence there, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India had “one Indian athlete who has qualified for the Winter Olympics”. “As regards who else will be present,” he said, “I don’t have any information on that.”  Cooperation with Pak. The Pakistan Prime Minister is expected to discuss investments from China and speeding up the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) plan, officials in Islamabad said earlier this month. China on Friday said it would boost cooperation with Pakistan in launching satellites and developing its space programme. A new white paper on China’s space activities said Beijing will “give priority to developing communications satellites for Pakistan and to cooperating on the construction of the Pakistan Space Centre”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/putin-to-attend-winter-olympics-meet-xi/article64991512.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:47 IST,||Economic crisis tightens grip on Sri Lanka’s hinterland||As Sri Lanka’s economic crisis makes global headlines, estate worker B. Sundararajan is watching it manifest in his teacup. In recent weeks, he has cut his usual, two cups of tea a day to one. “Milk powder is not easily available. When it is available it is not affordable. There is no other option but to cut down our tea,” said the resident of Doloswala village in Sri Lanka’s southern Ratnapura district. Besides the irony of a tea plantation worker, producing the famed ‘Ceylon tea’, rationing his own tea intake, Mr. Sundararajan’s reality lays bare the severity of Sri Lanka’s economic meltdown. Rising inflation The country’s fast-depleting foreign reserves — $3.1 billion at the end of 2021 — have pushed the Rajapaksa administration into a corner. The government needs dollars to import basic food items, fuel, and medicines, which have frequently been in shortage in recent months. As has milk powder, which Sri Lanka mostly imports and widely consumes in place of fresh milk. Consumers are struggling to afford essentials such as rice, pulses, vegetables, fish, and meat whose prices are soaring, amid import restrictions imposed to save foreign exchange. Consumer price inflation hit 14% last week. Finding LPG cylinders, in short supply, remains a challenge. And if the consumer is a daily-wage worker like Mr. Sundararajan, where his hard-won LKR 1,000 (Rs. 366) wage is tied to tedious production targets, forgoing a cup of tea or even a meal, is the only option.  The story of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis came to the fore amid the pandemic, which dealt a severe blow to the country’s crucial, foreign exchange earning sectors. Colombo has foreign debt obligations totalling nearly $7 billion this year, and Sri Lanka is “trying all options’” to avoid a default, Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa recently told the Financial Times .  India and China have extended emergency assistance by way of loans and currency swaps, but Sri Lanka is still on the edge. The national polity, policy makers and think tanks are debating if the country should opt for an IMF bailout. Some analysts are even arguing that Sri Lanka must prepare to default, and subsequently restructure its debt, although the government is determined to keep the country’s unblemished record in foreign debt servicing. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s plantation workers, like the nearly 900 employed in tea and rubber estates in Doloswala village, did not have to wait until the pandemic to know deprivation. “Over the last few years, the 1,000 rupee-wage struggle of our workers was in focus. They won the wage, but there are 1,000 other problems facing the community for decades,” said Anthony Masilamani, who works at the local administrative authority. “Our people are still living in crammed line room housing, no matter how big their families are. Our schools don’t have mathematics and science teachers for higher classes. We don’t have enough toilets. This is our reality,” he said, pointing out that the country’s recent economic downturn aggravated the workers’ misery, and didn’t create it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/economic-crisis-tightens-grip-on-sri-lankas-hinterland/article64991513.ece

Mr. Putin and Mr. Macron spoke by phone amid deep fears that a Russian troop build-up on the Ukrainian border is a precursor to a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. Russia denies any plans to invade but has demanded security guarantees from the West. The Kremlin said in a statement that both the leaders held a “long telephone conversation” and that Mr. Putin expressed his dissatisfaction with a U.S. response to Moscow’s demands that was delivered earlier this week. “The U.S. and NATO responses did not take into account Russia’s fundamental concerns, including preventing NATO’s expansion and refusing to deploy strike weapons systems near Russia’s borders,” Mr. Putin told Mr. Macron. “The key question was also ignored,” Mr. Putin said, pointing to the “principle of the indivisibility of security” in international affairs, that no country should strengthen its security at the expense of others. Mr. Putin said Russia would “carefully study” the responses “after which it will decide on further actions”. ‘Positive signal’ The Elysee on Wednesday hailed as a “positive signal” talks in Paris between Russia and Ukraine — as well as France and Germany — which produced the first joint written statement on the conflict in eastern Ukraine signed up to by Moscow and Kiev since 2019. They agreed to preserve a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine — where pro-Moscow separatists declared breakaway regions — and to hold new talks in Berlin in February.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/west-is-ignoring-russias-security-concerns-putin/article64991511.ece

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:32 IST,||A fading red zone in Telangana||It was 6 a.m. on December 26, 2021. With dense fog all around, Telangana’s Greyhounds, billed as one of the best commando forces in Southeast Asia, had to watch every step of their boot-strapped feet in the dense forests of Chhattisgarh, known to be filled with booby traps. Darkness was diminishing and the sun's rays were beginning to pierce through the canopy of trees. The commandos could see shadows but the fog obscured their view. Assisted by their counterparts in Chhattisgarh, they were on the lookout for members of the outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) on the borders of Sukma and Bijapur. The armed commandos continued moving until they spotted a Maoist patrolling team of five to six members a kilometre away. Apparently, the Maoists were standing guard for important comrades and leaders who were some distance away. An eerie silence followed. In hushed tones, the commandos discussed whether they should lunge at the enemy in a sudden move or reach closer and pull the trigger. Choosing the second option, they silently inched their way towards the Maoists. They had barely moved when one of the Maoist sentries spotted them. He frantically took out his weapon and pulled the trigger, alerting his associates. Realising that their opponents had identified them, the commandos started returning fire. For the next few minutes, the forest reverberated with the sound of gun shots. Some bullets ricocheted off the trees. The commandos, who often run half-marathons as part of training, chased the Maoists, spraying bullets with their AK-47s and 9 mm carbine guns. Taken aback at this unexpected attack at daybreak, the Maoists ran for cover behind the trees as bullets buzzed past them. They shouted and sent signals to their comrades so that they would not get caught in the crossfire. The exchange of fire continued for some time and then the forest fell silent. After making sure that their opponents had fled the area, the commandos combed the area. They found the bodies of six Maoists. Four of them were women. This was the account that the Greyhounds gave of that morning. A big victory The exchange of fire (EoF) towards the end of the year turned out to be a big victory for the Telangana Police. The ‘neutralisation of the Maoists’ may have occurred on Chhattisgarh soil, but it re-enforced the upper hand of the Telangana police in their ongoing battle with the Maoists. The next day, the Maoists issued a statement describing the incident as a “fake encounter”. “Police got frustrated as they could not locate us during their searches in the forest. They picked up six locals, shot them down and cooked up the story of [an] encounter,” the statement said. Five days before this EoF, the Maoists had summoned K. Ramesh, a former sarpanch of K. Kondapuram village in Mulugu district, to the forest of adjacent Bijapur in Chhattisgarh. The village leader went there with an acquaintance only to be detained that night. The Maoists let off the acquaintance but a day later, Ramesh was found shot dead in the forest with a letter from the Maoists stating that he had lost his life for acting as a “police informer”. Police sources said that it was this murder that compelled them to launch searches in the border areas of the two States. Villagers said the toll would have been much higher if the sentry had not opened fire. “A training camp with militants and villagers was being held there. They were about to leave the place when the firing started,” a villager said to journalists. An intelligence official said there could have been more losses but the “forces did their best”. The spot where the EoF took place was barely 20 km from the Telangana border. This was the fourth breakthrough, a big one, for the police in 2021. The Maoists described the EoF as a “typical concocted story and a clear fake encounter” but the joint combing operations of the commando forces of the two States did not stop. A spree of killings Combined squads of the police commandos of the two States received yet another shot in the arm three weeks later, on January 18, 2022, when they neutralised three more Maoists in the Karreguttalu forest on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border. A woman was among the slain Maoists. Ten rocket launchers, a self-loading rifle and an INSAS rifle were recovered from the site of the EoF. “This second EoF within a month has dealt a serious blow to the proscribed organisation. The fact that a Greyhounds commando sustained bullet wounds in the EoF shatters the ultras’ claim that the EoF was a fake encounter. The commando was airlifted to a hospital in Hyderabad where he is being treated,” a senior officer said. The officer, who was unwilling to be named, described the killing of an ex-Sarpanch in Mulugu district by the Maoists as a strategic mistake. Maoist squads holding sway in Chhattisgarh executed the village leader, branding him a police informer, apparently in a bid to convey that they had not lost ground. Nearly seven months earlier, on June 16, 2021, the Telangana Police had given ‘key inputs’ to their counterparts in Andhra Pradesh to help the latter ‘neutralise’ six Maoists in the Theegalametta forest area under Mampa police station limits in Visakhapatnam Agency. That was a serious blow to the operations of Maoists in the Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC). Three of the slain ultras were women. Of the remaining three, one was incidentally from a village in the Peddapalli district of Telangana. Two months later, commandos ‘neutralised’ another Maoist, Madvi Ungal alias Chotu, in an EoF at the Bodanalli forest area of Charla mandal in Bhadradri Kothagudem district. With the death of Ungal, said to be the sibling of a top Maoist leader, Madvi Hidma, the police emerged triumphant yet again in the battle against the Maoists. If a tip-off helped the police gun down six Maoists in Visakhapatnam Agency, a joint operation of the Telangana Police with their Chhattisgarh counterparts proved equally successful on October 25. This time, victory was recorded on Chhattisgarh soil in the Karreguttalu forest area of Bijapur. Three Maoists, all from Chhatisgarh, were killed. Gaining an upper hand The spree of EoFs have led the Telangana Police to claim an irrefutable advantage in the war against ultras not only in their jurisdiction but also in Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  This is in stark contrast to what the people, the police and politicians had witnessed during the peak of Maoist activities in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The Maoists were fondly called ‘ annalu ’ (elder brothers) by some. The most dominant group of them was the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) People’s War. Hundreds of police personnel lost their lives during this period to Maoist attacks, including three IPS officers. K.S. Vyas, instrumental in the formation of the Greyhounds, was assassinated in 1993 in a surprise attack in Lal Bahadur Stadium in Hyderabad. The same year, Mahbubnagar Superintendent of Police G. Paradesi Naidu was killed along with nine other policemen in a landmine blast. Six years later, IPS officer Ch. Umesh Chandra, who was unarmed, was gunned down by Maoists at S.R. Nagar in the State capital while he was heading to office.  After these challenging times, the concerted efforts of Intelligence officials and the Greyhounds reduced the threat posed by the Maoists. By 2010, the Maoists began suffering more losses, while deaths of police forces dipped considerably. In fact, when the agitation for a separate Telangana State peaked after 2010, those opposing statehood argued that the Maoists could take over Telangana. They cited the assassination of the then Home Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, A. Madhava Reddy, in a blast near Ghatkesar, less than 30 km from the Secretariat in Hyderabad on March 7, as an example of what would happen in the event of the creation of a separate State. Some even went to the extent of contending that the creation of a separate Telangana would mean offering the region to the Maoists on a silver platter. All such contentions fell flat with the police establishing control over the Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) movement after Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh on June 2, 2014. In undivided Andhra Pradesh, at least eight districts out of 10 were directly or indirectly affected by the ultras. In the remaining two, Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy, there were reports of movements of couriers and Maoist sympathisers. These 10 districts were eventually re-organised into 33 districts in Telangana. Since the inception of Telangana, law-enforcement agencies have clearly established their command over LWE activists in all the districts barring Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Mulugu and Bhadradri Kothagudem. While Bhupalpally has a border with Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, Bhadradri Kothagudem has a border with Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. Mulugu shares a border with the Bijapur and Sukma districts of Chhattisgarh, which is the present bastion of Maoists. “Soon the whole of Telangana will be free of Maoists and all LWE groups,” said Telangana Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy after the deaths of six Maoists on December 27. There is more than one reason for the State Police chief’s confidence. The Telangana Police never slowed down even after they gained the upper hand in the battle against the Maoists. In fact, they launched stronger offensives against the ultras soon after the administrative machinery settled down after initial hiccups of State formation. In the new State, the police had their first face-off with the Maoists on September 16, 2015, with Sruthi and Vidyasagar Reddy getting killed in an ‘encounter’ in the Tadvai forests of Warangal district. Revolutionary writer Varavara Rao and several civil rights activists then alleged that Sruthi had been subjected to torture and acid had been poured on her before she was killed. The deaths of Sruthi and Reddy impacted the Maoists, who supported the creation of a separate Telangana State and were planning to regain their foothold. While they were attempting to regain strength, Koora Rajanna, a former Maoist of the CPI-ML, Chandra Pulla Reddy and some others ganged up to create a new splinter group. They secured firearms and were waiting for an opportunity to prove their might when the police struck in Tekumalla forest of Bhadradri Kothagudem. Nine persons, reportedly including a Registered Medical Practitioner who is believed to have tipped off the police about the group’s movements, were killed in the EoF in December 2017. This ‘encounter’ sent the message that the Telangana Police were going all out to prevent all the attempts being made to revive the LWE movement. That they could be ruthless when tackling armed militants was established again in March 2018. Ten Maoists were killed when the Greyhounds carried out an operation jointly with the Chhattisgarh Police on the borders of the two States abutting the Bhadradri Kothagudem and Sukma districts. The Greyhounds too suffered a blow with one of their commandos losing his life in the fiercely fought gun battle. This and the death of a Home Guard in 2020 were the only losses suffered by the State forces in the war against LWE activists in the seven years and seven months since the creation of Telangana State. Socio-economic changes Besides the efforts of the police, socio-economic changes in rural Telangana are making it difficult for the Maoists to attract fresh blood. In the 1980s and 1990s, several families found it difficult to make ends meet in some interior villages of the region. The advent of television, mobile phones and Internet have changed the lives of youngsters. It has become tough for the Maoists to recruit cadres. They mostly recruit members of tribal communities like the Koyas or Guthi Koyas now. An intelligence report says that of the total underground cadres of the CPI-Maoist Telangana State Committee, 50 are from Chhattisgarh and 11 from Andhra Pradesh. Only 30 are from Telangana. “Most people are getting land for cultivation... due to this people think there is no need of CPI-Maoist party for them…,” said the diary notes of Mailarapu Adellu, Maoist Adilabad District Committee Secretary, in 2020, who made desperate attempts to revive the party and recruit new cadres in the Adilabad and Kumuram Bheem Asifabad districts of northern Telangana. The Maoist leader, who is believed to have moved around without using a mobile phone to escape detection, narrowly escaped death in the hands of police forces in three to four EoFs in the two districts. During their combing operations, the police stumbled upon the diaries believed to have been penned by him. “Enemy (government) has increased... focus seriously. Wherever we go, people’s cooperation dwindled... though people have problems circumstances are not conducive to fight..,” he wrote. Poor health was a major issue that prompted many Maoists to surrender before the police. Three months ago, a Central Committee member, Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna, fondly called RK by his comrades, died of kidney ailment in south Bastar. His death is seen as a setback to the movement. The pandemic has also affected the movement. Telangana Maoist State Committee Secretary Haribhushan alias Yapa Narayana died of a COVID-19-induced heart attack in Chhattisgarh in June 2021. Gaddam Madhukar, Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee Secretary, was caught by the police when he got admitted in a hospital for COVID-19 treatment in Warangal. He died later at the Osmania General Hospital of Hyderabad. The Maoists alleged that the police killed him. The pandemic not only claimed lives but also became a stumbling block in efforts to revive the movement. Mailarapu Adellu also wrote in his diaries that the lockdown in 2020 inconvenienced people and impacted attempts to bring people back under the Maoist fold. For the Telangana Police, Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Mulugu and Bhadradri Kothagudem are crucial areas as the Maoists can enter through these regions from other States. Maoist presence in Maharashtra is not strong but it cannot be ignored. Despite multiple attempts by central paramilitary forces and local police commandos to wipe out the movement, the Maoists are operating their own government (janathan sarkar) in southern Chhattisgarh, which abuts the Mulugu and Bhadradri Kothagudem districts of Telangana. Maoist squads enter Telangana from Chhattisgarh through different villages of these two districts. They also sometimes go north, travel via the forests of Maharashtra and enter through the Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad and Mancherial districts. “They cross the Godavari river using rafts or mostly ferries but don’t travel during rainy season or when the river is in spate,” a police officer said. Posting policemen at likely entry points such as these is impractical. It is also illogical from a security point of view. So, State forces have developed a network of informants who keep track of the movements of strangers. When an input is received about ‘non-locals’, the police cross-check the information and send commandos for combing operations if Maoist movements are confirmed. In the past seven years, the police have succeeded in stalling, driving away or neutralising Maoists whenever they launched such operations. A close watch Back in the capital and in other parts of the State, there is strong surveillance of those who are even remotely attempting to connect to the Maoist movement. Social and women rights activist Sandhya of the Progressive Organisation of Women was at her home in Hyderabad when a posse of policemen knocked on the door at night on November 12, 2021. They took the activist and her husband to the local police station. The main charge against them was an alleged attempt to publish a compilation of stories related to the dead Maoist leader RK. Eventually, the police issued notices to them under Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code in a case registered under the Telangana Public Security Act. The case indicates how the Telangana Police are keeping an eye on every Maoist-related development, be it deep inside the forests on the banks of Godavari river or the publication of a book in the heart of the capital. The top brass of the police is reworking its strategies every day and analysing intelligence inputs and inputs from informants. With these persistent efforts, the question on everyone's mind is this: Will Telangana soon become a Maoist-free State?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-fading-red-zone-in-telangana/article64991538.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:31 IST,||To the poll booth, with no donor knowledge||Late last year, the Union government authorised the State Bank of India to issue and encash a new tranche of electoral bonds, the 19th such parcel since the scheme’s notification in 2018. The timing of the announcement was predictable, with elections slated to be held to five different State Assemblies beginning next month. Now, as a result, voters in those States will go to the ballot box with no knowledge about the donors backing the various contestants. Anything but transparent Ensuring citizens have access to information, especially material on political funding, one would think, is an essential feature of a democracy. But ever since its introduction, the electoral bond scheme has envenomed the democratic process, by destroying altogether any notion of transparency in political funding. In this time, the Supreme Court of India has paid scant attention to the issue. It has allowed the scheme to continue unabated and has denied an interim stay on its operation without so much as conducting a full-fledged hearing. In one such provisional order, the Court asserted that the bonds were not, in fact, anonymous. Voters interested in finding out the identity of political donors, the Bench said, could simply perform what the order described as “match the following.” According to the Court, since both the purchase and the encashment of bonds are made through banking channels, all it would take for a person to glean the identity of a donor was for her to look through every corporation’s financial statement — these records, the Court said, ought to be available with the Registrar of Companies. Parties have no obligation Even assuming for a moment that voters have the resources to go through annual returns filed by every corporation in India, what the order ignored was that there is no attendant obligation on political parties to provide details to the public on each donation received by them through electoral bonds. Companies are also under no obligation to disclose the name of the party to whom they made the donation. Therefore, this “match the following” exercise apart, from being impossible to perform, will also do nothing to pierce the veil concealing the bonds. This is because anonymity is written into the programme’s ideals; it represents the basic leitmotif of the system. When he explained the contours of the electoral bond scheme to the Lok Sabha, the then Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley stressed on this very feature. “The donor will know, which party he is depositing money to,” he said. “The political party will file return with the Election Commission [of India]. Now, which donor gave to which political party, that is the only thing which will not be known.” This avowed objective runs athwart one of the most basic features of a democracy, that the right to freedom of expression, which the Constitution guarantees, includes within it a right to know. The electoral bond scheme is designed to allow an individual, or any “artificial juridical person”, including body corporates, to purchase bonds issued by the State Bank of India during notified periods of time. These instruments are issued in the form of promissory notes, and in denominations ranging from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1 crore. Once purchased, the buyer can donate the bond to any political party of their choice and the party can then encash it on demand. The purchasers are not obliged to disclose to whom they presented the bond, and a political party encashing a bond is compelled to keep the donor’s identity secret. Untenable arguments  What is more, a series of restrictions that were in place before the scheme’s introduction have now been done away with. For example, amendments have been made removing a previous prohibition that disallowed a company from donating anything more than 7.5% of its net profits over the course of the preceding three years. Similarly, a mandate that a company had to have been in existence for at least three years before it could make donations (a requirement that was aimed at discouraging persons from using shell corporations to funnel money into politics) was also lifted.  Thus, through its very architecture, the electoral bond scheme permits unlimited and anonymous corporate funding of political parties. In its defence, the Government says two things: one, that voters have no fundamental right to know how political parties are funded and two, that the scheme helps eliminate the role of black money in funding elections. On any reasonable examination, it ought to be clear that neither of these arguments is tenable. First, the Supreme Court has consistently held that voters have a right to freely express themselves during an election and that they are entitled to all pieces of information that give purpose and vigour to this right. Surely, to participate in the electoral process in a meaningful manner and to choose one’s votes carefully, a citizen must know the identity of those backing the candidates. Second, as affidavits filed by the Election Commission of India in the Supreme Court have demonstrated, the scheme, if anything, augments the potential role of black money in elections — it does so by, among other things, removing existing barriers against shell entities and dying concerns from donating to political parties. Moreover, even if the bonds were meant to eliminate the presence of unaccounted currency, it is difficult to see what nexus the decision to provide complete anonymity of the donor bears to this objective. Indeed, it is for this reason that the Reserve Bank of India reportedly advised the Government against the scheme’s introduction. For the higher judiciary The worries over the electoral bond scheme, however, go beyond its patent unconstitutionality. This is because in allowing anonymity it befouls the basis of our democracy and prevents our elections from being truly free and fair. There are, therefore, few issues of greater moral urgency than this that are awaiting the Supreme Court’s consideration. Yet, despite challenges to the scheme having been launched quickly on the heels of its notification in 2018, the Court has failed to hear and decide on the programme’s validity.  A delay in adjudication, as we have seen in a plethora of cases that are pending consideration, invariably presents a fait accompli . In this case, the damage from the pendency is all the starker, because the integrity of the electoral process is at stake. Judges of yore warned as far back as in 1957 of the threats posed by limitless corporate funding of elections. Chief Justice M.C. Chagla of the Bombay High Court predicted that any decision to allow companies to fund political parties might “ultimately overwhelm and even throttle democracy in this country”.  Justice P.B. Mukharji of the Calcutta High Court used language that was stronger still. “To induce the Government of the day by contributing money to the political funds of political parties, is to adopt the most sinister principle fraught with grave dangers to commercial as well as public standards of administration,” he wrote. “…The individual citizens although in name equal will be gravely handicapped in their voice because the length of their contribution cannot ever hope to equal the length of the contribution of the big companies.” Today, those dangers are heightened by individual voters not only being in a position where they are unable to match contributions made by corporations but also find themselves in a position where they have no knowledge over the identity of the donors bankrolling the political establishment. Can there be a greater threat to our democracy?

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:32 IST,||Graft talk and the top court’s inexplicable silence||December 10, 2021, was a dark day in the history of the Indian judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court of India’s. In a televised interview, where the pointed question was on whether there is corruption in the Supreme Court of India, the former Chief Justice of India, Justice Ranjan Gogoi, said: “Corruption is as old as society. Corruption has become an acceptable way of life and judges don’t fall from heaven.” It weakens confidence  Justice Gogoi’s attack was against the entire Supreme Court and scandalised the entire institution of the Supreme Court, which demands immediate redress. Wilmot, C.J. in R. vs Almon , had as early as 1765 observed: “…and whenever men’s allegiance to the law is so fundamentally shaken, it is the most fatal and most dangerous obstruction of justice and, in my opinion, calls out for a more rapid and immediate redress than any other obstruction whatsoever; not for the sake of the Judges, as private individuals, but because they are the channels by which King’s Justice is conveyed to the people.”   The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Brahma Prakash Sharma vs State of U.P. (1953) said: “It would be only repeating what has been said so often by various Judges that the object of contempt proceedings is not to afford protection to Judges, personally from imputations to which they may be exposed as individuals; it is intended to be a protection to the public whose interests would be very much affected if by the act or conduct of any party, the authority of the court is lowered and the sense of confidence which people have in the administration of justice by it is weakened.”  The Supreme Court found advocate Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt of court, in 2020, “for shaking the confidence of the public in the institution as a whole” and for creating an “impression that ... Judges who have presided in the Supreme Court in the period of last six years have a particular role in the destruction of Indian democracy”. The Court found that the attending circumstance to be taken into consideration was about the “person who makes the statement”; it held that “it is not expected of a person who is a part of the system of administration of justice and who owes a duty to the said system, to make such tweets which are capable of shaking the confidence of general public,” the judgment read. A bench presided by the now former CJI, Justice Gogoi, had in fact initiated contempt proceedings against a former Supreme Court judge, Justice Markandey Katju for similar utterances (against judges in a blog), but these were dropped after his unconditional apology . So what happens when a scurrilous attack is made and the Court is scandalised by a former CJI? A top judge and his conduct Justice Gogoi’s conduct raises serious questions. During his tenure as CJI, as many as eight cases of a particular business group were assigned to the Benches presided by Justice Arun Mishra, former judge of the Supreme Court. These cases were all decided in favour of the said business house, giving it relief running into thousands of crores of rupees. Interestingly, in one such case, C.A. No. 11133/2011, the said business house has settled the matter with the Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited recently, according to reports, forgoing a claim of Rs. 11,000 crore but only after a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court decided to rectify the judgment in favour of the business house under an extraordinary curative power. Sadly, other States or authorities have not come forward with similar curative petitions for the Court to act. One gets the impression that States or authorities are happy to accept even decisions against them running into crores of rupees which are made in questionable circumstances. Thus, what they could not do directly they are allowing it to be done indirectly — by their silence. Interestingly, this case — C.A. No. 11133/2011 was taken up during the summer vacation in 2019. Another matter of the same business group ( C.A. No. 9023/2018), which was also not an urgent vacation matter, was listed on May 21, 2019 when the following order was made: “Heard the arguments of Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant. List tomorrow, i.e. Wednesday, the 22nd May, 2019 for further arguments.” On May 22, the matter was concluded and judgment reserved with the following order: “Heard Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the respondent. Arguments concluded. Judgment reserved.” Pertinently, on April 8, 2019, the Registrar Judicial of the Supreme Court had passed the order stating that “regular hearing matters will be taken up as per guidelines and norms approved by the Hon’ble The Chief Justice of India”, that was, CJI Gogoi. So, has he self-incriminated himself? On this issue, I had addressed a letter on August 16, 2019 to the then CJI, Justice Gogoi, and other judges of the Supreme Court pointing out the gross abuse of the judicial process, with this request: “I do hope and trust that you would look into the matter and take corrective steps as deemed appropriate to protect this institution.” Sadly, my letter though received was not even acknowledged. A Constitution Bench of Supreme Court, to which Justice Arun Mishra was a party has held in 2018 “that the Chief Justice is the Master of the Roster; he alone has prerogative to the constitute Benches of the Court and allocate cases to the Benches so constituted”, and that, “In view of the aforesaid, any order passed which is contrary to this order be treated as ineffective in law and not binding on the Chief Justice of India.” Why would the now former CJI, Justice Gogoi, allow matters of one business group to be heard by a Bench presided by a particular judge? Why would he not take any action after his attention was drawn to the irregularities? At his book launch on December 8, 2021, the now former CJI welcomed the industrialist concerned and his family as guests. It has happened only once in the history of the Supreme Court when a Bench presided by (now former) CJI Justice K.N. Singh had heard and decided matters pertaining to a particular business group giving it substantial relief. But then perhaps following the outcry from Members of the Bar and the then Attorney General, the (now former) CJI H.J. Kania acted swiftly and decisively to recall those orders and restore the image and the reputation of the Supreme Court, thereby sub serving the rule of law. The Court must act Crony capitalism is a curse on this nation. The Supreme Court itself has come down heavily on corruption in public life and has directed time and again that action be taken against bureaucrats and politicians found guilty of corruption. Corruption is indeed a bane as far as our democracy is concerned. The judiciary must be fiercely independent and free from any kind of influence. It is indeed so, generally and by and large. It has served the nation well. The former CJI, Justice Gogoi, has done great disservice to the institution that he purportedly served. So, one wonders why there is an absolute silence on the part of this great institution. Surely, actions are needed against the former CJI, Justice Gogoi, and his actions or inactions. The Court has itself held that in such a situation, it must act on its own without waiting for the Attorney General or any person to move the Court. If not done, citizens’ faith in the integrity of the institution will be seriously eroded — perhaps irreparably.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 00:00 IST,||At the Centre||As the joint statement at the end of the India-Central Asia virtual summit on Thursday noted, ties between India and the region have been historically close, with “civilisational, cultural, trade and people-to-people linkages”, but the lack of access to land routes, and the situation in Afghanistan are among the biggest challenges. Hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the Presidents of the five Central Asian Republics (CARs), it was a first, building on years of dialogue. The summit also came after the meeting of NSAs in Delhi, where they built on several common themes of concern and priority. To begin with, there is the problem of routing trade — a paltry $2 billion, spent mostly on Kazakhstan’s energy exports to India. In comparison, China’s CAR trade figures have exceeded $41 billion — they could double by 2030 — apart from the billions of dollars invested in the Belt and Road Initiative. With Pakistan denying India transit trade, New Delhi’s other option is to smoothen the route through Iran’s Chabahar port, but that will involve greater investment in rail and road routes to Iran’s northern boundaries with the CARs, something India is hesitant to do in the face of U.S. sanctions. A third option is to use the Russia-Iran International North-South Transport Corridor via Bandar Abbas port, but this is not fully operational and at least two CARs (Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan) are not members. India too, has dragged its feet over TAPI gas pipeline plans (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India), due to supply guarantees, given the tensions with Pakistan. Finally, there is Afghanistan: the tenuous link between Central Asia and South Asia, where after the Taliban takeover, there is no official government, a humanitarian crisis is building, and there are worries of terrorism and radicalism spilling over its boundaries. Each theme has been outlined in the summit joint statement as areas to work upon. They have also agreed to more structured engagement, including the setting up of joint working groups, on Afghanistan and Chabahar, and more educational and cultural opportunities. While the attempt by India to institutionalise exchanges and press the pedal on trade, investment and development partnerships with the CARs is timely, it is by no means the only country strengthening its ties here. While Russia is the most strategic player, China is now the biggest development and infrastructure partner to the countries. The CAR Presidents held a similar virtual summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier. Pakistan has also increased its outreach to the CARs, signing transit trade agreements, offering trade access to the Indian Ocean at Gwadar and Karachi. India will need to move nimbly to ensure it stays in step with the changes, and to make certain the future of ties more closely resembles the deep ties of the distant past.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/at-the-centre/article38341998.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 00:00 IST,||Valley and hills||The Bharatiya Janata Party is eyeing its second straight term in Manipur. In 2017, the party had finished second with 21 seats in the 60-strong Assembly, behind the 28 seats won by the Congress. Forming an alliance with the National People’s Party (NPP) and the Naga People’s Front (NPF) that had four MLAs each, one MLA each from the Trinamool Congress, the Lok Janshakti Party, an Independent and a Congress defector (who was Minister until his disqualification three years later), the party managed to cross the halfway mark. Defections continued, including from parties allied with the BJP. The BJP now has 30 MLAs while the Congress has 13 — but an MLA has now joined the Janata Dal (United), the BJP’s national ally. The party in power at the Centre manages to exercise undue influence in Manipur politics, and that trend could continue this time too. The BJP has no pre-poll alliance, while its principal rival, the Congress, has announced a tie-up with five smaller parties, including the Communist Party of India. Chief Minister Nongthombam Biren Singh was himself once a Congress leader. A challenge to his continuance from within the BJP, if it were to form the government, is a likely scenario. Thongam Biswajit Singh, PWD Minister and an influential party functionary, could well be in contention. In neighbouring Assam, the BJP had replaced its Chief Minister after winning a second term last year. In the broad geographical divide in the State, the Imphal Valley, where the Hindu, non-tribal Meitei community dominates, has an edge over the surrounding hills inhabited by the largely Christian Naga and Kuki-Zomi communities. The Valley has 40 seats and the hills, 20. The BJP and its ideological partner, the RSS, have tapped the Valley for decades now, but the party also has a foothold among Christians. In the event of a hung Assembly, the NPP and the NPF, both fighting alone in their respective strongholds, could emerge influential. The NPF’s role is limited to a part of the Naga-inhabited hills. The JD(U) is also in the fray again. The Congress hopes the defections would help it regenerate with fresh faces. The BJP wishes its focus on infrastructure, rural housing, water supply, electrification and other schemes would help it. The CM’s “go to hills” and “go to villages” programmes sought to bridge the psychological divide between the hills and the Valley. The demand for the repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act unites all sections of Manipur society. The demand for Scheduled Tribe status for the Meitei community, the enactment of the Manipur (Hill Areas) Autonomous District Councils Bill 2021 for providing more autonomy to the tribal councils, and the Hill Areas Committee comprising all the 20 MLAs of Manipur’s hills also will be talking points in the campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/valley-and-hills/article38342005.ece

Deshmukh Memorial Lecture Series organised by the Council for Social Development, Hyderabad. ‘Time will tell’ “Only time will tell whether or not India has got it right but so far, this approach has served us well and helped in charting a course into the future which is different from the world,” he asserted. “To summarise, the RBI’s measures have contributed significantly in engineering the turnaround in the Indian economy, supported by rising financial inclusion and digitalisation,” he said. “We are on course to becoming among the fastest-growing economies of the world, but there is far to go. Private consumption and investment are still work-in-progress. The restoration of livelihoods and the revival of MSMEs is a formidable task that lies ahead,” he emphasised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbis-accommodative-approach-has-served-country-well-patra/article64991193.ece

(NARCL), or the ‘bad bank’ set up to help resolve the stress. “A total of 38 accounts aggregating to Rs. 82,845 crore have been identified for transfer to NARCL; however the transfer will happen in a phased manner,” State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Khara said in a briefing. “Under Phase I, about 15 accounts, aggregating to Rs. 50,335 crore, are expected to be transferred in the current financial year, i.e. on or before March 31,” he said. Mr. Khara said all requisite approvals, including from the RBI, for setting up NARCL and the India Debt Resolution Company Ltd. (IDRCL) have now been received and that both companies were ready to commence business. The broad features of the arrangement are that NARCL will acquire and aggregate the identified NPA accounts from the banks, while IDRCL, under the exclusive arrangement, will handle the debt resolution process. The final approval and ownership for the resolution shall lie with NARCL as the principal. This arrangement will also be in full conformity with the provisions of the SARFAESI Act as well as outsourcing guidelines of the Reserve Bank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/banks-to-transfer-15-npas-worth-rs-50000-cr-to-narcl/article64991194.ece

Why are you not paying up? Are you taking advantage because you are a busy airline? Do you want to run or close the show,” Chief Justice N.V. Ramana asked SpiceJet, represented by senior advocate Harish Salve. The Bench, also comprising Justices A.S. Bopanna and Hima Kohli, proceeded to give a short reprieve to the airline by staying the publication of a Madras High Court (HC) order to wind up the company. The court stayed the HC order for three weeks so that the airline could work out a “serious offer” to the satisfaction of Credit Suisse AG, which was assigned the right to receive the payments due to SR Technics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sc-gives-spicejet-3-weeks-to-resolve-payment-claim/article64991190.ece

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:36 IST,||Nadal one step away from a landmark||Rafael Nadal is within one victory of a men’s record 21st Grand Slam singles title. The 35-year-old Spaniard advanced to the Australian Open final for the sixth time with a 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 win over seventh-seeded Matteo Berrettini on Friday. He’ll have to beat US Open champion Daniil Medvedev on Sunday to make history. And, Medvedev is chasing a piece of history of his own after reeling off the last five games to defeat Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6(5), 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 in a heated semifinal. He’s aiming to be the first man in the Open era to win his second Grand Slam title at the next Major tournament. Challenging run The second-seeded Medvedev has had an emotional and challenging run to back-to-back Australian Open finals. He had to deal with a hostile crowd in his second-round win over Nick Kyrgios, save a match-point and rally from two sets down to beat Felix Auger-Aliassime in a nearly five-hour quarterfinal win, and had to regain his composure after an angry outburst at the umpire on Friday. He yelled at chair umpire Jaume Campistol after dropping serve in the second set, demanding that Tsitsipas be cautioned for receiving coaching from his father in the crowd. He took a five-minute break after dropping the set, took control late in the third set and then dominated the last five games after Tsitsipas was eventually cautioned. Smooth passage Nadal’s run to a 29th Grand Slam final has been comparatively serene. After the last point, he stopped, beamed a wide grin and then punched the air thrice. Nadal arrived in Australia not knowing how long he would last after months off the Tour dealing with a serious foot injury and then a bout of COVID-19. He skipped Wimbledon after losing in the French Open semifinals to Novak Djokovic, and didn’t play at all after August. Last month, he wasn’t even sure he’d be able to return to the Tour. But he won a tune-up tournament in Melbourne and has taken six straight matches at the first Grand Slam of the year. One more and he’ll break the record of 20 Major championships he shares with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Nadal would also become just the fourth man to win all four Slam titles at least twice. 500th win Nadal’s win over Wimbledon runner-up Berrettini, under a closed roof at Rod Laver Arena because of heavy rain, was his 500th on hard courts at Tour level. He’s only won the Australian Open once, in 2009. Calmer approach Medvedev will need to take a calmer approach after beating Tsitsipas in the semifinals for the second year in a row at Melbourne Park. He lost to Djokovic in last year’s final, but then beat the No. 1-ranked player for the US Open title.  For a month and a half I did not know if I was going to be able to play tennis so it did not matter if it's outdoor or indoor today, I just wanted to enjoy it Nadal||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nadal-one-step-away-from-a-landmark/article38342086.ece

That could come in handy for the West Indies cricket team on its tour of India, according to two-time T20 World Cup-winning captain Daren Sammy, who has led the World Giants into the final of the Legends League Cricket, to be played here on Saturday. “He has been playing in India for so long (at the IPL) and knows the conditions very well,” said Sammy, who was Pollard’s captain during the West Indies’ successful campaign at the World T20 in 2012. “Hopefully that experience and knowledge he could bring on to the field,” Sammy said. He said the West Indies would fancy its chances against India in the white-ball series, though India has always been strong at home. “They have got some really good one-day players, but we have unearthed some new talent in the ongoing series against England,” he said. “I think the West Indies would do well, but you would need the guys to take wickets with the new ball.” He regards Rohit Sharma highly as a captain. “Kohli has been exceptional with his performances on the field, but Rohit is an excellent captain, very motivational,” he said. “I have watched him in the IPL. If you look at the IPL captains, you see they have grown — like Dhoni, Rohit, Gambhir… All these guys manage to get performances from their teammates. When their teams need, they perform, like Dhoni did in the playoffs (in the last edition),” Sammy pointed out. About the Legends tournament, he said it had been an excellent one. “The fans who saw you 10 or 15 years ago get to see you again,” he said. “All these guys come and entertain. This league can go far.” (The writer is in Muscat at the invitation of Legends League Cricket) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pollards-experience-will-help/article64991118.ece

If Priyanshu exploited Mithun Manjunath’s on-court endurance, Kiran George knocked out the last seeded player, third-ranked Subhankhar Dey. In the women’s section, Smit Toshniwal overcame a poor start to pack off USA’s Ishika Jaiswal, the last overseas challenger. She will be up against fifth seed Ashmita Chaliha.

Chukwu appeared to be off-side when he got a long pass from the right from Laldinliana Renthlei in the 49th minute. The Nigerian raced into the box with a defender hot on his heels and produced a sliding shot that kissed goalkeeper Naveen Kumar’s fingers before rolling in. The 1-0 victory, Jamshedpur’s sixth from 12 games, helped the side jump over Kerala Blasters and occupy the second spot in the 11-team league with 22 points while Goa stayed at the ninth position with 14 points from 14 matches. It was a day when Goa dominated the match and created plenty of chances, but the team was very unlucky. Thrice the Goans hit the crossbar leaving players like Airem Cabrera and Edu Bedia holding their heads in disappointment. One expected Jamshedpur, which was playing after a two-week break forced by COVID-19 issues, to be a bit rusty but its defence and goalkeeper T.P. Rehenesh stayed strong and confident. Rehenesh pulled off some smart saves, midway through the first half and in the next, and walked away with the ‘Hero of the match’ award.  The result: Jamshedpur FC 1 (Chukwu 49) bt FC Goa 0.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:31 IST,||Brazil earns a contentious draw||Brazil goalkeeper Alisson Becker had two red cards overturned by VAR reviews as Brazil hung on for a controversial 1-1 World Cup qualifier draw with Ecuador on Thursday, with both teams having a player dismissed. Alisson could count himself lucky after a straight red card in the first half, for a high boot on Enner Valencia, was downgraded to a yellow and then a second yellow card in injury-time was also overturned on review. Ecuador could be forgiven for feeling aggrieved as four VAR reviews, two to check possible dismissals and two for penalties originally awarded by Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan, all went against the hosts in Quito. Even so, the point inches it closer to World Cup qualification with three games left. Early lead Casemiro gave the visitors, who were missing the injured Neymar, an early lead but Ecuador centre-back Felix Torres equalised 15 minutes from time. Chile, once a force in the region, saw its chances shrink dramatically after a 2-1 home loss to second-place Argentina. Uruguay rose back to contention after a 1-0 win at Paraguay, with a goal by veteran Luis Suarez.  The results: Ecuador 1 (Torres 75) drew with Brazil 1 (Casemiro 6); Paraguay 0 lost to Uruguay 1 (Suarez 50); Chile 1 (Brereton Diaz 20) lost to Argentina 2 (Di Maria 9, L.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:07 IST,||New-look hockey team relishing future challenges||With quite a few seniors calling time on their international careers, a sobering third-place finish at the Asian Champions Trophy last month was a well-timed lesson for the Indian men’s hockey team. Both the players and the management are now hoping to start a hectic 2022 on a winning note when they step out for their opening Pro League games against South Africa and France in Potchefstroom in February and maintain the momentum through the year. “It is never easy being the coach and have legends leave the group and make decisions that are required. My effort has been to build a deeper squad and give as many opportunities as possible to as many players and that was also part of the strength of this group before Tokyo,” chief coach Graham Reid admitted in an interaction with select media on Friday. “As you lose players, you bring the new ones in as quickly as you can and give them enough experience by the time of bigger events like the Asiad.” The squad features two debutants and Reid sounded impressed by them. “Jugraj Singh is very quick in drag-flick and if we can get some of his speed and make it a little more consistent it would be exciting. But he is also very versatile in the midfield and defence. Abhishek is an all-out striker who loves to score and even in the camp he was quite prolific, so good to have new influx in the group,” the coach explained. The recent breakout of Covid cases in the squad during training and the large number of positives in various teams across sports have raised questions on the efficacy of standard bio-bubbles but both the coach and captain Manpreet Singh insist they are prepared. “This is not new for us. Everyone has been constantly keeping us informed on the rules to follow, there will be almost daily tests so we would want to make sure to follow the protocols as much as possible. That will help us focus more on the games,” Manpreet said. Staying diligent “We spend a lot of time trying to make sure the bubble is created right from the moment we leave here and the players know what is required in the bus and the aircraft, everywhere. A lot of it is down to the players and places we are going to and the protocols in place,” said Reid. “I think SA know pretty well about it and we have to trust them and the FIH. It’s an ever-changing situation, we need to stay diligent but also be prepared for things to change very quickly,” Reid added. The pressure of being among the top teams in the world now sits easy on the team. “For us it is not pressure, it is an achievement. We know that teams will now target us and try to beat us all the time and so we have to be always better than them. But this is what we have been playing for all our lives and now we are enjoying this challenge,” Manpreet said.  Abhishek is an all-out striker who loves to score and even in the camp he was quite prolific Graham Reid Chief coach||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/new-look-hockey-team-relishing-future-challenges/article64991291.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 05:21 IST,||James, Durant named All-Star captains||Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James was named an NBA All-Star Game captain for the fifth-straight season on Thursday as the league revealed the starting players for the mid-season showcase in Cleveland. James was the leading vote getter from the Western Conference. Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant topped the East voting and got the nod as a team captain, although he is expected to miss a second straight All-Star Game after spraining his left knee earlier this month. Durant and James were among the 10 players voted in as starters for the February 20 game at the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. The All-Star reserves will be named next Thursday. Fan voting accounts for 50 percent of the total vote to pick the starters, while current players and media make up the other half. The reserves are chosen by NBA head coaches, and league commissioner Adam Silver chooses injury replacements, if necessary. James and Durant will draft their teams from the eligible pool of players and they are not required to draft based on conference affiliation or position. The 2020 All-Star lineup features some familiar faces, rising stars and first-time players. James’ 18 All-Star nods ties Kobe Bryant for second place all-time behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (19). Denver’s NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic (West) and Philadelphia 76ers Joel Embiid (East) nabbed starting frontcourt spots. Embiid has 21 games of 30 or more points this season and six with 40 or more. “I have come a long way the last two years,” Embiid said after hearing his name called. The other front court player in the East is Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, while Chicago Bulls DeMar DeRozan and Atlanta Hawks Trae Young make up the back court starters. Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins, of Canada, joins James and Jokic as top vote getters on the frontcourt in the West. The guards are Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry and first time All-Star Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies. Joining 2020 rookie of the year Morant as a first time all star is Wiggins, who is in eighth NBA season. Wiggins is shooting 48.1 percent from the floor and 40.4 percent from three-point range, and Morant is averaging 24.4 points, 6.7 assists and 5.7 rebounds per game. The All-Star draft is set for February 10 and the slam dunk contest on February 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/james-durant-named-all-star-captains/article64991384.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 06:08 IST,||New look team for Cairo World Cup||The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) was forced to select the team for the first World Cup in rifle and pistol to be staged in Cairo from February 25, without going through the selection trials. With January 25 as the deadline for entry, the NRAI had no option but to bank solely on the performance of the shooters in the national championship. The trials scheduled in January had been postponed owing to the Covid wave. It was not a surprise that many Olympians, who competed in Tokyo, could not find a place in the 24-member team. However, it was a surprise that national champions — Manu Bhaker in women’s air pistol and Sarabjot Singh in men’s air pistol — did not figure in the final selection, despite the policy guaranteeing a berth for the champions in the national squad. With the qualification scores of national championship and the points for the performance in finals, it was a lottery that went against many good performers. The young Esha Singh was the only shooter to be selected for both air pistol and sports pistol events. The cream of women air rifle shooters, Anjum Moudgil, Apurvi Chandela and Elavenil Valarivan did not get in. Interestingly, Apurvi missed out narrowly in the rifle 3-position event, in which only two could get the nod. In contrast, Sanjeev Rajput squeezed in as the fourth shooter in men’s rifle 3-position event. Deepak Kumar, Abhishek Verma, Yashaswini Singh Deswal and Tejaswini Sawant were the other Olympians who were not selected. Tejaswini did not compete in the national championship. In a revised selection policy for the next Olympic cycle till the Paris Games, the NRAI has also categorically stated that no shooter would be allowed to compete in more than two World Cups in a season. The national camp in preparation for the World Cup will be held at the Dr. Karni Singh Range for a fortnight. The team will be accompanied by six coaches and two physios.  The team: Men: Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar, Akhil Sheoran, Kiran Jadhav, Sanjeev Rajput, Divyansh Singh Panwar, Rundrankksh Patil, Srinjoy Datta. Anish Bhanwala, Bhavesh Shekhawat, Gurpreet Singh, Kedarling Balakrishna Uchaganve, Saurabh Chaudhary, Gaurav Rana, Pradhyuman Singh.

The Indians left behind the disappointment of their semifinal defeat to Korea and controlled the proceedings in the first two quarters to go into half-time with a 2-0 lead. Sharmila Devi gave India the lead in a 13th-minute penalty corner sequence, scoring from a rebound after Gurjit Kaur’s initial flick was saved. India kept up the pressure with relentless raids in the second quarter and secured another penalty corner in the 19th minute, converted by Gurjit with a superb drag-flick. China pressed hard in desperation and secured three consecutive penalty corners with two minutes left on the clock but lacked in final execution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-wins-consolation-bronze/article64991114.ece

It is set to stick to the format for the league stage as announced earlier: five groups of six teams in the Elite group and eight teams in Plate. However, there may be minor changes to the format and venues of the second phase. Out of the six venues the BCCI had announced (Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram), Mumbai and Thiruvananthapuram are almost ruled out. While Mumbai will be unavailable as the BCCI is planning to host the IPL league stage in the Mumbai-Pune corridor, Thiruvananthapuram is unlikely to host matches given the high number of COVID-19 cases there. Rajkot and Jaipur have been shortlisted to host a few games, with Indore as back-up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ranji-in-two-phases-bcci/article64991111.ece

ATK Mohun Bagan won the first phase 3-0 and continues to remain the favourite as the better placed side in the current league standings. ATKMB, which has remained unbeaten in its last six outings, is currently placed eighth with 16 points from 10 matches but still has three games in hand. East Bengal is lying at the bottom of the table with just nine points from 13 matches and is hoping to see a turnaround in its fortunes under new coach Mario Rivera, who made a few signings in the January transfer window. “When you play a derby, league positions do not matter. The derby is always about facing your top rival and the outcome can be anything,” said Rivera on the eve of the match. The SCEB coach now has the task of reorganising the side after suffering a demoralising 0-4 loss against Hyderabad FC in the previous outing. The ATKMB side has not tasted success after returning from an 18-day COVID-19 induced break. But what will be charging up the side, coached by Juan Ferrando, is the fact that East Bengal has never won against it ever since the two sides joined the ISL. “We understand that our target is to get the three points, improve in our style and stay focused throughout the game. Of course there is an emotional side to the game but we have to keep our focus,” ATKMB coach Juan Ferrando said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/atkmb-has-an-edge-over-sc-eb/article38342419.ece

Hari Haran and Vipul Kumar.  “Most of the players are of similar age groups and this helps us synchronise with each other better and they have the vigour to perform better. We might lack experience, but it should be remembered that we played the final of the previous edition and that is a huge experience,” the duo said in a chat with The Hindu .  “Definitely, the PVL will help Indian volleyball reach global level in the future,” they said to a query. On the preparations, Hari and Vipul said they worked a lot on strengthening and mobility, with the Argentine coach helping the team to treat each other equally and gel as a unit. “The coach also taught techniques which we have not seen before,” said 27-year-old Vipul from Uttar Pradesh. “Definitely, the format of 15 points for five sets means the game has to be with minimal errors. The chances of coming back into the contest are far less if we make too many errors,” they said. “There are also super points on offer which will be crucial for both the teams in any match. The conversion will make or break things, so we are focusing on that,” the duo said. “Yes, the bio-bubble because of the pandemic is a major challenge as you tend to get less time to train and speak and meet all,” they said. “We play for our Black Hawks with the same passion as we do when we play for the country. There is no difference in our level of hard work,” Hari and Vipul said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/coach-taught-techniques-we-have-not-seen-before/article64991202.ece

It was a complete team performance from the Pirates with all three raiders contributing. The 28-point victory margin will also boost its playoff hopes. Three Pirates defenders — Mohammadreza Shadloui (6 tackle points), Neeraj Kumar (6) and Sunil (5) — picked up High 5s in a superlative show. Coach Ram Mehar Singh's men had 21 tackle points on the night — Pirates’ best in the league — as they gave Thalaivas no chance to stage a fightback. The opening few minutes were closely contested with teams’ defence looking strong. However, Pirates, on the mat after a nine-day break, looked fresh.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:44 IST,||Rathore’s quiet RTW brand||Amid the many new fashion labels launched or announced in the recent past — with established designers like Tarun Tahiliani, Ritu Kumar, Anamika Khanna, Masaba, Shantanu and Nikhil Mehra, and others getting corporate backing — none has been as quiet, almost secretive, as designer Raghavendra Rathore’s new ready-to-wear brand, RR Blue. Backed by Reliance — Rathore’s brand received joint funding from Ermenegildo Zegna and Reliance in 2018 (one of the first in the country) — RR Blue is an accessible men’s label that’s aimed at bringing the Rathore aesthetic to a wider audience. But that’s where the similarities between it and, say, a brand like Tarun Tahiliani’s newly-launched Tasva, end.  A full six months after it started retailing online, I chanced upon its Instagram handle by sheer coincidence. At first, I thought it was a lookalike brand, a copy. But when I found it retailing on Rathore’s own website, I reached out to the designer. “The blueprint for RR Blue came into being almost four years ago when Reliance came into the picture,” he said over the phone from a jungle retreat. “We were waiting for the right time… and seeing the rise of online retail over the course of the pandemic, it seemed like the ideal moment to test the waters.” The Rajasthani designer, known for his bespoke bandhgalas and jodhpurs, is quick to point out that he did not want a big launch.  Trying a new strategy According to Rathore, the RR Blue brand is aesthetically an extension of his bespoke fashion label, and a big launch would lead to overlaps in design that could possibly muddy the waters. This is a new sentiment to encounter in a rapidly expanding market space where established designers are almost too ready to capitalise on their style signatures. And why shouldn’t they? Designs from labels like SN by Shantanu and Nikhil and Tasva by Tarun Tahiliani are, if anything, an entry point into a design universe for a new, and arguably larger, segment of shoppers who may not have the pockets for couture, but have the taste and desire for well-designed RTW from the same venerated houses.  Not so for Rathore. “We wanted to avoid overlapping the looks, silhouettes, and storyboards that we build for our premium brand,” he said, and added that he sees the RR Blue brand as providing everyday fashion for those who already wear Rathore. The collections so far feature cotton, silk, and blended fabrics, and are not marketed on their textiles particularly. The prints, developed in-house, are patterned and easy to pair with a variety of separates and lowers. “It’s more about giving Rathore wearers their staples so their existing wardrobe can get regular updates. This is why we aren’t looking at doing hyper-seasonal collections. We’re concentrating on smaller drops of easier shirts, kurtas , and pants.”  And when online gets loud?  Being retailed exclusively online, though, this reasoning may seem counter-productive. After all, online availability opens the brand up to all shoppers, and many may not have bespoke Rathore designs to begin with. And by Rathore’s own account, even without the blowout of a full-scale fashion launch, the response to RR Blue’s online retail has seen unexpected growth within these few months. “It’s been a very pleasant surprise,” he said. With kurtas beginning at Rs. 5,999 and the more design-forward achkans going up to Rs. 59,999, this isn’t news. But the very presence of the brand online would — should — hint at an aspiration for larger retail numbers. It’s something that the Reliance behemoth could easily step into in terms of production, just like the Aditya Birla group does for SN by Shantanu and Nikhil as well as TT’s Tasva.  RR Blue though, differs in this aspect. Rathore’s own studio and production facilities — owned or contracted — take on the onus of production and supply. And keeping his control on production brings Rathore a number of benefits as well. Smaller production quantities are easier to manage, while also allowing his design team to introduce newer styles more frequently. It gives the designers and merchandisers the time, and with it, the data, to understand their market and what works for it. What would be truly interesting to see, though, would be how Rathore and Reliance engage with RR Blue’s growth trajectory. In lay terms, deliberately and slowly is not how Reliance usually does things. I am eager to see whether this cautious approach, unique right now for RR Blue being the only corporate-backed brand that’s practising it, leads to building a label that’s both exclusive in its designs and accessible in its price points… without evolving the business plan to include more points of sale.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/rathores-quiet-rtw-brand/article64991537.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:44 IST,||In a loop for love||Looop Lapeta comes 24 years after the German thriller Run Lola Run, which had Franka Potente as Lola. But the cast and director of the Hindi adaptation are confident about having created something new. In a video interview accompanied by her co-star and director, Taapsee Pannu, the first to join the project, says half the battle was won when director Aakash Bhatia and Tahir Raj Bhasin came on board. Like Run Lola …, Looop Lapeta pivots on a woman’s (Pannu as Savi) race against time to raise money to save her boyfriend’s (Bhasin) life. So Savi has 80 minutes to navigate multiple dead ends and three time-loops to muster Rs. 50 lakh.   Fortunately, Bhasin, 34, remembered the original’s style and cutting-edge music from his college days and was excited to see it adapted for a contemporary Indian audience. Pannu, also 34, was especially delighted when he accepted the role as she had anticipated “tricky” casting with the actor having to set aside his ego to work in a film with a woman protagonist. This, however, was not Bhasin’s first time in a woman-centred film; his Bollywood breakthrough came as the antagonist opposite Rani Mukherjee in the thriller Mardaani (2014). Most recently, he played Sunil Gavaskar in Kabir Khan’s ’83 (2021).  Bhatia: doing it his way  This is Bhatia’s first feature film, but he has directed several episodes of the Prime series Inside Edge and a music video. Pannu says she admires his vision of doing something radically different from mainstream Hindi cinema. And while she preferred not to track the monitors on set, Pannu felt Bhatia’s energy when she saw the cameras moving dynamically. His style of filmmaking was hard to adapt to, but she was confident they were creating something that hadn’t been seen before.  “You aren’t competing with a film of that level. You are trying to give it an homage, and you should do it in an honest way while being honest to yourself, and all the people who are involved, by making it as a fresh film,” shares Bhatia. Game for anything Pannu brings up an intimate sequence where she and Bhasin were lying on a log and elevated mid-air by a crane in an open-air studio with multiple crews watching. “We knew, from that day, that we are going to do things we had never imagined or were prepared for,” she says. “It’s just going to be thrown at us. After that, nothing about the intimacy felt weird, not even the camera, which was so close that I could hit my head on it.” She jokes about how the most awkward person on set was cinematographer Yash Khanna who was constantly up-close with the couple. Looop is a fast-paced, kinetic, exaggerated film, and playful in its craft. Compared to the original, Bhatia wanted viewers to become more invested in the couple’s “modern” relationship, which is at the film’s heart.  The intimate scenes contrast the rest of the film, allowing them the space to showcase their vision of a relationship of equals. For Bhasin, these moments helped slow down the film’s frantic rhythm, and gave the actors respite from the shoot’s constant physical demands.  Savi is an ex-athlete, so the multiple hours of running every day left Pannu fatigued. Luckily, she was training to play a sprinter in Rashmi Rocket . Bhasin adds that for him, holding on to Satya’s anxious, hyperactive persona through the day, for days on end, was taxing. That said, today, every new project for him feels like a pivotal moment from Looop . “You are at a crossroad, and anything can happen.”  Looop Lapeta streams on Netflix starting February 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/in-a-loop-for-love/article64991535.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:47 IST,||Flashback 75: Partition in virtual reality||“God was a little late that day,” says Iqbal-ud-din Ahmed, before recounting how the dread of the Partition claimed the soul of his village (Ropar in East Punjab), as a bleak sense of terror hung in the air around charred houses and dreams doused forever.  Ahmed’s character is voiced by actor Salman Shahid in Child of Empire , the docu-drama directed by Delhi-based Sparsh Ahuja (24) and London-based Erfan Saadati (27), which premiered at the ongoing Sundance Film Festival. In the 17-minute immersive animated virtual reality (VR) film, two men from the Partition generation — Ishar Das Arora (voiced by Adil Hussain), an Indian Hindu who migrated from Pakistan to India, and Ahmed, a Pakistani Muslim who made the opposite journey — share childhood memories of their experiences while playing a board game. And it goes straight for the jugular, sticking to the facts of the Partition itself.  “Our original plan was not to go the animated route,” says Ahuja. “But when Covid-19 hit, we were left with no choice.” However, Ahuja and the team would realise that the animated format was a blessing in disguise: it was far better placed in mirroring the horrors of Partition.  The film was created by Project Dastaan — a peacebuilding initiative that reconnects individuals displaced during the 1947 Partition with their ancestral villages through VR — in association with Anzo films. “It is immersive, immediate, haunting, moving, and destabilising; one lives the days exactly as refugees in 1947 would have, fleeing, migrating, witnessing massacre and loss,” says oral historian and author Aanchal Malhotra ( Remnants of a Separation: A History of the Partition Through Material Memory ), one of the advisors on the project. “To be a listener of such stories is one thing, but Child of Empire may be the closest in imagining what millions of people experienced and survived.”  Another advisor, historian William Dalrymple, says that he was both “moved and astonished” by the power of the medium and the material itself. His son, Sam Dalrymple, is a co-producer. Fragmented lives The team at Project Dastaan had an ambitious target before them: to complete 75 interviews of the Partition survivors (across the UK, India and Pakistan, in five languages) on the eve of India’s 75th year of independence. However, Covid delays meant only 35 could be completed. “When we were sifting through the recordings, I was biased towards my own maternal grandfather’s experience,” says Ahuja. In the documentary, the characters of Arora — based on the experiences of Ahuja’s maternal grandfather, Ishar Das Arora (who migrated from Bela, a village in West Punjab’s Attock Tehsil to Tilak Nagar, New Delhi) — and Ahmed — jointly based on the memories of the latter (who migrated from Ropar, East Punjab, to Lahore) and Jagdish Chandra Ahuja (Ahuja’s paternal grandfather who migrated from Dera Ghazi Khan in West Punjab to Tilak Nagar, New Delhi) — recount stories of crouching under the seat of a humid train as a mob lashes at it, with images showing of candles turning into ransacked villages. More than anything, both share how each was saved by a member of the other religion. For Ahuja, this was telling of a larger political shift in his own family. “My maternal grandfather was saved by a Muslim man but many in my family, who have now become fervent nationalists, had no idea that this was the case,” he says. Last year, Sparsh and the team at Project Dastaan had the rare opportunity of actually visiting Pakistan. And he managed to track down the family of the Muslim man who had saved his grandfather’s life. “This was in a small hamlet that goes by Bela,” he recounts. “The man had passed away a while back, but his family was overjoyed to see me.” He recorded the entire experience in a VR format for his grandfather to experience back home. “They wanted me to stay there for at least a week and even attend their cousin’s wedding. I collected some pebbles from the village to fashion them into wearable jewellery.” But there was a surprising revelation at the heart of this experience: Ahuja would soon understand that this Pakistani family, much like his own, had sympathies for the extremists in their country — despite being happy for each other. “It’s strange and ironic how history plays out. In a different world, we would be a single unit.” Throughtheeyesof a child Nearly every frame of the docu-drama features a child — either crouching under a train seat, running away from a frantic mob, or simply sitting next to burning pyres. It appears that their presence is both a metaphor for the many children quite literally lost to us and a searing indictment of just how unfair it was that they were witnesses to our country’s blackest spot.  Ahuja believes that if we were to remove the two central narrators, Child of Empire would essentially parallel a single, tragic migration story. “It’s important to note that both the narrators are Punjabis,” he says. “They have internalised the political shifts of their time, which shows in the way they narrate their stories. When they recalled their experiences in the interviews, you could see the trauma in their eyes. It is that very experience that we want our viewers to come close to.”   The way Arora sees it, for the uninitiated viewer, Child of Empire provides just the right context to understand how multifaceted the Partition experience was. “The fact that both the characters have so much in common helps. We wanted the most moving and human stories to make it to the film from over two dozen interviews.”   Towards the end of the documentary, a soulful rendition of Subh-e-Azaadi — originally penned by the Pakistani revolutionary poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz, composed by Vasundhara Gupta, and sung by Amira Gill — beckons the viewer to contemplate the sheer human price of one of modern history’s largest and bloodiest forced migrations; and the price of freedom itself.   Child of Empire is currently screening on-demand at sundance.org, as part of the ‘New Frontier’ programming slate,which showcases works at the crossroads of film, art, and technology. This year, their ‘Spaceships’ programme allows viewers to experience the films by teleporting themselves to the festival using virtual avatars.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/flashback-75-partition-in-virtual-reality/article64991521.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:45 IST,||Snow Right and the 11 Duties||If you’ve been following the news, you probably know that Indians have unknowingly weakened the country since Independence. At every turn, personalities ranging from Annie Besant to Ambedkar, Bharati to Namdeo Dhasal, Hasina Khan to Radhika Vemula have fought for the fundamental rights of all Indians, but it transpires that this was a pretty anti-national move. Instead, they should have focussed on people performing their fundamental duties. Added to the Constitution in 1976, Fundamental Duties, like the Directive Principles, are in the nature of guidelines and not enforceable by law. Perhaps it’s time to change that now, given the eagerness with which we are already enforcing the duties. Take, for instance, the duty to “promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst the people, transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities”. I believe nothing does this so well as a strategic lynching or two, disrupting prayers, breaking statues of each other’s religious communities, barring some people from some river banks, and so on. Equally, there is the duty to “cherish and preserve the rich national heritage of our composite culture”. Many people define ‘composite culture’ as a happy fusion of many disparate ways of being. Which is fine, but it doesn’t take into account a widespread misreading of the said passage. Our venerable Constitution writers wrote ‘composite’ but many people are probably reading it as ‘compost’. This explains why the protectors of duties are now showing much interest in digging up all sorts of historical worms that turn, purely in the interest of vermiculture composting.  I actually did not know that one of the fundamental duties is “to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women”. One suspects that this too needs a small amendment. It should perhaps read as “denounce” and not “renounce”. In this revised form, I am happy to say, the nation is following its duty to the letter. Each day brings news of women auctioned online, of women raped by powerful seers and heads of church, of famous actors and singers assaulting female colleagues, and each of these crimes is loudly denounced in public speeches. As long as someone somewhere denounces all practices derogatory to our ma-behens , all will be well.  Duty No. 7 is to protect and improve the natural environment including lakes, wildlife, rivers, forests, etc. And the best way to do this is to find innovative ways to increase India’s forest cover. It was recently discovered that India’s forest and environment ministry has begun to include tea gardens and palm plantations as forest cover. It should be a citizen’s duty to suggest other areas they can add. Golf courses, lawns and coconut groves come to mind. As for “improving the natural environment,” both industrialists and ministers know that nothing improves messy jungles as neatly as a coal mine or two. One of the Fundamental Duties also says that citizens must “abjure violence”. But this duty, I believe, one can safely ignore because enforcing duties invariably requires a bit of violence. Remember how that man was beaten up by dutiful citizens even as they asked him to recite the anthem? It’s the spirit of the thing that counts. Another duty that could pose a challenge is the one that urges citizens to develop “a scientific temper, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry”. One is aware that many dutiful citizens have a short temper, but it might not always be scientific. After all, when it becomes our bounden duty to bang plates and ring bells to connect aurally with the cosmos, one can’t be too keen on science. And then there’s the highly unscientific Corofil that many of us swear by and diligently distribute to friends and relations. As one should. Never let science come between you and your duty. All told, it appears as if one need not feel anxious about the direction in which the country is headed. But one never knows; people have a nasty habit of suddenly demanding fundamental rights. And that’s probably why the Prime Minister felt the need to caution the nation in its 75th year of Independence. One shares his anxiety. It is perhaps time for another constitutional amendment — one that takes away all rights and assigns to citizens a set of duties alone.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:45 IST,||Can Kamal help khadi?||Last November, KH House of Khaddar (KHHK) — a joint venture between designer Amritha Ram and actor Kamal Haasan — launched in Chicago, with a Fall-Winter collection that included trenches, blazers, and skirts. On Republic Day 2022, it came to India. With organic colours such as olive, dove grey, spring blue and a fruity pink, the palette is youthful and hip, in keeping with KHHK’s aim to push the handloom conversation beyond our borders. The question is, however, if a celebrity-endorsed venture will finally help bridge the gap between the handspun fabric and a new, young audience. (The finished product is often expensive and inaccessible after top designers work with it.) We talk to some experts. Priced between Rs. 4,950 andRs.9,450, onkhhk.in. Ramesh Menon Founder of Save the Loom, which works with handloom and khadi weavers in Kerala Hand-spun fabric and youth: Khadi has definitely got attention in the Modi era, but not enough to rejuvenate its spinners and weavers. Handspun, handwoven khadi has huge potential as it is entirely produced by human hands; it is not just sustainable but also is suitable for all seasons. There is a global awakening towards khadi — this is from our experience of launching the ‘Colors of Resilience’ project [with Kerala khadi made by over 20 leading designers, which found a global audience in 2018-19].   The Kamal Haasan connect: He is a legend and will surely bring attention to khadi. We hope that instead of merely selling it under his brand name as a business, he steps forward to speak of [the fabric] and its Gandhian values. Khadi needs the attention and who better than the country’s cine stars?  Ravi Kiran Founder of Metaphor Racha, which  works with ambara charaka handspun handwoven fabric   Celebritiesand khadi: Rather than launch a label, a celebrity wearing the handloom regularly is in itself is a huge endorsement! An actor does not have to launch a label to promote the fabric.   A new audience: We should first educate the younger lot about not just what khadi is, but also what it signifies. [Since it is often expensive] rather than expecting them to dress up in it, they can start small, with, say, a handkerchief that does not cost much. The idea is that they understand the fabric.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:44 IST,||‘Our attention has been stolen by powerful forces’||The viral Netflix documentary Social Dilemma clarified that with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram we are not the consumer, but the product being sold. Our attention is being surveilled and packaged to advertising companies who pump our timelines — now an infinite scroll confected by an addiction-fuelling algorithm. One of the consequences of this, as argued by journalist Johann Hari, is a radically shortened attention span.   Hari, after the scandals in 2011 involving his plagiarism, took time off and boomeranged back with books tackling charged issues such as drug addiction ( Chasing the Scream: The first and last days of the war on drugs , 2015) and depression ( Lost Connections: Uncovering the real causes of depression , 2018). In his latest book Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention (Bloomsbury, Rs. 599), he broadens the question of attention beyond social media. What are all the things that rob us of our focus? What can we do as individuals? What should we do as a society?  His argument is bleak: that as individuals there is only so much we can do. His solutions are, thus, systemic and radical — nationalising Facebook like the BBC, creating a paid-subscription model for social media, introducing four-day work weeks, banning surveillance capitalism, and letting children play freely without parental helicoptering. In a Zoom interview, he discusses these solutions and some of the criticism they have received. What were the triggers that led to you pursuingabook on this topic? I noticed that my own ability to focus got worse. Things that needed deep forms of focus, like reading a book, were getting harder and harder. I would blame my will power, but looking at the young people in my life alarmed me, where nothing still or serious could touch them. This seemed outside the norm. So, I went on a long journey from Moscow to Miami to Melbourne interviewing over 200 of the leading experts on attention and focus, and I learned there is scientific evidence for 12 factors that can make your attention better or worse, and that many of the factors which can make your attention worse have been hugely increasing. It is not that our attention collapsed. But it has been stolen by these big powerful forces. A lot of the research you cite in this book is incredibly American and European-focussed. Are there cultural factors that would, perhaps, undermine some of the arguments? The honest answer is I don’t know. It is a perfectly legitimate criticism. One of the things that is happening is that your society [South Asian] is becoming much more like the West. What the book is doing, then, is to caution you on parts of the western society — like our diet — that have a negative effect on focus. You have spoken about how the internet has made reading “manic and extractive”. Is there no pleasure then in being online? Definitely. But is it possible to have the good bits without the negative effects on attention? Turns out there is. Aza Raskin, who designed a key part of the internet — his father invented the Apple Macintosh — said to me that if you want to deal with the invasive effects of the internet on people’s attention, you have to understand the business model. If you open Facebook or TikTok, the company makes money in two ways: the ads, but also everything you say and do is scanned and sorted by the AI to build a profile of you, to sell your attention to targeted advertisers. His solution was to ban the current business model. Those companies would [then] have to use a different model — subscription, like a Netflix account, or like the sewer system, we all pay for the public good.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:45 IST,||‘I like to be kind and stay in my lane’||Teen romance to romantic comedy to action drama. In just three films, Ananya Panday, 23, has shown that she will not be put into a box. Her latest, Gehraiyaan , tackles messy relationships and the drama that comes with them (the cast calls it ‘‘domestic noir”). Directed by Shakun Batra ( Kapoor & Sons , Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu ) for Amazon Prime Video, the movie also stars Deepika Padukone and Siddhant Chaturvedi.   While we don’t see much of Panday’s character, Tia, in the recently-launched trailer, she says there’s a lot more to her role. “I won’t say I have experienced what she has been through, but we do share a lot of characteristics. Like being extremely loving and loyal in any relationship. Perhaps a little dependent and insecure as well…,” she trails off with a smile in a Zoom interview with The Hindu Weekend .  The dynamic and complex relationships between the three protagonists are what drew her to the script. That the project was helmed by one of her dream directors was an added bonus. “I don’t think I had a process in terms of acting; I would turn up and just go with the flow. [But] Shakun has been very conscious and mindful with me. He gave me the freedom to explore. When we would block our scenes, he would let us play it out.” This helped Panday build the character on her own terms and connect with the role better. “It’s something I will take forward with me in my career.” The socialnetwork One area that Panday does not need help with, however, is social media. Her 21 million Instagram followers are privy to her love for fashion, her new projects, and glimpses of her personal life. In her bio, she calls herself a ‘serial chiller’. “I’m happy just being with my family and closest friends [whom I’ve grown up with]. I love sitting with my pancakes and coffee in a corner and getting lost in a good book,” she says, adding that, at the same time, she is careful about not setting unrealistic expectations for those who follow her. “It isn’t possible to be completely confident, happy, or on point at all times. I like to be kind and stay in my lane.” It’s also why she does not understand cancel culture. “What does that even mean? It’s not like they will cease to exist any more!” This approach to creating safe spaces online gave rise to So Positive (@sopositivedsr) in 2019, her Digital Social Responsibility initiative. The aim is to create awareness around social media bullying, she says. “The fact is that anyone could be in that position; it’s important to discuss these subjects openly.” So, apart from tips on their social media feed, they have also put together a handbook on how to best deal with such situations. During the pandemic, the content pivoted to highlight Covid warriors. Future projects  On the work front, she’s busy promoting Gehraiyaan at the moment. Liger , with Vijay Devarakonda and Mike Tyson, is set to release in the second half of 2022. There’s also a mystery project she promises we’ll hear about soon.   In the meantime, she will begin shooting for Zoya Akhtar’s Kho Gaye Hum Kahan in March.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/i-like-to-be-kind-and-stay-in-my-lane/article64991533.ece

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:47 IST,||Sofa, so good||Asofa is going to last you for long, long time. So even if you buy one for a temporary fix, it will keep moving from one room to another but not get discarded so easily. So give it a good thought before going sofa-shopping. But how do you know which sofa works best for you and your family? They all look great and they all look like they will serve the purpose well. But that’s where you need to open your eyes and pay attention because there is more than meets the eye (think spring, frame, cushions). We have a list of types of sofa that best suit your lifestyle. Regular redecorator If the itch to change and then change some more is your trademark, then a sofa with slipcovers is a good idea. That’s because you can change the slipcovers often since changing a sofa every month is not a viable option. TV-watching couple/family So you and your family are couch potatoes? Fair enough. If the sofa is the preferred sanctuary then we suggest a super comfortable sofa where you can sink in to, tuck your feet in, place the bowl of chips in your lap and go on a movie marathon. A deep-seat sofa with foldable armrests would work best for this. Happy-to-play host If you are the one whose place is the hotspot for parties that may stretch into early dawn or if you are the one hosting family and friends from outside, a sleeper sofa is the right pick for you. Make sure it is sturdy and of deeper shades. After all, the sofa will live to see many a wine being spilt! Small-space occupant If you live in a smaller space it will be unreasonable to buy a sofa that extends from wall to wall. Demi-sofas and loveseats are always a good option. You can also go for wrought iron sofas as they have bare minimum frame and occupy less space. They also look elegant and stylish depending on the piece you have picked up. For the temporary bachelor Single but may soon tie the knot? Since you need something to sit on until the wedding bells ring, we suggest you go for a cheaper sofa that won’t hurt if you have to discard it later. You could go for a cane sofa set since that can be used in other rooms if not the main living room. Now that you have a sofa, may we suggest a few quick ways to jazz it up? Toss a throw: Throws add casual chic and look perfect tossed carelessly over the back of a sofa. Opt for a mohair one if you’re seeking warmth or a fur piece to add a touch of Hollywood glam.  Dump the pillows: Almost every other sofa is topped by an assortment of pillows. Stand out from the crowd by placing just one simple cushion – a longish one – on the sofa. Stylish!  Bring in a blanket: What could be better than a warm plaid blanket draped over the side of the sofa? It adds a punch of colour and is just what you need to wrap around yourself on a cold night.  Try a shawl: If the blankie seems a tad too much for Indian winters, why not get out your soft cashmere or pashmina shawl for the sofa? It adds a stylish touch without ODing on the wintry feel.  Change the cushion covers: This one’s a no-brainer but we suggest you keep your throw pillows as they are and spend a couple of hours in the afternoon working on the covers – a satin bow here, some sequins there, a lick of fabric paint somewhere. Voila!  Replace the seat covers: If the sofa seems a bit off colour, why not add a quirky touch by getting the roadside tailor to stitch some slip covers for the seat cushions? Opt for patterns if the sofa is plain; look for solids if the sofa has patterned upholstery.  Explore interesting accessories: Placing planters, a lamp and other souvenirs by the side of the sofa ensures that there’s plenty of visual interest around your seating arrangement.   If you are the one hosting family and friends from outside, a sleeper sofa is the right pick for you. Make sure it is sturdy and of deeper shades||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/sofa-so-good/article64991516.ece
29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:47 IST,||Preserving existing trees||When I look around the city and its outskirts, I see large plot layouts ready for sale but cleared of all vegetation, I suppose making it easier to be ‘developed’ or to be built upon. One of the first thoughts that comes to the minds of most plot owners is to clear all trees and vegetation on their plots so that they have a clean slate to build without any constraint. It is unfortunate that trees have to be sacrificed in order accommodate our building and other infrastructure needs. With the growing pace of urbanisation, such clearing of plots will continue to happen without any consideration for the environment unless stringent laws and regulations are in place. By now we should all be aware of the beneficial effects of trees and other vegetation especially in our urban areas. They not only provide shade and oxygen but also sequester carbon from the atmosphere reducing ambient air temperature and minimizing global warming. When trees are cut, this sequestered carbon is released back into the atmosphere contributing to increased emissions and global warming. Cutting of trees also results in habitat loss. Permission required According to the Indian Forest Act it is required to take permission to cut trees even within one’s premises. However, the act also leaves it up to each state to formulate its own rules and regulations against felling of trees. Some states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have been progressive in implementing tree preservation acts and regulations. The State of Maharashtra has recently amended its ‘Urban Areas Protection and Preservation of Trees Act’ to classify 50-year-old trees as heritage, tighten the rules for cutting of trees for development works and increase the number of trees to be planted in place of a cut tree. The planted trees need to be 6-8 feet in height and the survival of such trees should be ensured by geo-tagging. Afforestation project In Tamil Nadu, multiple environmentalists and non-governmental organisations have been trying to bring in stringent urban tree preservation policies. Recently the Tamil Nadu government had launched a very ambitious afforestation project to increase forest cover across the State by the year 2030. Such initiatives are good of course, but without stringent laws to protect our already existing tree cover that would have been formed over decades of growth, are of little value. Considering the rate of urbanisation, it is imperative that stringent laws be formed and enforced in our cities to comprehensively protect existing trees. It is also equally important that plot developers and owners see existing trees as assets that result in increased land value. In fact, plots with existing trees should command a higher price than ones without, considering the benefits they bring such as improved ground water quality, better air quality, visual relief from the built urban scape and much needed shade, thereby resulting in enhanced quality of life for the occupants.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:47 IST,||Emerging trends in office space industry||Every vertical of the Indian real estate sector, be it the office spaces industry or residential home buying, faced severe headwinds during the pandemic. However, the year 2021 has displayed a fantastic resurgence and some motivating trends for the office space industry. According to a recent report by real estate research firm Colliers, renewals for office spaces accounted for over 30% of the total leasing during a 15-month period. As the office spaces industry is looking at a robust revival, the following trends are likely to remain buoyant. Hybrid work schedules Several companies across the globe had asked their work force to work from home and increasing number of people now want a mixture of working from home and going back to the workplace. As highlighted in a survey by Prudential, “68% of global workers now prefer a hybrid workplace model where there exists a flexibility to work outside the office occasionally.” From the cost-saving perspective, both organisations and employees have saved a great deal of expenses from the hybrid model. In the post-pandemic world, a mix of office and work from home arrangements are going to be an omnipresent trend. Co-working spaces The co-working office spaces industry is set to witness a 20-30% hike in seat absorption. The robust IT sector of India will be at the forefront of this rising demand. As the cost of operating in India is lower as compared to other markets, the demand will see a strong revival in the post-pandemic 2022. Moreover, the demand for flexible spaces has been at an all-time high from start-ups as they are moving cautiously and want to save cost in the backdrop of a dismal year in terms of business. In addition to this, established corporates are expanding to the Tier II, and Tier III cities and hence, 2022 will see a rise in demand for flexible office spaces. Tech-enabled environs The World Economic Forum (WEF) believes that in the post-pandemic year 2022, the office spaces will be highly tech-enabled. The AI (Artificial Intelligence) assisted job roles, and office environment will be a common sight. The usage of sensor-based dispensers, adaptive technologies and robotics will be preferred in the minimal touch inspired new normal. AI in offices will primarily be used for repetitive tasks and will let the humans focus on creativity, imagination, and the strategic part. While technology will help the office occupiers, it will also help the operators in saving a significant cost. Retrofitting and repurposing As the year that went by was tough on the business and finances, large corporates and start-ups are focussing on repurposing and redesigning the office spaces they already occupy. The judicious use of available spaces and retrofitting of properties will be a trend in the coming year. The alternative use of the existing spaces to maximise value will be a trend in large as well as small companies. The role of interior designers and architects will play a major role in office spaces optimisation going forward. Moreover, uncertainties attached with the new variants of the coronavirus is also leading the companies to tread cautiously in terms of investment in new office spaces. Open sustainable spaces The year 2022 is expected to witness offices spaces with a lot of open spaces and natural touch. As the pandemic has shifted the focus on social distancing and a healthy work environment, the offices will be duly ventilated. Use of sustainable materials such as bamboo, installation of indoor plants, efficient air conditioning and social distancing will be ensured at all costs. The use of tech-enabled and minimal touch equipment will be in vogue. Incidentally, sensing the trend of ultra-hygienic office spaces in 2022, the large co-working players have already put in place the world-class sanitisation mechanisms and technology backed office spaces. Flexible lease terms The pre-pandemic lease terms were infamous for rigid terms and conditions and non-flexible payment plans. However, the pandemic has altered the way the world works, so has the working style of lease providers. The professional office spaces will now be available at flexible and negotiable lease arrangements. As the uncertainties are still to fade away completely, the corporates prefer a no-strings-attached relationship. The icing on the cake is that the relaxed lease terms are coupled with flexible or deferred payment plans. This kind of arrangement is a win-win for both the businesses and the operators. The year 2022 will witness a change in the way leases and rentals work. Focus on mental wellbeing The Coronavirus pandemic was a blow to the physical as well as mental wellbeing of the working class. In the gradual opening of the workplaces and office spaces, the corporates are ensuring that the workers are mentally fit and sound. This is leading to the provision of recreational facilities, gym, play areas and food joints in the office spaces so that the employees do not get stressed and feel burnt out. Moreover, the offices are being redesigned in such a way that lets the workers feel at ease. This will be a widely seen trend in the office spaces industry in 2022. Conclusively, with companies planning a comeback to offices in 2022, the office spaces industry has adapted to the new normal. The high-density offices are a thing of the past, and the new format will cater to the changing preferences of the workforce in a more open environment. The office spaces industry has learnt a great deal from the pandemic, and the strategies for 2022 will be heavily impacted by the lessons learnt. The writer is MD, Avanta India.

29 January 2022||January 29 2022 03:47 IST,||Pre-Budget expectations from the real estate sector||The real estate sector in India is one of the country’s economic cornerstones, and it is the country’s second-largest business generator after agriculture, with more than 230 affiliated businesses. Despite disruptions and market upheavals during the pandemic, the real estate sector has achieved a remarkable recovery. The recovery will continue in the coming years as well. The industry has developed into a buyer’s market, and today’s buyers are focusing on tailored offers to make the best investment selections possible. Expected growth According to reports, when compared to 2019, the sale of housing units fell by 60% in 2020, with only 1.38 lakh units being sold. Between July 2021 and September 2021, however, the real estate market had a robust rebound. Further growth is expected, but nothing can be predicted now that the third wave of Omicron variant is wreaking havoc across the county lately. The nation’s real estate sector is pinning its hopes yet again on this year’s budget for some more relief in the measures. The sector has reasonable expectations from the Budget 2022, given that it contributes more than 8% to the Indian GDP. However, this year real estate sector’s budget wish list might not be long this year. Furthermore, a combination of positive factors such as low home loan interest rates, customer-centric regulation, affordable property prices, developer options on new products, and payment flexibility has motivated even those on the fence to buy sooner rather than later. Lockdowns and limitations With an increase in COVID-19 cases due to the new Omicron variant, India’s economic recovery could be threatened once more. As a result of the lockdowns and limitations imposed by numerous states to regulate the COVID-19 cases, the real estate sector expects the government to increase capital spending to give the economy a boost. The government should give a boost by providing more exemptions to end consumers who are driving affordable housing purchases. The government can enhance the tax deduction for principal repayment on house loans under Section 80C of the Internal Revenue Code. It should also concentrate on providing unique incentives to real estate building laborers. Realtors have been pushing for the sector to be given infrastructure status for a long time. It will undoubtedly aid in the development of industry liquidity and the determination of supply-side costs. The Union Budget this year can play a supporting role in the real estate sector, by offering some key relaxations in taxes and waivers, reductions on GSTs on raw materials. As the sector is one of the biggest contributors to the nation’s GDP, strengthening the sector will also boost the allied economic activities, thereby bringing a positive turnout to the economy as a whole. We would expect the focus to be on providing a push to both affordable and rental housing to accommodate the rising demand in the housing sector due to the pandemic-induced change in home buying preferences. Hopefully the long due of giving the sector infrastructure status will help in building liquidity in the sector. The recent performance of the residential sector, along with good execution, are important indicators that the current momentum in home buying will continue in the near future. The real estate business is roaring back thanks to pent-up demand, an uptick in the job market, the widespread use of vaccines, and decreasing infection rates.

Home Purchase Affordability Index indicates that between 2013 and 2021, affordability increased consistently across key Indian cities, making home purchase more conducive. Housing affordability is the ratio of the annual median family income to the annual necessary income.Earlier, the average cost of buying a home used to be equal to seven years of the home seekers’ income, which has now reduced to between five years. With steady economic recovery, resumption of sectoral activities, fresh hiring gaining momentum, and festive bonanza played a catalyst role fueling home buying. The uptick in sales velocity and record high property registrations coins in with home affordability scenario. The most expensive city of Mumbai has witnessed a noticeable rise in home affordability index in the last few years.The interplay between property price, income and mortgage rates impacts the ability of a household to afford a home purchase. Demand stimulus Indian Property market was ailing from slowdown, subdued demand, muted investment, and liquidity crisis for a while now. The COVID pandemic didn’t spare real estate sector unscathed from its menace; it acted as a demand stimulus by underpinning the value of owning a house. The value of own safe nest triggered a sense of stability and security it offers in volatile market cycles. It induced long-time renters to enter the home-buying zone and current homeowners took plunge to upgrade to a better and larger apartment with new normal lifestyle. FavorableHome Affordability Index is outcome of multiple factors like price rationalisation, interest rates are accommodative and decadal low, low-cost credit for home-buying, customised payment flexi plans, low EMI, bouquet of services offered by banking and non-banking financial institutionsignificantly impacting ‘affordability’. Especially since a majority of home-buying in India, a whopping 90%, happens with a mortgage as per media. Fresh hiring India’s GDP growth curve is on upward curve, with fresh hiring on spree, employment generation, restoration of pay cut as business operations gains traction, and vaccination drive catching up in the backdrop, bringing life and economy to normalcy. The year-on-year average consumer inflation index also shows a positive effect. As consumer confidence index rebounds, home-buying demand hastaken offto new heights with a large number of actual home buyers entering the property market. Investment from the domestic as well as international NRI investors have been garnering momentum. It marks an ideal time for investors and end users to buy house in India. COVID crisis has ingrained the fact that need for home is perennial and this will lead to sustainable home-buying demand. Increase demand has resulted in dip of an overhang unsold stock. The unsold inventory levels have dropped from 5 years to 1.5 years, which nudge developers to gear up for new project launches. Demand for ready-to-move-in has been preferred, but fence sitters are closing transactions in under-construction projects from branded developers. Trend of market consolidation gives a cutting edge to organised branded players to widen its market share across micro markets and housing segments. The market witnesses spike in demand for mid and luxury housing in the wake of upgradation to spacious apartments in a community living township with ample social and civic amenities. Location with ease of connectivity is a prime factor for demand generation and a slew of mega infrastructure projects in the pipeline will script the growth story of real estate landscape. Media reports suggest that home loan rates have started stabilising and home prices have bottomed out; so, the affordability aspect may get impacted. This is a point for home seekers to note — they should take the decision and buy their home before the market scenario transit.
