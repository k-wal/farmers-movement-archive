The leaders also spoke at length about concerns over Afghanistan, sharing the “same concerns and same objectives” in broader terms and agreed to setting up a Joint Working Group (JWG) of senior officials, said Reenat Sandhu, Secretary (West) in the Ministry of External Affairs, listing those concerns as the need for immediate humanitarian assistance, ensuring the formation of a truly representative and inclusive government, combating terrorism and drug trafficking, and preserving the rights of women, children and minorities. Mr. Modi tweeted that all countries at the summit were “concerned about the developments in Afghanistan”. “In this context, our mutual cooperation has become even more important for regional security and stability,” he said. More meetings proposed Mr. Modi also proposed a number of high-level exchanges between the two sides, including biannual summits and annual meetings of the Foreign, Trade and Cultural Ministers and Secretaries of Security (National Security Advisers) to “strengthen cooperation in the areas of political and development, partnership, trade and connectivity, culture and tourism and security”, the officials said, adding that these proposals were accepted, along with a plan to build a “Central Asia Centre” in New Delhi. They also announced two “Joint Working Groups” on Afghanistan and the Chabahar port project. “Further development of mutual connectivity is essential for enhanced trade and commerce between India and Central Asian countries in the context of their landlocked nature and lack of overland connectivity with India,” said the “Delhi Declaration” joint statement issued at the end of the 90-minute summit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/central-asia-meet-forms-afghan-group/article64991621.ece

The airline has been a public sector undertaking from 1953. “We are excited to have Air India back in the Tata Group and are committed to making this a world-class airline. I warmly welcome all the employees of Air India to our Group and look forward to working together,” N. Chandresekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons, said. Earlier, he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The transaction covers Air India, Air India Express and the government’s entire 50% stake in a joint-venture ground handling company AI SATS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/air-india-back-in-tata-group-hangar/article64991623.ece

He appeared to be referring to comments from Washington ahead of the 14th round of talks between Indian and Chinese military commanders earlier this month saying the U.S. was “closely monitoring” the situation and that it was concerned about Beijing’s “destabilising” behaviour and “attempt to intimidate its neighbours”. “Some people on the U.S. side like to use the word ‘coercion’ but they do not know that the U.S. is the originator and master of ‘coercive diplomacy’,” Col. Wu said, adding that China was “firmly opposed to the U.S. engaging in ‘coercive diplomacy’ with other countries”. “China will work together with the Indian side to continue to properly deal with the border issue through negotiations,” he added. The PLA spokesperson described the 14th round of talks as “positive and constructive”. He referred to the joint statement put out by both sides after the talks agreeing to “stay in close contact and maintain dialogue” to work out a “mutually acceptable resolution” of remaining issues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). While there was no agreement to disengage in the three remaining areas of difference — the focus of the 14th round was Hot Springs, where both sides are thought to be close to agreeing on a plan to disengage, while differences in Demchok and Depsang are more pronounced with the prospects of an early resolution unlikely — the joint statement struck a more positive note than the previous round, when both sides traded accusations and failed to issue a joint statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/not-for-third-party-in-lac-talks-china-tells-us/article64991626.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:52 IST,||New districts plan backed by in-depth study: official||Andhra Pradesh State Development and Planning Society (AP-SDPS) CEO and ex-officio Secretary (Planning) G.Srkr. Vijay Kumar has said that the government has done an in-depth study of a variety of geographical, demographic, logistical and socio-cultural factors and the people’s sentiments before taking the decision to create 13 new districts. Addressing mediapersons at the office of SDPS, along with its Director K. Siva Shankar Rao, here on Thursday, he said it was in tune with the State government’s concept of “decentralisation and inclusive development” which was being given effect, keeping in view the fact that after the mandals and revenue divisions, people looked up to the district headquarters as the places where issues related to development could be sorted out at the higher level and have their grievances redressed. Providing easier access to the government authorities and realising the growth potential of the districts were the main intentions, he pointed out. Mr. Vijay Kumar said a high-level committee led by Chief Secretary Sameer Sharma and subcommittees had thoroughly weighed the pros and cons and then reached the conclusion that new districts were in larger public interest. It had been resolved to have an Assembly constituency entirely in one district and at least two revenue divisions per district, three in some cases and to create 15 new revenue divisions and merge four divisions to as many existing ones. Two districts were carved out of the vast tribal belt that stretches from Sitampet (Srikakulam) to Polavaram (West Godavari) via Parvatipuram (Vizianagaram), Araku-Paderu (Visakhapatnam) and Maredumalli and Rampachodavaram (both in East Godavari). Each one of the 26 districts would have an average population of 20 lakh as per the 2011 Census. Apart from the given factors, emphasis was laid on the historic aspects of each one of the districts. An effort had been made to strike a balance between the resources among the districts, Mr. Vijay Kumar said, adding that the government was open minded to sort out differences, if any, and give the new districts a tangible shape from the new financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/new-districts-concept-in-ap-backed-by-study/article64991627.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:24 IST,||Four more districts in State placed under Category C||Four more districts in Kerala have clamped down on gatherings and a range of recreational activities to slow down the accelerated spread of the suspected Omicron-driven COVID-19 surge. An online pandemic-monitoring committee meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan remotely from the U.S. on Thursday classified Idukki, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, and Kollam as Category C (Threshold 3). The committee relies on hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions as the points of reference or baseline for classifying districts into A (Threshold 1), B (Threshold 2) and C (Threshold 3) categories. Idukki is vulnerable given the relatively low number of hospitals and COVID-19 beds. Limited attendance As per the new calculus, the C grading entails limiting the number of persons at marriages, funerals and social events to a maximum of 20. It warrants a temporary ban on visitors at places of worship. Rituals and prayers could switch to cyberspace. The district authorities have ordered the closure of cinema halls, gymnasiums and swimming pools. The government had earlier classified Thiruvananthapuram, which reported a spurt in cases, as Category C. Category A, B districts The meeting rated Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Wayanad and Kannur district as Category B (Threshold 2). Malappuram and Kozhikode are in Category A (Threshold 1). So far the government has not accorded any rating to Kasaragod, where the virus spread appears within the safety threshold. The administration has opened a COVID-19 war room at the Secretariat here. It would monitor in real time the availability of COVID-19 beds, ICU beds, ventilators and supplementary oxygen cylinders. Mr. Vijayan told the meeting to anticipate a surge in hospital administrations. He ordered the opening of more first-line treatment centres. Local self-governments should form committees at the ward level to monitor the situation. If required, they should open community kitchens. He asked private and public sector hospitals to assign special kiosks for COVID-19 positive dialysis patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/four-more-districts-in-state-placed-under-category-c/article64991737.ece

At the weekly briefing, Lav Agarwal, Joint secretary, Health Ministry, said 10 States contributed to more than 77% of the total active cases in the country. Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu led the tally. 90% in home isolation Data released by the Ministry added that Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Odisha, Haryana and West Bengal were registering a steady decline in daily caseload, while Pune, Ernakulam and Nagpur were flagged as districts of concern. Also more than 90% of active cases are under home isolation at present — indicating mild to moderate clinical severity, Mr. Agarwal said. “A clear trend in terms of fewer COVID cases requiring oxygen-supported beds or ICU beds has been observed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/early-signs-of-a-flat-caseload-says-govt/article64991625.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:13 IST,||Budget session of Assembly likely from Feb. 4th week||The budget session of the Telangana Legislative Assembly is likely to start in February fourth week and continue till the end of third week of March. The government has lined up a series of programmes including the inauguration of statue of equality by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 5. Several dignitaries are scheduled to visit the venue at Muchintal in the next 10 days including President Ramnath Kovind on February 14. The event would be followed by the famous tribal fair, Medaram Jatara in the third week and there is a major event — inauguration of renovated Yadadri temple scheduled towards the end of March, keeping the administration busy for almost a week. The session, accordingly, is likely to start after culmination of Medaram Jatara and conclude before preparations start for the inauguration of Yadadri temple in a befitting manner. The budget session assumes significance as it will probably be the last full budget that will be presented by the current dispensation led by the TRS in its second tenure. With the term of the current elected Assembly scheduled to expire in December next year, the government is unlikely to present a full-fledged budget in March next year as it will have only nine months left for completing its full term. The size of the budget too is likely to be bigger as compared with this year when the total outlay is pegged at Rs. 2.3 lakh crore as the government has to be make provision for Dalit Bandhu, the ambitious scheme aimed at financial empowerment of dalit families with a grant of Rs. 10 lakh each to selected families. The government will have to make provision for the enhanced expenditure on account of the revised pay scales implemented to the employees. Expenditure on salaries/wages, according to estimates, crossed Rs. 26,000 crore this fiscal while that for pensions is in close to Rs. 11,000 crore. The government is liberally granting subsidies arising out of payment of social security pensions as well as for schemes like 24x7 free power to farmers. Expenditure on this account for the current year is estimated at Rs. 12,630 crore. This apart, the government had to put up with the burden on account of debt servicing which, for the current fiscal, is projected at Rs. 17,584.38 crore, according to the details available on the Comptroller and Auditor General of India’s website. Finance department officials are already working overtime to mobilise revenues for the existing schemes with open market borrowings in the form of State Development Loans being the main option for the resources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/budget-session-of-assembly-likely-from-feb-4th-week/article38337099.ece

The total number of infections has reached 4.03 crore, and the active cases have crossed the 33.5 lakh mark. The figures are based on the State bulletins released until 9.30 p.m. on Thursday. However, Ladakh, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Jharkhand and Lakshadweep had not yet released data for the day. Kerala recorded 51,739 infections on Thursday, followed by Karnataka (38,083) and Tamil Nadu (28,515). On Thursday, 596 deaths were recorded in India, considerably higher than the average levels recorded in the last week. The total number of recorded fatalities has reached 4,91,754. Kerala reported the most deaths with 153 fatalities (57 were from a backlog), followed by Tamil Nadu (53) and Karnataka recorded 49 deaths. On Wednesday, 14.6 lakh tests were conducted (the results for which were made available on Thursday). The test positivity rate (the number of cases detected per 100 tests) was 16.4%. As of Thursday, 91.9% of the eligible population has been vaccinated with at least one dose, while 68.4% have received both doses. In the 15-17 age cohort, 59.9% of the population have received their first dose. Altogether, 93,67,34,502 first doses, 69,72,07,423 second doses, and 98,74,345 booster doses have been administered across India. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has extended the COVID-19 guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act till February 28. Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said in a letter to States that due to the current COVID wave, led by the new variant, Omicron, there has been a steady increase in the number of COVID cases in the country and the active cases have increased to over 22 lakhs. “Though a majority of active cases are recovering fast and a low percentage of cases are in hospitals, it is still a matter of concern that 407 districts in 34 States and Union Territories are reporting a positivity rate of more than 10%. Therefore, looking at the current trends of COVID virus, there is a need to exercise caution and vigilance,” the letter said. States were asked to observe all precautions and not let the guard down. “Imposition and lifting of local curbs/restrictions should be dynamic and should be based on the case positivity and hospitalisation status at the local level,” the letter said. The Ministry said there should be continued focus on the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat, vaccination and adherence to COVID appropriate behaviour. State enforcement machinery have been told to strictly enforce norms such as wearing of masks and maintaining safe social distancing. Any misinformation on new variants of concern should be addressed immediately, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/24-lakh-fresh-covid-19-cases-reported/article64991591.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:53 IST,||Hundreds of students booked in Bihar over rail exam protest||The police have registered a complaint against six teachers of coaching institutes in Patna and hundreds of students across Bihar for their violent protests over a railway recruitment exam. Some student organisations, meanwhile, have called for a Bihar bandh on Tuesday to protest against alleged irregularities in the exam. An FIR has been lodged against teacher Faizal Khan, popularly known as “Khan Sir”, and five other teachers for allegedly inciting students to protest. Some of the teachers named in the complaint, however, said that they had appealed to the students to keep away from such protests, as damaging government property was a punishable act. “Still, the police booked us,” they said. Among the other teachers named in the complaint are S.K. Jha, Gagan Pratap and Gopal Verma. The police have also booked hundreds of unidentified students in Patna, Nawada, Bhojpur, Sitamarhi, Buxar, Muzaffarpur and other places where there were protests and railway property was allegedly damaged. In Jehanabad, protesting students burnt effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on railway tracks and raised slogans against the government. The angry protest of the students affected the movement of several trains under East Central Zone, causing inconvenience to passengers. Bandh call Meanwhile, the All Indian Students Union and other youth organisations have called for a Bihar bandh on January 28. The student bodies have also called the Railway Ministry’s move to form a committee to look into their concerns a “hoax”. Thousands of students gathered on railway tracks and at stations on January 25 to protest irregularities in the Railway Recruitment Board’s Non-Technical Popular Categories (RRB-NTPC) Exam, 2021. At some places such as Gaya, the protesting students set coaches of a train on fire and damaged railway property and were caned by the police personnel. About 1.25 crore students had applied for the exam that had advertised over 35,000 posts with initial salaries ranging from Rs. 19,900 to Rs. 35,400 a month. Around 60 lakh students had appeared for the exam. The angry students were protesting against a decision by the Railways to hold the exam in two stages. “The second stage of the exam is totally unfair to those who have cleared the first stage and for which results were released on January 15,” they said. The Railways has set up a high-powered committee to look into the grievances of protesting students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hundreds-of-students-booked-in-bihar-over-rail-exam-protest/article64991615.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:54 IST,||Akhilesh trying to build a strong caste alliance||The Samajwadi Party is banking on regional heavyweights across the board — from the OBC communities to Brahmins. Many on its latest list of 56 candidates for eastern Uttar Pradesh are BSP turncoats. The Akhilesh Yadav-led party has built a most formidable caste alliance in the region to challenge the BJP. At the centre of these efforts are Azamgarh and Ambedkar Nagar districts. In Azamgarh, where the SP won five out of 10 seats in 2017, the party has retained four sitting MLAs — veteran legislator Alam Badi, Sangram Yadav, Nafees Ahmad and Durga Prasad Yadav. Three other candidates from the district are former Lok Sabha member and Yadav strongman Ramakant Yadav, who is contesting from Phulpur Powai ; Kamlakant Rajbhar, son of the late Sukhdev Rajbhar, former BSP leader and Speaker of the Assembly, from Didarganj; and Bechai Saroj, former MLA, repeated for Lalganj. Nominees for three other seats are yet to be announced. Solid line-up In neighbouring Ambedkar Nagar, a traditional BSP bastion, the SP has an equally solid line-up of candidates: senior OBC leaders and sitting MLAs Lalji Verma in Katehari and Ram Achal Rajbhar in Akbarpur; senior Jatav leader and former MP Tribhuvan Dutt in Alapur and Rakesh Pandey, father of BSP MP Ritesh Pandey, from Jalalpur. Mr. Verma, Mr. Rajbhar and Mr. Dutt have had a long association with the BSP before they switched to the SP to boost its outreach among the non-Yadav castes. Mr. Pandey’s son Ritesh was the MLA from Jalalpur before he contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election and became an MP. The senior Mr. Pandey is also a former MP and a prominent Brahmin face in the region. In Ghosi in Mau, the SP has fielded Dara Singh Chauhan, who quit as Cabinet Minister recently. Mr. Chauhan, a BSP leader, had switched to the BJP in 2017 and contested from Madhuban, before moving to the SP recently. In Gorakhpur, the bastion of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the SP has named candidates for seven seats. They include Vinay Shankar Tiwari, the sitting BSP MLA from Chillupar and son of Brahmin strongman Hari Shankar Tiwari, who is often considered a challenger to Mr. Adityanath. By roping in the Tiwari family in the campaign against the Chief Minister, the SP hopes to exploit the tussle between Thakurs and Brahmins in the pilgrimage town and adjoining areas, since Mr. Adityanath was born into a Kshatriya family. The SP is, however, yet to name a candidate to take on Mr. Adityanath in Gorakhpur Sadar. Sizeable community The SP’s fresh list also includes Kajal Nishad, a Bhojpuri actor, who will contest from Campiyarganj in Gorakhpu,r while Amrendra Nishad, the son of Nishad stalwart Jamuna Prasad Nishad, has been fielded again from Pipraich in the same district. Nishads and other riverine castes form a sizeable community in the State. Other forward castes Former Assembly Speaker Mata Prasad Tiwari will contest from Itwa in Siddharthnagar, while another Brahmin leader Brahma Shankar Tripathi will fight from Pathardeva in Deoria.

The party had earlier changed seven of its declared candidates last week in west Uttar Pradesh. At Dhampur in Bijnor, the BSP has now fielded former Minister and three-time Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA Mool Chand Chauhan in place of Kamal Ahmad. Mr. Chauhan has been a Minister in both Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav governments in 2003 and 2012. In 2017, he had stood second in Dhampur. However, the SP this time fielded Naimul Hasan, a sitting MLA in Noorpur seat in the same district, from Dhampur, following which Mr. Chauhan shifted to the BSP. The Kundarki seat of Moradabad also witnessed shifting of equations after the sitting SP MLA Mohammad Rizwan, who is a three-time legislator, was dropped in place of Zia-ur-Rehman, the grandson of Sambhal MP Shafiqur-ur-Rehman Barq. In 2017, Zia-ur-Rehman had contested on the AIMIM symbol and stood third in Sambhal securing almost 50,000 votes. Mr. Rizwan has joined the BSP and is its new nominee in Kundarki. The BSP had earlier fielded Haji Chand Babu Malik for the seat. His supporters staged a protest after he was dropped. The BSP also announced its candidates for Nawabganj, Faridpur and Bareilly seats in Bareilly district and Dadraul in Shahjahanpur. So far, the party has announced candidates for 113 seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bsp-changes-two-more-candidates-in-up/article64991603.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:53 IST,||‘Growing threat to rights in India’||As part of a reflective celebration of India’s Republic Day, a Democratic Senator and three Democratic Congressmen expressed their concerns about democracy and human rights in India. The remarks were made at a Congressional briefing, Protecting India’s Pluralist Constitution, organised by the Hindus for Human Rights, the Indian American Muslim Council and 15 other organisations. Former Vice-President of India Hamid Ansari also delivered a video message at the event. Ed Markey, Senior Senator from Massachusetts, said that as the world’s largest democracy, India had for long been committed to universal human rights and the rule of law, but there were concerns now. “That commitment includes the protection of religious freedom and refraining from actions that limit the rights of minorities,” Mr. Markey said. Peeling back rights “That is why I remain concerned about Prime Minister Modi’s government’s efforts to peel back the rights of religious minorities in India. Laws on religious conversion, citizenship and other restrictive measures fly in the face of India’s inclusive secular constitution and core tenants of any democracy,” he said. Mr. Markey said that while honouring the strong ties between the two countries, the U.S. would continue to speak up when a fellow democracy was “unable to protect” all of its people. Rising intolerance Mr. Ansari also shared his concerns. “In recent years, we have experienced emergence of trends and practices that dispute the well-established principle of civic nationalism and interposes a new and imaginary practice of cultural nationalism … It seeks to present an electoral majority in the guise of a religious majority and monopolise political power. It wants to distinguish citizens on the basis of their faith, give vent to intolerance, insinuate otherness, and promote disquiet and insecurity,” he said. Mr. Ansari said these trends need to be contested both legally and politically. U.S. Congressman from Massachusetts, Jim McGovern, who co-chairs the bi-partisan Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, also spoke about the strength of the U.S.-India relationship and the need to speak up for human rights. He listed various concerns, including the linking of “citizenship to religious identity [the CAA].”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/growing-threat-to-rights-in-india/article64991609.ece

Ramana on Thursday said political leaders approaching courts seemed to be due to “election virus,” while dealing with an urgent request made by Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia to speedily list his appeal for anticipatory bail in a case registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Assembly elections are due soon in five States, including Punjab. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for Mr. Majithia, during the mentioning, said the case was one of political vendetta. HC dismissed appeal The Punjab and Haryana High Court had recently dismissed his plea for anticipatory bail. “I do not know if this is election fever or election virus. Everyone is rushing to the courts now,” the CJI addressed Mr. Rohatgi in a light-hearted manner. The court listed the case for January 31 and told the State not to take any coercive action against him till then. Senior advocate P. Chidambaram, for the State, said Mr. Majithia had gone into hiding. “Tell your State not to do anything. We are listing this on Monday,” the court addressed Mr. Chidambaram. NDPS Act Mr. Majithia was booked under the NDPS Act on December 20 last year and moved the High Court seeking anticipatory bail. The former Punjab Minister was booked under the NDPS Act on the basis of a 2018 report of a probe into a drugs racket operating in the State. Mr. Majithia was booked under Sections 25 (punishment for allowing one’s premises for its use for the commission of an offence), 27A (for financing sale, purchase, production, manufacture, possession, transportation, use or consumption, import and export or any act pertaining to narcotics) and 29 (abetting or plotting an offence) of the NDPS Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-breather-for-akali-leader-in-drugs-case/article38336587.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:55 IST,||Stir over Padma awards continues in Bengal||The controversy over the Padma awards refused to die down in West Bengal with two artists saying they have refused the awards. After former Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee issued a statement saying he would not accept the Padma Bhushan, legendary singer Sandhya Mukherjee and tabla maestro Anindo Chatterjee [also known as Anindya] have said they were approached by the Union Home Ministry for the Padma Shri honour but they refused it. The list for 2022 however did not contain their names. While the reason for Mr. Bhattacharjee’s refusal may be “political”, the two artists were of the opinion that the award was too late for them at this point of their career. The family members of nonagenarian singer Sandhya Mukherjee said Padma Shri for the artist was “humiliating”. She was informed over phone by the Central Ministry that she was going to be given the Padma Shri. “She is 90 and recorded her first song at the age of 12… at her age, to be awarded a Padma Shri for someone of her stature, we feel is nothing short of an insult. She has already refused it,” her daughter Soumi Sengupta said. Mr. Chatterjee too told journalists that the award has come too late. “I did not like the manner in which it was being conferred; so I said no to it.” Among those from the State who were conferred the honour are classical singer Rashid Khan and screen actor Victor Banerjee, who were awarded the Padma Bhushan. War of words The development has triggered a war of words between political parties. While the CPI(M) welcomed Mr. Bhattacharjee’s decision saying the party’s “policy has been consistent in declining such awards from the government”, the Trinamool Congress leadership said the Bharatiya Janata Party is trying to win over Left voters. “The recent rise of the BJP in the State is because of the support of the Left voters. The BJP leadership is trying to say that we have given Padma award to your leader so they should vote for BJP,” Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said. State BJP leaders said the Trinamool and the CPI(M) were inclined to see politics in everything, including the Padma awards. “There is always an attempt to portray that West Bengal is some place outside the country. The Communists have done that and now the TMC is doing that,” BJP national vice–president Dilip Ghosh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stir-over-padma-awards-continues-in-bengal/article64991590.ece

Announcing the decision, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted: “The @CDSCO_INDIA_INF has now upgraded the permission for Covaxin and Covishield from restricted use in emergency situations to normal new drug permission in the adult population with certain conditions.” The conditions set down by the DCGI include supply for programmatic settings including registration on the CoWin platform and continued submission of safety data on a six-monthly basis, the Minister added, referring to rules under the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019. Adverse events following immunisation will continue to be monitored. Conditional market authorisation is a new category of market authorisation that has emerged during the current global pandemic of COVID-19. The approval pathways through this route are fast-tracked with certain conditions to enhance the access to certain pharmaceuticals for meeting the emerging needs of drugs or vaccines, the Health Ministry explained. Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII) which manufactures Covishield said, “We are delighted to receive the conditional market authorisation for Covishield from the DCGI. With this, our focus should be to reduce the gap between the 2nd and the 3rd dose to six months, as it is done globally. Our objective must be to get the population fully vaccinated to curb the spread of the pandemic.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covishield-and-covaxin-get-conditional-market-approval/article64991595.ece

Both Mr. Channi and Mr. Sidhu told me that the biggest question in Punjab is who will lead the Congress party. And both have assured me that no matter who is declared the party’s chief ministerial candidate, they will support each other and fight the polls with all their might to ensure the party’s victory,” he said. “...we usually don’t announce the CM candidate but if the party workers and Punjab want it, then we will take a decision for you.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:54 IST,||U.P. polls will decide the future of the country, says Amit Shah||Raising the electoral pitch in the Brij region of Uttar Pradesh, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said in Mathura on Thursday that the upcoming Assembly election in the State was no ordinary election, as they would decide the future of the country. “Women in Mathura check their matki (pitcher) before buying by tapping it twice. Do check out whom you are voting for before casting your ballot,” said Mr. Shah after conducting a door-to-door campaign in the district where the party is facing a tough fight from the SP-RLD alliance and the BSP.   Mr. Shah said the upcoming election would decide what kind of ideology would govern the State. He said that before the BJP came to power, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party worked only for specific castes. “They never gave a road map for the composite development of the State and followed the policy of casteism, nepotism and appeasement.” It is only when the BJP governments came to power at the Centre and in the State, he said, that sabka saath, sabka vikas became a reality. Accusing the opposition parties of not being serious about national security, Mr. Shah said time had come for voters to choose between an individual or a party and the security of the country and the State. “They could not manage Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh,” he said and went on to describe U.P. as a sensitive border State as it shared a border with Nepal.  Citing the abrogation of Article 370, Mr. Shah said the party did not indulge in vote bank politics. “Those who said rivers of blood would flow if such a decision was taken are now surprised that not even a pebble has been hurled.” Describing construction of the Ram Temple and the Kashi-Vishwanath corridor as cultural nationalism, Mr. Shah said no party worked for the re-development of pilgrimage centres. He accused the SP of supporting criminal elements. “Azam Khan has committed so many crimes that the police ran out of sections of the Indian Penal code. The government has freed acres of land from the control of mafia. During the BJP rule crime rate had come down in the State,” he said.  “There has been a 70% drop in dacoities and cases of loot has come down by 72%. The number of murders has come down by 29%, murder and kidnapping by 35%. You have to decide whether you want a government that stands for development or goondaism ,” Mr. Shah said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-polls-will-decide-the-future-of-the-country-says-amit-shah/article64991602.ece

The organisations are the Tiwa Liberation Army (TLA) and the United Gorkha People’s Organisation (UGPO). Formed in 2014 to cater to the aspirations of the Tiwa community, the TLA was active in the Morigaon, Nagaon and West Karbi Anglong districts of central Assam. The UGPO, formed in 2007, was mostly active in the Bodoland Territorial Region and the Biswanath district. The two outfits had 246 members. Together, they deposited 277 assorted firearms, grenades and 720 rounds of ammunition. On the occasion, the Chief Minister also distributed a financial grant of Rs. 1.5 lakh each to 462 members of five other extremist groups who had surrendered earlier. These disbanded groups are the Rabha National Liberation Front, the Adivasi Dragon Fighters, the National Santhal Liberation Army, the National Liberation Front of Bengalis and the United People’s Revolutionary Front. “We are focussed on peace. Today’s surrender will go a long way in putting Assam on the road to more development,” the Chief Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/250-tiwa-gorkha-extremists-lay-down-arms/article64991592.ece

Separately, the Congress also urged the Centre not to cancel the earlier computer-based NTPC test as those who might have qualified to appear for the April-July 2020 exam might no longer be eligible if the exam was held all over again. Protests have erupted since Monday in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh over alleged discrepancies in the NTPC results declared earlier this month. While students blocked the railway track in Prayagraj on Tuesday, the protests to block rail routes turned violent in Bihar on Wednesday. “Youth who are preparing in Prayagraj told that they were beaten up after entering the lodges that are located a kilometre away from the protest site. This is sheer injustice. Strict action should be taken against those who torture students. Youth, in these elections, you decide ‘no job, no vote’,” Ms. Vadra tweeted along with a video of her interaction. “You are the next generation, future of U.P.. You should ask for your rights and seek accountability from them. You should ask them “what have you done for us?’ Ms. Vadra said in the video. Stressing that the Congress does not believe in any form of violence, party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate told reporters at a press conference that “the Congress is standing with the youth in their peaceful protests and for their just demands”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-slams-police-action-on-job-aspirants/article64991610.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:54 IST,||Woman tonsured and paraded in Delhi||A 20-year-old married woman was sexually assaulted, tonsured, publicly shamed and paraded with a blackened face and a garland of shoes around her neck in Shahdara on Wednesday. The horror unfolded in broad daylight at a spot barely 50 metres from a police booth. While the family of the woman claimed that the police reached the spot almost an hour and a half after a PCR call was made. The police however maintained that they rescued the victim within a few minutes of receiving the information. The woman was attacked over “personal enmity”, the police said. DCP (Shahdara) R. Sathiyasundaram said a case under different sections of the IPC, including gang rape, abduction and wrongful confinement, has been registered. Seven women have been arrested and two minors (all from the same family) have been apprehended in the case. The police are looking for more suspects. A senior police officer said the victim’s parents and the accused were neighbours and woman was in a relationship with a teenage boy belonging to the accused’s family. The boy killed himself in November last year and his family members blamed the woman for his death. Abducted outside home The accused abducted the woman from near her husband’s house in the Karkardooma area. They took her to their house and assaulted her in full public view. In some videos of the incident — recorded by the accused themselves — a group of women can be seen smearing black polish on the victim’s face, chopping off her hair and abusing her before parading her in the colony. People could be heard cheering and hooting while the woman was being violated.  Speaking to The Hindu , the victim’s 18-year-old sister said around 11 a.m., she had gone to her sister’s house, about a km away, to hand over some wheat. She suspects that the accused women were following her. “When my sister stepped out of her rented house, the women caught hold of her and forced her into an autorickshaw. I was so scared that I ran from there and reached my house,” the sister said, adding that she called the police for help immediately. The woman’s husband was informed by their house owner and he too called the police for help.   Recalling the events that led to the incident, the woman’s sister-in-law said both the families were opposed to the relationship between the victim and the teenager because they belonged to the same ‘ gotra ’. Three years ago, when the victim was still a minor, she was married off to another man and she now has a two-year-old son.  Her family said the now deceased teenager had been chasing the victim even after her marriage and they had complained about it to their community’s head, but to no avail. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir, National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma and DCW head Swati Maliwal were among those who condemned the incident and asked for strong action against the accused. “This is very shameful. How did the criminals get so much courage? I urge the Union Home Minister and the L-G to instruct the police to take strict action... Delhiites will not tolerate such heinous crime and criminals at any cost,” tweeted Mr. Kejriwal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/woman-tonsured-and-paraded-in-delhi/article64991597.ece

Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar slammed the BJP, questioning whether the party was trying to instigate riots in Mumbai. Ms. Pednekar released documents from 2001 and 2013 showing that BJP members were part of a decision that unanimously named roads in Mumbai after Tipu Sultan. Sena MP Sanjay Raut, while referring to Mr. Kovind’s speech at the 60th anniversary of the Karnataka Vidhan Soudha, said the President had said that Tipu Sultan was a historical warrior against the British. “Will the BJP now ask for the President’s resignation? They should come out and clarify,” he said. Congress leader Sachin Sawant, commenting on renaming a road as Shaheed Tipu Sultan Road which had been seconded by now BJP MLA Amit Satam, said, “Was this Tipu different from the Tipu that is being opposed by BJP now?.” Countering it, Mr. Satam said that he never supported any such proposal and his name was added later through forgery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tipu-sultan-row-sena-and-congress-slam-bjp/article38336623.ece

The government has a total disinvestment target of Rs. 1.75 lakh crore for the financial year 2021-22.

What were they doing for five years,” said Mr. Singh in Muzaffarnagar after conducting a door-to-door campaign for the RLD candidate in Budhana. In a show of strength, SP and RLD have decided to hold a joint press conference in Muzaffarnagar on Friday. The press conference will be attended by the presidents of both parties, RLD sources said. The SP has left 33 seats for RLD in west U.P. that will vote on February 10 and 14.  “The press conference has been called to clear the confusion the BJP’s leadership is trying to create in the region by making statements like the BJP’s doors are open for Jayant Chaudhary ji after polls,” said Sandeep Chaudhary, national spokesperson, RLD.  During the meet, he said, the party would remind people how Mr. Jayant Chaudhary was lathi-charged in Hathras and how farmers who constitute the RLD’s cadre vote were crushed in Lakhimpur Kheri. “We were called names. Our dignity and self respect has been crushed. Through the vote, we will try to regain it,” Mr. Sandeep Chaudhary said. He said those who participated in Wednesday’s meeting in Delhi were workers of the BJP and did not represent any community.  “The BJP gave their workers the names of Jat leaders. Top leaders of the Jat Mahasabha and khap leaders didn’t attend the meeting,” he said. Mr. Sandeep Chaudhary said it was reprehensible that the ruling party was dividing farmers on the basis of caste and religion.  He said Mr. Shah should have spoken to farmers on the promise of doubling their income during his Kairana visit. “Instead, he indulged in divisive politics,” Mr. Sandeep Chaudhary said.  He said the party leadership had made it clear that it did not want to get into the politics of Hindus and Muslims. “Jayant ji had clearly told party workers that he would prefer to stay at home than do politics over Hindus and Muslims.”  He admitted there were issues over ticket distribution for two or three seats but, unlike the BJP, nobody had left the party. Meanwhile, U.P. Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya tweeted that people could not forget the SP’s rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sp-rld-play-down-bjps-meet-with-jat-delegates/article64991604.ece

Now it is time for them to claim their rightful share of the kingdom. But Duryodhana is determined that the Pandavas should not get even an inch of land to call their own. Yet, Yudhishthira is reluctant to wage war against his cousins. So he requests Krishna to go to the Kauravas as a messenger of the Pandavas, and to negotiate on their behalf. Krishna stays with Vidura and then goes to the Kaurava court. When Krishna enters the court, His effulgence makes everyone else appear dull, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. Bhishma and the others stand up and welcome Krishna. When Krishna speaks, His voice is like the sound of the musical instrument known as dundubhi .  Krishna says that Duryodhana and Karna are responsible for the relationship between the cousins to have soured to this extent. If war breaks out, they are to blame. Krishna says that He is known as the all powerful One. This being the case, if He does not make attempts to stop the war, then people will question Him. That is why He has come to meet Duryodhana. Addressing Dhritarashtra, Krishna says, “ Neither the Kaurvaas nor the Pandavas should suffer. So, I request you to ensure there is no war. Yours is a great dynasty. There have been many great kings in this clan. Your sons operate against dharma. They are greedy. Whereas, the Pandavas are patient. In fact, they will even protect you, if need arises. Your subjects will die if there is a war. Should many die because of your sons? I have warned you of the consequences of your sons’ actions. Now, you think about it, and make the right decision.” But Dhritarashtra, unfortunately, does not take the right decision, and lets his sons do as they please.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/advice-to-dhritarashtra/article38336628.ece

Mr. Naqvi said the “madness for Prime Minister Narendra Modi bashing is turning into a conspiracy for India bashing”. “People who used to exploit minority votes are now anxious about the prevailing positive environment in the country,” the Minister said. “Our cultural nationalism is our constitutional commitment,” Mr. Naqvi added. “Yesterday when the country was celebrating Republic Day, and unfurled the tricolour at Srinagar’s Lal Chowk, at that time, someone who occupied a constitutional post was speaking at a platform provided by an organisation that has worked against our country and has a link to the ISI, to criticise the country,” Mr. Naqvi said. Priyal Bharadwaj, vice-president of BJP’s Mahila Morcha, said, “The fact that Hindus can be happy in their own country becomes intolerable for the ‘seculars’. Over years they distinguished and cultivated their ‘vote banks’ for the purpose of appeasement, at the cost of majority.

The decision will give a boost to fruit-based wineries which provide additional income to farmers and wine producers in the State,” said Minister for Skill Development Nawab Malik after a meeting of the State Cabinet. A statement from the Chief Minister's Office said “shelf-in-shop” method will be adopted in supermarkets and walk-in-stores which have area of 100 sq mt or more and which are registered under the Maharashtra Shops and Establishments Act. Supermarkets will have to be pay a fee of Rs. 5,000 for selling wine. However supermarkets which are close to places of worship or educational institutions cannot sell wine. Further, sale of wine will not be allowed in the districts where prohibition is in force. As per the existing policy in the State, wine bottles can be sold only in approved liquor stores. Under the new policy, the State government will charge Rs. 10 as excise duty per bulk litre production on all types of wine bottles. According to data, the wine industry has a turnover of around Rs. 1,000 crore in India, of which Maharashtra’s share is 65%. The industry is largely concentrated in Nasik, followed by Sangli, and Pune.  Criticising the decision, Bharatiya Janata Party leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “We will not allow Maharashtra to become a Madya-rashtra (liquor state).”  BJP MLA Ashish Shelar asked whether the State government now plans to supply liquor via taps.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 04:06 IST,TAMIL NADU||Action plan to protect city from climate change||Chennai’s trysts with monsoon are often volatile and determine the abundance or scarcity of resources the following year. In a concerted effort to protect the city from the vicious cycle of flood and drought, the Water Resources Department is preparing a comprehensive action plan for better water management and reducing the impact of climate change-related natural calamities on the city. Last year, nearly 32 tmcft of surplus water was released from the Poondi reservoir alone following heavy inflow and only 15-20% of the resources were conserved due to lack of sufficient storage facilities. In 2020, 20 tmcft of water was discharged from the reservoir during monsoon. “We are chalking out project proposals under the ‘Chennai City Water Supply Augmentation, Flood Mitigation and Resilient to Climate Change’. We are considering about 900 proposals. This will be an attempt to address different challenges in making the city self-reliant in water supply and provide nature-based long-term solutions in the city’s river basins, including the Adyar, the Kovalam and the Kosathalaiyar,” said an official. If the projects are executed, nearly 22 tmcft of additional water can be conserved. Among the various strategies are conservation of floodwater runoff with new reservoirs and revival of nearly extinct or long neglected waterbodies and climate adaptive measures. Given the change in weather pattern, including increase in intense rains in short spells, the department plans to revive waterbodies in the Chennai metropolitan area. “Many of these are affected by encroachments and rapid urbanisation. We plan to identify such lakes that act as an ecological balance in boosting groundwater and reduce localised waterlogging,” the official said. Kolathur lake is a fine example of highly encroached and exploited waterbody that had scope for rejuvenation. Similarly, lakes in Rajakilpakkam, Arabatheri near Avadi and Puthagaram near Ambattur, are not used for irrigation or drinking water needs. “We will have to revive the vanishing supply and surplus water channels to sustain restoration of such lakes,” the official said. In a bid to conserve runoff water, there are plans to create new reservoirs in the catchment areas of the city’s basins. For instance, Ramanjeri, upstream of Poondi, and Nemam, above Chembarambakkam reservoir, are being considered to be developed as storage facilities. Besides deepening the lakes in Thiruninravur, Sriperumbudur and Pillaipakkam, feasibility study would have to be initiated for intra-Basin transfer of floodwater. Transfer of surplus water from catchment areas near Oragadam in the Adyar Basin to the Palar through Neenjal Maduvu and feed surrounding lakes is one of the proposals. The department is planning climate adaptive remodeling of waterbodies. Flood regulators would be constructed in lakes such as Porur to transfer or discharge existing water to prepare the waterbodies for sudden and heavy inflow during rains. “Siltation remains a major challenge that has reduced storage capacity of lakes. Afforestation in catchment and foreshore areas is planned to reduce silt deposits. Silt traps or trenches of masonry or rubble structure will be built in the river beds or lake beds to trap the silt carried by floodwater,” said an official. The department plans to submit the proposals to the State government for studies to be taken up for feasibility of the projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/action-plan-to-protect-city-from-climate-change/article64991920.ece

Palaniswami, on Thursday urged the State government not to insist on the implementation of paddy procurement through online registration in view of difficulties being faced by farmers in following the new system of registration for procurement. In a statement, he said the farmers were not familiar with the online registration, for which they had to seek help from others. Besides, the process required authentication by officials of the Revenue department. All this had contributed a sense of fear among the agriculturists that the harvested paddy would go waste or had to be sold to intermediaries at rock bottom prices. There was an estimate that by the end of February, the direct purchase centres (DPCs) would witness the arrival of 30 lakh tonnes. To overcome the problem, the government should open more DPCs; follow the conventional system of procurement; keep enough stock oftarpaulin sheets,gunny bags and juteand employ manpower in adequate strength, Mr Palaniswami added. In a separate statement, the party’s former interim general secretary, V.K. Sasikala, said there were reports of small farmers not being ableto havethe registration doneon account of their details of landholdings, which were not allowed by the online system. There was also apprehension that the DMK government, through its measures, was not keen on the paddy procurement. In another development, deploring the move of the Sri Lankan authorities to auction impounded fishing boats belonging to fishermen of Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK’s coordinator, O.

Sources said the shortlisted locations include Sriperumbudur, Parandur, Tiruporur and Mamallapuram. “It is not easy to finalise a site soon. We should take into account the land availability, the number and type of runways that can be constructed and other such issues. We have to see the distance from Tambaram Air Force Base too,” a source said. A source from the State government said, “We understand that the talk on this airport has been around for years now. But things are progressing now. We understand the economic and business potential that comes by setting up this airport.” Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu said the State government and TIDCO had requested Airports Authority of India (AAI) to send in a team to study the feasibility of the four locations. More than a decade ago, Sriperumbudur was identified as a suitable location. In 2019, the AIADMK government looked at Parandur and Mamandur following which the Airports Authority of India sent a team that conducted a pre-feasibility study and submitted a report to the State government. After that, Parandur was seen a favourable location and nearly 4,700 acres of land in villages nearby were chosen.

Ravi’s contention that school students in Tamil Nadu should not be deprived of knowledge of other Indian languages, Minister for Tamil Official Language and Culture Thangam Thennarasu on Thursday said the State government had been following the two-language policy since 1967. He also reiterated the State government’s request to the Governor to clear [for Presidential assent] the NEET exemption Bill, which was adopted by the Assembly in September last year. In a statement, Mr. Thennarasu referred to the address of the Governor on the occasion of Republic Day, and said his comments sounded as if he advocated a three-language policy in Tamil Nadu. “Those who are aware of the history of protests over language in Tamil Nadu would realise that ‘other Indian languages’ is just another terminology for pushing Hindi,” he said. Pointing out that in 1967, then Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai had announced that a two-language policy — Tamil and English — would be followed in the State, the Minister said that remained the Tamil Nadu government’s policy to this day. “I hope the Governor would realise that the two-language policy has not affected students from Tamil Nadu in any way when it comes to acquiring educational qualifications or holding major positions,” he said. In his address, the Governor had contended that “depriving our students of knowledge of other Indian languages is unfair to all”. He had also stated that the share of students from government schools in seats in government medical colleges was hardly 1% before the introduction of NEET. Maintaining that the 7.5% reservation for NEET-qualified government school students in medical admissions could help them overcome the NEET “discrimination” only “to some extent”, Mr. Thennarasu said this was only a “temporary solution” and reiterated that only an exemption for Tamil Nadu from the ambit of NEET could be a permanent solution. “The Bill adopted by the Tamil Nadu Assembly seeking exemption from NEET is pending for approval from the Governor. I hope the Governor would soon give his approval to the Bill and send it to the Union government,” Mr. Thennarasu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-govt-reiterates-stand-on-two-language-policy/article64991691.ece

Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu directed the Commissioner to join the virtual court from the office of a Special Government Pleader on Monday. They said the department ought not to have stopped the inquiry just because the police had taken up parallel investigation. The judges called for the case diary from Idol Wing-CID since it was reported that the police were unable to pin down the mastermind behind the theft since the crime was committed before 2004 whereas the First Information Report (FIR) was registered only in 2018 following a complaint lodged by Rangarajan Narasimhan of Srirangam. During the hearing of a writ petition filed by the complainant in 2018 and pending since then, State Public Prosecutor Hasan Mohammed Jinnah told the court that the Idol Wing CID had completed the probe except for recovering the original idol. Stating that 85 witnesses were examined so far, he said 90% of the investigation was over. Only a few more witnesses had to be examined and then the agency would file a final report before the court concerned within three to four months. Asked about the details of the probe conducted so far and whether anyone had been pinned down, the SPP said the needle of suspicion was pointing towards N. Thirumagal, the then Executive Officer of the temple. When the judges wanted to know whether the kingpin in the offence had been identified since the HR&CE official might have only aided the commission of the crime, the SPP replied in the negative. Invites judge’s ire “That aspect is still under investigation,” he said, prompting the ACJ to retort: “Then, what is the purpose of investigation. You are totally wasting time.” On his part, Mr. Narasimhan told the court that the police had not even enquired with him although he happened to be the complainant in the case. Similarly, the HR&CE department had discontinued its fact finding inquiry in 2019 citing COVID-19, he complained. He told the court that Ms. Tirumagal was now the Additional Commissioner of HR&CE department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-summons-hrce-commissioner-to-explain-delay-in-probe-into-peacock-idol-theft/article64991917.ece

Delivering the keynote address at the Confederation of Indian Industry’s event, ‘The India Finance Forum (TIFF) 2022’, he pointed out that the Indian banking system and debt market needed a lot of improvement. The 12th edition of TIFF was held virtually, on the theme: ‘Beyond Resilience: Turnaround & Transformation’. Mr. Rajan noted that the unsecured credit growth in India had been very poor, which was acting as a stumbling block, especially to social justice and equality and ensuring economic fairness. TheFinance Minister said he had made it a point to attend all State Level Bankers’ Committee meetings, and had sought data on the performance of each bank branch to get a sense of what was happening and take necessary action, if needed. Mr. Rajan also reaffirmed his point about closing the gap between the stated intent and the outcome. As an example, he pointed out that while the Union government and the RBI had announced various COVID-19 relief measures for MSMEs, there was a lack of awareness at the branch level. The Finance Minister reiterated the need for improving cooperative federalism, where the Union government sets the agenda and drives the vision, and needs the States and the local bodies to execute them, especially to reach the middle and the bottom of the pyramid. Mr. Rajan stressed the need for improving the administrative capability in government, citing the recent example of a shortage of IAS officers at the Central and State levels. He also underscored the need to improve the GST system. In her keynote address, Rupa Dutta, Principal Adviser, Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India, highlighted the various measures taken by the Centre during the pre-COVID and COVID period. “The government is focused on building world class industrial infrastructure. Next generation infrastructure is set to see an investment of $1.4 trillion in the coming years,” Ms. Dutta said.  While the Union government and the RBI have announced COVID relief measures for MSMEs, there is a lack of awareness at the branch level||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/states-must-work-closely-with-banking-sector-to-ensure-credit-flow-to-all/article38336986.ece

Besides, Mr. Palaniswami and party coordinator O. Panneerselvam have been, through their statements,bringing to the fore numerous issues including the Pongal gift hampers’ distribution and the liquor shops’ working. On the issue of gift hampers, the party has moved the High Court, seeking a probe by the CBI.

A paper in the International Journal of Scientific Study, that studied breakthrough infections after vaccination among diabetics in Chennai, has called for extensive research on the nature of these infections and how and why they are possible.  The article by V. Balaji et al , concluded in their study done at Dr. V. Balaji Dr. V. Seshiah Diabetes Care and Research Institute in Chennai, showed breakthrough infections occurring in patients with Type 2 diabetes.  Of 3,243 patients who stepped into hospital and were vaccinated (either completely or partially), Dr. Balaji says, over 1% reported being infected with COVID-19 after vaccination. Of this 1%, 11 patients had severe to critical illness and required hospitalisation. Mild to moderate infection was observed in 25 patients who were quarantined, and one person had no symptoms and an incidental test showed him to be COVID-19 positive. In those who were symptomatic, symptoms such as fever, cough, breathlessness, body pain and loss of smell and taste lasted between 4 and 10 days. The ability of the virus variants to escape vaccine-induced immunity and cause asymptomatic infection (allowing the infection to spread) or illness is a key concern, Dr. Balaji says. Multiple studies that have been done among vaccinated individuals getting breakthrough infections across the world, have been quoted in the paper. A critical aspect of pandemic management is preventing vaccine failures due to variants. “It is important to be aware of the mechanisms that allow variants to escape vaccine-induced immunity, so research is essential. In the meantime, public health measures such as mandatory mask wearing and hand washing remain essential for controlling outbreaks,” Dr. Balaji adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pay-attention-to-breakthrough-covid-19-infections-says-study/article38337229.ece

Some had prepared for the test on their own. On the first day of counselling for special categories, including the wards of ex-service personnel, eminent sportspersons and persons with disabilities, 88 seats were allotted. Of the 91 candidates called for counselling, as many as 71 were allotted MBBS seats and two opted for BDS. While 12 candidates chose to be wait-listed, three opted out. Another three candidates were absent. A few candidates with disabilities were hoping for a seat under the All India Quota in the college of their choice. Madline Jemimah R. (NEET score - 560), ranked 1st in the State in her category, chose Stanley Medical College, but under AIQ, she has chosen JIPMER, Puducherry. She prepared on her own for NEET, using NCERT books. “I got a lot of time to figure things out while I was at home,” she said. Al Aseena J., ranked 2nd with 417 marks, chose Madurai Medical College as it meant saving on hostel accommodation. A debilitating disease left her bed-ridden in 2020, and she underwent several surgeries. For a year, she prepared on her own for NEET, said the candidate, who needs an assistive device to walk. M. Brinda, who scored 548 and was allotted a seat in Madurai Medical College, had been preparing since she was in Class XI. “My teachers motivated me when I scored low marks in Physics,” she said. M. Kokilavani and A. Srinidhi became friends while waiting for the allotment order to join Kilpauk Medical College. Ms. Kokilavani, a first-generation student, is from a village in Tenkasi.

Such declaration is mandatory for even obtaining building plan approval, property tax assessment and securing electricity as well as drinking water connection. Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu ordered that those applying for layout approval must be made to submit the self-declaration. The judges said no registering authority should register documents in respect of land notified as waterbodies in revenue records as reflected in the government website Tamil Nilam. Officials in charge of granting layout approval, building plan approval, property tax assessment and providing water and electricity connections must conduct physical inspections, besides crosschecking the records, to ensure that the property concerned had not been classified as a waterbody, prepare an official note and make it part of the records, the Bench ordered. “Any public authority, official or other staff concerned, who is found to have granted or aided or abetted in granting approval for layout or building construction or assessment of property tax or electricity or water connection for a property located on waterbody or commits dereliction of duty by not protecting a waterbody from encroachment, shall be liable for disciplinary action and prosecution for offences relating to encroachment under criminal law,” the court warned. The directions were issued while disposing of a batch of public interest litigation petitions which complained of large scale encroachments on waterbodies in the State. The judges directed the Chief Secretary to complete survey of all waterbodies through Differential Global Positioning System and then remove all encroachments before March 31 this year. The officer was directed to file a compliance report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/registration-only-after-declaring-property-is-not-on-waterbody-hc/article64991914.ece

Widening of the Adyar and the Cooum to increase their carrying capacity and minimise flooding in surrounding areas is on the cards. For instance, the stretch of the Adyar between Tiruneermalai and Anakaputhur is only about 40 metres wide now. “We need a width of over 100 metres to reduce inundation in areas like Varadharajapuram and Mudichur. Missing links between lakes and rivers will be revived with new channels,” said an official. Moreover, flood protection wall along the vulnerable portion of river banks like Araniar and Kosasthalaiyar would be constructed to increase their carrying capacity wherever there is inadequate space for bund. This would help avoid breaches during the rainy season and illegal sand mining, officials said. Construction of check dams and barrages across the Palar at Padalam are one of the major proposals to retain surface water and boost groundwater reserves. The department plans to reconstruct check dams in areas such as Velliyur and Gerugampoondi across the Kosasthalaiyar that are defunct now. This would help augment groundwater recharge and create new well fields for Chennai water supply. Moreover, massive recharge wells and shafts would be sunk in river or tank beds for aquifer recharge. “We may opt for 40 metre dia recharge wells too. Such infiltration measures are also planned in low level areas to reduce waterlogging,” the official said. Besides flood regulators in streams, regulators at the tail-end of rivers may be proposed to arrest seawater intrusion in places like Sadayankuppam and Idayanchavadi, officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/flood-carrying-capacity-of-rivers-to-be-improved/article38336953.ece

The officer had one-and-a-half years of service left, and is likely to enter politics in Punjab, his home State.  A source told The Hindu that after considering his request for Voluntary Retirement from Service (VRS), the State government permitted the officer to do so with effect from the afternoon of January 27 under the proviso to rule 16 (2) of the All India Services (DCRB) Rules, 1958, “by waiving the three months’ notice period”.  In a letter to the Chief Minister, the officer said his conscience was being weighed upon by the “painful conditions” of his home State, and he was agonised by the lingering socio-economic stress and suffering of the unheard, the youth and the underprivileged. “At the same time, restraints of my service rules confine me from acting in solidarity with the causes espoused by my inner voice,” he said. The officer also said the Chief Minister had inspired him to emulate his laudable spirit and follow in his footsteps in serving one’s own people. ‘Dedicate his life’ All through his career, the officer said, his actions were guided by the teachings of Sikh gurus and the principles of ‘Babasaheb’ B.R. Ambedkar and ‘Periyar’ E.V. Ramasamy. He said he intended to return to Punjab and dedicate himself “full-time” in its service for the rest of his life.

A Division Bench of Justices Paresh Upadhyay and Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup rejected the writ appeals preferred by a group of non-government service candidates and upheld the validity of a judgment passed by Justice M. Dhandapani on January 19 in favour of the decision taken by the government. The judges, however, clarified that their verdict would apply only to the present academic year. They said it would not be appropriate for the court to interfere with the government’s decision at the present stage. Additional Advocate-General J. Ravindran and senior counsel P. Wilson, Isaac Mohanlal and E. Manoharan, representing various government in-service candidates, had contended that the incentive marks were awarded for postgraduate studies with the laudable objective of encouraging doctors to serve in remote and hilly areas. The AAG also said that the government had decided not to grant any incentive mark in postgraduate admissions for doctors serving in urban areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-dismisses-appeals-against-incentive-marks-for-government-doctors/article38336966.ece

Air quality An analysis of air quality data of cities,including Chennai, Coimbatore and Puducherry, by Greenpeace India has shown that the average pollution levels in these cities were much higher than the new WHO air quality guidelines. The study, which analyses data from the Central Pollution Control Board, indicates that air pollution was a public health crisis not only in north Indian cities but also in south Indian cities. Similarly, the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter that is 2.5 microns or less in size) has increasedby six to seven times inCoimbatore, andby four to five times inChennai and Puducherry. The levels arehigher thanthe World HealthOrganisation(WHO)revised standards but well within theNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Akanksha and Avinash Kumar Chanchal, the authors of the report, have called for a comprehensive, systemic and time-bound action to reduce the air pollution levels. Economic impact “If we don’t act now, these south Indian cities too are not far from cities like Delhi in terms of the health and economic impact of air pollution,” they said. The Greenpeace study has suggested various steps to reduce pollution levels, among which is the need for introduction of new NAAQS based on WHO air quality guidelines.Governments need to seek alternatives to burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry.It calls for establishment ofcar-free days or zones in cities toalleviate pollutionandillustrate that it is possible to travel about the city without private vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/air-pollution-level-in-chennai-coimbatore-higher-than-who-norms-greenpeace/article38337013.ece

Palaniswami, on Thursday urged the State government not to insist on the implementation of paddy procurement through online registration in view of difficulties being faced by farmers in following the new system of registration for procurement. In a statement, he said the farmers were not familiar with online registration, for which they had to seek help from others. Besides, the process required authentication by officials of the Revenue Department. All this had instilled a sense of fear among the agriculturists that the harvested paddy would go waste or had to be sold to intermediaries at rock bottom prices. There was an estimate that by the end of February, the direct purchase centres (DPCs) would witness the arrival of 30 lakh tonnes. To overcome the problem, the government should open more DPCs; follow the conventional system of procurement; keep enough stock of tarpaulin sheets, gunny bags and jute, and employ manpower in adequate strength, Mr. Palaniswami added. In a separate statement, the party’s former interim general secretary, V.K. Sasikala, said there were reports of small farmers not being ableto havethe registration doneon account of their details of landholdings, which were not allowed by the online system. There was also apprehension that the DMK government, through its measures,was notkeen on paddyprocurement. In another development, deploring the move of the Sri Lankan authorities to auction the impounded fishing boats belonging to fishermen of Tamil Nadu,the AIADMK’s coordinator, O. Panneerselvam,urged Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to exert sufficient pressure on the Central government and ensure that the boats were returned to the rightful owners.

Peter Alphonse said.  “We will wait and see what the court has to say on the case on Friday,” Mr. Alphonse told The Hindu .  He added that if the Commission received a complaint from any of the aggrieved parties - the Christian institution where the girl studied, or even the Christian community in general, against the targeted attack on them by the Tamil Nadu BJP, it would issue summons. With the Tamil Nadu BJP and its president K. Annamalai vociferously claiming that the girl died by suicide as she was being forced to convert to Christianity by the school authorities, Mr. Alphonse said this was a conspiracy by the BJP to sow religious hatred in Tamil Nadu. In another video, the veracity of which is being examined, the girl is heard saying she had resorted to the extreme step as she was unable to concentrate on her studies due to the daily chores she was being asked to carry out at the hostel.There is no mention of religious conversion. Mr. Alphonse said if it was found that the earlier video had been tampered with, and Mr. Annamalai had resorted to “creating religious hatred and divide using an edited video”, the panel would hold an inquiry. “But we will wait for the investigation to be completed,” he added. (Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State’s health helpline 104 and Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-trying-to-sow-religious-hatred-in-tn/article38336985.ece

In a memorandum to the Finance Minister, secretary of the organisation K. Kathirmathiyon said that according to the existing rules, encashment of accumulated leave at the time of retirement is fully exempted from Income Tax for Central and State government employees. However, this does not apply to employees of private sector, banks, insurance companies, public sector undertaking, etc. For these employees, the encashment of accumulated leave at the time of retirement is different and tax exemption is limited only for Rs. 3 lakh. Even the Rs. 3 lakh limit was fixed in 1998. For the last two decades or so, the limit was not revised for the private sector and PU employees. The government should revise the limit. There should be no discrimination between government and private sector employees for I-T exemption as all are salaried employees. Mr. Kathirmathiyon appealed to the Finance Minister to treat the government and non-government employees on a par for the exemption or increase the limit to Rs. 12.50 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consumer-organisation-seeks-i-t-exemption-for-leave-encashment/article38337001.ece

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the State government had a meeting on Thursday with the representatives of industry associations to discuss the measures needed to be taken to control cotton and yarn prices. The State government sought removal of 11 % import duty on cotton, removal of cotton from future trading, and the need to redefine the role of Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) to control cotton prices, according to a press release from the Tiruppur Exporters' Association. Raja M Shanmugham, president of the Association, said he requested the Finance Minister for support through Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) to MSMEs to meet their financial requirements. He also said the garmenting units were predominantly MSMEs. Since the orders are booked three to six months in advance, the units are unable to manage the sudden spurts in yarn prices. Hence, the government should not incentivise export of raw cotton and yarn to competing countries, should lift the import duty on cotton, should not permit trading of cotton on commodity exchanges, restore Interest Equalisation Scheme, and additional funds through schemes such as the ECLGS to the garment industry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/garment-units-seek-steps-to-control-input-prices/article38336990.ece

Hearing a batch of writ petitions on January 25, the bench comprising Justice V. Bharathidasan and Justice N. Sathish Kumar, said that precious lives of wild animals were lost between 2012 and 2021 due to high vehicular movements and the drivers of those vehicles were not adhering to speed limits. The District Road Safety Committee, Erode, issued a notification in Erode District Gazette (extraordinary) dated January 7, 2019 that banned vehicle movement on the stretch from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day. However, the order was implemented only for a few months after which all types of vehicles were plying without any restrictions, the court observed. Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden and Nihar Ranjan, Field Director, STR, told the court that banning movement of certain types of vehicles during night hours on the Mysore–Calicut Highway in the Nilgiris district that passes through Mudumalai Tiger Reserve prevented the death of wild animals. The court asked Su. Srinivasan, standing counsel for National Highways Authority of India, to get suitable instruction from authorities regarding the restriction of vehicle movement between Bannari and Dhimbam and posted the next hearing for January 28. The court also took note of the fact that the 25 km-road from Bannari to Thengumarahada that passes through the core tiger area has 30% of STR’s total tiger population. Since the area is also the breeding place for tigers and other wildlife animals, the court asked Collectors of the Nilgiris, Coimbatore and Erode districts to appear through video conference during the hearing on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-expresses-concern-over-death-of-152-wild-animals-on-bannari-dhimbam-stretch/article64991686.ece

A Division Bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and S. Srimathy were informed by the State that the police shooting range has been permanently closed since December 31, 2021, and it would not be used for shooting practice. Taking note of the submission, the judges closed a petition filed by Kavivarman alias Suresh Kanna, of Aranthangi in Pudukkottai. The petitioner, a district secretary of CPI(M), sought a direction to the authorities to close the shooting range in Narthamalai village. He said the shooting range in Pudukkottai was set up about 20 years ago, and It was mandatory for the duty officers-in-charge to ensure that necessary precautionary measures were followed before the start of shooting practice. Before commencing, the authorities should alert the nearby villagers by sounding an alarm, hoisting red flags or by informing the residents. Back in 2001, Murugesan, a person from a nearby village, was also injured by a stray bullet fired from the shooting range, Mr. Kavivarman said. The authorities failed to follow safety measures. No compensation was provided to Mr. Murugesan, and he had to spend from his own pockets for his medical treatment. The negligence on the part of the authorities had taken away the 11-year-old boy’s life in Narthamalai, he added. The authorities should have taken steps to shift the shooting range after the 2001 incident. But, they failed to do so, the petitioner said and sought a direction to the authorities to shift the shooting range from its present location to a remote place.  Back in 2001, Murugesan, a person from a nearby village, was also injured by a stray bullet fired from the shooting range Kavivarman District secretary, CPI(M)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pudukkottai-firing-range-has-been-permanently-closed/article64991684.ece

In 2017, the villagers had gathered in front of the Tasmac shop and demanded its closure. It was said that they had not obtained permission from the police to stage a protest. They caused hindrance to the public and traffic. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that the villagers had approached the officials in a peaceful manner and asked them to close the Tasmac shop as it affected the entire village. They did not disturb the public, it was submitted. Justice K. Murali Shankar took note of the fact that the villagers had not used criminal force with an intention to prevent or deter the Tasmac staff from discharging their duty. They had only assembled and conducted an agitation to shift the Tasmac shop. No doubt, prohibition is a policy matter to be decided by the government. But, at the same time, the policy of prohibition is a Constitutional mandate and the government is having greater responsibility to function in larger public interest, the judge observed. In the case on hand, the petitioners did not indulge in any act of violence. Considering the same, the court has no hesitation to hold that the proceedings pending on the file of the District Munsif / Judicial Magistrate court, Tirupattur is liable to be quashed, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/case-against-23-villagers-who-sought-closure-of-tasmac-shop-quashed/article64991710.ece

The sandy beach stretching to around 2 km has the potential to attract more tourists but regular visitors, especially city residents who throng the leisure spot on weekends, believe that the government should step in to provide safe access to the place and better amenities. Many complain that the roads, one starting at the Electricity Department office and the other a narrow lane in between Indira Gandhi Sports Complex and Petit Seminaire School at Uppalam, connecting Pondy Marina and town, are unsafe all through the day, not to speak of night hours. People consuming liquor along the sides of the roads leading to Pondy Marina has become a nuisance when one takes the family along for an evening outing, said Ratheesh Ramachandran, a resident of Reddiyarpalayam. “I have seen people sitting on either side of the roads leading to the Pondy Marina and drinking even at noon. It is very awkward when they pass lewd comments. Children and women get upset,” he said. Travelling to the beach after evening hours has become a nightmare due to poor lighting, he rued. According to A. Ashwin, a resident of Thattanchavady, though there are streetlights in the area, they are simply not adequate. “The roads towards Pondy Marina are not properly lit. If you are driving through the stretch with your family in a car, it is fine. Walking or travelling by a bike after sunset is a risky affair,” he said. Puducherry is a tourist destination and the government has to ensure safe spaces for all at newer popular hangouts in the city, he noted. The weekends get almost crowded with 25,000 to 30,000 people visiting the place. If it is a long weekend or festival time, the beach swells with local and domestic tourists, said a restaurateur. “Lack of safety is a problem that tourists complain of. Providing safe access to the spot for tourists should be the job of the government. Police patrol teams make routine rounds but that seems not enough to deter people fromindulging inmischiefs. We have been demanding a police outpost with adequate manpower. At present, if some incident occurswe have to wait fora long time forthe police to arrive,” he pointed out. Djeamourthy, a resident of Ellaipillaichavady, said the upkeep of the crematorium situated at Dubrayapet should also be a priority for the government. “The sidewalls of the crematorium are broken and children find it uncomfortable to travel along the route,” he said. Private promoters also want the government to depute trained lifeguards near the jetty. On the eve of the New Year celebrations, two students drowned while swimming. Lifeguards “We frantically tried to get lifeguards to save the children but our efforts went in vain,” said a promoter. He also sought setting up of more toilets as the existing facilities are getting inadequate due to the heavy rush.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pondy-marina-leaves-tourists-asking-for-facilities/article64991792.ece

She has been enrolled as a woman health volunteer under the Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam scheme, the DMK government’s programme to deliver essential healthcare at the doorstep of the people, in the district.  “The voluntary worker job at the PHC is a stop-gap measure for her. Paperwork is being done recommending her for middle-level health worker in the PHC to the DMS (Directorate of Medical Services) on compassionate grounds. Such inclusiveness will motivate other transgenders to excel in their life. In Ranipet district, we have around 200 transgenders,” Mr. Bhaskara Pandian, told The Hindu .  The 25-year-old Tamil Selvi became the first transperson to be admitted into a nursing programme in the State four years ago in 2018 after the SHRC directed the government to allot her a seat as a special case in the Diploma in Nursing course conducted by the Government Vellore Medical College for the academic year 2018-19. She completed her diploma course. Since then, she has been working as a health assistant in various hospitals and health centers as temporary staff. In fact, duringthe second wave of the pandemic last year (2021), she worked in the COVID-19 ward in Ranipet district for more than two months. “It is my dream to become a staff nurse in a hospital. I pursued the nursing course with passion. The voluntary worker job at the PHC in my village is a stepping stone for me to become a staff nurse,” said Ms. Tamil Selvi. Born in a poor family, Ms. Tamil Selvi lost her parents at an early age. She managed to study with the help of her relatives and well wishers in the government school at Walajah taluk securing 757 marks in her Plus Two board examinations nearly a decade ago in 2013. Later, she underwent a sex reassignment surgery in 2015 and decided to become a nurse. After repeated hurdles to enroll in the nursing course, she finally managed to secure a seat for the course at the Government Medical College Hospital in Vellore.In her new role as women health volunteer, she will screen those above 45 years of age and others with infirmities through routine door-to-door check-ups and detect non-communicable diseases that are also seen to cause sudden mortalities and impact the quality of life. Women public health workers, women health volunteers (WHVs), physiotherapists and nurses, who will provide healthcare at the doorstep, were being roped under the scheme. She would also screen high blood pressure and diabetes and monthly medicines for the patients at the door-step.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/day-after-her-plea-transgender-gets-health-volunteer-job-at-phc/article64991681.ece

Thereis no mention of religious conversion in the clip, which is being circulated on social media platforms. The latest clip appears to have been shot by an unidentified person while the girl was undergoing treatment at a hospital. The video begins with the girl being asked to disclose her name and the names of her parents. She says she used to be a topper in her class, but due to family circumstances, she joined her institution late this year. Due to this, the ‘sister’ used to ask the girl to write the accounts even after the latter said she could not understand anything. “Even when written correctly, the sister would make me sit for an hour, saying what I had written is wrong,” the girl says. As a result, she was unable to concentrate on her studies, and had been scoring less marks. She decided to resort to the extreme step as she felt she could not study if the situation continued. To a question, the girl says she was asked to do other choresby the warden, including opening and locking the gates and switching on the motor and checking it. To a query whether the school had asked her not to sport a bindi, the girl replies in the negative. Poor health She says she normally would have been asked to stay back and study, had she asked for permission to go to her villagefor the Pongal festival. However, this time, she was sent home due to her poor health. When asked whether they (apparently referring to the school) knew that she had attempted to end her life, the girl replies in the negative. She identifies the sister as Sahayamary. Police sources said the veracity of the fresh video was being ascertained. An inquiry was on to identity the person speaking with the girl in the video.

With one already located at Konakkarai, the new ones will be set up at Srirangam, Ariyamanagalam and Ponmalai zones.  Speaking to The Hindu , a senior official of the civic body said that tenders have been called for the three new ABCs and to expand the existing one at Konakkarai. “We have received several complaints that the population of street dogs in the city is increasing and we require a facility in each zone to control it,” he said.  The existing facility at Konakkarai can accommodate up to 100 dogs but can sterilise only around 20 to 25 per day as only one operation theatre was available. The limited space affected the drive, he added. Dogs were being caught at various parts of the city and sent to the centre at Konakkarai. The centre in the Srirangam zone would come up at Ambedkar Nagar, at Kottapattu in the Ponmalai zone and near the Ariyamangalam dump yard in Ariyamangalam zone. Once set up, each ABC will have the capacity to neuter around 30 dogs a day in each zone. Similar to the centre at Konakkarai, a not-for-profit organisation working to care for animals would be roped in to perform the sterilisations and care for the animals. A veterinary surgeon would be appointed at each centre and medical equipment would also be purchased. The Konakkarai centre would be expanded by creating more cages to hold the dogs. Special vehicles to transport the canines would also be purchased.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:38 IST,TAMIL NADU||Intense race for getting poll tickets in DMK||With the notification of urban civic polls, race for getting tickets for the coveted posts in urban local bodies is hotting up in the DMK as the ruling party cadre firmly believe that the battle of ballots this time would be a ‘cakewalk’ for them. Former Tirunelveli MLA N. Maalai Raja is in the race for the post of Tirunelveli Corporation Mayor as he has planned to contest in ward 1, 3 or 13. “After representing Tirunelveli Assembly constituency (in 2006), I seek an opportunity to serve the people again,” he said. When it was speculated that the mayoral post of Tirunelveli Corporation had been reserved for woman (general), Gogila Vaani, wife of former councillor of ward 4, Suresh was in the race. Even though the post is under General category, she is in the race while Mr. Suresh has submitted his application for ward 12. Former Tirunelveli MLA and son of former Mayor A.L. Subramanian, A.L.S. Lakshmanan, who lost the electoral battle to BJP’s Nainar Nagenthran in the last Assembly election, is likely to contest this urban civic poll with an eye on the post his father held. Former Speaker R. Avudaiyappan, who lost the battle of ballots to AIADMK candidate Esakki Subaya in Ambasamudram Assembly segment in last April, is reportedly in the race for the mayoral post. “He (Mr. Avudaiyappan) is contesting from Ambasamudram Assembly constituency since 1996 and has lost four of the six electoral battles. After suffering ‘hat-trick defeat’ in this constituency at the hands of AIADMK candidates since 2011, he is turning his eyes towards Tirunelveli Corporation Mayoral post either for him or for his son. We’ll oppose it tooth and nail,” said a DMK heavyweight here, who is aspiring for this post. Palayamkottai MLA and DMK’s Tirunelveli City district secretary M. Abdul Wahab said the party cadre were in upbeat about the upcoming civic polls and a good number of applications had been filed. “However, our party president will hand pick the mayoral candidate,” Mr. Wahab said. While the DMK is upbeat as the ruling party is hoping to repeat its victory it registered in the Assembly polls, similar poll effervescence could not be seen in the AIADMK which has lost power to the DMK. “The morale is really down … When we organised a preparatory meeting recently, only seven of the former (Tirunelveli Corporation) councillors participated in the meeting. A former councillor, who had submitted application for a ward in Thatchanallur zone, later withdrew it citing personal reasons even though it is not true. The party high command should infuse confidence which should cascade into every cadre,” said a senior office-bearer of the AIADMK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/intense-race-for-getting-poll-tickets-in-dmk/article38337058.ece

Officials, who were part of the operation, said that the forest staff had camped at Pongupalayam in the city outskirts on Wednesday evening following reported sightings of the carnivore in the locality. Later, the personnel received information that the leopard was found at a godown on the premises of a private garment company at Ammapalayam within the limits of Tiruppur City Police. The personnel rushed to Ammapalayam at around 9 a.m. to capture the leopard. In the meantime, it had attacked Rajendran (66), a security guard at the garment company, the officials said. While they succeeded in containing the carnivore initially, it managed to escape to an agriculture land in the vicinity within an hour. After locating the leopard, the teams commenced efforts to administer the tranquiliser darts. The officials said they roped in E. Vijayaraghavan, veterinary assistant surgeon with the Department of Animal Husbandry, who had previously collaborated with the Forest Department in various operations, to fire the tranquilliser darts. He was accompanied by A. Sukumar, Forest Veterinary Officer of Coimbatore Forest Division for the darting operation. During the confrontation with the leopard that lasted for nearly three hours, the leopard attacked two anti-poaching watchers, officials said. At around 1.30 p.m., Mr. Vijayaraghavan fired the first dart on the leopard at Ammapalayam. A second tranquilliser dart was also fired, following which the personnel physically restrained the big cat and placed it inside a cage. On January 24, the leopard attacked two men at a maize farm at Pappankulam village in Avinashi taluk in the morning and an anti-poaching watcher in the evening. A total of six persons (three residents and three anti-poaching watchers) suffered injuries after being attacked by the leopard in four days. Having escaped from the village, it was believed to have been prowling around in the outskirts of Tiruppur on Tuesday and Wednesday and managed to enter the city on Thursday.  Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle and Field Director of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) S. Ramasubramanian told The Hindu that the male leopard was around four years old and had no external injuries. It was found to be healthy and was released in the forest area of the ATR at Kadamparai near Valparai in Coimbatore district as per the directions of the Chief Wildlife Warden, he said.  “Our main aim was to prevent the public from getting injured,” he said, noting the darting operation was a “risky” one as the Ammapalayam locality was densely populated. While not ruling out the possibility that the leopard might have escaped from Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve in Erode district, Mr. Ramasubramanian said where the leopard came from is yet to be ascertained. “This could be a one-off incident,” he said on the leopard visiting Avinashi and Tiruppur, which are not located close to any forest area. The Forest Department will bear the treatment expenses of the anti-poaching watchers who were injured in the operation and they will be felicitated soon, Mr. Ramasubramanian said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/leopard-that-attacked-six-persons-near-avinashi-captured/article64991688.ece

She later reduced her demand to Rs. 60,000 and the complainant approached the DVAC, following which they laid a trap on Thursday afternoon. The sleuths caught Sivakami red-handed while accepting the bribe, according to the statement, following which she was booked under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and was arrested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kangeyam-tahsildar-held-on-graft-charges/article38337008.ece

Liquor bottles, plastic as well as household waste are being dumped in the water body indiscriminately, with little to no action being taken to stop the practice, local residents said. Due to the pollutants being dumped into the lake, water hyacinth has taken over most of the area, with the invasive species forming a thick carpet over the lake surface. Based on records uploaded to the ebird.org/India website, 42 species of birds have been recorded using the dam and artificial lake since 2014. Wildlife biologists said that though the effects of water hyacinth on aquatic and wetland bird species has not been studied in the area, it has been theorized that water hyacinth can impact water quality and limit open-water areas required by certain avian species. P.J. Vasanthan, a trustee of “Clean Coonoor,” an NGO which has helped clean up the Coonoor River, said that the Kattery Stream flows down from Ketti and joins the Coonoor River near Runnymede. “While there is little impact on water purity further downstream due to the oxygenization effect on running water, plastic does get washed down, and accidental ingestion by wildlife is a serious concern,” he said. “The effect of micro-plastics too is not very-well studied. In a clean-up conducted a few years ago near Laws Falls in Coonoor, we found milk packets from 2002, highlighting how plastics can stay in the river for many years and have an impact decades after they were dumped there,” said Mr. Vasanthan. Local residents said that one of the reasons people dumped waste into the dam was due to the lack of a proper waste management system in place in Ketti and surrounding villages. “The Kattery Dam also supplies water to the Cordite Factory in Aravankadu. There is security presence throughout the day and during the night. CCTV cameras can be set up in the area to find who is dumping waste into the dam,” said R. Hariharan, a resident of Ketti Palada, a village located close to the Kattery Dam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/garbage-dumped-into-kattery-dam-in-the-nilgiris-poses-risk-to-wildlife/article64991911.ece

The animal had wounds all over his body, said forest officials who conducted the post-mortem. Based on preliminary investigations, the officials said the animal might have sustained the injuries during a fight with another animal.   The Tiruppur City Police on Thursday commenced a probe into the alleged break-in by miscreants into the residence of Avinashi MLA and former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly P. Dhanapal at Rakkiyapalayam. Police said that no valuables were stolen and that the miscreants allegedly damaged the front door of the house.

Officials said that eight CCTV cameras were installed in the new subway to monitor the movement of people and, more importantly, to prevent hawkers and other encroachments in the new facility. Initially, the subway will be maintained by the National Highways Authority of India at least for a year. Later, the facility will be taken care of by the Vellore City Corporation. The underpass was built by Larsen & Toubro Ltd. on behalf of the NHAI. It will end a detour of at least 1 km by motorists and walkers. More importantly, the new facility will save more lives on the stretch because, on an average, the highway at that spot in Sathuvachari witnessed at least three accidents every month. “The new underpass will also help decongest the service lanes on both sides of the highway. The facility will also be monitored to prevent any encroachments, especially hawkers, taking advantage of the movement of walkers,” said Collector P. Kumaravel Pandian. The underpass is 25 metres long, 5.5 metres wide and 3 metres high. It has equipment to pump out water, CCTV cameras and LED street lights. The tiled facility also has reflectors, sign boards and ramps for persons with disabilities. Steel railings are also provided to ensure safety of walkers, especially, senior citizens, women and children. The work, which was started two years ago in November (2020), was originally planned to be completed in 45 days but was delayed due to continuous flow of traffic on the highway. Three such underpasses are also coming up in places like Perumugai, Kandaneri and Vettuvanam in Vellore.  The new underpass will help decongest the service lanes on both sides of the highway. The facility is 25 metres long, 5.5 metres wide and 3 metres high||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-pedestrian-subway-on-bengaluru-highway-opened/article64991677.ece

International network She told investigators of the State intelligence how a huge amount of money lying unclaimed in bank accounts were targeted by two former members or sympathisers of the LTTE based in Germany and Switzerland. The duo that was part of a larger network of sympathisers operating out of India, Canada, Singapore and Malaysia would facilitate withdrawal of the money by deploying agents with fake documents. The money would be transferred to different bank accounts in India and abroad in the names of companies or individuals and used for works of the “movement”, the sources quoted her as saying. Acting on the instructions of the two accused persons, Ms. Francisco said she came to India a couple of years ago and moved into a rented premises at Anna Nagar in Chennai. With the help of the rental agreement and domestic LPG connection papers, she managed to open accounts in different banks. With the help of some agents, she obtained a PAN card, Aadhaar card, voter identity card and Indian passport, the sources said. Ms. Francisco alleged she was connected to a few others and assigned the task of withdrawing several crores of rupees lying in a joint account held at Indian Overseas Bank’s Fort Branch in Mumbai. The two accused persons, whom she said were living in Denmark and Switzerland, had claimed that the money was raised for funding the activities of the LTTE, the sources said. Fake identities The woman and her two accomplices accessed the details of the original account- holders and forged documents to impersonate their identities. She even managed to activate the mobile phone linked to the account in her name. However, intelligence officials who were tracking the movement of the suspects alerted the immigration authorities and arrested Ms. Francisco when she was about to leave for Mumbai, the sources said, adding that the amount withdrawn illegally from various accounts by various persons who were part of the racket over the years was under investigation.  After the investigating agency found prima facie evidence to invoke provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, the National Investigation Agency, which has been investigating a similar case, took over the probe. In the first week of October, 2021, the NIA arrested a senior intelligence operative, Satkunam alias Sabesan, 47, of the LTTE in Chennai.  It was alleged that the suspect, also a Sri Lankan national, had transferred a large amount of money to former members or sympathisers to revive the movement. The agency was tracking Satkunam on the basis of inputs that he was involved in the trafficking of arms and drugs from Pakistan to Sri Lanka and used the proceeds of the crime to fund former members of the organisation.  The suspect told the investigators how huge amounts of money lying unclaimed in bank accounts were targeted by former members or sympathisers of LTTE based in Germany and Switzerland||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-police-bust-gang-raising-funds-for-ltte/article38336977.ece

Ministers from these districts have not been given any responsibility, while other districts have been given disproportinately higher representation. This is unfair. Similarly, some districts have no representation in the Cabinet, while others have more than none. This is unjust too,’’ he said. He was speaking to journalists in Vijayapura after the Republic Day celebrations. “The party should remember that people of all districts have voted it to power. Their votes have helped the Chief Minister to remain in that position. This should not be forgotten,” he said. He said that he will not respond to MLA M.P. Renukacharya’s statement that the party has neglected both of them [Mr. Renukacharya and Mr. Yatnal] despite the fact that they struggled to bring the party to power. “I will not say I brought the party to power. But there are some leaders whose efforts led the BJP gaining power in the State. Such people’s efforts should be rewarded,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yatnal-upset-over-appointment-of-district-in-charge-ministers/article38337094.ece

Member of Legislative Assembly Satish Jarkiholi, who addressed the protesters, described the rejection as a national insult. The Union Government has also rejected the tableaux suggested by West Bengal featuring Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Periyar’s images presented by Tamil Nadu. None of these were rejected for technical reasons. They were all rejected for political reasons. Such insults should not be tolerated, he said.

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta, who is in home isolation after testing positive for COVID-19, chaired a virtual review meeting of the pandemic situation in the city on Thursday. “Case trends over the past week across all eight zones show there is about 30% reduction in day-on-day case numbers across all zones. Positivity rate has also reduced from over 25% levels to the range of 17%-20%,” he said. Bengaluru reported a record 30,540 cases on January 20, but by Thursday, the number of new positives had dropped to 17,717 cases. However, there are pockets with a high caseload. For instance, BTM Layout, Malleswaram, HSR Layout, and Konanakunte wards have a high caseload. Mr. Gupta directed officials to map the positivity rates of RAT and RT-PCR test results across all zones and earmark wards with high positivity rates. “We need to take strict measures in these wards, enforce stricter containment measures to arrest the spread of infection,” he said. He also directed officials to speed up the vaccination drive. Meanwhile, BBMP has decided to close down all COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs) with zero admissions. With most patients in home isolation, CCCs are mostly unoccupied. Mr. Gupta said mobile triaging units should physically triage all cases recommended hospitalisation/CCC admission the same day, and aim to cover 10-15% of the overall caseload.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/focus-shifts-to-wards-with-high-caseload/article64991924.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:59 IST,KARNATAKA||City’s air pollution exceeds WHO guidelines||The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions on economic activity had little impact on improving the air quality of Bengaluru during November 2020 to November 2021. Bengaluru, along with Mangaluru, saw annual PM2.5 levels exceed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines of 5μg/m3 by six to seven times, according to a report by GreenPeace India. When it comes to annual PM10 levels, Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad exceeded the prescribed WHO guidelines of 15 μg/m3 by six to seven times. Bengaluru, on the other hand, recorded PM10 levels that exceeded the limit by three to four times The report, which was released on Thursday, analysed Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data from 10 cities in South India: Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Amaravati, Visakhapatnam, Kochi, Mangaluru, Puducherry, Coimbatore, and Mysuru. It was found that the annual average values of PM2.5 and PM10 exceeded WHO revised standards by many fold, showing that rising air pollution levels is not just a health hazard in cities in north India. In Bengaluru, air quality data was recorded from 10 monitoring stations set up by the CPCB and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in commercial and industrial areas. Shift to clean energy Avinash Chanchal, campaign manager, Greenpeace India, said that the findings show that lockdown is not a solution to reducing air pollution. “Relatively lesser economic activity and vehicles are also putting us in a dangerous position. We have to prioritise the immediate shift to clean energy and clean transport to stop more damage. If we look at Bengaluru’s PM10 data, the annual average in most stations is exceeding not only WHO guidelines, but NAAQS levels too,” he said. The primary contributors to worsening the air quality are fossil fuel-powered infrastructural development, industries, transport, waste burning, and construction activity. “Air pollution increases the likelihood of premature death and many medical conditions, including asthma, pre-term birth, low birth weight, depression, schizophrenia, diabetes, stroke, and lung cancer,” according to authors of the report. What’s worrying is that this is true even in places where air pollution levels meet the 2005 WHO Air Quality Guidelines. “Making our urban transport networks accessible and sustainable can play a major role in combating India’s urban air pollution crisis. Majority of the population in these cities is already using public transport or sustainable ways of transportation. But the infrastructural focus is still on private vehicles. Efforts and lifestyle of the masses must be appreciated and encouraged, as they are contributing to making our cities sustainable,” Mr. Chanchal added, while describing those who use public transport as “heroes”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/citys-air-pollution-exceeds-who-guidelines/article64991930.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:59 IST,KARNATAKA||HC: Why potholes occur after every rain?||Questioning why potholes occur after every rain, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday said that it was not satisfied with the status report filed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on the action taken to fill potholes across the city. While observing that the BBMP does not appear to be carrying out road repairs properly, the court directed the civic body to submit details of the technology adopted to repair roads, and whether it had taken the assistance of any experts or agencies for construction and repair of roads. Also, the court asked the BBMP to inform whether it has got any policy on coordination between various utility service providing agencies in road-cutting as roads are found dug up frequently by agencies for laying cables and pipelines. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the directions whilehearing a PIL petition filed in 2015 on lack of proper and regular mechanism for maintenance of roads. Observing that there has to be some coordination among agencies in road digging works to avoid digging of same road again and again by different agencies for laying cables and pipelines, the Bench also wanted to know what action the BBMP had taken against utility service providers for not completing the works within the time frame after permissions for road-cutting are granted. From the status report filed by the BBMP, the Bench found that the city’s roads are still not free from potholes as the report itself indicated that nearly 30 km of major roads and 482 km of zonal ward roads are still having potholes. The Bench adjourned further hearing till February 7 while directing presence of the BBMP’s head of engineering wing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-why-potholes-occur-after-every-rain/article64991934.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:10 IST,KARNATAKA||‘Govt. will crack down on illegal Bangladeshi immigrants’||Home Minister Araga Jnanendra on Thursday announced that the State Government is planning to crack down on illegal Bangladeshi immigrants working in Karnataka. The police have taken up a survey to track them down as they pose a threat to security, he said. The Police Department has information about their presence especially in coffee plantations in Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru districts. This comes in the backdrop of the arrest of a 27-year-old woman from Bangladesh who married a delivery executive in Bengaluru. The woman, Roni Begum, went by the name of Payal Ghosh. The Byadarahalli police arrested her on Thursday based on a complaint filed by the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). She had been caught two years ago by officials in Kolkata when she attempted to fly to Dhaka, Bangladesh, to meet her family with a valid Indian passport. At the time, she was not arrested but officers alerted FRRO in Bengaluru. Based on the report from FRRO, the Byadarahalli police formed a special team to track her down. “She was working in a garment factory. She came to India in 2007, and settled in Bengaluru in 2015. She changed her identity and married a food delivery executive from Mumbai,” said a police officer. After the incident in Kolkata, Romi reportedly moved to Mumbai, Mangaluru, Mysuru, and Bagalkote before returning to Bengaluru. “Investigations revealed that she obtained IDs and a passport from Bengaluru,” said Sanjeev Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP-West). In yet another case, a woman was deported from Maldives to Bengaluru. Rima Firoz Mulla, 34, had travelled to Maldives from Mumbai on a tourist visa without the required documents. “She was deported to Bengaluru as she had obtained an Indian passport from the city using fake domicile documents,” said a police officer. Inquiries revealed that Rima was living with her daughter and parents in Kattigenahalli while her husband, Feroz Mulla, runs a mobile spare parts shop in City Market. “She lived in West Bengal, Mumbai, Maharashtra, and other parts of the country before she arrived in Bengaluru around two years ago. She used her rental agreement to get an Aadhaar card and other IDs and applied for a passport,” said a police officer. She had multiple ID cards, said police officials who suspect she is part of a human trafficking racket.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-will-crack-down-on-illegal-bangladeshi-immigrants/article38336922.ece

Yediyurappa as Chief Minister of Karnataka six months ago. His predecessor’s tenure was marked by allegations of corruption, nepotism and political uncertainty. The Bharatiya Janata Party is, however, yet to heave a sigh of relief as changes in administration are still not stark. Good start The amenable Mr. Bommai began well by trying to project himself as a “common man’s Chief Minister” by shunning some of the privileges attached to his post. He also sought to send a message on focus on administration by holding a series of meetings with officials on a daily basis. But some of this early sheen was lost when his name was dragged into the bitcoin controversy. Soon after, the party suffered a humiliating defeat in byelection to Assembly from Hanagal constituency of Haveri district, which also houses his own Assembly constituency Shiggaon.This was followed by a below par performance in the elections to the Upper House from village panchayats in which the Opposition Congress too matched the ruling BJP’s performance as both won 11 seats each. There was another setback in the elections to Urban Local Bodies in which the party was outsmarted by the Opposition Congress in several areas, including his home turf.While such defeats suffered by the BJP boosted the confidence of the Opposition Congress, these episodes also provided an opportunity to his detractors within the party to speculate about a possible leadership change.However, the Chief Minister now appears to have decided to put such setbacks behind him as he is again making efforts to boost the image of the Government by dedicating more time towards administration and development works. But, the fruits of these efforts are yet to be felt by people at the grassroots level due to poor accountability among lower level administrative machinery, many say. A section of the BJP leaders and workers themselves admit that the new Government is yet to prove that it is better than its predecessor at the grassroots level.While the lackluster performance of several Ministers has also come in the way of making a mark in terms of administration and service delivery, the lack of stalwarts in the party organisation too is showing up, say many.The unsavoury episodes of right-wing groups indulging in vigilantism and moral policing too have diverted public attention from whatever efforts are being made to activate administrative machinery, observe a few Ministers. Now that only a little over a year is left for elections to the Assembly, the party cadre is waiting to see if the Chief Minister can do a turnaround and boost the image in time to retain power.Pointing out that the Chief Minister has been focusing on improving administration, particularly service delivery through various programmes, sources close to him maintain that his vision would start showing up in terms of development programmes after the presentation of the State Budget. They blame the pandemic-induced shortfall in revenue collection for the lack of visible progress on many fronts.They maintain that Mr. Bommai is the “best bet” for the party for leadership role given his administrative experience, diplomatic skills, contacts cutting across party affiliations, community background and good will among people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/6-months-on-bommais-efforts-at-makeover-yet-to-show/article64991769.ece

The civic body is spending Rs. 1,171 crore to take up works primarily on storm-water drains and roads. It first tried to bypass the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements Act, 1999, by seeking a 4G exemption arguing these are emergency works. However, following widespread outcry against the move,the BBMP has issued tenders for selection of project consultants, but has given them only one week to submit bids. “For any tender above Rs. 5 lakh, the agency needs to give one month to bid.

The discrepancy is underscored in the findings. In Bengaluru, for instance, the authors found that the PM2.5 of all stations were within the NAAQS, but exceeded the WHO revised standards. “....eight stations’ PM10 values are higher than NAAQS standards,” according to authors of the report. They pointed out that low birth weight, depression, schizophrenia, diabetes, stroke, lung cancer, and other diseases linked to the quality of air we breathe is seen even in places where air pollution levels meet the 2005 WHO Air Quality Guidelines.

Mahesh has alleged that the delimitation of wards in Hassan City Municipal Council area by including villages on the city outskirts had been done to give an advantage to the BJP, the party in power in the state. Addressing a press conference in Hassan on Thursday, Mr. Mahesh, who contested for Hassan Assembly seat twice, said the boundaries of the existing 35 wards had been redrawn to include the new areas. The draft notification of the delimitation showed that the wards, which were earlier represented by members belonging to minority communities, had been divided ‘unscientifically’ to benefit the BJP. The wards which were once represented by Muslims, Dalits and a few other castes had been divided and the areas had been distributed among other neighbouring wards. “This is done to benefit the BJP, which is known for dividing people on the basis of caste and religion. If the officers had done delimitation of wards, they would not have done like this. It seems Hassan MLA Preetham Gowda got this done according to his wishes”, he alleged. Mr. Mahesh said the Congress had filed objections to the draft notification of delimitation and sought the Deputy Commissioner to look into the objections. Referring to Mr. Preetham Gowda’s statement that he would not join the Congress, but remain in the BJP throughout his career, Mr. Mahesh said that in the past Mr. Preetham had approached H.D. Kumaraswamy, when the latter was the Chief Minister, intending to join the JD(S). Similarly, he had met D.K. Shivakumar, when the latter was Minister for Water Resources, and expressed his wish to join the Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/delimitation-of-hassan-cmc-done-to-suit-bjps-interests/article38337253.ece

Laxmi Prasad on Thursday. Speaking to presspersons in an interaction programme, the SP said those into this illegal activity had changed their mode of operation. “Only those who call up the peddlers personally, get the stuff delivered. We have succeeded in controlling the supply of ganja from Andhra Pradesh. However, some people are getting it from other sources. Earlier, if we checked 10 people on suspicion of possessing ganja, we used to get at least six-seven people with the stuff. Now, it has come down to one or two”, the officer said. The police, he said, had plans to bring down the illegal sale of liquor in rural areas substantially. As long as the sale of illegal liquor continued in rural areas, the number of crimes would continue to grow. The crime rate could be reduced if the sale of liquor was restricted in rural areas. The SP said bringing down the crime rate by involving the public through various means was one of his priorities. The policemen would be trained on receiving complaints from the public and how to respond to people who approach them seeking help.

He was dedicating a concrete road from Sarvodaya Circle in Keshwapur to railway underbridge on Gadag Road in Hubballi developed under CRF to the public on Thursday. He said that under CRF, a Rs. 50 crore project to develop the road stretch from the railway underbridge connecting Keshwapur, Bengeri, Gopanakoppa and Sainagar has been initiated. “Already, a good quality concrete road has been laid from the railway underbridge to Sarvodaya Circle, pavers have been installed by the road side and pavement has been constructed on either side.I held a meeting of various government agencies to ensure better coordination during the execution of the work, following which the road work has been completed expeditiously,” he said. Mr. Shettar said that the project to extend 24x7 water supply facility to all wards of Hubballi-Dharwad has been sanctioned and the work will be initiated after the completion of survey work by the construction company L&T. He said that because of the pandemic, development works have been delayed and in the next six months, Hubballi-Dharwad will be transformed into beautiful twin cities.

Ambedkar’s portrait from the dais during the Republic Day celebrations on the premises of the Raichur District Court on Wednesday, Raichur Principal District and Sessions Judge Mallikarjuna Gouda has dismissed the charge that he asked his subordinates to remove it. In a media note released on Thursday, Mr. Gouda termed the charge as “propaganda” against him coupled with suppression of facts and appealed to the people not to believe it. “A few advocates approached me and demanded that the portrait of Dr. Ambedkar be placed beside that of Mahatma Gandhi [during the Republic Day celebrations as per a Government Order]. I told them that the High Court Registrar had informed us in our Leaders Group that the Government Order is before the Full Bench [of the High Court] and asked us to wait till a decision was taken in the matter and requested them not force me... We later hoisted the national flag. I have not seen anybody placing the Ambedkar portrait and removing it. Hiding this fact, [some people] propagated that I made the removal of Ambedkar portrait as a precondition to hoisting the flag,” Mr. Gouda said. Stating that he had a lot of respect for Ambedkar, he said that he had, during the Republic Day celebrations every year, appealed to people to follow the thoughts and ideals of the great personality. “There is no question of showing disrespect to such a great personality. I don’t know why this misinformation about me has been spread. The propaganda is false and I request people not to believe it,” Mr. Gouda said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/judge-refutes-charge-that-he-wanted-removal-of-portrait/article38337088.ece

Southern Railway’s Palakkad Division is confident of throwing open the tunnel to through traffic by March this year. The then Railway Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda had announced line doubling between Mangaluru Junction and Surathkal in the 2014 Railway Budget. The work that was included in the line doubling project of Shoranur-Mangaluru-Panambur, however, got delayed due to various reasons, including difficult terrain, change of contractor and landslips.  Palakkad Divisional Railway Manager Trilok Kothari told The Hindu on Thursday that the tunnelling work is already completed. Track laying work should start by February first week and that is expected to be completed in a fortnight on the 600 m stretch. Drawing overhead power lines and communication lines will also be taken up simultaneously.  While the completion of doubling on Mangaluru-Jokatte-Panambur stretch is expected to reduce congestion at Mangaluru Junction, the Railways intends to use both the tunnels only by May this year, Mr. Kothari said. The existing tunnel needs to undergo thorough maintenance and it will be closed for traffic once the second tunnel is commissioned. The closure of the existing tunnel in other circumstances is not possible at all because of the heavy train traffic, he said. Mr. Kothari said that once both the tunnels are brought under operation, hopefully by May, congestion at Mangaluru Junction is expected to reduce by 20%. This will facilitate easy and faster dispatch of trains between the North and the South, he added. Running below National Highway 169, Mangaluru-Karkala-Solapur Road, the Kulashekara tunnels are a vital link on the Mumbai line too. The lines branch out at Jokatte towards Panambur and they have been a critical connectivity component to New Mangalore Port, Baikampady Industrial Area, MRPL and other major industries located in North Mangaluru. Of the 21-km line between Mangaluru Junction and Panambur, about 17 km is already doubled while about a 4-km stretch, including the 600 m tunnel stretch, is under single line operation. The construction wing of Southern Railway is executing the tunnelling work that is part of the line doubling project. Another bottleneck on the stretch, a road overbridge on Bondel-Vamanjoor Road, was recently cleared with the commissioning of a longer bridge to accommodate double lines that run beneath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/second-tunnel-at-kulashekara-ready-for-commissioning/article64991823.ece

The initiative, he said, has developed a vibrant network of participants across all sections of Udupi’s population. It is launching Udupi Tokens on the first anniversary as per Lcommerce guidelines of local ownership, Mr. Pai said. A native of Udupi who formerly founded banking analytics firm, Fintellix, that was later acquired by Verisk Analytics, Mr. Pai said that data localisation is a necessary requirement to ensure data sovereignty. COVID-19 has made one realise the need for local action, which is possible only when information is used by local communities to organise themselves and coordinate with like-minded groups across the world. Mr. Pai further said that eSamudaay has made a business catalogue of local traders because global online giants are interested only in dominating market space thereby bringing a big divide between producers and users. Udupi eSamudaay has engaged with digital services and App development companies operating in the region. Student community has been networked through the participation of the entrepreneurship cells in many engineering colleges in the region, he added. It is an effort aimed at democratising the digital world where local communities can become self-sufficient in managing their digital assets and infrastructure. Udupi eSamudaay is a model for a distributed digital economy or a network of collaborating and cooperating local digital platforms. It aims at having sizable number of business, self-employed entrepreneurs, cultural events and community content on the platform enabling a self-sustaining local economy, Mr. Pai added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/udupi-esamudaay-completes-a-year-strengthening-local-economy/article64991821.ece

The BJP is heading the MCC council and the Mayor, .Sunanda Palanethra, announced the adjournment citing lack of quorum, within minutes of reaching the council hall. The day’s development also irked Mysuru MP Pratap Simha as one of the projects to ensure piped supply of domestic LPG for cooking was to be approved. However, it transpired that some of the MLAs of the BJP had written to the councillors not to back the project on the grounds that it will entail digging up the roads. Mr. Simha had stated early in the day that the piped gas supply was to be implemented in Mysuru for which about 500 km length pipe had to be laid in the city. The MCC being the local body was supposed to ratify the project and give its consent and Mr. Simha had described it as a ‘’mere formality’’. But much to his chagrin, the councillors abstained en masse from the meeting and hence the subject has to be taken forward to the next meeting. However, the next meeting has to be preceded by electing a new Mayor. In the meantime, Ms.Sunanda Palanethra said that she had no objections to the project and it was unfortunate that the last meeting under her chairmanship was adjourned with no business taking place as her tenure comes to an end in due course. Mr. Simha did not spare the BJP MLAs and alluding to S.A. Ramdas of Krishnaraja constituency, said some take credit for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies and conduct ‘’Modi Yuga Utsava’’ but instead of ensuring that the benefits reach the people they are content distributing booklets with their photographs. The Mayor had recently lamented the lack of cooperation from her own party councillors with respect to grant of Rs. 50 crore from the State Finance Commission to take up development works including road repairs. She had stated that the funds would lapse in case the members did not cooperate and had alleged that a majority of the councillors including those from the BJP had written to the authorities to withhold the grant as they were not convinced of the rationale for selecting the roads. Mr. Simha said the BJP MLAs were hand in glove with the Congress in opposing the project and said they should eschew petty politics. Mr. Modi was scheduled to be in Mysuru for inauguration of the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway by the end of this year and hence the piped gas supply project too could have been timed to coincide with it, he added||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/it-is-bjp-versus-bjp-in-mysuru/article64991780.ece

The government has sanctioned Rs. 350 crore for the project which has a planned capacity to pump 900 million liters daily (MLD) of water catering to Mysuru and 193 other villages in the vicinity. The elected representatives including Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and Chamundeshwari MLA .G.T. Deve Gowda paid a visit to the project site on Thursday and urged the government to sanction Rs. 545 crore for the project so that its implementation was not further delayed. Mr. Simha and Mr. Gowda said that the DPR for the project entailed an amount of Rs. 545 crore against which the State Government has sanctioned Rs. 350 crore in the first phase. ‘’But the full benefits will materialise only on its completion and hence we have sought the release of Rs. 545 crore being the cost of the entire project plus an additional Rs. 45 crore towards cost escalation and GST’’, said Mr. Simha. ‘’We have apprised the government of the imperatives of sanctioning the full amount of Rs. 590 crore and it will be placed before the Cabinet for approval so that there was no delay in its implementation’’, according to Mr. Simha and Mr. Gowda. The project envisages the projected population of Mysuru to be around 5 million by 2081 and the Hale Unduwadi scheme is on the lines of the project conceived by the maharajas which has lasted more than a century, according to officials. The existing drinking water projects catering to Mysuru are all located in the downstream of the dam and hence whenever there is a drought, it affects the drinking water supply to the city. But the current project is on the upstream of the dam and the jack wells will draw water even if the reservoir level is at 48 feet. At present they tend to run dry in case the storage level in the reservoir dips to 68 feet. Land requirement The land requirement is 123.07 acres spread over Mysuru and Mandya districts and an amount of Rs. 50 crore has been deposited for the purpose. The length of the pipeline from the water treatment plant to the city will be around 20 km and the project is being implemented by Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board incorporating the best practices in construction industry and adopting the state-of-the-art technology, according to the officials. Mr. Simha and Mr. Gowda said the project is expected to be ready by July 2023 and will ensure permanent supply of drinking water to Mysuru and surrounding regions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mega-drinking-water-project-near-krs-gathering-steam/article64991779.ece

He was admitted to a private hospital in Kochi. The Mannancherry police arrested two persons, identified as Kuruvi Aneesh and Shanmughadas, of Settlement Colony in connection with the incident. The police are on the lookout for a third person named Subash. BMS member The police said Aneesh was a member of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS). The police, however, said the incident was not political and personal enmity led to the assault. The police said the torching of a motorcycle in the area a few days ago culminated in the attack. “A motorbike of one Vipin was allegedly torched by Subash and Kuruvi. After knowing about the incident, Santhosh and his friend visited Vipin’s house and on their way back they met Subash and Kuruvi. On Wednesday, Subash, Kuruvi, and Shanmughadas came for Santhosh and attacked him,” said a police official.

The DPR was approved at a meeting held in the chamber of the Kochi Mayor the other day. The DPR was a prerequisite for getting financial assistance from KIIFB. There were several hurdles before the preparation of the key document, including the handing over of the existing road to the Public Works Department (PWD). The resolution passed by the Kochi Corporation Council handing over land to the PWD earlier was not sufficient, and a notification had to be issued for the purpose, said Mayor M. Anilkumar. The handing over of the land to the PWD is in the final stages. Since the road is an asset of the corporation, it can be formally transferred to the agency only through an official notification. The draft notification has been prepared, and the final notification will be out shortly, he said. A DPR was also required for obtaining financial sanction for utilising the Rs. 100 crore allocated by KIIFB for the project. The DPR is expected to speed up the project, the Mayor added. The civic authorities had been pursuing the project that connects Thammanam with M.G. Road for long. However, paucity of funds and delay in acquiring land had hit the project. It is estimated that around Rs. 250 crore will be required for land acquisition. Besides, the 2.19 hectares acquired for the project, 3.67 hectares have to be acquired. A significant extent of land was obtained as free surrender. The corporation had purchased 54.79 ares using the Rs. 25 crore allocated by the government, Mr. Anilkumar said. The project cost has been revised to Rs. 320 crore considering the market value of the land to be acquired. The proposal for two flyovers has been kept in abeyance. It could be taken up at an appropriate time, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thammanam-pullepady-road-project-to-be-speeded-up/article64991861.ece

The decision comes in the wake of complaints that special prosecutor V.T. Raghunath, who was handpicked by the mother of Madhu, had failed to turn up at the trial court on Tuesday when the case was considered. T. A. Shaji, the Director General of Prosecution, said the family could decide on whether to retain Mr. Raghunath or have a new lawyer in his place. If they opted for a new lawyer, they could suggest a panel of three from which the State would pick one, he said. The State cannot unilaterally remove the current prosecutor as he was appointed as demanded by the relatives of the slain youth. Hence, they were given the choice, he said. Madhu was beaten to death at Mukkali, near Attapady, by a group of local people on February 22, 2018, who accused him of theft. The accused were charged with murder and offences under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Ill-health Earlier, Mr. Raghunath had communicated to the Director General of Prosecution that he would be unavailable for a few months as he was undergoing a medical treatment. The lawyer did not turn up at the Special Court trying the offences against the SC/ST members on Tuesday, which had invited widespread criticism. The court posted the case for March 25. According to Mr. Shaji, the prosecutor, who was unable to appear before the court should have made alternative arrangements and communicated the decision to the court and the investigation officers. Seeks explanation An explanation would be sought from the prosecutor in this regard, Mr. Shaji said. Mr. Raghunathan attributed the delay in beginning the trial to the COVID-19 restrictions and the time taken to complete the reinvestigation in the case. The lawyer said he could not appear before the court on Tuesday as he was recuperating from an illness. “I have not resigned from the post but communicated my inability to appear in the court for four or five months on health grounds.

The violators were nabbed when they were trying to dump waste near the bridge at Glass Colony at Manjummel and along Seaport-Airport Road on January 25 night. The municipality has published the names of those who dumped waste and warned of stringent action against illegal dumping of waste in public places and waterbodies. Municipal Chairperson Seema Kannan said surprise checks would be held across the municipality in the coming days. “We will take serious action against managements of hotels and shops violating rules,” she added.

Crimes committed by youth riding such vehicles have become commonplace in the city and its suburbs. “Considering the gravity of the situation, we have begun referring such cases to the court, since most riders do this on purpose to get away after committing crimes or to evade law-enforcing agencies,” said G. Anandakrishnan, Enforcement RTO (Ernakulam). “This is on a directive from the Transport Secretary. Youth involved in chain snatching, narcotic drug peddling, and other crimes know it is difficult to track them down if their vehicles’ identity is concealed,” he added. Even if they are intercepted as part of regular enforcement drives, they either speed away or cite excuses like the number plate got detached earlier. They would carry the plate with them as proof in most instances. Even worse, many of these riders do not have driving licence either. Once apprehended, the vehicle is handed over to the nearest police station and the case referred to the court. It takes minimum of one month for the owner to get the vehicle back, while the rider’s licence can be suspended, Mr. Anandakrishnan said. It is mandatory that all vehicles manufactured in the country after April 2019 have high-security number plates. Dealers must rivet them as mandated on the front and rear of the vehicle. The police have to be informed in case the number plate suffers any damage, following which a fresh one ought to be refixed. MVD sources said that in a recent incident, they had tracked down the rider of a bike without number plate using his Instagram account which was displayed on the vehicle, although he refused to stop when told to.

The RDF (refuse-derived fuel) generated will be sent to cement companies in Tamil Nadu. According to officials it is the first complete biomining project in Kerala. The landfill adjacent to Ashtamudi Lake, one of the Ramsar sites in the district, will be cleared as part of the project. In the first phase, 3,000 tonnes of waste will be segregated and converted into fuel that can be used instead of coal and firewood. The Corporation authorities are planning to clear the garbage heap within a year. "We are making arrangements to set up source waste treatment units at houses. Forty more biogas plants will be made available by the end of this month," says Mayor Prasanna Earnest. Eco-friendly Biomining technology segregates waste into various components and each is treated in an environment-friendly manner. Through biomining 100% of the waste will be cleared, unlike the capping method where the waste is buried. RDF, which contains combustible components, will be separated from soil, stone, metal, glass, rubber and wood. About 500 tonnes of legacy waste will be disposed of every day and by opting for this method 72,647 tonnes of carbon dioxide will be eliminated. Waste will be treated under the direct supervision of the Local Self-Government department and Kollam Corporation with the permission of the State Pollution Control Board as per the Central norms for solid waste management. The Corporation had initiated the proceedings for the removal of legacy waste in February 2021. With the help of the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, the volume of the waste was measured and it was found to be 1,04,906.88 cubic metres. The project is expected to be complete within 12 months, excluding the monsoon season and including a three-month mobilisation period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/biomining-launched-to-eliminate-legacy-waste/article38337200.ece

Mohamed Riyas has said that the State government is committed to the development of Calicut international airport. Addressing a meeting to discuss the development of the airport here on Thursday, he said the Left Democratic Front government had made significant intervention for the development of the airport since 2016. Soon after the new government came to power, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had entrusted the charge of the development of the airport with three Ministers, he said. The meeting was organised by Malabar Chamber of Commerce (MCC), Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI), Greater Malabar Initiative Foundation (GMIF), Calicut Management Association, Malabar Development Council, and The Business Club. A collective effort had become necessary to reinstate the glory of the Calicut airport after various restrictions were imposed on the facility from 2015 including the suspension of wide-bodied aircraft operation. The airport, established in 1988, grew into one of the busiest airports in the country in terms of passenger traffic. The international status was awarded to the airport in 2006. Mr. Riyas said it was decided to solve traffic jam at Ramanattukara Junction to facilitate smooth journey from Kozhikode to the airport. The Public Works Department (PWD) had already taken steps in this regard. A proposal to sanction Rs. 31.5 lakh for preparing a blueprint, among other things, was under the consideration of the Finance Department, he said. He pointed out that the work on developing the Ramanattukara-Vengalam bypass into six lanes was in full swing under the National Highways Authority of India. He added the government would go ahead with projects for the comprehensive development of the Calicut airport. MCC president K.V. Haseeb Ahammed presided over the meeting. Elamaram Karim and M.K.

A high-level probe is under way into the incident to verify the sources of the clip and identify the officer behind the incident. The voice clip was reportedly leaked by a group of lorry operators who were allegedly fed up with a few enforcement squad members with itchy palms. In the voice clip, the officer was heard promising to clear the way for trucks from Koduvally to Wayanad district on payment of Rs. 5,000 per vehicle. The owner of the voice was also found making an extra offer with some reductions if there were five vehicles at a time. The investigation was launched after a few lorry operators took it up as evidence with the MVD and the police for action. According to the complainants, a scientific examination of the voice clip would bring to light the exploitation in the name of enforcement and struggles being faced by inter-district lorry operators. A functionary of the Lorry Owners Association said the details shared by the officer about the functioning of the enforcement squad during the telephone conversation alone would be sufficient to prove the authenticity of the complaint. “The MVD inspector was heard saying that no member of the 32-member road enforcement squad along Kozhikode-Wayanad highway would check the trucks if the owners were ready to make the fixed payment. It should not be taken lightly,” he said. Minister’s directive Meanwhile, MVD sources said the authenticity of the audio clip was still under investigation which was launched on a directive from Transport Minister Antony Raju. They also said the Transport Commissioner would submit a department-level probe report to the Minister soon recommending further action based on the preliminary investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/voice-clip-puts-mvd-squads-in-a-fix/article38337151.ece

Twenty years later on Wednesday, he became the victim of a vicious elephant attack in the jungle. Mathan’s death brought a pall of gloom on a few dozen Cholanaikkan families living deep in the forests. A quiet man, Mathan had emerged as a tribal leader in recent years. The elephant attacked Mathan and his friends between Panappuzha and Valkkettumala as they were heading towards the Manjeeri colony to collect their weekly ration. Narrow escape for one Another senior tribesman, Chathan, had a narrow escape as the elephant charged at them. Mathan’s age became a handicap for him to escape elephant attack. He was 70. The elephant trampled Mathan and stood beside his body for hours. The tribespeople, with the help of the forest officials, had to drive away the elephant to retrieve the body.

Madhu, the tribal youth who was lynched by a gang at Attappady four years ago, has raised suspicions of attempts to scuttle the legal proceedings against the culprits. Madhu’s sister, Sarasu, said that there were pressures to settle the case and also to influence the key witness. She said the key witness had been offered Rs. 2 lakh to withdraw from the case. Ms. Sarasu also said that there were assault attempts on the family after the murder of her brother. “We did not reveal it to the public because of fear,” she said. Madhu’s family said that some people had came to their house with weapons at night a few months after he was lynched, and they escaped the attack as they hid in the jungle. It was on February 22, 2018, that Madhu was lynched by a local mob that charged him with theft. Nearly four years after the murder, the trial was yet to begin owing largely to political pressures from the culprits. Prosecutor quits A special public prosecutor appointed by the government refused to take up the case. The second prosecutor, V.T. Raghunath, too has stepped aside raising poor health as an excuse. The Director General of Prosecutions has asked Madhu’s family to suggest three names for prosecutor’s post to handle his case at the Special Court for SC/ST Atrocities Act Cases at Mannarkkad. The court had raised a concern over the absence of the prosecutor when the case came up for hearing a couple of days ago. The court’s concern brought the case back into limelight. A new prosecutor is expected when the court hears the case now on February 26. Minister for Law P. Rajeeve said that the government was viewing the absence of the prosecutor seriously. He said the government would act if there was any fault. Family’s charge Madhu’s sister alleged that neither the government nor the prosecutor had informed the family of the status of the case. She said that the family was disappointed with the government, and was planning to approach the High Court demanding an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Madhu was lynched on February 22, 2018, and the police submitted their chargesheet on May 22, 2018, accusing 16 local people. Among them were local leaders of different political parties. Madhu’s family said they were living in fear as the accused had political clout. One of the accused, Shamsuddeen P., was a branch secretary of the CPI(M). He was removed from the post after his involvement in the lynching case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/madhus-kin-allege-bid-to-scuttle-case/article64991731.ece

The State government has also conveyed to the Union government its willingness to grant exemptions in various matters, including the State GST. Preliminary efforts The Union Ministry has entrusted the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) with commencing preliminary efforts for the project. Both Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Mr. Riyas had taken up the issue with Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari during separate meetings in New Delhi. In a statement, Mr. Riyas said the Centre’s approval for the Thiruvananthapuram outer ring road project was bound to spur the State’s development aspirations.

Mr. Khan, who unfurled the national flag and received salute at the 73rd Republic Day parade at the Central Stadium here, said that by building a strong network of educational and research institutions of greater quality, the State can help realise the national dream of transforming India as the world’s knowledge hub. “On this Republic Day, let our thoughts be on making our beloved State of Kerala a paradise of intellectual pursuits and the preferred destination for higher education and research in India,” he said. The State’s role in the realisation of many national dreams had been substantial, he said. The State, which was “bravely fighting” the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, had topped the NITI Aayog ranking of States on health indicators for the fourth year in a row. It had been ranked fifth in the country and first among southern States in the Good Governance Index. Kerala had also won recognition nationally for its COVID-19 vaccination drive covering nearly 80% of the population, for bringing down the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), and for registering an annual decline rate of 7.5% in the incidence of Tuberculosis, the Governor said. The State's decision to establish special courts to try cases related to dowry harassment and violence against women would help to ensure gender justice and wipe out evil practices like dowry, he said. The third wave of the pandemic had forced India to pare down the Republic Day celebrations. Nonetheless, the country had displayed tremendous resilience and capability, scope of synergy and leadership in every sphere, during the pandemic, Mr. Khan said. The Governor opened his Republic Day speech with several lines in Malayalam before switching to English, and, towards the end, quoted verses by the late poet Vishnunarayanan Namboothiri.

This is the first time this fact is being officially acknowledged by the State. Among the COVID-positive samples from international travellers sent for sequencing, 80% were of the Omicron virus variant and the rest Delta. Addressing mediapersons here on Thursday, Ms. George said the government was fully prepared to take on the third wave. The rapid response team is meeting on a daily basis and monitoring all aspects of COVID management. The ICU occupancy had shown a dip by 2%. In government hospitals, only 40.5% of the ICUs are currently occupied by both COVID and non-COVID patients, while ventilator occupancy is also at a low at 11.5%. In the private sector, ICU occupancy of both COVID and non COVID patients together is 8.28%, while ventilator occupancy is 8.96%. Ms. George said with 97% of the cases now confined to care at home, it was important that home care was carried out in a proper and scientific manner. She appealed to the public to be mindful of the fact that even when it created less serious illness in comparison to Delta, Omicron was leading to serious disease in a proportion of the population who are elderly or might have other comorbidities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/omicron-driving-third-wave-veena/article38337212.ece

A section of ration dealers claimed that the technical snag that had necessitated specific time slots for districts last week persisted. Ration cardholders were forced to wait for long hours outside the outlets with the dealers claiming that their e-PoS (electronic Point of Sale) machines were unresponsive. Ration dealers claimed the machines were offline despite restarting them repeatedly. As a result, many ration beneficiaries who found it difficult to collect their monthly allocation during the specified period last week had to return empty-handed on Thursday too, the dealers said. Notwithstanding such occurrences, ration supply exceeded all expectations as 7,26,724 ration cardholders received their allotted commodities (as on 7 p.m.) on the day. Capacity ascertained Food and Civil Supplies Minister G.R. Anil said this was a record-of-sorts in recent times, considering the average daily supply ranged from 3.5 lakh to 4 lakh beneficiaries. He pointed out that the government had decided to revert to the normal working hours of Public Distribution System (PDS) outlets after the server capacity and other technicalities were ascertained by the National Informatics Centre and the State IT Mission. Mr. Anil accused a section of ration dealers who had opposed the introduction of e-PoS machines of engaging in the misinformation campaign and creating panic among the public. The Minister added that such dealers had focused on magnifying difficulties caused by network connectivity issues. Squads to be deployed Department sources said squads would soon be deployed to ensure that ration dealers had been using SIM cards that provided decent Internet connection. Certain sections had for long violated the guidelines issued by the department in this regard. This had often affected the ration supply system, they claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/record-number-of-beneficiaries-collect-ration/article38337290.ece

Yediyurappa, many believed he would be able to strike a balance between Hindutva and his socialist moorings. But the government led by him seems to have taken a sharp right turn, even more than under his predecessor, who was from the RSS stables. The Basavaraj Bommai-led government enacted the Karnataka Right to Freedom of Religion Act, 2021, popularly called the “anti-conversion law”, on the lines of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, what many argue was “more draconian”. It was also preceded by a campaign of vigilante attacks on the Christian community. The coastal belt also recorded an uptick in moral policing incidents, which Mr. Bommai even defended saying “there will always be a reaction when sentiments are hurt.” A group of senior writers, academics and scientists recently wrote an open letter expressing concern over frequent violence against religious minorities. Mr. Bommai’s government was quick to enact the Karnataka Religious Structures Protection Act, 2021, also, to protect temples and places of worship built on encroached lands from demolition. Mr. Bommai recently announced his government will free Hindu temples from “government control” and give them autonomy, a long standing demand of the Sangh Parivar. He has also been trying to pitch development of Anjanadri, believed to be the birthplace of Lord Hanuman, to be in line with Ayodhya’s Ram Mandir. “Mr. Yediyurappa had come from the RSS stables and had the stature, seniority and was winning elections for the party. Mr. Bommai, who has lost an election on his home turf, has jumped on to the Hindutva bandwagon. His Hindutva zeal seems mostly inspired by political pragmatism,” said a senior strategist of the party. “During the first wave of the pandemic, Mr. Yediyurappa could ask his partymen to stop demonising Muslims over Tablighi Jamaat. Mr. Bommai can ill afford to do that. Even Mr. Yediyurappa let Hindutva ideologues have their way when he was a weak wicket. His government enacted the anti-cow slaughter legislation and he defended Tejasvi Surya when he targeted Muslim employees of the COVID-19 war room during his last months in power, when there was an internal rebellion,” another leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-sharp-right-turn-under-bommai/article64991574.ece

I will send by letter to Congress President Sonia Gandhi,” he said.  ‘Had sought elections’ Mr. Ibrahim further said, “I had told the party to conduct elections to elect the leader of the party. I had said if I did not have the numbers, do not make me the leader. However, I had the backing of 19 (of the 26 Congress members in Council) members.” A veteran politician, who was also Union Civil Aviation Minister in the H.D.

Congress leaders, including the general secretary in charge of Karnataka Randeep Surjewala, had met Mr. Ibrahim to pacify him. Sources said that in the recent months, the minority leader had also distanced himself from former Chief Minister and a long-term associate from Janata Parivar days, Siddaramaiah. When asked if he would be joining JD(S), Mr. Ibrahim said, “I have not made up my mind. I am weighing other options too.” DKS to talk to him KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar told reporters that Mr. Ibrahim was a senior leader in the party and he may have spoken after being hurt. “He has worked and contributed to the party. He has also been MLC twice.

A Sri Lankan national, who was detained by the immigration authorities in Chennai recently and handed over to the ‘Q’ Branch-CID of the State police, revealed how the accused persons operating from European countries deployed operatives to draw huge money from dormant accounts using fake identities/documents, police sources told The Hindu on Thursday.  Mary Francisco, 51, a native of Sri Lanka, moved to Canada many years ago and became a permanent resident there. She was intercepted at the Chennai Airport as she was preparing to board a plane to Mumbai. International network She told investigators of the State intelligence how huge money lying unclaimed in bank accounts were targeted by two former members or sympathisers of the LTTE based in Germany and Switzerland. The duo that was part of a larger network of sympathisers operating out of India, Canada, Singapore and Malaysia would facilitate withdrawal of the money by deploying agents with fake documents. The money would be transferred to different bank accounts in India and abroad in the names of companies or individuals and used for works of the “movement”, the sources quoted her as saying. Acting on the instructions of the two accused persons, Ms. Francisco said she came to India a couple of years ago and moved into a rented premises at Anna Nagar in Chennai. With the help of the rental agreement and domestic LPG connection papers, she managed to open accounts in different banks. With the help of some agents, she obtained a PAN card, Aadhaar card, voter identity card and Indian passport, the sources said. Ms. Francisco alleged she was connected to a few others and assigned the task of withdrawing several crores of rupees lying in a joint account held at Indian Overseas Bank’s Fort Branch in Mumbai. The two accused persons, whom she said were living in Denmark and Switzerland, had claimed that the money was raised for funding the activities of the LTTE, the sources said. Fake identities The woman and her two accomplices accessed the details of the original account- holders and forged documents to impersonate their identities. She even managed to activate the mobile phone linked to the account in her name. However, intelligence officials who were tracking the movement of the suspects alerted the immigration authorities and arrested Ms. Francisco when she was about to leave for Mumbai, the sources said, adding that the amount withdrawn illegally from various accounts by various persons who were part of the racket over the years was under investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tn-police-bust-gang-raising-funds-for-ltte/article38336921.ece

It is worse across North India as primary healthcare is in shambles there with the poor and downtrodden having no access to emergency or quality healthcare, said noted paediatrician Dr. Kafeel Khan on Thursday. “COVID has shown thateven thosewith money had no access to hospital beds, drugs, oxygen and even lost their lives during the second wave. The reality is this is the daily issue with 70% of the population in the country. We need to have ‘Right to Healthcare’ passed in Parliament for everyone to get medicare within 5-10 km of their homes,” he said. Dr. Khan has been in the limelight as the Uttar Pradesh government of Yogi Adityanath jailed him for the deaths of children due to lack of oxygen supply at the BRD Medical Hospital in Gorakhpur in 2017. He was in the city to release his book ‘A doctor’s memoir of a deadly medical crisis’ recounting the incidents where he was made the ‘scapegoat’ for the tragedy despite being “the junior most in the department with no administrative and financial power”. The book chronicles what went wrong during that time, how he was framed and became a ‘hero to a zero’, his jailed life and later termination from service though he was given a ‘clean chit’ by the High Court.“I am not a hero, just a common man fightingthe hatred intoxicating the minds of youngsters and innocent in the nameof religion. I am trying to do what a common Indian shoulddo. Everyone knows my story but I wrote thebook to compile what had happened with evidenceas 81 families are still waiting for justice having lost their children due to administrative failure and corruption of Mr.Yogi Adityanath’s government,” he charged. “There was not a ‘singleevidence’ of corruption or medical negligence against me. Yet, I was made responsiblefor oxygen supply shortage and the “judiciary took nine months to releaseme after being with 200 other undertrials with acommon toilet,” he said. Dr. Khan alleged that the UP government had ignored warnings about oxygen shortage and delayed payment because “10% commission was not paid”. “I was later terminated citing my illegal private practice,” added Dr. Khan, who has been visiting different cities to release his book. Former Osmania University Dean P.L. Viveshwar Rao released the book and the event was presided by Siasat’s managing editor Zaheeruddin Ali Khan.

The Bench comprising Justice K. Vinod Chandran and Justice Ziyad Rahman also dismissed an appeal filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) challenging the acquittal of Abdul Halim and Aboobacker Yusaf. The court passed the verdict while allowing an appeal filed by Nazeer and Shafas challenging the order of the NIA Special Court convicting them in the case. NIA court judgment The NIA Special Court, Ernakulam, had awarded life imprisonment to Nazeer, the first accused, and Shafas, the fourth accused and had imposed a fine of Rs. 1.6 lakh and Rs. 1.1 lakh on Nazeer and Shafas respectively. Abdul Halim and Aboobacker Yusaf, the third accused and the ninth accused respectively, had already been acquitted by the special court. Sixth accused Fayiz died during the trial while seventh accused Shammi Firoz had turned approver. The court observed that there was “no reliable evidence on the preparation or commission of the crime that would incriminate the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The approver’s evidence fails miserably in the twin tests, that of inherent reliability and credibility as also on the aspect of corroboration.” The case According to the NIA chargesheet, Nazeer and the other accused had conspired, planned and executed the bomb blasts in the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation’s bus depot and the mofussil bus stand in Kozhikode on March 3, 2006. The NIA alleged that the blasts were carried out in retaliation against what they regarded as the “the perceived partisan action of the Executive and Judiciary in rejecting bail to the Muslim accused in the second Marad communal carnage”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-hc-acquits-two-accused-in-kozhikode-twin-blasts-case/article64991573.ece

The Commission (CWC) said the Supervisory Committee had visited the dam during its annual meetings held at the project site. “Till date 14 meetings of the Supervisory Committee have been held, the last one on February 19, 2021,” the report said. The records of past five of these meetings conclude that the “overall condition of the dam and its appurtenant structure, based upon visual inspection is found to be satisfactory”. The CWC however said “a fresh review of the safety of the Mullaperiyar dam is now due and is required to be undertaken”. The report said the safety aspects of the dam were under the watch of the Empowered Committee constituted by the Supreme Court in 2010. This committee had, from 2010 to 2012, “looked into and thoroughly investigated” the safety aspects. The Empowered Committee, with the help of expert organisations, had then “arrived the conclusion that the Mullaperiyar dam is found to be safe in all respects, viz, hydrologically, seismically and structurally”, the CWC report said. In the last hearing, the court had made it clear that it would not intervene to “administer the dam” when a Supervisory Committee was already in place to examine the issue of safety of the dam and the management of its water level. The court had said it was only concerned about the safety, security and health of the persons living in the vicinity of the dam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/condition-of-mullaperiyar-dam-satisfactory-cwc-tells-top-court/article38336883.ece

The party claims the girl took the step due to an alleged pressure to convert to Christianity from her school. BJP Mahila Morcha chief and Coimbatore MLA Vanathi Srinivasan said party president J. P. Nadda had authorised the setting up of a four-member committee for not just going into the “truth” of the case but also to “provide comfort to the bereaved family of Lavanya.” “Members of the committee are MP Sandhya Rai, BJP leader from Telangana Vijayshanti, Chitratai Wagh from Maharashtra, Karnataka Mahila Morcha president Geeta Vivekananda. They will be tasked with ascertaining the facts of the case, especially the allegations of conversion made by Lavanya in a video,” she said. Ms. Srinivasan also alleged that silence of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in this case was ominous. “When he was leader of the opposition, he raised his voice for each and every student who died by suicide but he hasn’t said a word in this case. Ministers of his government try to suppress the conversion angle. This is why we have no faith in any investigation being carried out in the case,” she said. The BJP has already demanded that the case be handed over to the CBI.

He said that the amount received through salaries would not be sufficient to lead respectable lives given the ever-rising rate of prices. Mr. Naidu formally inaugurated a relay hunger strike of the staff at the Collectorate in Srikakulam. “The government employees are facing many financial burdens as they are not eligible for any social welfare schemes, fee reimbursement or other benefits,“ he said. All employees were eagerly waiting for the PRC recommendations. But at the end, they were shocked by the announcement of 23% fitment and reduction in HRA, according to Mr. Naidu. A majority of the employees do not have houses of their own. They are unable to afford the steep rents in towns. In such a scenario, they would face more troubles with the deduction of salaries. It is the main reason behind the launching of their struggle to achieve 30% fitment and other benefits,” said Mr. Naidu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/employees-in-distress-due-to-meagre-salaries/article64991787.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:56 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||UDF asks Governor to reject Ordinance||The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) on Thursday sought the intervention of Governor Arif Mohammed Khan to thwart the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s “under-the-table” move to promulgate an Ordinance to “defang” the Kerala Lok Ayukta and relegate the Ombudsman to a “nominal advisory role” in critical public interest cases related to corruption, nepotism, maladministration and abuse of official power. A UDF delegation led by Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan met Mr. Khan and entreated him to withhold gubernatorial assent to the proposed executive order. Executive order Later talking to reporters outside Raj Bhavan, Mr. Satheesan said the CPI(M) had furtively pressed for an executive order in a Cabinet meeting last week to "dilute" Section 14 of the Kerala Lok Ayukta Act, 1999. The proposal aimed to forestall the Constitutional and political fallout of possible adverse Lok Ayukta findings against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Higher Education Minister R. Bindu. The Lok Ayukta is currently investigating allegations of corruption and nepotism against them. The complainants, including Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, had moved the ombudsman for a "declaration" banning the leaders from holding public office under Section 14 of the Act. The decisive section empowers the Lok Ayukta to recommend the "competent authority" to eject a corrupt public official from office and deter the offender from holding the post again. Such a declaration is final and binding and not subject to appeal as per the Act. Tellingly in 2021, an adverse declaration by the Lok Ayukta had cost LDF Independent legislator K.T. Jaleel his job as Higher Education Minister in the previous Pinarayi Vijayan Cabinet. “Suspicious haste” Mr. Satheesan said the government’s “suspicious haste” to abrogate Section 14 of the Act betrayed its visceral fear that Dr. Jaleel’s fate might befall Mr. Vijayan or Dr. Bindu. The amendment erroneously proposes to give the political executive appellate jurisdiction over Lok Ayukta's findings by tasking the Governor, Chief Minister, or the government, as the case may be, to accept or reject the ombudsman's ruling after hearing the opposing parties. The order, if allowed, would institutionalise corruption in government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/udf-asks-governor-to-reject-ordinance/article64991568.ece

She was 84. The Italian-born French art researcher was an ambassador of Kathakali and other Indian classical art forms in France. The country honoured her with Padma Shri, recognising her contributions to the field of Kathakali in 2019. To learn Kathakali Milena arrived at the Kerala Kalamandalam in 1965 from France with a scholarship to learn Kathakali. A Europe trip conducted by a 17-member Kathakali team of the Kerala Kalamandalam on invitation of Milena was a milestone in development of the Kalamandalam. She along with her partner Roger Filipuzzi started a school of Indian classical dance – Centre Mandapa - in Paris in 1975 for training classical dances, including Kathakali. The programmes organised by this dance centre in 1980 and 1999 was instrumental in popularising Koodiyattam across the world. Milena played a crucial role in getting Unesco recognition for Koodiyattam as an ancient art form and to include it in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity Programme in 2001. Contributions hailed In his condolence message, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled her passion towards Indian culture. “She made numerous efforts to further popularise Kathakali across France. I am anguished by her passing away. My thoughts are with her family and well-wishers. May her soul rest in peace,” the Prime Minister tweeted. Kerala Kalamandalam Vice Chancellor T.K. Narayanan, administrative committee members, teachers and students condoled death of Milena.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/padma-awardee-milena-salvini-dies/article64991571.ece

Chandrababu Naidu has urged Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan to order an impartial inquiry into the alleged conduct of a casino-style event at Gudivada recently. Mr. Naidu has also urged the Governor to order an inquiry into the alleged involvement of the ruling YSRCP leaders in the illegal activity, and their “unchecked” attacks on the opposition TDP leaders and cadres. In a letter to the Governor on Thursday, Mr. Naidu deplored that the administration in the State was deteriorating by the day. The latest in the series of untoward incidents was the casino organised at Gudivada in Krishna district from January 14 to 16, the TDP chief alleged. The conduct of such events hurt the Telugu culture, traditions and customs, he said, and alleged that women were made to do indecent dances at the event. Alleging the involvement of a Minister in organising the casino, Mr. Naidu said “lawmakers are turning into lawbreakers.” It was leaving a bad impact on contemporary society and politics, Mr. Naidu observed. Mr. Naidu further said that about 13 women were brought to Andhra Pradesh for the event and sent back to Goa on January 17. “More than Rs. 500 crore had changed hands at the Gudivada casino event,” the TDP chief alleged.

Chandrababu Naidu, on Thursday described the reorganisation of districts as nothing but a “politically motivated game to divert the attention of the people from the employees’ agitation.” There were instructions from the Central government that reorganisation of districts should not be taken up until the census was completed. Notwithstanding the instructions, the State government went ahead with the proposal as it was unable to face the rising public resentment on a variety of issues and problems. “The proposal to create new districts is only a diversionary tactics,” the party said. Formation of new districts should be conducive for administrative convenience and in accordance with the aspirations of the local people and should not give scope for new problems, the TDP observed. The TDP leaders said they had no objection to naming Krishna district after party founder- president N.T. Rama Rao if the YSRCP leaders truly respected him. The party reiterated its demand for conferring Bharat Ratna on NTR. “Though NTR’s name in Hyderabad airport had been removed, the party did not politicise it. Similarly, the party did not object to naming Kadapa district after former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy,” the TDP leaders said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/reorganisation-of-districts-a-diversionary-tactic-tdp/article38337282.ece

In a statement on Thursday, samithi president B. Dasaratha Rami Reddy said the proposal on new districts was unscientific. “The areas closer to the existing district headquarters have been annexed in the new district. Similarly, the places closer to the new district headquarters have been shown in the old districts.,” he said. The government failed to create the districts that help in the development of Rayalaseema, Mr. Rami Reddy observed. Migration issue “The new districts have been created based on the population of the Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies. The Rayalaseema region forms 40% of the total area of Andhra Pradesh. Based on it, 10 to 11 districts have to be formed in the region.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:55 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Move to carve out new districts evokes mixed reactions||In the exercise to create new districts, Visakhapatnam district has been proposed to be split into three — Visakhpatnam, Anakapalle and Alluri Sitharamaraju district. In the proposed bifurcation, the residual Visakhapatnam district will primarily comprise GVMC area and two revenue mandals such as Bheemunipatnam and Visakhapatnam. Under Bheemunipatnam revenue division - Anandapuram, Padmanabham, Visakhapatnam (Rural) and Maharanipeta, have been named as new mandals. Similarly under Visakhapatnam revenue division, the new mandals have been identified as Gajuwaka, Pedagantyada, Gopalapatnam, Mulagada and Seethammadhara. In total, the Visakhapatnam district will now have 10 mandals. As per the proposed carving out, now the two new districts Anakapalle and Alluri Sitharamaraju, which will be carved out of a larger Visakhapatnam, appears to have not only more mandals, but also seems to be bigger in size. Anakapalle will have two revenue divisions — Anakapalle and Narsipatnam. While Anakapalle division will have 15 mandals, including existing ones such as Devarapalli, Kasimkota, Yelamanchili and Rambilli. It will also include Parwada, Pendurthi and Sabbavaram, carved out of Visakhapatnam. Similarly, Narsipatnam division will have 10 mandals which include mandals such as Payakaraopeta, Golugonda, Makavarapalem, Ravikamatam and Kotauratla. In total, Anakapalle district will have about 25 mandals. The district of Alluri Sitharamaraju is again partly carved out of Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts and will comprise of two revenue divisions — Paderu and Rampachodavaram. It will retain all the 11 Agency mandals that are presently under Visakhapatnam district such as Koyyuru, GK Veedhi, Pedabayalu, Araku, Anantagiri, Paderu, Munchingput and Chintapalli, but will also have addition of seven mandals such as Rampachodavaram, Y. Ramavaram, Addateegala and Maredumilli from Rampachodavaram division of East Godavari district and four mandals such as Yetapaka, Kunavaram and Chintoor from Yetapaka division also from East Godavari. In total, as per the proposal it will have 22 mandals Though across sections of people, the decision to carve out new districts has been welcomed, as they believe that the idea behind is for better administration, a number of social thinkers among them say that the proposal lacks in-depth research. The idea of creation of smaller districts is good, but doing it on the basis of Parliamentary constituencies is a bit unsound, said V.S. Krishna of Human Rights Forum. Alluri Sitharamaraju District is proposed from Araku Lok Sabha Constituency, but extending it up to Ramachodavaram in East Godavari is a bit too much. The distance from Rampachodavaram to Paderu, the proposed district headquarters, is over 280 km, and the distance can be covered in 10 hours. What is use of carving out districts, if the logistic problems exist? he questioned. Ajay Kumar of All India Agricultural and Rural Labour Association (AIARLA) said that it would be ideal if Rampachodavaram and Yetapaka divisions were merged to form another district, he said. There is nothing wrong in having more districts, as both our neighbouring States Odisha and Tamil Nadu have more districts, despite their geographical area being less than Andhra Pradesh, he said. Safeguards sought in tribal areas Welcoming the proposal, former bureaucrat E.A.S Sarma said that the government should have organised gram sabhas in the tribal region before proposing the district, especially in the case of Alluri Sitharamaraju district, which is predominantly going to be a tribal district. Tribals should have been part of the decision making process, as this right is enshrined in the Constitution, he said. Mr. Sarma also suggested that once the districts come into force and infrastructure building begins, the State should ensure that tribal region is not taken over by realtors and entrepreneurs. “Safeguards should be in force,” he said. The former bureaucrat also expressed apprehension on the fate of 533 villages, which despite being inhabited by tribals are still to be included in the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution. “This is a long-pending demand and this is the time that such villages, which exist on the fringes of Agency areas be included into the schedule area,” said Mr. Sarma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/move-to-carve-out-new-districts-evokes-mixed-reactions/article64991580.ece

In a statement released on Thursday by E.A.S. Sarma, former secretary to the Ministry of Power and Economic Affairs andthe co-chair of the commission, it noted that the disinvestment is a matter of concern, as the proposed IPO is happening in the midst of a pandemic, which has upended millions of livelihoods. It also noted that at a time when there is a need to expand and consolidate social protection measures, a task that the LIC has performed commendably for so many decades, the thought itself was ill-timed.  Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Sarma said that the Union Government has not contributed anything beyond the initial capital of Rs. 5 crore, way back in 1956. All subsequent investments have come from policy holders’ contributions.  The commission pointed out that going in for disinvestmentwould result in changing of the character of LIC as the largest social security provider, andwould adversely affect the disadvantaged sections of the society. The manner in which the Union Government has recently amended the LIC Act, by reducing the profit share of the policy holders from 95% to 90%, is arbitrary andwould affect policy holders. According to Mr. Sarma, the argument that disinvestment of the LIC and other CPSEswould bring in additional fiscal resources is illusory, as the government can access the same resources from the common pool of savings in the economy on far better terms. The commission has demanded the Union Government to immediately withdrawits decision of disinvestment of LIC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/civil-outfit-decries-lic-disinvestment/article38337355.ece

His relentless services for the poor polio patients won him recognition at the national-level as he was one among the three from the State chosen for the prestigious Padma Shri award. However, it comes as no surprise to those who have seen his relentless work for the poor polio patients, through the Prema Hospital and also through camps conducted at various places in the country over the past few decades. It is not just his skill with the scalpel but also his affable nature and understanding, which endeared Dr. Adinarayana Rao to his patients, feel denizens. Countless patients, accompanied by their family members, would travel by train from as far as Gujarat and Rajasthan to get treated by him. Patients also used to come from from the USA, Canada and other nations including some from Pakistan before the Kargil war. Dr. Adinarayana Rao has conducted around three lakh surgeries and over 10 lakh operative procedures in a career spanning over four decades.  “We had conducted 419 surgeries on a single day at Mandavi in Kutch district of Gujarat more than a decade ago,” Dr. Adinarayana told The Hindu on Wednesday evening.  Born to Kanakam and Seshamma (both freedom fighters) in Bhimavaram town in West Godavari district, Dr. Adinarayana Rao had his early education at the ULCM High School. His parents taught him that serving the needy was more important than earning money. He did his M.B.B.S. in 1966 and M.S. (Ortho) in 1970 from Andhra Medical College. The surgeon used to accompany and assist his guru, the late Vyaghreswarudu, at the free orthopaedic camps conducted by the latter in different States of India. Seeing the gratitude in the eyes of patients and their kith and kin at those camps, made him realise that no amount of money could give one so much satisfaction. “Dr. Adinarayana did not know Hindi in those days and scores of patients, who used to come to the Prema Hospital from North India, did not know Telugu, I had the privilege of being the translator between them,” recalls Chandmal Agarwal, president of AP Pradeshik Marwari Sammelan, who has settled in the city, decades ago. Keen footballer Dr. Adinarayana is full of gratitude to the innumerable philanthropists, who had helped him in the conduct of free surgeries to the poor over the years. A keen footballer in his college days, Dr. Adinarayana was responsible for promoting the game in Visakhapatnam.

Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Veerraju said the BJP’s national policy was to have smaller States and more districts for administrative convenience. The party had declared in its 2014 election manifesto that it was for establishing 25 districts (one per each Parliamentary constituency) in Andhra Pradesh post bifurcation, he added. During the A.B.

A senior official confirmed that classes will reopen and clarity on staggered reopening for different grades or for entire classes will be decided in a day. “Classes will reopen and we are still discussing whether the primary classes could be opened a few days later,” he told The Hindu . The government is also waiting to see if the Central government releases any new guidelines before officially announcing it. “As of now the holidays are till January 30 only,” an official said.  Earlier, the government announced the Sankranti holidays till January 8 to 16 but later extended the holidays to January 30 in view of the rising COVID cases and also taking into consideration parents’ apprehensions. Health department officials apparently advised the government that the spread of COVID was not rising as expected at the start of the month and the recovery rate among the infected was fast and without many complications. Moreover, the vaccination drive was pretty fast and a large number of people were also opting for the booster dose. The government has also been under pressure from the school managements to reopen the schools from January 31 arguing that any delay would mean denying justice to students and a generation of them will get impacted if the closure continues. The Telangana Recognised School Management Association (TRSMA) recently met the Education Minister, Sabitha Indra Reddy and said the academic teaching days had already been lost and any delay would be disastrous for the learning capabilities of children. This is particularly applicable to students in budget schools where the majority of students study apart from the government schools. The TRSMA president, Y. Shekar Rao said that physical classes had been held just for 55 days so far out of the 220 mandatory days and urged the government to extend the academic year to May 30 this year rather than ending it on April 22. The curriculum has to be completed and before that students have to be brought back into learning mode. Mr. Rao claimed that there was pressure from parents and teachers apart from the students for reopening. When the stakeholders want it the government should not delay the reopening since the health officials too have given a positive report. There was no point in keeping malls, pubs and other business establishments open with large congregations but impose restrictions on educational institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-keen-to-reopen-colleges/article38337126.ece

The case pertains to alleged money laundering connected with illegal diversion of clients’ securities worth Rs. 2,873.82 crore by Karvy Stock Broking Ltd and pledging these securities with banks and NBFCs for seeking loans and subsequent loan default. The ED said that investigation began after HDFC Bank filed a complaint at the Central Crime Station. More complaints were filed by other banks later, they added. “The ED has uncovered a complex web of transactions designed by senior management of the Karvy Group to misuse the securities of their clients and to raise loans fraudulently, which were then rotated via multiple related companies and diverted away from the stated purpose. The shares of clients who did not owe any funds to KSBL were also transferred to the margin/ pool Account of KSBL and were pledged with the banks/ NBFCs. The Power Of Attorney (POA) given by clients to KSBL to facilitate exchange settlements was grossly misused by KSBL at the directions of the CMD and senior executives,” the ED said, adding that Mr Parathasarthy and Mr Krishna were the main conspirators who gave instructions to others. The ED said that the duo were in Central Jail in Bengaluru and were produced before the PMLA Special Court MSJ in Hyderabad January 20.

Aravind was by TRS party men and demanded that the government file cases against them and take action against the Nizamabad police commissioner for ‘facilitating’ the incident’, on Thursday. “It is shameful that the Government has not filed a FIR till now. We condemn the attack on our MP in strongest possible terms. It was done under the direction of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao which the police officials had diligently followed. Both DGP and Police Commissioner were aware of the murder plan. When did farmers take up swords to attack? TRS men are involved," charged party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar at a media briefing in Nandipeta. Mr. Sanjay Kumar along with Mr. Aravind, Adilabad MP Soyam Babu Rao, MLA M. Raghunandan Rao, P. Sudhakar Reddy and others visited the party workers injured in the attack at Armoor and other places to console them and their families, while assuring of total support from the leadership. The BJP had every right to question the government on the ‘forgotten’ assurances on jobs, stipend to the unemployed, Dalit Bandhu, free 2-bedroom housing and others. “The Government is unable to fulfill the promises made and has been resorting to raids against us with the CM himself egging on his party men,” he alleged. The party would not be cowed down by such ‘coercive’ methods and would continue to stand by people, he maintained. “Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao is getting frustrated at our growing popularity so he has been resorting to these acts. Was Telangana State formed for conducting these raids? Our national leadership too is seized of this latest incident," he observed. The party president exhorted the party men not to get demoralised with such attacks as TS people are seeking a change and would surely support the Bharatiya Janata Party in the next elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/attack-on-aravind-at-behest-of-trs/article64991757.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:18 IST,TELANGANA||French bean is a remunerative ID crop||In the wake of the Union government making it clear that it would not purchase boiled rice through Food Corporation o India (FCI) in the summer season and authorities making it clear that the paddy produced in Telangana will have more broken rice after milling due to high temperatures, the farmers are in dilemma to which crop they have to shift. The suggestion from agriculture experts is to go for irrigated and dry (ID) crops. One of those ID crops that is being encouraged by the agriculture extension officers at field level is French bean, most suitable crop for rabi season. As people became more conscious of health and are preparing to consume more protein-enriched food, this ‘vegetarian’s meat’ can meet the demand. Cultivating French bean was experimented successfully at Narayanpet mandal of Siddipet district and the results were encouraging. Majority of area in Narayanapet cluster is covered with red soil and light soils which are more suitable for French bean cultivation and it can be cultivated for dual purpose - it can be consumed as a vegetable and grain as a pulse - so called rajma. For rabi season it is sown in the months of October to November. This can be cultivated as summer crop in January after pongal and February. Duration of the crop is 100 to 120 days. Between 55 and 65 days after sowing, green bean will be ready for first picking as a vegetable. Maximum of three pickings can be taken and average yield will be between 20 quintals to 25 quintals per acre. The price is ranging between Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 5,000 per quintal. French bean as grain, the average yield will be between eight to nine quintals per acre. Last year the price in the market of grain (rajma) was Rs. 7,000 to Rs. 8,000 per quintal and the expectation is that the returns will be around Rs. 70,000 per acre. “In Narayanapet cluster, 20 farmers have cultivated French bean for both vegetable purpose and grain (rajma) in 25 acres. Farmer Kongari Narayana had sown the crop on October 20 and he got first picking in 55 to 65 days After sowing. Mr. Narayana already sold 10 quintals of green bean between Rs. 40 and Rs. 50 per kilogram and got return a return of Rs. 50,000 rupees.  If the demand in market falls down, the rest of crop can be retained for grains rajma. Another farmer Suthari Srinivas got a return of Rs. 1 lakh per acre. Some other farmers who had sown the crop late are waiting to harvest,” Narayanpet Agriculture Extension Officer (AEO) T. Nagarjuna said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/french-bean-is-a-remunerative-id-crop/article64991755.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:18 IST,TELANGANA||SCCL’s plans for new forays make slow progress||Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL), which has already diversified into thermal and solar power generation by having 2×600 megawatt and 220 MW units, respectively, in addition to its core activity of coal mining, is planning to enter varied activities such as sand and iron ore mining as well as other minerals. Although the pace of such plans is not moving on a fast track for now, some sustained activity is still in progress. The company has been planning to join hands with the State Mineral Development Corporation in the area of sand mining, not by bidding for sand quarrying blocks but by supplying sand segregated from the overburden removed for coal extraction. “Preliminary tests conducted for ascertaining the percentage of sand in the overburden for utilising it in the construction activity have thrown positive results,” a senior official of the SCCL said. As part of coal mining, the company removes overburden of over 300 million cubic metres every year and the overburden contains sand useful for the construction activity. The company has taken to exploring areas other than thermal and solar generation on the suggestion made by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao at several review meetings held on the company’s performance and the need to diversify further for sustaining the company for more generations. The company’s plans to enter iron ore and limestone mining have also not made much headway so far except for asking for a detailed project report on the same. “Once crystallised, the company could explore the opportunities of iron ore mining in Bayyaram and other areas in the State. However, such foraying needs the approval of the government. Admitting that company is more focused on protecting coal blocks within the Singareni areas now from the entry of private players following the rollout of plans by the Centre to privatise more coal blocks in the country, the SCCL officials said plans of setting up a floating solar power plant with 350 MW capacity on the waters of Lower Manair Dam near Karimnagar and adding an 800 MW unit to its thermal power in Mancherial district were moving in the right direction. “Survey work for the floating solar power plant is in progress and once that is completed the company will invite bidders for the tender of setting up the plant. Similarly, the proposal of adding another unit to the existing thermal power plant is also in progress”, the coal company officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sccls-plans-for-new-forays-make-slow-progress/article64991750.ece

An NGO, SAHE, has taken up the initiative to clear the step well of garbage. Two metric tonnes of garbage was removed from the step well 30.5 meters in length, 19.2 meters in width, and 53 feet deep. Mr. Srinivas Yadav said measures will be taken to restore the 17th century well by Independence Day this year. He visited the photo exhibition showing the status of the well before and after removal of the garbage, and said the well had been built to serve the drinking water needs of the yonder era. He promised that the government would make efforts to revive the rich cultural heritage of the city, in accordance with the wishes of Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao.

In a statement to the media, the associations also requested the government to revert the stamp duty, nala conversion rates and local body charges to the previous levels. It was pointed out that the market rates were revised just seven months ago by 30-100%, stamp duty by 3.75%, and nala charges by 50-67%. There are more than three lakh properties released recently from the prohibitory list and many are are yet to be released while lakhs of registration transactions are pending. The ongoing COVID pandemic wave too has put a halt to many activities as citizens are shying away from visiting public places especially registration offices. The associations pointed out that the industry and the government are yet to work out a mechanism to deal with menace of pre-sales, undivided share sales and 100% payment sales, which have affected the market and prices. Building materials like cement and steel prices in the meantime too have gone up significantly despite COVID, they added. Meanwhile, BJP senior leader Gudur Narayana Reddy said that any further increase in market rates would put house sites out of the reach of the common man and poor people. “The government is using every ‘backdoor’ method to increase its revenue and also inflate the forthcoming budget to show everything is well after encouraging rampant sale of liquor,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/defer-revision-of-market-rates-govt-urged/article38337107.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:18 IST,TELANGANA||National job guarantee scheme mooted||Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao has appealed to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman to announce National Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme (NUEGS) on the lines of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in the ensuing Union budget to help urban poor in the country. In a letter to Ms. Sitaraman today, Mr. Rao said the nature of urban poverty posed distinct challenges for housing, water, sanitation, health, education, social security and livelihoods. As per 2011 census, he said 31 per cent of Indian population or about 380 million people lived in urban areas. A sizeable chunk of the population was migrant labour engaged in construction activity, casual labourers, security staff, delivery boys, helpers or small vendors. It was evident in most of the urban areas that the urban poor were offered daily jobs on roadsides. They were deprived of their earning if they did not get work for that day. They were the worst hit by loss of employment during lockdown. Mr. Rao recalled that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour headed by Biju Janata Dal MP Bhatruhari Mahtab recommended that the Centre strengthen social security measures in urban areas and also suggested brining an urban employment guarantee scheme on the lines of MGNREGS. Social security The trade body Confederation of Indian Industry also sought social security measues in urban areas. In this background, Mr. Rao urged Ms. Sitaraman to thing big and come out with a policy measure to safeguard the interests, especially livelihoods of urban poor and raise their income levels. This was more so because urbanisation was unabated and the country would see a surge in urban population requiring more employment avenues to the growing labour force. Urban centres and towns had become the growth engines of Indian economy and the urban informal sector was the major thrust factor. Hence, it was high time for the government to create a facilitating environment for the urban informal sector in the form of skill upgradation, financial linkages and social security to labour. A national policy aimed at increasing the daily income for urban labour was the need of the hour. The country’s urban centres and towns aimed to provide qualify of life to citizens which could only be ensured if the urban labour engaged in informal sector had higher income levels to take care of their families.. They could be given job cards like in rural employment guarantee programme for engaging their services, Mr. Rao added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/national-job-guarantee-scheme-mooted/article64991753.ece

This year’s edition will unfold online (at youtube.com/c/hlf-india) from January 28 to 30. When the directors of the festival decided late last year to conduct HLF 2022 virtually, it appeared to be a preemptive move, factoring in the possibility of the third wave of COVID-19: “It was a good call to plan an online festival,” reckons Amita Desai of Goethe-Zentrum Hyderabad, one of the festival directors. HLF began in 2010 and in its physical form, hosted multidisciplinary events — literary sessions, poetry, storytelling, workshops, performing arts, theatre, art showcases, workshops and movie screenings. HLF 2022 will incorporate events in all these streams online. This year’s festival is dedicated to the late Ajay Gandhi, founder of Manthan and one of the former directors of HLF. Carnatic vocalist and writer T M Krishna will deliver a tribute to Mr Gandhi on the opening evening, before moving on to talk about ‘Artistic Universe: Creative Spaces Within and Without’. Mr. Gandhi was associated with the HLF since 2013 and worked alongside the other directors — professor T Vijay Kumar, Kinnera Murthy and Amita Desai. The guest nation for HLF 2022 is the United Kingdom and the Indian language in focus is Punjabi. A panel discussion titled ‘Lest we forget 1984’ will focus on Punjab; master photographer Raghu Rai and his wife Gurmeet Rai will be in conversation with academician Usha Raman in the session ‘Amritsar: A City in Remembrance’. The HLF team is aware of the digital fatigue among people, owing to extended online engagement during the pandemic. However, on the brighter side, the digital festival has enabled easier international participation.  For instance, the 60-minute interactive play The Art of Facing Fear: World United , features 20 actors from five continents.  The play is set in a dystopian future in the aftermath of the pandemic. Conceptualised in 2020, the play encourages the audience to share their fears and their tributes to their loved ones. The actors incorporate the text into the script. “The play acknowledges the mental trauma and touches upon other issues that people have been facing; in a non-preachy manner, it addresses how we can cope with a positive attitude,” explains Sumit Lai Roy of The Red Curtain International, which has collaborated with Brazil’s Os Satyros group for the play.  Literary sessions will take up diverse topics and the delegates include Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee and artist Cheyenne Olivier who will discuss their book Cooking to Save Your Life , Kavitha Rao for her book Lady Doctors: The Untold Stories of India’s First Women in Medicine , Nandana Dev Sen on poems penned by her mother Nabaneeta Dev Sen, Hyderabad writer Balaji Vittal and journalist Kaveri Bamzai discussing on-screen heroes and villains, and actor Divya Dutta holding forth on women in cinema.

The decision comes days after the city government accepted the Delhi Prisons’ proposal, moved every year on the occasion of Republic Day. “The Delhi government has issued orders on special remission for inmates in view of Republic Day. We are in the process of identifying the convicts who have shown good conduct. Over 400 to 450 inmates will benefit this year,” said DG (Prisons) Sandeep Goel. However, inmates who have been convicted of heinous crimes like rape and terror-related cases are barred from availing themselves of remission. Inmates who have to serve a jail term which is less than their remission period will be released immediately, said an officer. So far, three convicts have walked free after reduction of their sentence, he said. Granting remission is a discretionary power of the State government under Section 432 of CrPC where it can at any time suspend the execution of the convict’s sentence or remit the punishment. Mr. Goel said the remission process acts as a reward for a convict’s good behaviour and encourages other inmates to rehabilitate themselves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/govt-to-grant-remission-to-over-400-convicts-for-good-conduct/article38337028.ece

Excerpts: Why have you raised the ‘85 vs 15’ slogan in this U.P. election?  In public meetings, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed pain that he had been called neech (lowly) because he was born in a pichdi jati (backward caste). This was the biggest reason for me to join the BJP.  But when the government was formed and I got a chance to be a part of it, I found that the BJP does exactly the opposite of what it claims. They crossed all limits when they started tampering with reservation and started filling seats meant for reserved categories with people from general categories, bypassing the constitutional system and arbitrarily. In the appointment of 69,000 teachers, in 19,000 reserved seats they handed appointment letters to applicants from the general category. What happened in the BJP government over the past five years that you had to resort to this formulation? This government did not run a special campaign to fill the backlog of reserved posts but of the general category. On many instances, I asked them that you talk of ‘80 vs 20’ but tamper with the reservation of the OBCs, the SCs and the STs, who voted for you in large numbers, don’t you consider them as Hindus? They did not have any reply to this. Whenever someone tries to hurt the interests of the Dalits and the OBCs, I not only oppose it, but with a feeling of vengeance, I also try to wipe out their existence. You say you have ideological differences with the BJP and despite this you worked as a Minister for five years. Your conflict is between Hindutva and Bahujan politics or Ambedkarite and RSS politics?  You (BJP) cannot destroy the constitutional rights of reservation for the SC, ST and OBC sections, by raising a slogan of Hindu, Muslim. You cannot tamper with and mock the constitutional arrangement. You cannot bury the 85% weaker sections and do politics over their body. This is why I exposed their wrong policies. And whatever allegations I have levelled against them, no BJP leader, big or small, could rebut. Because they are at fault.  But the BJP claims that it is the best party for the interests of backward caste people…  Even the backward castes were taken over by this fallacy. When Modi ji stated that people considered him neech (lowly) because he was born in pichdi jati (backward caste), I thought their chehra (face) and charitra (character) may have changed. But after working for five years, I felt that their face may have definitely changed but the nature of their work and thinking did not. They want to make a brunch out of society and swallow the rights of those standing at the end of society, just like a python. And due to this, the poor, Dalits, backwards and the deprived sections of society have resolved to get together and uproot the BJP and form an SP government.  Why didn’t you quit earlier and resigned just before election? It is also being said that many of those MLAs who quit after you were already being denied ticket by the BJP. A public mandate is given for every five years. I honoured the public mandate. When the time for a new mandate came, I exposed their black deeds. The BJP sometimes also talks about the ‘60 vs 40’ formula. It mobilises the rest of the Hindu communities against Jatavs, Yadavs and Muslims. Will this equation work again?  BJP is the Indian British ( Bharatiya Angrez ). They follow the policy of divide and rule. They want to make backward castes and Dalits fight each other by tearing them into two parts. But the response to their manipulations is the ‘85-15’. And about the ‘80 vs 20’, I want to ask BJP leaders, didn’t Ashfaqullah face the gallows for this country? Didn’t Veer Abdul Hamid destroy dozens of Pakistani tanks and achieve martyrdom? So why Hindu-Muslim, when Muslims have sacrificed their lives for the nation?   They want to make a brunch out of society and swallow the rights of those standing at the end of society, just like a python||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-tampering-with-reservation-bypassing-the-constitutional-system/article64991810.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:51 IST,||U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer set to retire||The senior most justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal, is expected to announce his retirement, making way for U.S. President Joe Biden to nominate another justice in his place. The court is split 6-3 between conservatives and liberals, with the opening allowing Democrats to appoint someone, who could serve decades on the court. Democrats will be looking to get a replacement on the bench after the 83-year-old justice steps down this summer — and while they still have control over the evenly split Senate, with Vice-President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote. “If all Democrats hang together — which I expect they will — they have the power to replace Justice Breyer in 2022 without one Republican vote in support,” Senator Lindsey Graham, the previous chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee (the body that confirms nominations), said on Twitter. Mr. Biden has previously said he would nominate a Black woman to the highest court if the opportunity arose. Supreme Court justices are given lifetime appointments and sometimes die in office, as was the case with liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020. Asked to comment on the possibility of the Justice Breyer’s retirement on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said he did not want to get ahead of any announcement from the justice, whose expected retirement was reported in the American press but is not yet official. “The President has stated and reiterated his commitment to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court and certainly stands by that,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said , as she also declined to confirm whether Justice Breyer would retire, saying it was up to the justice to announce it. Asked if Vice-President Kamala Harris would be nominated by Mr. Biden, Ms. Psaki said Mr. Biden intends to run for office again with Ms. Harris as his running mate. Names in the running for Justice Breyer’s replacement include Ketanji Brown Jackson, a U.S. Court of Appeals judge, California Supreme Court (i.e. the highest state court) Justice Leondra Kruger, U.S. District Judge Michelle Childs and civil rights lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill. Justice Breyer was appointed to the Court in 1994 by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. During his career he has questioned the constitutionality of the death penalty, supported healthcare coverage and strengthened abortion rights. He is also known for his ability to reach a compromise and has a reputation for being a pragmatist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-set-to-retire/article64991936.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:51 IST,||Address Russia’s ‘legitimate concerns’, China tells U.S.||China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday told his U.S. counterpart Antony Blinken that Russia’s “legitimate concerns” needed to be addressed amid rising tensions over Ukraine. The U.S. Secretary of State, in the phone call, “underscored the global security and economic risks posed by further Russian aggression against Ukraine and conveyed that de-escalation and diplomacy are the responsible way forward”, the U.S. State Department quoted him as saying. The phone call on Thursday came as Mr. Blinken said the U.S. had given Moscow a document “setting out a serious diplomatic path forward” and highlighting U.S. concerns about Russian actions, including a build-up of troops. Call for diplomacy China, which maintains close relations with Russia, has been largely muted on the crisis except for calling for diplomacy. Mr. Wang’s comments in the call with Mr. Blinken are the strongest yet in support of Russia, whose President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to be in Beijing next week to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and attend the opening of the Winter Olympics on February 4. Mr. Wang said China “calls on all parties to remain calm and refrain from inflaming tensions or hyping up the crisis” and added that “the security of one country should not be at the expense of the security of others, and regional security should not be guaranteed by strengthening or even expanding military blocs”, referring to NATO. He said that “Russia’s legitimate security concerns should be taken seriously and addressed.” On China-U.S. relations, he said “the top priority was for the U.S. side is to stop interfering in the Beijing Winter Olympics, stop playing with fire by playing the ‘Taiwan card’ and stop forming all kinds of small cliques aimed at working against and containing China”. The U.S. has said its officials will boycott the Winter Olympics — although its athletes are participating — because of human rights violations in Xinjiang. The U.S. State Department, in a brief readout of the call, said both had “exchanged views on how to advance work together following President Biden’s virtual meeting with President Xi on November 15, 2021, including on managing strategic risk, health security, and climate change.” Relations between the two sides had plunged amid a trade war and differences over a range of issues from Taiwan to the South China Sea and investigations into the origins of COVID-19, with tensions spiralling under the previous Donald Trump administration. Some Chinese experts had expected a change of course and greater stability with Mr. Biden taking office. The Biden administration has, however, made clear it would confront China and compete on issues where needed, and seek cooperation where it can. Many of the previous administration’s policies, particularly on trade, have so far remained in place. Mr. Wang in the call said there “has been no substantive change in the tone of the U.S. policy towards China and Biden’s pledges have not been fully delivered”. “Pressure will only make the Chinese people more united,” he said, “and confrontation will not stop China from becoming stronger.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/address-russias-legitimate-concerns-china-tells-us/article38336580.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:51 IST,||EU launches WTO case against China for ‘targeting’ Lithuania||The European Union angered China on Thursday by launching a case against Beijing at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for targeting Lithuania over its stance on Taiwan. The move by Brussels was a further deterioration in ties between China and the bloc, with a long-negotiated investment deal already on the rocks after both sides exchanged tit-for-tat sanctions. The latest spat is over Lithuania, one of the smallest countries in the European Union, which made waves in July when it allowed Taiwan to open a diplomatic outpost in Vilnius. The move outraged Beijing, which does not recognise Taiwan as a state and considers the self-ruled democratic island a rebellious territory of the mainland. “Launching a WTO case is not a step we take lightly,” said the EU’s trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis in a statement. “However, after repeated failed attempts to resolve the issue bilaterally, we see no other way forward than to request WTO dispute settlement consultations with China,” he said. The European Commission handles trade policy for the EU’s 27 member states and takes the lead on conflicts at the WTO in Geneva, even if they involve a single state. By going to the WTO, the EU lent support to accusations by Lithuanian business leaders and officials that the row has resulted in China blocking imports from Lithuania and other economic restrictions. The move on Thursday launches a 60-day window for the two sides to come to a solution before moving the dispute to a panel. Beijing responded bitterly to the move, calling accusations of the “so-called” Chinese coercion “groundless and inconsistent”. “The issue between China and Lithuania is a political one, not an economic one,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eu-launches-wto-case-against-china-for-targeting-lithuania/article38336581.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:51 IST,||For Afghan evacuations, Johnson ‘prioritised’ pets||The U.K. government denied on Thursday that embattled Prime Minister Boris Johnson had prioritised pets over people in the chaotic evacuation out of Afghanistan as Kabul fell to the Taliban. The issue involving a British animal charity fuelled questions about Mr. Johnson’s truthfulness as he awaits an internal inquiry into lockdown-breaching parties that could determine his fate as leader. After launching its own investigation, London’s Metropolitan Police force was said to be poring over the “partygate” findings by a senior civil servant, holding up the report’s release. Foreign Ministry emails from August, newly released by a parliamentary committee, showed diplomats referring to a decision taken by Mr. Johnson to evacuate the staff and animals of the Nowzad animal charity. Mr. Johnson at the time denied insisting on preferential treatment for the charity, which sheltered dogs and cats in Afghanistan and was run by a media-savvy former soldier, Paul “Pen” Farthing. “Equivalent charity Nowzad, run by an ex-Royal Marine, has received a lot of publicity and the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated,” one email said, referring to other charities wanting the same treatment. ‘Afghans left behind’ The rushed nature of the evacuation meant many Afghans, who had served the British in various capacities, were left behind. The U.K. has been working since to repatriate those it can reach under Taliban control. Downing Street on Wednesday reiterated Mr. Johnson’s denials about Nowzad in light of the leaked emails, and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace insisted he had been given no order from the Prime Minister to prioritise pets. “The PM didn’t make any individual decisions about evacuations,” Cabinet Minister Therese Coffey told Sky News on Thursday. “A lot of people will claim that the PM is involved in supporting their particular pet projects, but the PM said he wasn’t involved in individual decisions,” Ms. Coffey said. Senior Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat agreed it was possible that some civil servants had exploited Mr. Johnson’s name after his wife Carrie — an animal rights campaigner and friend of Farthing — reportedly intervened.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/for-afghan-evacuations-johnson-prioritised-pets/article38336583.ece

Korea fires 2 missiles as testing blitz continues||North Korea fired two suspected ballistic missiles on Thursday, Seoul said, its sixth weapons test this month in one of the most intense spates of launches on record that has delivered an emphatic rejection of Washington’s offers for talks on its nuclear programme. Pyongyang has not fired this many missiles in a calendar month in decades, according to data compiled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies — a Washington-based think tank. The last time they came close was in 2019, after high-profile negotiations between leader Kim Jong-un and then-U.S. President Donald Trump collapsed. With U.S. talks stalled since then, Pyongyang has doubled down on Mr. Kim’s pledges of military modernisation, embarking on a string of sanctions-busting launches this month, including hypersonic missiles. The sabre-rattling comes at a delicate time in the region, with Mr. Kim’s sole major ally China hosting Winter Olympics next month and South Korea gearing up for a presidential election in March. Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected two suspected short-range ballistic missiles fired from the Hamhung city area towards the East Sea from around 8 a.m. Pyongyang fired two suspected cruise missiles on Tuesday, and tested ballistic missiles on January 14 and 17. It also fired what it said were hypersonic missiles on January 5 and 11. “I believe, if we include the two cruise missiles, this is now the most recorded North Korean missile launches in any month ever,” analyst Ankit Panda wrote on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/n-korea-fires-2-missiles-as-testing-blitz-continues/article38336582.ece

An IS assault on the sprawling Ghwayran prison complex near the city of Hasakeh on January 20 sparked six days of fighting, in violence that claimed more than 200 lives. It was the most high-profile attack launched by the jihadists since the loss of their “caliphate” nearly three years ago. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said they had retaken full control of Ghwayran prison on Wednesday, ending battles that turned the largest city in northeastern Syria into a war zone. But search operations the next day found around 60-90 jihadists still holed up in one wing of the prison, the SDF said, adding that 3,500 IS inmates had so far surrendered to its forces. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Kurdish forces are combing areas inside the prison, proceeding with “great caution over fears of suicide bombers or landmines laid by the IS”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sdf-combing-for-is-fighters-after-jail-attack/article38336584.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:32 IST,||What approach should we adopt to treat Omicron?||With Omicron becoming the dominant COVID-19 variant in the country, and with its reputation of being a ‘milder’ form of the disease, there is a debate raging on what treatment methodologies are appropriate. Should we adopt a conservative line or an aggressive line to treat Omicron? The responses to SARS-CoV-2 have been changing constantly, whether in the form of treatment or social restrictions. In a conversation moderated byRamya Kannan, infectious diseases specialists Dr. V. Ramasubramanian and Dr. Subramanian Swaminathan discuss the question and the challenges of responding to an evolving pandemic. Edited excerpts: Omicron has a reputation for being ‘mild'. Is this true? Dr. V. Ramasubramanian:We are fortunate that the current third wave, which is caused predominantly by the strains of lineages of Omicron, appears mild. In other words, the disease is much more rapidly transmissible but disease severity is significantly less compared to the Delta variant. The incubation period is much shorter, the transmissibility is much, much higher and faster, and the disease is mild. The only slight difference I would say is that unlike Delta, which caused milder infections among younger people, we find now that even youngsters have high-grade fever. But fortunately, it settles down in three to four days in most people. Even though Omicron has significant mutations, and it spreads very fast, disease severity is lower compared to Delta. Dr. Subramanian Swaminathan:Delta was an unmitigated disaster for the whole world, not just for us. We do have a lot of symptomatic disease now. We are seeing quite a few of the extremely elderly, especially those with co-morbidities, now coming in with severe disease; my ICU is currently full. And I have quite a few patients who we would classify as critical COVID-19 cases. And let's not forget that mortality is not insignificant. We call this variant mild, based on the need for oxygen. But having said that, I'm seeing an increasing number of people who are completely miserable due to Omicron because of the fatigue and body ache it causes. I'm seeing a lot of elderly people with mental fogginess. They have loss of energy, some of them tend to buckle and fall, some have had a fall in blood pressure. None of this would qualify as severe disease, but the symptoms in older people can be dangerous. So, while treating COVID-19, presumably since the dominant strain is now Omicron, do we take a conservative approach or a more aggressive path? Dr. Ramasubramanian:It’s a difficult question in the sense that there are people who can become sick — for instance, the elderly with co-morbidities can end up very sick. But if you look at the percentage of people who become sick, it's very small compared to the number of people who fall ill and have symptoms, which is significantly higher than what we saw with Delta. So, people who are elderly, have co-morbidities, or people who are unvaccinated can fall ill. But this percentage is very small. Because [symptoms in] most people settle in three to four days, we have a window of at least five days before we need to react to it. I don't think we should hurry and give something on the first or second day of the infection. So, my advice has been to wait for three to four days. If by the fourth day, the patient is feeling significantly better, which is what happens to most people, they should be fine. But if by day four or five, things are not settling down, the patient is not feeling better, we need to probably act. Dr. Subramanian:I agree with that. Jumping the gun and running for medicines for every patient is probably ill advised. I think we should be very generous with things like paracetamol. Rest, drink lots of fluids. The [symptoms in] the majority of patients are going to settle very nicely. Is vaccination helping keep death, severe disease and hospitalisation at bay? Are more children infected now? Dr. Subramanian:The vaccine campaign has been one of the major victories that we've had in reducing the impact of COVID-19. That is certainly making a difference. The question is, how long does immunity last and how effective is it, especially in the most vulnerable groups? Obviously, the unvaccinated do remain a significant vulnerable group. However, we are noticing that among patients 70 years and above, especially those who have multiple co-morbidities, if the second dose of the vaccine was administered to them more than six months ago, it seems as though it is not protecting them adequately. Those who had received the second dose of the vaccine within the last six months didn't seem to do so badly, irrespective of their age. So, I think there is some value in the booster dose. And I really wish we had started administering the third dose earlier. And yes, we are getting a lot of children and adolescents coming in with fever. But thankfully, the majority of children do not have a problem. Just watching symptoms and providing symptomatic therapy is enough. My colleagues are telling me that children are coming in with fever-induced seizures. It’s too early for us to say if there is a real link with COVID-19 or is just happenstance. But that's something that we need to observe very carefully. Dr. Ramasubramanian:With regard to vaccination helping, it is spot on. But we have seen that as the antibodies wane, there is a higher risk of picking up Omicron. Now studies have shown that if a booster dose or a third dose had been given to people, they would have stood a lower chance of having symptomatic Delta virus infection. If your immunity after two doses was about 80-90% and went down after six months or so and you were given a booster for the Delta virus infection, the protective efficacy would have gone up again to 80% or 90%. In other words, the booster would have brought up your level of protection from symptomatic disease to 80-90%. But with Omicron, protection from the third dose was actually only about 50-60%. So, the booster dose was not as effective for Omicron in preventing symptomatic disease as it was with the Delta variant. This has been clearly documented. But if you look at severity, which warrants hospitalisation or complications and death, even for Omicron, the third dose actually did very well. The necessity for a booster in preventing serious infections, whether it is Omicron or Delta, is very well established. But one thing I would like to add is, even though we are looking at administering three doses for most people, I think the priority is to ensure the two doses are given to the entire population. How do you deal with the constantly changing goal posts for treatment for COVID-19? Dr. Subramanian:The process of data gathering is not necessarily linear or streamlined. If we look at medicine as such, we have evolved our way of looking at the data and understanding the science of it in a much better way right now than we did, say, 50 years ago. When you have a new problem, and a new molecule, and new drugs, if there is one study done very well with enough numbers, it may be fairly useful in concluding the path ahead. But we need to do studies in different settings and populations, and then decide how it works. During an evolving pandemic, what is true in one wave may or may not be applicable in the second wave, especially when it comes to antivirals. That’s exactly where we’re going. The third thing is that it also depends on the kind of population we are looking at. For example, a lot of the studies, on the basis of which we have got approvals for various drugs, were done on people who were unvaccinated. But now, nearly all the people who are coming in are vaccinated. When we talk about COVID care, there are two parts to it — antivirals and the treatment of hypoxia. And the good news is that for the second part of the treatment, which is treatment of severe COVID-19, which is basically lung injury, the data on treatment are fairly clear. The antiviral use is a moving target and it changes based on where you are and who you are studying. Dr. Ramasubramanian:Medicine is constantly evolving. But what we have to understand is that there are two issues. One is medical and the other is advocacy. If you look at the medical evidence, this should be based purely on science, purely on randomised control studies. But these kinds of trials and studies take time, you cannot be waiting around to come up with advocacy. The advocacy will involve political issues, logistic issues, such as the question of lockdown. In the early part of the pandemic, all kinds of drugs were recommended for all kinds of situations. That has been streamlined. So, we have definitely become a lot better in our approach to handling this crisis. But we need to understand that this situation is constantly evolving. Earlier, nobody was vaccinated; now we have a vaccinated population. So, would the same drugs work? It depends on the population dynamics and behaviour; on the susceptibility of each person to infection, whether they are unvaccinated/vaccinated; on the immune response to earlier infections. And most importantly, it would depend on the variants and how they behave. So, the bottom line is, this is still constantly evolving, and we need to learn along the way. Is it possible to ensure that certain recommended protocols are implemented across the country? Dr. Subramanian:It's a pretty complex area. While COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on it, it is happening everywhere else. So, therefore, while the government has had very detailed guidelines on treatment for several diseases, not many doctors are aware of them. There is obviously a problem in education and dissemination, and that needs to be addressed. These protocols should be strictly followed in academic institutions. Only if that happens will we be able to fix the private sector. Dr. Ramasubramanian:With regard to COVID-19, even with evidence there is a problem because this is constantly evolving and what was true two months ago may not be valid now. In the Indian situation, one more complication is the spectrum of care which is given to the patient, unlike in the U.S. or the U.K., where the standard of care is a very small band and the best and the worst fall within the band. In India, the best hospital is probably on par with or better than some hospitals in the West, but the worst hospitals are really bad. So, it is very difficult to come up with guidelines to cover this entire spectrum of population and healthcare delivery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/what-approach-should-we-adopt-to-treat-omicron/article64991969.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:50 IST,||Punjab is more than just another election||Is the forthcoming Assembly election in post-1966 reorganised Punjab, its thirteenth, going to mark any significant deviation from the State’s long-term electoral trends and issues? For any discernible observer of Punjab politics, the trends have been as follows: presence of electoral regions, identity politics, competitive populism, ascendance of the State-level party and leadership, close contests, electoral volatility and pragmatic electoral alliances/coalition government. The issues that have remained with the State for over two decades include: ethnic peace, human security, endemic economic crisis in the post-Green Revolution phase, ecological crisis, institutionalised corruption and, more recently, an exodus of youth, drug menace, sacrilege, farm laws, among others. On social assertion While the issues are State-specific as elsewhere, in terms of trends, cross-State comparisons show the ‘exceptionalism’ of Punjab in the absence of the incremental transfer of political power to socially marginal communities through the electoral route. Assertion from below remains elusive despite nearly a third of the State population being from 39 Scheduled Castes (34 reserved seats out of 117 after the fourth delimitation exercise). And also when Dalits are comparatively economically well off.  And in terms of electoral participation, Punjab has registered numbers that are consistently more than the national average in recent elections. The sheer dominance of the landowning and numerically strong Jat Sikh community in Punjab politics is unparalleled when compared with the non-twice born land-owning dominant castes in other States (the Reddys, Khammas, Lingayats, Nayars, Vokkaligas, Kapus, to name a few). Barring Zail Singh, all the Chief Ministers and the leaders of most parties have been Jat Sikhs in the Punjabi Suba , a testament to the asymmetrical power structure that defines the State polity. Even caste Hindus and Khatri Sikhs have played second fiddle in the State’s politics.  Not much political traction Punjab exhibits another ‘exceptional’ trend — in the inability of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in making electoral gains despite entering into a long-term alliance with the Akali Dal, a State party. One can refer to the fruitful alliances the BJP has stitched in different States in the past, i.e. the Biju Janata Dal, Trinamool Congress, the two Janata Dals (Secular and United), the Telugu Desam Party, the Shiv Sena, and the Asom Gana Parishad. Instead of gaining, the BJP has witnessed shrinking of its social constituency of urban trading/professional caste-Hindus. Confined to 23 constituencies, the party has gradually ceded a part of its urban upper caste base to the Congress, polling less than 9% of the vote in the last five Assembly elections. There is much continuity visible in the present elections both in terms of the trends mentioned above and issues: new pragmatic alliances are now in place BJP-Punjab Lok Congress-Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt); Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal)-Bahujan Samaj Party; parties are gung-ho about making tall, unrealistic promises and not seeking a vote on their past performances in government (for example, one has the Rs. 1,000 a month for every woman in the State that the Aam Aadmi Party, or AAP, ‘promises’). Identity politics is playing out along caste and communal lines (AAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has declared that a Sikh would be the chief ministerial face of AAP; Sunil Jakhar of the Congress being denied chief ministership ostensibly for being a Hindu, and the Akali Dal promising a Dalit Deputy Chief Minister if voted to power). In the Congress Factionalism in the Congress is rife, with Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu fighting it out to be the chief ministerial face of the Congress. There is also Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa leading the Akali faction, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) against the official Akali Dal. The BJP has been raising the issue of national security, territorial integrity, Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, which has now been taken up by Punjab Lok Congress headed by Captain Amarinder Singh. Governance issues, the drug menace, corruption, unemployment and the mafia raj have now become the staple electoral issues. So, this election is also witnessing both SAD and the Congress blaming each other for not doing enough when in power. Interestingly, the present Congress government led by Mr. Channi seems very keen to blame the government led by Captain Amarinder as if it was the Opposition government! The most vocal over these issues has been AAP — understandably so as it has never been in power in the State and was first off the block to raise the drug issue back in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Impact of farm laws The run-up to the present election has, however, witnessed two recent developments which mark deviations in terms of trends and issues, thereby making it an unusual one. The year-long farmers’ movement against the three contentious farm laws has cast its shadow over State politics. Reeling under the threat of losing its core social constituency of the Jat Sikh landed peasantry, the Akali Dal broke up with the BJP (an alliance firmly in place since the 1990s). The breakup is likely to result in the loss of votes for both parties. While the BJP could lose the Akali rural Sikh vote, the Akali Dal could lose the much-needed Hindu vote that has allowed it to take on the Congress which has always had decent support among the Sikhs. The Akali Dal has suffered a dent (which can be called long term) in its image as being the farmers’ party due to its initial support for the farm laws. As for the Congress, it deftly kept away from the farmers’ wrath by mouthing support for the cause without getting directly involved. The movement has paved the way for the formation of the Samyukta Samaj Morcha (SSM) by 22 farmers’ unions — the first such political initiative by the landowning Jat Sikh farmers in the State. The development has the potential to harm AAP which has been hoping again to receive former Akali voters (like in the 2017 election, especially in the Malwa region), who are disgruntled also over the sacrilege incidents involving Sikh holy scriptures and subsequent firing at protesters in 2015 when the Akali Dal was in power. The performance of the SSM may have electoral implications in a multi-cornered contest as in the last Assembly election, there were 16 constituencies where the margin of win was less than 2%. The Dalit vote In the long term, the movement has rekindled the focus on farmers’ issues and farmers are being seen as a distinct voting community. The elevation and installation of Mr. Channi as the first Dalit Chief Minister is also supposed to have far-reaching consequences. Even though he is an ‘accidental’ Chief Minister — as the Congress high command chose him only after powerful Jat Sikh leaders Navjot Singh Sidhu and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa cancelled out each other — the Congress is now betting on him to consolidate the Dalit vote, thus ensuring the party win. There are 54 constituencies where Dalits constitute more than 30% of the listed voters, which is a significant factor in this multi-cornered contest. The Dalit vote so far has remained fractured mainly along religious lines, going to the Congress and the Akali Dal whereas the other claimant, the BSP, has been in a state of terminal decline, polling less than 5% of the vote and no seat in the last three and four Assembly elections, respectively. Mr. Channi has been prudent enough so far not to challenge the existing social power structure, thus averting a possible counter-mobilisation of Jat Sikhs. Arguably, in case of a Congress win, it would be difficult to displace him — a fact that explains the restlessness of Mr. Sidhu. Mr. Channi is projecting himself as the original ‘aam aadmi’ who has risen from the ranks to take on a resurgent AAP. Irrespective of the results, uncertain due to so many parties in contention and given the State’s history of narrow margins in wins, Mr. Channi’s appointment has already opened up the political space so far dominated by Jat Sikhs.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:51 IST,||India’s economy and the challenge of informality||Since 2016, the Government has made several efforts to formalise the economy. Currency demonetisation, introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), digitalisation of financial transactions and enrolment of informal sector workers on numerous government Internet portals are all meant to encourage the formalisation of the economy. But why the impetus for formalisation? The formal sector is more productive than the informal sector, and formal workers have access to social security benefits. The above-mentioned efforts are based on the “fiscal perspective” of formalisation. This perspective appears to draw from a strand of thought advanced by some international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, which foregrounds the persistence of the informal sector to excessive state regulation of enterprises and labour which drives genuine economic activity outside the regulatory ambit. It underplays informality as an outcome of structural and historical factors of economic backwardness. Arguably, excessive regulation and taxation ensure the endurance of informal activities. Hence, it is believed that simplifying registration processes, easing rules for business conduct, and lowering the standards of protection of formal sector workers will bring informal enterprises and their workers into the fold of formality. The fiscal perspective has a long lineage in India going back to tax reforms initiated in the mid-1980s. Early on, in an attempt to promote employment, India protected small enterprises engaged in labour intensive manufacturing by providing them with fiscal concessions and regulating large-scale industry by licensing. Questions of efficiency aside, such measures led to many labour-intensive industries getting diffused into the informal/unorganised sectors. Further, they led to the formation of dense output and labour market inter-linkages between the informal and formal sectors via sub-contracting and outsourcing arrangements (quite like in labour abundant Asian economies). In the textile industry, the rise of the power looms at the expense of composite mills in the organised sector and handlooms in the unorganised sector best illustrates the policy outcome. While such policy initiatives may have encouraged employment, bringing the enterprises which benefited from the policy into the tax net has been a challenge. The challenge is only partly administrative. Political and economic reasons operating at the regional/local level in a competitive electoral democracy are responsible for this phenomenon, too. Sign of underdevelopment Undoubtedly, widening the tax net and reducing tax evasion are necessary. However, global evidence suggests that the view that legal and regulatory hurdles alone are mainly responsible for holding back formalisation does not hold much water. A well-regarded study, ‘Informality and Development’ (https://bit.ly/3KOBEVx), argues that the persistence of informality is, in fact, a sign of underdevelopment. Across countries, the paper finds a negative association between informality (as measured by the share of self-employed in total workers) and per capita income. The finding suggests that informality decreases with economic growth, albeit slowly. A similar association is also evident across major States in India, based on official PLFS data. Hence, the persistence of a high share of informal employment in total employment seems nothing but a lack of adequate growth or continuation of underdevelopment. Transformation in Asia The defining characteristic of economic development is a movement of low-productivity informal (traditional) sector workers to the formal or modern (or organised) sector — known as structural transformation. East Asia witnessed rapid structural change in the second half of the 20th century as poor agrarian economies rapidly industrialised, drawing labour from traditional agriculture. However, in many parts of the developing world, including India, informality has reduced at a very sluggish pace, manifesting itself most visibly in urban squalor, poverty and (open and disguised) unemployment. Despite witnessing rapid economic growth over the last two decades, 90% of workers in India have remained informally employed, producing about half of GDP. Combining the International Labour Organization’s widely agreed upon template of definitions with India’s official definition (of formal jobs as those providing at least one social security benefit — such as EPF), the share of formal workers in India stood at 9.7% (47.5 million). Official PLFS data shows that 75% of informal workers are self-employed and casual wage workers with average earnings lower than regular salaried workers. Significantly, the prevalence of informal employment is also widespread in the non-agriculture sector. About half of informal workers are engaged in non-agriculture sectors which spread across urban and rural areas. It has many layers It needs to be appreciated that informality is now differentiated and multi-layered. Industries thriving without paying taxes are only the tip of the informal sector’s iceberg. What remains hidden are the large swathes of low productivity informal establishments working as household and self-employment units which represent “petty production”. To conflate the two distinct segments of the informal sector would be a serious conceptual error. Survival is perhaps the biggest challenge for most informal workers (and their enterprises), and precarity defines their existence. Despite (well-intentioned) efforts at formalisation, the challenge of informality looms large for India. The novel coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated this challenge. Research by the State Bank of India recently reported the economy formalised rapidly during the pandemic year of 2020-21, with the informal sector’s GDP share shrinking to less than 20%, from about 50% a few years ago — close to the figure for developed countries. As we have argued elsewhere (https://bit.ly/3G6JtST), these findings of a sharp contraction of the informal sector during the pandemic year (2020-21) do not represent a sustained structural transformation of the low productive informal sector into a more productive formal sector. They are a temporary (and unfortunate) outcome of the pandemic and severe lockdowns imposed in 2020 and 2021. The informal sector will perforce spring back to life soon, for sheer survival, to produce whatever it can, using its abundant labour and meagre resources. The necessary elements Policy efforts directed at bringing in the tip of the informal sector’s iceberg into the fold of formality by alleviating legal and regulatory hurdles are laudable. However, these initiatives fail to appreciate that the bulk of the informal units and their workers are essentially petty producers (self-employed and casual workers) eking their subsistence out of minimal resources. Therefore, these attempts will yield limited results. The continued dominance of informality defines under-development. Policy-induced restrictions are minor irritants, at best. The economy will get formalised when informal enterprises become more productive through greater capital investment and increased education and skills are imparted to its workers. A mere registration under numerous official portals will not ensure access to social security, considering the poor record of implementation of labour laws. R.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:51 IST,||Wrong route||The Kerala government’s proposal to amend its Lok Ayukta Act through an ordinance appears questionable and hasty. Even though the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government is citing legal opinion to justify the proposed amendments, it does give an impression that it is in an unseemly hurry to remove the finality attached to a provision that allows the anti-corruption judicial body to direct a public servant to vacate office, if an allegation is substantiated. The criticism by the Opposition that the change may dilute the Lok Ayukta law appears valid, as Section 14 of the Lok Ayukta Act is its most stringent provision. Both the Congress-led United Democratic Front and the BJP have appealed to the Governor not to promulgate the ordinance cleared by the Cabinet. Opposition parties have suggested that the proposal may be linked to ongoing inquiries by the Lok Ayukta against members of the Cabinet. Also, the present regime has been adversely affected by this particular provision. In April 2021, Minister for Higher Education and Minority Welfare K.T. Jaleel had to resign after the Lok Ayukta found him guilty of nepotism. The present regime seems to have realised only after this episode the implications of the binding nature of the Lok Ayukta’s ‘declaration’ that a public servant, against whom an allegation is substantiated, should not continue to hold office. It is strange that the Government now says the section is unconstitutional when it could have been challenged by Mr. Jaleel himself. The Government has defended the proposed ordinance on the ground that the section amounts to removal of a Minister duly appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister, and violates Articles 163 and 164 of the Constitution. Further, there is no provision for appeal. It proposes to amend it to the effect that the Governor, the government or authority may decide on the Lok Ayukta’s finding within three months. It also seeks to provide for an appeal. While these are valid points, there is room to question the adoption of the ordinance route. It is also curious that the provision is now considered unconstitutional when it was an earlier LDF regime headed by E.K. Nayanar that enacted the law in 1999. The legislation was quite ahead of its time, as it envisaged removal of a public servant from office following an adverse judicial finding long before the Supreme Court paved the way for automatic disqualification of an elected representative upon conviction. It was only in 2013 that the apex court struck down a clause in election law that saved a serving legislator from disqualification following conviction until an appeal was filed and disposed of. A regime truly disposed towards corruption-free governance should not normally be worried about a law that allows an independent judicial forum to direct a public servant to leave office. If it has well-founded reservations about the process, it should not be chary of introducing relevant amendments in the Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/wrong-route/article38336570.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:51 IST,||Open the schools||India continues to record over 2,80,000 cases every day, which on its own is an uncomfortable statistic. These are not too far from that observed during the second wave and it is understandable why State administrators continue to impose lockdowns. However, numbers are meaningless without context and the data from States show that what was most feared about Omicron — an upsurge of hospitalisations and indiscriminate mortality — has not come to pass. The States that are in the throes of the wave now report, on average, that more than 95% of their available beds are unoccupied. By no means does this suggest that an Omicron infection is mild or that those vaccinated can be assured of pre-2020 nonchalance. However, the evidence is unequivocal that the odds of requiring hospitalisation are low in the doubly vaccinated and the vaccines, so far, continue to deliver on their promise of staving off severe illness. These observations are no doubt accounted for by various State governments which are now easing restrictions and allowing business establishments and public places to open up. However, schools continue to be shut in most places and administrators are reluctant to open them because most children are unvaccinated. Serology surveys by the ICMR and independent experts have found that greater than 70% of children displayed COVID-19 antibodies — which is no different from adults. Other lines of research also establish that while children are likely to contract the infection and be carriers, they are less likely to fall severely ill. Placing this in context with the disruption that has taken place in schools, the years of quality teaching time that have been lost and, the entrenching of inequality among well-off children and those who are dependent on schools not only for learning but also a nutritious meal, it is clear that schools, in good conscience, cannot be allowed to remain shut. The COVID-19 pandemic has not ended but societies are better prepared and aware of the reasonable measures that can be undertaken to save lives. Lockdowns are effective as a temporary measure and give time to stock up, but they come with huge costs and are not sustainable over the longer term. Thus, States should prioritise expanding vaccine coverage, insist on masks when children are in close confines, undertake periodic testing to gauge transmission and monitor hospitalisation trends while fully reopening schools. Experience from other countries such as the U.K. and the U.S. suggests that the reopening of schools hardly impacted transmission trends. India must incorporate these lessons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/open-the-schools/article38336573.ece

Bhutto’s reversal to a policy of conciliation instead of threats to business community is connected with the visit on Saturday of the World Bank President, Mr. Robert McNamara. According to the sources, Mr. McNamara reacted sharply to the reports that Mr. Bhutto had taken over the management of factories in 10 industrial categories in what was reported as a form of nationalisation. Mr. McNamara’s critical reaction was reported here last week during a visit of Mr. Peter Cargill, head of the World Bank’s South Asia Division and Chairman of the Aid to Pakistan Consortium, said the sources. Mr. Bhutto responded by releasing three major industrialists from house arrest and postponing the deadline for the return of hidden foreign exchange assets from abroad from Tuesday to February 15. Mr. Bhutto has ordered the release of Mr. Ahmed Dawood, whose family manages the Dawood Hercueles Chemical Fertilizer plant to which the World Bank has loaned more than Rs. 3 crores (Pakistani), retired Lt.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:51 IST,||Letters||The Omicron variant of COVID-19 may be relatively less fatal than the Delta variant. And, on account of this, hospitalisation may be less (Page 1, January 27). However, the gaps in our medical system have been laid bare. Vagaries over the virus and its new variants persist. The Government at best can buttress the medical system. Under the garb of Omicron, the Government should not get away from its responsibility of reinforcing the medical infrastructure. Aanya Singhal, Noida, Uttar Pradesh This is no case for lowering one’s guard as long as COVID-19 continues to spread. It is also scientifically possible that a new variant of concern may emerge in the near future. As such, people should be impressed upon to continue to follow COVID appropriate behaviour and report cases of positivity found on self-testing to the authorities concerned and get themselves treated under medical supervision. Any negligence on the part of even a few could lead to the emergence of new variants of concern. The vaccination programme should be speeded up as it does appear to be the key weapon.

Despite the disappointing defeat, Swiatek showed character on her way to the last four and said she had no regrets from her time at Melbourne Park, where she made her first semifinal. Barty is the first Australian woman into the summit clash of her home Grand Slam since Wendy Turnbull in 1980 and is aiming to become the first winner since Chris O’Neil two years earlier. Tenacious But the tenacious Collins stands in her way on Saturday with the 28-year-old enjoying a second coming after surgery last year for endometriosis left her pain free. Nine months on and she has a 32-7 win-loss record, capturing her maiden WTA singles titles last year in Palermo then San Jose. After making the semifinals at Melbourne in 2019, she is now in a first Slam final and will break into the top 10 for the first time to cap a remarkable comeback. “To play against the number one player in the world in her home country, it’s going to be spectacular,” said Collins of the final. “I couldn’t be happier. It’s been such a journey, so many years of hard work.” Barty has been rampant so far, dropping serve just once through six matches and is yet to drop a set as she powered through the top half of the women’s draw.

With this the host has gone 2-1 up in the five-match series. The recalled Powell’s 107 off just 53 balls, as well as his fourth-wicket stand of 122 with Nicholas Pooran (70), helped take the West Indies to 224 for five after stand-in England captain Moeen Ali won the toss. Tom Banton hit six sixes in a rapid 73 and Phil Salt 57 on his T20I debut as England tried to chase down 225, with Moeen leading a new-look side after regular captain Eoin Morgan pulled his quad during the warm-up. But England finished on 204 for nine in a remarkable match yielding over 400 runs. Powell’s impressive display of ball-striking, including four fours and 10 soaring sixes, saw the 28-year-old Jamaican become only the third West Indies batsman, after Evin Lewis and Chris Gayle, with two T20I hundreds. Three debutants England’s side featured three debutants in Salt, fellow batsman Harry Brook and paceman George Garton and, even more unusually, a trio of left-arm quicks in Garton, Reece Topley and Tymal Mills.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:57 IST,||‘Cummins showed fast bowlers could be good captains too’||Brett Lee’s transition from one of the world’s fastest bowlers into a perceptive commentator on the game, especially on the subtlest nuances of his trade, has been smooth. He has left the microphone behind for the time being though, to grip the cricket ball once again. The Australian is one of the biggest stars at the Legends League Cricket which has reached its business end here. He may be 45, but he bowled his full quota of four overs and took one for 27, playing his part in World Giants’ comfortable seven-wicket win against Asia Lions at the Al Amerat Stadium on Wednesday night. He is enjoying the experience. “It’s a fantastic tournament,” said the man who has 310 Test and 380 ODI wickets. “The quality of the players on show and the spectacle that has been presented to us (prove that).” Lee, who has come here after doing commentary on the Ashes series back home, is happy that Pat Cummins showed that fast bowlers could be good captains. Australia had won the series 4-0 with the skipper leading from the front. “He has done a pretty good job,” he said. “His captaincy has been really solid and he has some great people around him. The issue may have been if Pat could take wickets while captaining. He has proved he could.” Lee believes Scott Boland’s stunning start to his Test career — 18 wickets in three Tests at an average of 9.55 — shows the depth of Australian fast bowling. “He took six for seven (on debut) at the MCG, backed it up at the SCG and bowled beautifully in the last Test at Hobart. The great thing about Australian cricket is that there is a conveyor belt of fast bowlers, which is a luxury to have.” He doesn’t believe in the modern-day practice of resting the fast bowlers, though. “I don’t like bowlers resting,” he said. “I like bowlers to play each and every single game if they can. If they are struggling from injury, that is fair enough. What I would like to see is bowlers doing the hard work and playing day in and day out.” (The writer is in Muscat at the invitation of Legends League Cricket).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cummins-showed-fast-bowlers-could-be-good-captains-too/article64991559.ece

Mithun, after impressive showings in the India Open and Syed Modi India International this month, is among the serious title-contenders in the grossly depleted field. He marched on following a 21-11, 21-18 victory in 40 minutes. He now faces another exciting prospect, Priyanshu Rajawat. In the other quarterfinals, Kaushal Dharmamer will play Abhyansh Singh, third seed Subhankar Dey meets Kiran George and Ansal Yadav takes on Tharun Mannepalli. Ishika fights back Like the men’s singles, all eight women singles quarterfinal spots could have come India’s way had USA’s Ishika Jaiswal not saved four match-points against Deepshikha Singh to win 18-21, 27-25, 21-18. All other pre-quarterfinals ended in straight games. With all the higher-ranked players no longer in the fray, Malvika Bansod and Ashmita Chahila, ranked 67 and 69, are firmly on course to set up the title-clash. In the quarterfinals, Malvika clashes with Tanya Hemanth, Samiya Imad Farroqui meets Unnati Hooda, Ashmita plays Rhucha Sawant and Ishika challenges Smit Toshniwal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mithun-defeats-wei/article64991647.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:51 IST,||Praggnanandhaa brings down Vidit||Struggling for form, R. Praggnanandhaa punished Vidit Gujrathi for a misjudged pawn-capture and posted his second win in the Masters section of the Tata Steel chess tournament at Wijk aan Zee, near Amsterdam, on Wednesday. The result kept Praggnanandhaa (3.5 points) in the 13th spot in the 14-player field but brought down Vidit (5.5) from the overnight joint third to tied fifth. Magnus Carlsen (7) continued to lead after a 16-move draw in 20 minutes with Sergey Karjakin. After the final rest day, action resumes on Friday. Playing white, Vidit looked in control until the 33rd move when he faltered by taking an unguarded pawn on the king’s side. That was enough for Praggnanandhaa to seize his chance. The youngster used his proactive queen and rook well to keep Vidit under pressure. Once the queens were off the board on the 50th move, Praggnanandhaa established a one-pawn advantage on the king’s side and continued accurately to end Vidit’s resistance in 78 moves. In the Challengers section, Arjun Erigaisi (8.5 points) maintained his overnight two-point lead after a draw with former World junior girls’ champion Polina Shuvalova.  The results (10th round): Masters (Indians unless stated): Vidit Gujrathi (5.5) lost to R. Praggnanandhaa (3.5); Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 5.5) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 7); Anish Giri (6.5) drew with Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Pol, 4.5); Sam Shankland (USA, 4) drew with Shakhriyar Memdyarov (Aze, 6); Fabiano Caruana (USA, 5) lost to Richard Rapport (6); Andrey Esipenko (Rus, 5.5) bt Jorden van Foreest (Ned, 4.5); Daniil Dubov (Rus, 3.5) lost to Nils Grandelius (Swe, 3).   Challengers (involving Indians): Arjun Erigaisi (8.5) drew with Polina Shuvalova (Rus, 3.5); Surya Shekhar Ganguly (5) bt Zhu Jiner (Chn, 2.5) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/praggnanandhaa-brings-down-vidit/article64991646.ece

Prolonged illness The former mid-fielder was 90 and would have turned a year older next month. He is survived by two sons and one daughter. Charanjit suffered a stroke five years ago and was paralysed since then. “Dad was paralysed after suffering a stroke five years back. He used to walk with a stick but since the last couple of months, his health deteriorated and this morning he left us,” his younger son V.P. Singh told PTI. Charanjit was also part of the 1960 Games silver-winning and 1962 Asian Games silver-winning team. The two-time Olympian was a part of India’s glorious days. Charanjit was an alumni of Col Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun and Punjab University. After his illustrious career in international hockey, he worked as the director of the Physical Education department in Himachal Pradesh University in Shimla. HI’s condolence Hockey India condoled the death of Charanjit, saying the country has lost a legend of the sport. “It is a sad day for the hockey fraternity. Even in his old age, he would light up every time there were conversations about hockey and he could accurately recall every great moment he was part of during India’s golden days of hockey,” HI president Gyanendro Nigombam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/charanjit-singh-passes-away/article64991644.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:23 IST,||Women umpires make history of sorts||The appeal is loud and confident from the bowlers, the ’keeper and the close-in fielders. But the umpire’s dreaded finger doesn’t go up. The decision is reviewed, but it still isn’t lbw: the replays show the ball is going down the leg-side. A couple of days later, Humaira Farah recalls the incident with pride. She is not proud just because she got it right, but also because she, along with four other women, made history of sorts at the Legends League Cricket. It is not every day that you see only women officiating in an entire men’s tournament. Besides the four umpires, the match referee is also a woman. “The organisers need to be congratulated on their decision to have female umpires for all the matches,” says Shubhda Bhosle Gaikwad, who hails from Gwalior. “For me this is nothing less than a dream.” It could also make many girls dream of a career in umpiring. These are good times for women’s cricket anyway. Its popularity is increasing rapidly, the MCC has made a woman its president, for the first time in more than two centuries, and has turned batsmen into batters. Women have also broken through the glass ceiling of commentary. “Yes, we should have more female umpires, too,” says Renee Montgomery, the Mumbai-born Hong Kong-based flight attendant whose passion has flown her down here. “It’s been a great experience.” South African Lauren Agenbag nods in agreement. “I grew up watching cricketers like Morne Morkel and Kevin Pietersen, so it’s amazing that I get to officiate in matches featuring them,” she says. Most experienced Humaira, the first female umpire of Pakistan, is the most experienced of the lot. “Now we have some 15 women umpires back home,” she says. “I have been an umpire in over 150 matches, and I am so happy to be here for this tournament.” Match referee Shandre Fritz, a former South Africa all-rounder, completes the fabulous five of female officials.

He was a soft-spoken, down-to-earth and well-educated man. He was a compact centre-half. I started playing under him in 1961 on the New Zealand tour.  “The 1962 international tournament at Ahmedabad, where almost the whole world except Pakistan played, and the Lyon (Olympics qualifying) tournament in 1963 were some of the important events we played together before the 1964 Olympics,” Gurbux told The Hindu on Thursday. We played against each other when he represented Punjab at the National level,” he said.  Gurbux said Charanjit was a team man to the core. “Charanjit began playing as an inside-right with Balbir Singh. He was very good in our own half, inside the 25-yard line. As a defender, I can say he used to take on the opposition players very solidly. “In the 1964 (Olympics) team we could shout at anybody for any lapse and no one took it personally. Even captain Charanjit did not mind and took it in his stride as he understood that it was for the team’s good. That was one of the good points of that team, which was studded with well-known players such as four-time Olympian Udham Singh, Prithipal Singh, Charanjit, Shankar Lakshman, Haripal Kaushik and Mohinder Lal,” said Gurbux.

Egypt, the record seven-time continental champion, will play Morocco in the last eight in Yaounde on Sunday.

Odisha started the match well, but Hyderabad started to find its feet from the 20-minute mark. However, it was Odisha which struck first through Jerry Mawihmingthanga in the 45th minute. Nandhakumar Sekar charged down the left flank and whipped in a low cross. Jerry, at the front-post, flicked the ball home through the legs of goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani. The second half belonged to Hyderabad. It did not take much time to grab the equaliser after the break. In the 51th minute, Akash Mishra found Chianese with a pin-point cross and the latter guided the ball into the net. In the 70th, Hyderabad skipper Joao Victor gave his team the lead, showing good skill to control the ball and lash it into the top corner on the turn. Akash Mishra made it 3-2 three minutes later when he met Yasir Mohammad's cross and guided the ball home. Odisha substitute Jonathas pulled one back in the 84th minute, curling the ball in after receiving a pass from another substitute Redeem Tlang.

A meeting of office-bearers on Thursday decided to vet all the options through BCCI executives and arrive at a “decision suitable to every stakeholder”.  “Make no mistake all of us want to stage the Ranji Trophy but there are lots of practical hurdles, including COVID-19 protocols and scheduling issues. We hope for a viable solution at the earliest,” an official privy to developments told The Hindu , citing anonymity, after the meeting.  The Hindu understands that the BCCI office-bearers have directed executives to check with the state associations about whether their teams can enter pre-tournament quarantine by February 5 in order to start the tournament around February 10.  However, time seems to be running out for the BCCI considering the priority of ensuring a safe passage for the Indian Premier League (IPL). The BCCI office-bearers have directed the executives to prepare a back-up plan that would result in the Ranji Trophy winding up by March 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bcci-defers-decision-on-ranji-trophy/article38336677.ece

The 31-year-old Australian, the most successful quad tennis player ever with 15 Grand Slam singles and eight doubles titles, had announced his decision to quit before the tournament. It followed his history-making exploits in 2021 when he completed the Golden Slam of winning all four quad singles Majors and the Paralympics gold in the same year. But the World No. 1, a prominent sporting and media figure in Australia, was unable to go out on a high, losing to second-seeded Dutchman Sam Schroder 7-5, 6-0 on Rod Laver Arena. “All around the world, every single locker-room we go to, there's wheelchair tennis on. I'm very thankful. “I’m really the luckiest guy in the world, and I didn’t need to win today to realise that,” he said courtside, holding back tears.     It’s going to be an all-Australian men’s doubles final on Saturday at Melbourne Park. A first in 42 years. Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis, dubbed the ‘Special K’ team, beat the third-seeded pair of Marcel Granollers of Spain and Horacio Zeballos of Argentina 7-6(4), 6-4. “I've played a lot of singles matches around the globe with amazing atmospheres, but this week, with Thanasi and playing in front of you, nothing beats this,” said Kyrgios. On an adjoining near-empty Margaret Court Arena, fellow Australians Matthew Ebden and Max Purcell beat second-seeded Rajeev Ram of the United States and Joe Salisbury of Britain 6-3, 7-6(9), saving four set-points in the second set.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:31 IST,||A shot at history?||Even before he hit his first ball at this year's Australian Open, Rafael Nadal knew he had an open door to set the men's record for most career Grand Slam singles titles. So far he hasn't let it close. Nadal plays Matteo Berrettini in one semifinal on Friday at Melbourne Park, knowing he’s potentially two match wins from a 21st major title. He’s tied for the record of 20 with Roger Federer, who is recovering from right knee surgery, and Novak Djokovic, who was deported from Australia on the eve of the tournament following an 11-day visa saga over his decision not to be vaccinated for COVID-19. In the other semifinal, Daniil Medvedev plays Stefanos Tsitsipas in a rematch of their 2021 Australian Open semifinal. Medvedev won last year's semifinal, then lost to Djokovic in the final. After Nadal's tough five-set win over Denis Shapovalov on Tuesday, he looked to take away some of the pressure of that 21st major. “I don't believe that my happiness, my future happiness is going to depend on if I achieve one more Grand Slam than the others, or if the others achieve more Grand Slams than me,” Nadal said. “For me, the fact that we are equal at 20 ... the only thing that says is that we share an amazing part of the history of our sport, and for me it's a real honor to be part of it.” Nadal spoke highly of Berrettini, among the players like Tsitsipas and Shapovalov who could replace the Big Three who have dominated the sport for nearly 20 years. “Matteo, he's one of the best players of the world,” Nadal said. “I need to play my 100% and my highest level if I want to keep having chances to fight, to be competitive, and to try to be in the final.”AP  I need to play my 100% and my highest level if I want to keep having chances to fight, to be competitive, and to try to be in the final||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/a-shot-at-history/article64991971.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:31 IST,||Space junk to hit the Moon in March||A chunk of a SpaceX rocket that blasted off seven years ago and was abandoned in space after completing its mission will crash into the Moon in March, experts say. The rocket was deployed in 2015 to put into orbit a NASA satellite called the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). Since then, the second stage of the rocket, or booster, has been floating in what mathematicians call a chaotic orbit, astronomer Bill Gray told AFP Wednesday. It was Gray who calculated the space junk's new collision course with the Moon. The booster passed quite close to the Moon in January in a rendezvous that altered its orbit, said Gray. He is behind Project Pluto, software that allows for calculating the trajectory of asteroids and other objects in space and is used in NASA-financed space observation programs. A week after the rocket stage whizzed close to the Moon, Gray observed it again and concluded it would crash into the Moon's dark side on March 4 at more than 9,000 km/ hour. Gray appealed to the amateur astronomer community to join him in observing the booster, and his conclusion was confirmed. The exact time and spot of impact may change slightly from his forecast but there is widespread agreement that there will be a collision on the Moon that day. The impact of the SpaceX rocket chunk weighing four tons on the Moon will not be visible from Earth in real time. But it will leave a crater that scientists will be able to observe with spacecraft and satellites like NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or India's Chandrayaan-2, and thus learn more about the geology of the Moon. Previous crashes Spacecraft have been intentionally crashed into the Moon before for scientific purposes, such as during the Apollo missions to test seismometers. In 2009, NASA sent a rocket stage hurling into the Moon near its south pole to look for water. But most rockets do not go so far from Earth. SpaceX brings its rocket boosters back through the Earth's atmosphere so they disintegrate over the ocean. The first stage is recovered and reused. Gray said there could be more unintentional crashes into the Moon in the future as the U.S. and Chinese space programs in particular leave more junk in orbit.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:31 IST,||What’s an oxbow lake?||This picture shows a part of the Amazon river, as it meanders its way across a floodplain. As you can see, it takes regular bends, forming curves and loops. If you look closer, you will find some loops in the shape of a horseshoe lying alongside the winding river. These small lakes are called oxbow lakes (named for their shape) and are created over time as erosion and deposits of soil change the river's course. Oxbow lakes usually form in flat, low-lying plains close to where the river empties into another body of water. Meanders that form oxbow lakes are characterised by two sets of curves: one curving away from the straight path of the river and one curving back. On the inside of the loop, the river travels more slowly leading to deposition of silt, while on the outside edges, the river flows faster leading to the erosion of the banks and thereby the meander becoming wider at these points. Over time, the loops widen until their necks vanish altogether and cutting themselves off from the river's current and thus forming the oxbow lake. As water does not flow in or out of them, oxbow lakes are stillwater lakes. They eventually become swamps or bogs, and often dry up as their water evaporates. Oxford lakes can support a range of wildlife. Submerged or floating aquatic vegetation, phytoplanktons, algae and various types of fish are some of the species found in oxbow lakes. In Amazon, the most common wildlife you will see in an oxbow lake are giant river otters and the fish they feed on. Many birds can also be seen visiting oxbow lakes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/whats-an-oxbow-lake/article64991973.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:47 IST,||Shoot at sight||Nagesh Kukunoor describes his first Telugu film Good Luck Sakhi , starring Keerthy Suresh as a 10-metre rifle shooter, as “a bright, sunny film to watch in these messed up [pandemic] times.” It has taken the Hyderabadi writer-director a little more than two decades to do a homecoming, with a full-fledged Telugu film.   Filmed partly in 2019 and in 2020 after the first lockdown, the film has taken its time to arrive in theatres, with each wave of COVID-19 throwing the release schedules of several films out of gear. Settling down for this interview in his office, Kukunoor reminisces, “I moved on from Good Luck Sakhi and made Season 2 of City of Dreams (Disney + Hotstar); when I returned to the film months later to check the colour grading on a large screen, I watched it with a smile. It’s a happy film in an utopian space that I keep returning to.”   Kukunoor had written Good Luck Sakhi years ago, intending to collaborate with late director Hrishikesh Mukherjee. A fictional story emerged after he spotted a news clipping of shooters Chandro Tomar and Prakashi Tomar 23 years ago.  His co-writer Rohit Banawlikar chanced upon the story a few years ago, and suggested that it be revived. “Keerthy has filled the role with joy. Sakhi is my kind of heroine — real, spunky but not over the top.” Good Luck Sakhi is set in a fictional village and besides sport, the story discusses gender issues and questions the notion of luck. “I wrote it as a wacky sports romance comedy, trying to keep the Hrishi- da vibe alive. The story is narrated in a lighter vein and the problems are not overwhelming.”  Good Luck Sakhi also forged Nagesh’s collaboration with music composer Devi Sri Prasad, who is synonymous with catchy numbers in star-studded big budget films. Kukunoor remembers the music sessions in DSP’s Chennai recording studio. “He is like a mad bundle of energy, so full of ideas and with an ever-present smile. The first song that was released, ‘Bad luck Sakhi’, has a Hollywood musical vibe to it but is in sync with the Indian rural setting.”   Kukunoor ensured that he had complete control over the story and script. He recalls an incident when he met producer Tutu Sharma for Rockford (1999), his second film, soon after the runaway indie hit Hyderabad Blues (1998). “He read the script and gave me suggestions. I stood my ground and stated that I wrote the script according to how I perceive the story. He trusted my conviction and let me be. Since then, I have never let anyone throw constraints in the name of box office.”   Thumbs up||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/shoot-at-sight/article64991963.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 05:32 IST,||‘Not an ego trip ’||Speaking to Anthony Horowitz invariably involves looking ahead. Last time when we spoke for Moonflower Murders , we were also speaking of the third book in his Daniel Hawthorne series. And now as we talk of the third book, A Line to Kill (Penguin Random House), we are also talking about the third James Bond novel Horowitz has been commissioned to write by the Ian Fleming estate.  The Hawthorne series features a disgraced police detective-turned-consultant, Hawthorne, with a fictionalised version of Horowitz as his sidekick and chronicler. “When my publishers asked me to do a detective series, I started to think about what I could do that was original, and had never been done before,” says Horowitz over video call from London. He says, “My first thought was, is the detective British or from another country, man or woman? What is the ethnicity, sexuality, marital status? Does he have problems? Does she want to be something different? Is she a robot, vampire, spaceman or ghost?” From many angles Realising all these permutations had been done, Horowitz began to wonder what would make his series different. “I started to think about the relationship between the detective and his sidekick and had this sudden flash of inspiration. If I was a sidekick in the book, it would turn everything on its head because suddenly instead of being the cleverest person in the book, the author who knows everything, I would know nothing. I would be at the mercy of my detective. If my detective did not solve the crime, I would not have a book.” The 66-year-old author says this allowed him to have enormous fun with the genre. “At the same time, I hope I was giving the audience all the pleasure of a whodunit, the clues, the suspects, the red herrings and the surprise of the ending.” Anatomy of a whodunit There was no danger that the book would come out like an ego trip, says Horowitz. “At the end of the day, I’m only the narrator, not the main character. You do not learn a great deal about me in the book. The book is about Hawthorne, and me writing about Hawthorne. What it does allow me to do as a writer, is to write about the nature of a whodunit.” Horowitz writes in different genres, from YA with Alex Rider and The Diamond Brothers to the Sherlock Holmes and James Bond continuation novels apart from whodunits and horror. Horowitz says he prefers not to use words such as easy and difficult when describing writing. “Writing is never difficult for me. James Bond is perhaps the biggest challenge to write because I’m working in the shadow of Ian Fleming and there is so much research to do to get it right and to get the correct tone of voice. I find the process of writing one of immersion and absorption.” Insisting he loves all his writing, Horowitz admits a partiality for the Alex Rider books, which has helped a whole generation find literature, books and reading.  On the television front Horowitz says, Magpie Murders has been adapted into a six-episode series with Lesley Manville as the editor Susan Ryeland and Tim McMullan as Atticus Pünd, the detective in the book within the book. The Full Monty director, Peter Cattaneo, helms the show.  “Lesley is absolutely wonderful and Cattaneo is one of the most brilliant directors I’ve worked with.” Alex Rider is now in its second season based on Eagle Strike adapted by Guy Burt with Otto Farrant returning to play the titular character. There is also Toby Stevens playing the chief antagonist. “I know the first season was popular in India.”  Forever Bond With a Mind to Kill , Horowitz’s new James Bond novel, is expected in May 2022. “I cannot give anything away because they will be unhappy with me ( laughs ). I will say I was thrilled to be asked to return for the third time. This book is part of a trilogy following Trigger Mortis (2015) and Forever and a Day (2018). It is a quieter book compared to the other two.”  Reconciling Bond’s attitudes to today calls for acknowledging the original books by Ian Fleming were written in the ‘50s. “That was how things were then. You have to put the books in their historical context. If you are offended by them, do not read them. I still think that they are great books, very much of their time.”  The sequence at the end of Live and Let Die (1954) when Bond is dragged over the coral reef is brilliant, says Horowitz.  “The beginning of the novel, when Bond is captured and Mr. Big’s henchman, Teehee, breaks Bond’s finger, makes me sweat when I read it. There are, however, parts of the book which I would not write myself, which we would feel uncomfortable reading.” Horowitz says he sees no need to prune out the uncomfortable bits from the legacy sequel as it is not the way he thinks. “It would never even come to my mind. There is so much in the Bond world, which is so great and so wonderful. Let us celebrate that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/not-an-ego-trip/article64991817.ece

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:48 IST,||Vellalore Lake: Where butterflies roam||A miyawaki forest canopy with towering native trees and a dense belt of flowering plants has turned the city’s Vellalore Lake into a butterfly hotspot. Blue Mormons, the fourth largest butterfly of India and State butterfly of Maharashtra, have been sighted in great numbers. A beautiful bluish-green butterfly called the common banded peacock, as like medus brown, chocolate albatross, and bamboo tree brown buzzed around the nectaring plants at the lake much to the excitement of butterfly enthusiasts. “All these species can be sighted in forest covers and wooded-areas, but we were surprised to see them in good numbers in the plains,” says Pavendhan A of the Tamil Nadu Butterfly Society (TNBS), adding that so far 83 species have been recorded. “This indicates that 25% of species from Tamil Nadu’s checklist (of 327 species) are available in this single location. This criteria qualifies the wetland as a butterfly hotspot.” At one time, Vellalore tank spread across an expanse of 90-acres, was home to rosy starlings, a winter migratory bird that flocked here in thousands to roost. Many old timers recall it as an unforgettable sight. While cormorants used the many trees around the lake as their nesting ground, ducks paddled in the waters. What was once a hub of migratory birds, ran dry and became a dumping ground for garbage and debris. This blocked the inlet channels that fed the lake with water from the Noyyal, the lifeline of Coimbatore. A team of eco-warriors including R Manikandan, founder of Kovai Kulangal Paadukaappu Amaippu (KKPA), a water conservation NGO started in 2017, along with Coimbatore Corporation and other public works departments, de-silted the Rajavaaikaal channel, which connects the lake with the Noyyal, removed encroachments, and cleared the debris. “After a gap of over 15 years, the lake filled up during the monsoons in 2018,” says Manikandan.  A miyawaki forest sprung to life along the bund as a part of restoration. “We planted 10,000 trees in batches. This includes over 300 varieties of native species like neem, banyan,pungai, andpoovarasu. We added hundreds of herbal plants, and flowering plants like thael kodukku , nari kilikiluppai , castor, hibiscus, arali and naatu rose. It created a conducive ecosystem for butterflies to thrive,” says Manikandan.  Kamala Kannan Y, a volunteer with KKPA says a team of bird watchers accompanied by school students have recorded 156 species of birds at the green zone. “We ensure that the green cover is nurtured and well-maintained and supports the many life forms including insects, birds, and butterflies.” A six-member team from TNBS along with KKPA has been conducting regular monitoring of butterflies at the Vellalore wetland as part of a one-year study that started in October last year. They also take students on Nature walks along the bund and explain the life cycle of butterflies and their significance within the ecosystem. Pavendhan explains that it is important to develop the greenery without altering the vegetation that already exists in the area. He says, “The purpose is to impart Nature education to students. As we continue to lose green cover in cities, such green zones are important to attract butterflies. For example, the common three ring is dependant on grass, its host plant.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:50 IST,||A s t a b l e life||Coimbatore’s Adhav Kandasamy, started riding when he was four years old. By the age of 12, he had won a gold medal at the Junior National Equestrian Championship 2021, in Mumbai. Every year, he has more company in the paddocks. Adhav’s coach Saravanan K says there has been a rise in enrolments at Equine Dreams, the city’s equestrian club, over the last few years. “About 10 years ago, people here just knew about horse racing. But now they are aware of the existence of a competitive sport like equestrian,” he says. Meanwhile, at the Chennai Equitation Centre (CEC) on Old Mahabalipuram Road yet another cake is being cut. With an increasing number of children taking up horse riding, the stables often turn into venues for celebrations with young riders, for wins as well as birthdays of both horses and riders. “There are cakes and carrots,” laughs Isabelle Futnani who trains riders at CEC. She is visibly pleased with the recent haul of medals by her students at the Junior National Equestrian Championship in Mumbai. “My girls won three golds, one silver and two bronze,” she says. In equestrian sports, boys and girls compete together in the different disciplines (Show Jumping, Tent pegging, Dressage and Equitation) and there is no separate category, she adds. It is a similar tale of victory at Madras School of Equitation, Velachery, which has been competing in national and regional events for the last 15 years. “Our total medal tally stands at 50 so far, with two of our students winning three gold medals at the Junior National Equestrian Championship last month,” says Prem Kumar KS, president, Madras School of Equitation (MSE). Over the last few years, Isabelle and Prem have noticed a rise in interest in this sport. CEC now has 80 students from 40, while MSE’s donor riding members have also increased. Picking up on the trend, a clutch of new riding schools have come across Tamil Nadu, in Coimbatore, Ambur, Vellore and Tiruppur. A new awakening Surendar Nagaraj, who was a trainer at Coimbatore’s Equine Dreams from 2012 to 2017, is now looking to get an international coaching license with the British Horse Society. Having travelled to Europe, where equestrian is extremely popular, he reckons India still has some catching up to do. “For instance, our national-level events have 30 to 50 competitors. Over there you see 800 to 900 equestrian athletes and about 1,000 horses in a single event. There are big cash prizes too, unlike here. Equestrian is not a part of sports quota, which means it can’t fetch you benefits like a Government job.” For those who want to ride more casually, Walk & Trot takes riders on horse safaris along the windy coast of Panayur on Chennai’s scenic East Coast Road. Started by NR Janarthanan and Sabari Girish in 2018, this riding school teaches the basics, so even beginners can eventually do long rides. The pandemic too has clearly played a role, as more people started exploring horse riding as a means to get away from the city, and the confines of their homes. “In the quest for Nature and the outdoors, they are giving this a shot,” says Isabelle, adding that of late she has noticed a lot of adults aged 44 to 50 taking up this activity as a hobby. Saddle up Despite being low key, riding has been a popular sport in Tamil Nadu since the 1940s when the Riding Club of Madras (with the help of Madras Race Club [MRC]) opened its doors in Guindy. Classes were attended by adults and children as young as 10. In the 70s, riders interested in polo started the Madras Polo and Riders Club near Guindy. A decade later, a few riding members of both clubs along with MRC started the Madras Riding School, known as MSE since 1999, after a change in management. Both CEC and MSE, over the years have had students who started learning as early as five and continued to do so for over a decade or even more. “Our oldest rider is 74-year-old Dr Nagajothi,” says Prem. He adds, “Often, it is the bond with the horse that draws the rider for a session of riding everyday. There are regulars who reach here at 5.30 am six days a week to practise horse riding.” Competitive equitation picked up steam in 1990 with in-house competitions and shows at Wellington, and Lovedale in Udhagamandalam. From 2000 regional shows at Chennai Equitation Centre (OMR), Red Earth Riding School (Pondicherry) and Embassy International Riding School (Bengaluru) garnered more attention. And then the International Dressage Development League, a brain child of Kapil Modi, Delhi-based equestrian and participant at the Asian Games, gave a leg up for children in equitation and dressage. In recent years, horse riding has become more prominent as more schools embrace it. “I became interested in horses after I saw them competing at the Guindy Race Course many years ago,” says Janarthanan who then trained for 15 years. He has 10 students at Walk & Trot now, mostly in the eight to 12 age group. Their 15-kilometre ride (priced at around Rs. 3,000) from Neelankarai to Kovalam, which starts at 6am with breakfast and runs along the shore and through the woods is most popular. “This sport combines athletics with team spirit,” says Isabelle, adding, “It’s a special feeling, especially for a child, who, in spite of weighing 30-40 kilograms is able to command a horse that weighs 500 kilograms.” (With inputs from Praveen Sudevan)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-s-t-a-b-l-e-life/article64991949.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:49 IST,||For a happy pregnancy||Is it possible to have a ‘perfect’ pregnancy? Why not? Asks Durga Shakti Nagpal. In her memoir, Grow Your Baby Not Your Weight (Rupa), the bureaucrat and a mother of two explains how to ease one’s journey to motherhood. “A woman’s body is perfectly designed to bear a child. So, the pregnancy can also be perfect, without complications. You just need to be on the right track,” declares Durga Shakti, emphasising the need to eat right and stay physically active.  Her debut book, which has been endorsed by celebrities like Akshay Kumar, Shilpa Shetty and Hema Malini, covers not just the first three trimesters but also birth, breast feeding, and post-partum blues. It addresses pregnancy-related myths and beliefs, as well as the role of an older child and the family’s active involvement during and after pregnancy. “The journey begins with jubilation, nausea and fatigue in the first trimester. The book reminds aspiring mothers to treat it as something natural and not a medical condition. In Asian societies, especially in joint family set-ups, pregnant women are pampered with high calorie food and are not allowed to do any physical activity. This leads to unnecessary weight gain. A sedentary lifestyle has shot up the numbers in C-section deliveries,” says Durga Shakti. The book explains how it is possible to be pregnant with minimal weight gain, while maximising the nutrition. “Every chapter is accompanied by medical advice from a gynaecologist,” says the author, adding “One is often told to eat double. In my experience, I learnt that to give proper nutrition to the child, it meant eat well and not eat extra.”  She also touches upon balancing a career and motherhood, based on her experiences as an IAS officer. Durga Shakti also explains what she ate, her fitness routine, and posture correction exercises. One of the chapters titled Ma ke nuskhe offers traditional recipes handed down by her mother and grandmother. “I used home-made chia butter moisturiser to keep my skin supple and followed simple exercises for flexibility. One cannot compromise on self care,” says the author, adding, “I also practised pre-natal yoga (done under the supervision of a yoga teacher), meditation, and pranayama ... The journey has enabled me to stay strong, physically and emotionally. I hope the book helps women to have a joyful pregnancy.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/for-a-happy-pregnancy/article64991952.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:48 IST,||The sea breeze blew in blue dragons||Despite being just half an inch long, the Glaucus marginatus is often called the blue sea dragon. It belongs to an intriguing class of creatures — those that live not on land or underwater, but on the surface of the ocean, under the beating sun, perpetually at the mercy of currents and tides. “Blue dragons actually walk and climb on the surface water tension,” says city-based naturalist M Yuvan, adding, “They eat blue button jellyfish that float on the water. So does the fascinating purple storm snail, who blows itself a balloon to float up to the surface of the sea, and feasts on blue buttons.”  The “balloon”, also referred to as a bubble raft, is created by a secretion from the foot of these snails. It is one of the features that makes these snails particularly alluring to Nature lovers; the other feature being the unusual, pale lavender colour of its shell. “These creatures, as well as goose barnacles, are surface dwellers that usually live far out on the ocean, and form their own, floating micro biome of sorts,” says Yuvan. He adds: “All of these washed ashore in millions last week. I saw them on the shore at Neelankarai Kuppam; two of my colleagues went and checked Kovalam and Akkarai beaches. They were also seen at Urur Kuppam in Besant Nagar; basically, there were mass strandings in multiple stretches of Chennai.” Though these strandings were seen and documented on January 20, they had probably occurred a few days before, muses Yuvan, “going by the condition that we found them in”. He adds: “If we had managed to see them on the same day, the blue dragons would have been in beautiful colours. In case of the blue buttons as well, what we saw left behind were just the floats [the flat, central discs that help the creature stay afloat. It is usually surrounded by brilliant blue tentacles]. The organism had vanished.” The reason for this stranding is still unclear, though Yuvan suspects it has something to do with the shoreward winds of January. “It could also be because of some kind of event happening inside the sea,” he muses, but all is conjecture at this point. The only thing known for sure is that such strandings, though unusual, are not entirely unheard-of. For instance, the Australian coastline has seen multiple cases of mass strandings of surface dwellers in the past five years. Yuvan points out that there is a mass stranding in Odisha once every two years or so, and there has been an isolated incident in Gujarat as well. A few blue buttons had also been swept in near Chennai during the Nivar cyclone in 2020. “These creatures are completely at the mercy of the wind and the sea,” says Yuvan, “So, the cause lies in the complexity of wind systems, and how they behave close to the coast and far out in the sea — all of which, we do not have a clear understanding of. There are also occasions, sometimes, of a sudden boom in jellyfish numbers. Then, they get beached a lot because there is too many of them.” Intriguing creatures This is not the first time forces of Nature have washed up intriguing creatures of the sea to our lands. An incident like this, though unfortunate, it nevertheless gives students and naturalists a chance to observe creatures that they would otherwise not get a chance to see. The last time Yuvan had seen such a large-scale stranding had been in January 2019, “all along the Urur Kuppam and Adyar Estuary area”. He recalls: “That particular stranding had also included Portuguese man-of-war.” That is a brilliantly coloured, translucent creature with long tentacles. It resembles a jellyfish, but is actually a siphonophore: a colony of identical smaller individuals that together make up an entire creature. In the same stranding in 2019, the team had seen something called a by-the-wind-sailor, a creature whose anatomy includes a float and a fin-like sail that help it drift afloat above water, and tentacles that extend down below water. Another creature of intrigue in these strandings is the blue barnacle, a creature that attaches itself to steady or floating objects — including debris like water bottles or slippers — and populates it densely. “The number of barnacles on an object is a good indicator of how many months it has been washed ashore. It is even used in forensics in some countries,” he states. Yuvan usually notices a rise in goose barnacle numbers in January, but the reason for it is still an enigma, yet to be unravelled by Nature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-sea-breeze-blew-in-blue-dragons/article64991955.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:50 IST,||Photography meets Madhubani||Arun Pradeep has been a photographer in Coimbatore for seven years now. He shoots weddings, products, models, and more. Despite belonging to a commercial space in photography, he wanted to do something purely artistic. A passion project. He asked his then intern, Kanishkaa Senthilnathan, for ideas towards the end of 2020. G Venkat Ram’s calendar for Suhasini Maniratnam’s Naam Charitable Trust, featuring several actresses, had been released earlier that year. Arun did not have the budget to rope in celebrities. But the idea of recreating a painting excited him and Kanishkaa. They settled on the idea of recreating a Madhubani painting. Kanishkaa helmed the project. But one thing led to another. Three months later, they did seven such recreations of paintings by Gautam Khurana, Mona Biswarupa, and Soma Folk Art. It was not easy to recreate scenes from a painting style that is centuries-old. It was an exhaustive, yet fulfilling process, they say. It took them more than a week to finalise the paintings. They shortlisted them based on set design, costume, jewellery, and perspective. To recreate the flat, two-dimensional Madhubani paintings in a three-dimensional space was challenging. “We did not have the budget to hire a top art-director to make the props and other elements in the painting. The first time we tried doing something by ourselves with thermocol and other material, it was a disaster,” says Kanishkaa. This is where the artistic community in and around Coimbatore lent its helping hand. More than 15 people, including models, makeup artists, and traditional jewellery makers, worked on the project. Most of them came forward without expecting any remuneration. The project was also an interaction between an ancient art (the Madhubani painting) and a modern one (digital photography). But there was a confluence of other art forms during this project. Terracotta art is, for instance, another art form used here. “The paintings show the caste hierarchy of the time. The upper-caste women, for instance, wear jewels made of gold and other precious metals. Whereas the lower caste women wear clay and wood jewels. So, we roped in a terracotta jewellery maker,” says Kanishkaa. Kanishkaa and Arun decided not to commercialise the project. “This was purely a work of passion. We did it for the love of art. Some of my friends asked me, ‘Why are you working on it so much if it does not help you grow in any way?’ But being a part of this, with so many wonderful artists coming together, is a big personal growth for me. It doesn’t always have to be about the money, does it? “||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/photography-meets-madhubani/article64991948.ece

Winning a show like Bigg Boss is possible only if audiences really like you,” says the actor.  Throughout the fifth season of the show, Raju emerged as a fan favourite thanks to his jokes, witty one-liners, mimicry style and camaraderie with his fellow housemates. Another constant, Priyanka Deshpande, spoke highly of Raju’s patience and calmness, during the finale. “I never thought my patience was a big quality until now. Early on in the show, people often asked me why I was quiet and not reacting much to anything. But as days went by, this worked in my favour. Taking most things lightly definitely helped me.” In the finale, Raju spoke highly of his housemates and how they had a great part to play in his success. “In a house, it is the people around us who determine the kind of person we are going to be. All the other contestants had a great part to play in this. Imman Annachi, in particular, was a great source of support and encouragement.” Raju says he enjoyed the ‘Cinema Cinema’ task where he dressed up as actor MR Radha, as well as the week when the house became a boarding school. “I’m yet to sit and watch the show in its entirety though; I hope that one day, all of us who were in the house, can get together and watch our favourite episodes,” says Raju, who has starred in a few TV shows and films and has also worked as an assistant to director Bhagyaraj in the past.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/raju-jeyamohan-on-his-bigg-boss-journey-and-winning-the-title/article64991965.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:47 IST,||Khaddar vs burger||In Chicago’s cruel winter, at -3 degrees Celsius, it was a khadi jacket that kept Kamal Haasan warm. To be precise, a jacket from KH House of Khaddar, his just-launched designer label. Now, khaddar has taken over his wardrobe. “Khaddar needs no introduction. It’s woven into the fabric of the nation. We cling on to the thread and climb,” says Kamal at the virtual press conference to launch the website for House of Khaddar in India. “We are proud to launch our business on Republic Day,” he says, adding, “Let’s hope khadi will do better than burgers in India.” The brand’s first collection, titled Nunool, was showcased in Chicago in November 2021. “Whenever we spoke of exporting khaddar to the West, the first question asked was ‘who would want to wear an Indian politician’s costume?’ It’s not a politician’s costume: it is a historic thread that connects people like freedom fighters and the free Indians of today.” The actor says he is emotionally connected to the fabric, as his father, who was a lawyer and part of the Independence movement, used to wear khaddar to court. The first collection for Fall Winter has trenches, jackets, trousers, skirts and dresses in olives, browns, blues and pinks. Amritha Ram, the designer, put everything together with the layering concept in mind, so people can use each piece in different ways. Amritha says the next collection will be launched at the Paris Fashion Week.  Kamal also takes pride in the fact that KH House of Khaddar is eco-friendly, conscious about sustainability, and the welfare of the weavers associated with the label. “The fabric is hand-dyed using organic dyes. Our dyes have zero chemical waste and zero carbon,” he states, adding, “We have taken Gandhiji’s advice seriously and become the change we wanted.” For details, log on to www.khhk.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/khaddar-vs-burger/article64991961.ece

After he finished his Engineering degree, he was smitten by the world of filmmaking. Stints in television and ad commercials helped him, as he puts it, “discover that he had a passion for filmmaking”.  Today, 29-year-old Vishal is all excited about his debut Tamil feature, Sila Nerangalil Sila Manidhargal (SNSM) , featuring Ashok Selvan, Reyaa, Nasser and Manikandan among others.   Releasing in theatres this Friday, the film revolves around how one incident changes the life of many people. “The protagonists are from different walks of life but one incident changes them completely,” says Vishal. The script was initially a short film idea, which he later fleshed out into a full-fledged feature. “Shooting was a hard task, especially given the challenges that came post the pandemic, but we were able to pull it off,” says the filmmaker. Despite many big films opting to take the OTT route, the makers of SNSM have decided to go ahead with a theatrical release. “It is a hard decision to take in today’s times. But if the content is good, audiences will support the film.

Musician MS Krsna is looking forward to it for more reasons than one. He will be performing in this first-of-its-kind event, and up his sleeve is the premiere of the music video of his latest single titled ‘Odathey Oliyathey’. “I’m thrilled that it will be one of the first videos from the Indian independent scene to play in a metaverse event,” says the 23-year-old singer-songwriter.  The idea of this single came about during the most unlikely of places: when he was on his way to work on a bike. “Many of my best ideas come in the strangest of places,” he recalls, “I was studying to be an audio engineer at SRM and was also working as an assistant director on Tamil film Vaazl , directed by Arun Prabhu. I was on my feet all the time and this song is also about how one has to have the stamina to receive the good things that come into your life.”  Krsna, who describes the song as ‘upbeat, joyous and peppy’, has worked with Ken Royson of Atti Culture fame for the music video, which would be showcased during the metaverse wedding. “We conceptualised a story and visual treatment for the song and decided to shoot it at my school, Abacus Montessori, where my music journey as a performer began.” The video will also feature Napier Naveen, Rahul Muralidhar and Gooth, besides an animated storyline by Adhiti Harikumar. “‘Odathey Oliyathey’ will be a key project in defining the kind of music that I make.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/music-for-the-muhurtam/article64991964.ece

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 05:33 IST,||Juniper on the beach||In Goa, Nilgiris tea meets Himalayan juniper and cashewnuts on the beaches and in the bars. While the past two pandemic years slowed business, and closed down many bars and restaurants, across the country, Goa has been bustling with new ideas and launches. Over the past two years, a host of home-brewn gins have mushroomed across the State, building on the impact created by Greater Than, Hapusa, Stranger & Sons and Jaisalmer, the gin brands that began celebrating Indian botanicals.  In 2020, Jin Jiji launched its India dry gin, with the unique flavours of botanicals like chamomile and tulsi . This was followed by Clearly Good Gin, India’s 1st Blue and Vapour-Infused gin created by Goa-based Shubham Khanna.  The year 2021 witnessed the launch of multiple brands: Seqér , Doja, Tāmras, to name a few. “Each of these has a unique story. While Seqér — from packaging to the botanicals used — preserves and boasts of the Goan identity, Tāmras has unique botanicals like sweet lime, lemon verbena, Nilgiri tea, Egyptian grapefruit and Indonesian cubeb peppers. Doja is a small-batch gin with a blend of Indian and Japanese botanicals,” says Rojita Tiwari, a certified drinks professional, educator and consultant. Today, customers, bartenders and restaurateurs in India can choose from about 11 indigenous gins from Goa, most of which are competitively priced between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 2,000 for a 700-750ml bottle. The reason for this sudden explosion can be attributed not only to the growing popularity of this spirit, but also to the business environment in the State being conducive to experimental launches. A chance question by a bartender in London, about Indian gins prompted Devika Bhagat and Khalil Bachooali, founders of Tāmras, gin, to set up their own distillery — The Adventurist Spirits Distillery in Colvale, North Goa — rather than go in for contract bottling. “It’s a 1,000 square metre space where we experiment, test, distil, blend and bottle and have an experience centre for tours and tastings,” says Devika. “Gin is primarily being made by up-and-coming millennials, who want business practices to be straightforward,” says Devika. “The Goa government and the Excise Department are supportive of new brands and distilleries. Excise licences are also reasonable and don’t eat into your set-up costs and initial investment,” she says. Familiar botanicals  Adriel Sequeira, founder of Seqér gin, believes that gin is the most versatile of all spirits and offers a lot of potential. Seqér gin is a blend of 10 botanicals, including one that is synonymous with Goa: cashewnuts. These are locally sourced, from right within the distillery premises. Cashewnuts were selected not only as a tribute to Goa and its beloved feni by this proudly local brand, but also to lend a distinct texture to the gin.   If local cashewnuts are what make Seqér stand out, the distillation and dilution process of Tāmras is its USP. Devika explains, “We use the multiple distillation and slow-dilution/desaponification process.” Their botanicals include mausambi (sweet lime), Indian mint ( pudina ), lotus flowers and lotus seeds. Devika says they are one of the few in the world using fresh whole citrus fruit. “By individually distilling mausambi , Indian lemon and grapefruit, we can distil our requirements for the whole year in those four winter months, when these fruits are harvested,” she says.  Spicy cocktails Indian spices contribute as much to these gins as botanicals. Jai Anand, founder, Doja, who opted for an Indo-Japanese collaboration to further his craft gin vision, believes that Indian spices like fennel, coriander, green cardamom and Himalayan peppermint, help amplify the flavours of Japanese botanicals such as yuzu lemon, with hints of cedar, sansho pepper, and Hinoki. Their Japanese master distiller Tsui San determined which Indian spices matched with base Japanese botanicals in the Goa-based, East Side Distillery. “The primary aromas in a gin have to be juniper, followed by the unique botanicals that the distiller wants to showcase,” explains Rojita. She adds, “The Juniper does not make such a difference as much as the botanicals, which play a major role in defining the gin. Unless it’s a juniper-forward gin such as Hapusa, juniper normally acts as a base aroma.” Rakshay Dhariwal, partner at Passcode Hospitality in Delhi, says, “Over the past year with Ping’s, Jamun and now Saz on the Beach in Goa, we’ve noticed people like to try new gins. Gins like Greater Than and Stranger & Sons are doing very well, but they have been around for a while and have created a huge following. Pumori, Tamras and Doja are also getting popular.” From being declared one of the eight best gins in the world by the International Wine And Spirit Competition in 2020, to winning the highest honours at The Asian Spirit Masters 2021, Stranger & Sons, has managed to put Indian gin on the world map. Hapusa, the Himalayan dry gin from Nao Spirits, produced and distilled in Goa, also bagged a gold medal at the prestigious The International Wines & Spirits Competition 2021. In an attempt to retain customer’s attention in a crowded market, brands have been hosting gin-fuelled events across Goa.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:49 IST,||Juniper on the beach||In Goa, Nilgiris tea meets Himalayan juniper and cashewnuts on the beaches and in the bars. While the past two pandemic years slowed business, and closed down many bars and restaurants, across the country, Goa has been bustling with new ideas and launches. Over the past two years, a host of home-brewn gins have mushroomed across the State, building on the impact created by Greater Than, Hapusa, Stranger & Sons and Jaisalmer, the gin brands that began celebrating Indian botanicals.  In 2020, Jin Jiji launched its India dry gin, with the unique flavours of botanicals like chamomile and tulsi . This was followed by Clearly Good Gin, India’s 1st Blue and Vapour-Infused gin created by Goa-based Shubham Khanna. The year 2021 witnessed the launch of multiple brands: Seqer, DOJA, Tāmras, to name a few. “Each of these has a unique story. While Seqer — from packaging to the botanicals used — preserves and boasts of the Goan identity, Tāmras has unique botanicals like sweet lime, lemon verbena, Nilgiri tea, Egyptian grapefruit and Indonesian cubeb peppers. Doja is a small-batch gin with a blend of Indian and Japanese botanicals,” says Rojita Tiwari, a certified drinks professional, educator and consultant.  Today, customers, bartenders and restaurateurs in India can choose from about 11 indigenous gins from Goa, most of which are competitively priced between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 2,000 for a 700-750ml bottle. The reason for this sudden explosion can be attributed not only to the growing popularity of this spirit, but also to the business environment in the State being conducive to experimental launches. A chance question by a bartender in London, about Indian gins prompted Devika Bhagat and Khalil Bachooali, founders of Tāmras, gin, to set up their own distillery — The Adventurist Spirits Distillery in Colvale, North Goa — rather than go in for contract bottling. “It’s a 1,000 square metre space where we experiment, test, distil, blend and bottle and have an experience centre for tours and tastings,” says Devika. “Gin is primarily being made by up-and-coming millennials, who want business practices to be straightforward,” says Devika. “The Goa Government and the Excise Department are supportive of new brands and distilleries. Excise licenses are also reasonable and don’t eat into your set-up costs and initial investment. Familiar botanicals  Adriel Sequeira, founder of Seqer gin, believes that gin is the most versatile of all spirits and offers a lot of potential. Seqér gin is a blend of 10 botanicals, including one that is synonymous with Goa: cashewnuts. These are locally sourced, from right within the distillery premises. Cashewnuts were selected not only as a tribute to Goa and its beloved feni by this proudly local brand, but also to lend a distinct texture to the gin.   If local cashewnuts are what make Seqer stand out, the distillation and dilution process of Tāmras is its USP. Devika explains, “We use the multiple distillation and slow-dilution/desaponification process.” Their botanicals include mausambi (sweet lime), Indian mint ( pudina ), lotus flowers and lotus seeds. Devika says they are one of the few in the world using fresh whole citrus fruit. “By individually distilling mausambi , Indian lemon and grapefruit, we can distil our requirements for the whole year in those four winter months, when these fruits are harvested.”  Spicy cocktails Indian spices contribute as much to these gins as botanicals. Jai Anand, founder, Doja, , who opted for an Indo-Japanese collaboration to further his craft gin vision, believes that Indian spices like fennel, coriander, green cardamom and Himalayan peppermint, help amplify the flavours of Japanese botanicals such as yuzu lemon, with hints of cedar, sansho pepper, and Hinoki. Their Japanese master distiller Tsui San determined which Indian spices matched with base Japanese botanicals in the Goa-based, East Side Distillery. “The primary aromas in a gin have to be juniper, followed by the unique botanicals that the distiller wants to showcase,” explains Rojita. She adds, “The Juniper does not make such a difference as much as the botanicals, which play a major role in defining the gin. Unless it’s a juniper-forward gin such as Hapusa, juniper normally acts as a base aroma.” Rakshay Dhariwal, partner at Passcode Hospitality in Delhi says, “Over the past year with Ping’s, Jamun and now Saz on the Beach in Goa, we’ve noticed people like to try new gins. Gins like Greater Than and Stranger & Sons are doing very well, but they have been around for a while and have created a huge following. Pumori, Tamras and Doja are also getting popular.” From being declared one of the eight best gins in the world by the International Wine And Spirit Competition in 2020, to winning the highest honours at The Asian Spirit Masters 2021, Stranger & Sons, has managed to put Indian gin on the world map. Hapusa, the Himalayan dry gin from Nao Spirits, produced and distilled in Goa, also bagged a gold medal at the prestigious The International Wines & Spirits Competition 2021. In an attempt to retain customer’s attention in a crowded market, brands have been hosting gin-fuelled events across Goa The Himalayan takeover by Hapusa, conducted in Goa in November 2021, celebrated Himalayan ingredients – Edible camphor, Earl Grey tea, Cardamom and Timbur. Cocktails using these were created, from the Forest Trail using Hapusa, camphor, tonic and kaffir lime leaf, to a refreshing Earl of the Himalayas, fragrant with Earl Grey tea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/juniper-on-the-beach/article64991951.ece

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 07:01 IST,||Toy story||Colourful wooden toys dot the streets of Gombegala nagara or the town of toys in Ramanagara district, Karnataka. The small town of Channapatna has gained prominence as the producer of wooden toys that are unique and showcase the talent of its craftsmen. The beginning The history of Channapatana toys can be traced back to the time of Tipu Sultan, who encouraged the Persians to come down to India and teach the artisans the art. Bavas Miyan is known as the Father of Channapatna Toys for his commitment to helping the local artisans and bringing in new technologies to improve the craft. How the toys are made The toys were made mainly from Dhoodi Wood or Milkwood, as it was easy to carve out the shapes. However, craftsmen now use other types of hardwood like rubberwood, sycamore, silver wood and red cedar. The wood is seasoned for two to three months before carving begins. A lathe machine is used to create objects that are symmetrical around an axis. The pieces are shaped in cylindrical forms. Then a machine is used to shape these into spheres, hemispheres, cones, and other round forms. It is then rubbed with sandpaper to get an even surface.  The wooden toy is coloured using vegetable-dyed lacquer sticks and polished by rubbing it with a palm leaf. The eye-catching colours are made using natural materials. The yellow dye is from turmeric, blue from indigo powder, red and orange from kumkum , and brown from from the acacia tree.  Traditionally, the craftsmen made animal figurines, kitchen sets, playing tops and characters from folk tales. Today, they also make aesthetic jewellery boxes, coaster sets and key chains. How to get there Channapatana lies on the Bengaluru-Myysuru Highway. The place is 57 km away from Bengaluru; 84 km from Mysuru and 14.5 km from Ramanagara, the location for many famous movies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/toy-story/article64991546.ece

This town has the ancient and famous Parthasarathy temple, on the banks of the Pampa. According to legend, the king of Pandalam brought artisans from Sankaran Koil near Tirunelveli to Aranmula to build the temple.  These skilled craftsmen also made ornaments, cooking vessels and bells by casting copper-based alloys and thereby discovered the reflective property of a particular copper-tin alloy. Thus began the tradition of making the Aranmula kannadi .  Process of production This extraordinary mirror is handmade and, unlike the usual glass mirror, eliminates secondary reflections typically seen in back surface mirrors. First, the mould is prepared, based on the shape, and the metals are melted. Eighty mirrors can be made from one mould. The names and composition of the metals are known only to the craftsmen and is referred to as the Vishwakarma family secret. In the second stage, the metal is polished. This labour-intensive task takes weeks to get that perfect finish and reflective surface. Once done, the mirror is set in elegant ornamental frames. These mirrors can never be duplicated, as the intricacies of making them are known only to the family that crafts them. It is believed that the formula of the alloy was revealed in a dream to a woman from one artisan’s family.  The Aranmula kannadi is part of the Ashtamangalya set (eight auspicious items) usually displayed at religious ceremonies, functions and weddings. It is believed to bring luck and is kept in places of worship and meditation. To clean it, one has to wipe the surface only in one specific direction to maintain its lustre and luminosity.  In 2004, this rare craft was awarded a geographical indication (GI) tag and a 45-cm tall mirror was placed in London’s British Museum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/a-mirrors-secret/article64991547.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:58 IST,||Unique and exclusive||Remember the dancing girl statue from the Indus Valley Civilisation? Would you imagine that the same technique continues to be used even today? The well-known Dhokra metal craft of Bastar district in Chhattisgarh uses the lost-wax casting technique from ancient times. The technique First, the artisan makes a mould with sand and clay. Then it is layered with cow dung and pure beeswax. The next step is to make wax threads and wind them around the mould. This is then put in the furnace. Once the wax melts, molten brass or bronze is poured into the mould. Once they cool, the mould is broken and the final figure is taken out. Since each figure requires an individual mould, this is a time-consuming process. But then each figure is unique and exclusive. What they make Traditionally, the artisans made animals like horses, elephants, owls and peacocks, religious figures, bowls and lamps. Today, they are experimenting with different kinds including jewellery, plates, photo frame, wall hangings, cutlery and decorative items. This allows them to appeal to a more modern taste and find a market for their ancient craft. While metal is the most popular, the Dhokra art uses other material as well. Bamboo Dhokra uses the reed to make baskets and furniture for homes. Wooden Dhokra primarily features religious figures and items used in festivals in and around Bastar. A third kind uses mud and soil to make statues, vessels, pots, and other items. Name The name comes from the Dhokra Damar tribe, who are traditional metalsmiths in eastern India. Though originally the community lived in the area from Jharkhand to Odisha, they travelled across the country and are now found from Kerala in the south to Rajasthan in the north. The craft as practised in Bastar district is the most famous but artisans are found across the country, as a result of their travels. Dhokra art from Andhra Pradesh/Telangana, Jharkhand and Odisha is also well known. In fact, in 2018, the Adilabad Dokra from Telangana State was awarded the GI tag. Livelihood Despite the demand in India and abroad, many artisans feel that they cannot make a living from this art. Since the process is both time-consuming and labour-intensive — it takes around 15 days to make a small piece — the younger generation prefers give up this traditional practice and move on to other jobs.  While metal is the most popular, the Dhokra art uses other material as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/unique-and-exclusive/article64991553.ece

But then Aniket brings exciting news.  “Hey Anki, I have got news for you,” Aniket said. Cricket is being introduced for girls and selection will be held when school reopens.” “Yahoo!” Anki yelled, jumping up. I’ll participate in the trials.” “Of course, you should. You have a great chance of making it to the team.” Shared passion Cricket was a passion the twins shared and one ofAnkita’s pet peeves was that their school allowed only boys to play cricket. To make up for the lost opportunity, almost every evening Ankita played cricket along with a bunch of boys. She was a batsman who could bowl fairly decently and her team mates admired her all-round skills. “I am not so sure, Ani. I shall be competing with girls from senior classes.” “Anki, I think you should get some coaching during the holidays.” “Where will I get a good coach?”  Aniket thought about that and then said, “Geetha will be the best person.” Sixteen-year-old Geetha was the daughter of Lakshmi, their neighbour’s cook. They lived in the basti behind the twins’ home.  “Pluto Sports has set up a cricket academy and Geetha has been selected for coaching. I heard that she attends every morning and evening before and after school.” “Will she have the time for me?” Ankita said. “Let us ask her.” *** The next evening, the twins went to see Geetha, who was tall and had an oval face and thick curly hair. She reminded Ankita of their science teacher in a good mood. Aniket quickly explained to Geetha why they had come to meet her. Immediately her face creased into a sparkling smile. “I would love to coach Ankita didi.” “First, I am not didi, I am just Ankita.” Geetha nodded. “Now, tell me, when and where will you coach me?” Ankita asked. An early start “My school is not very far from your house. My friends and I have drawn stumps on the back wall of the school. We have also created a rough pitch. We can practice from 6.00 to 7.00 in the morning.” “So early and that too on holidays!” Ankita groaned. “We have no choice. By 7.30 a.m., I have to report to the Cricket Academy.” That night, Ankita was too excited to sleep. Would Geetha’s mentoring help her achieve her dream of getting into the school team?

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:46 IST,||How Nayyar called the tune||O.P. Nayyar passed away 15 years ago today. The composer set and lived by his own rules. Though not formally trained, his music had great depth and variety. He preferred to work with only his three favourite singers, or three others who were second in line.  Geeta Dutt was associated with Nayyar right from his debut film Aasmaan (1952), followed by Baaz (1953), but the team really struck gold with Aar Paar’s (1954) superhits like ‘Yeh lo main haari piya’, ‘Ja ja ja ja bewafa’ and ‘Babuji dheere chalna’ and the Rafi-Geeta duet ‘Sun sun sun sun zaalima’.   Nayyar admitted that Geeta was responsible for this major breakthrough, followed by Mr & Mrs 55 (1955), which had Rafi-Geeta hits like ‘Chal diye banda nawaaz’, ‘Udhar tum haseen ho’ and ‘Jaane kahaan mera jigar gaya ji’. The Nayyar-Geeta duo scored 65 songs (37 of them solos) in 22 films, before he moved to Asha Bhosle.  Two untrained geniuses  Besides the fizz, Nayyar also utilised the silken and sensuous timbre of Geeta’s voice, which S.D. Burman had presented to the world in Baazi . Nayyar also extracted the melancholy in ‘Ae dil ae diwane’ from Baaz . The association saw an abrupt but memorable end with the iconic ‘Mera naam Chin Chin Chu’ from Howrah Bridge (1958), though the two untrained geniuses continued to hold each other in great regard. Geeta once said that Nayyar “composed feelings, not words,” while Nayyar praised her ease with both seductive and classical songs.   Compared to Geeta Dutt, Asha Bhosle sang a huge number of songs, over 320, for the maverick composer, beginning with Chham Chhama Chham (1952). However, it took them almost five years to come up with a hit and that happened with B.R. Chopra’s Naya Daur (1957).  Then began their long association that developed into a deep personal relationship. Nayyar always believed that Asha’s voice had more weight than Lata Mangeshkar’s (who never sang for him). Tumsa Nahin Dekha followed in the same year, and in ‘Aaiye meherbaan’ from Howrah Bridge, Asha won hearts with her sensual voice. Their songs spanned a wide range of emotions. The duo parted after the poignant ‘Chain se humko kabhi’ from Pran Jaaye Par Vachan Na Jaaye (1974), which won Asha the Filmfare Best Female Playback Singer. Ironically, the song was not retained in the Sunil Dutt-Rekha starrer.   Nayyar’s association with Mohammed Rafi began with Baaz and Guru Dutt ensured that he had Rafi with him till the end of his career. It was with Aar Paar ’s ‘Mohabbat kar lo’ and ‘Sun sun sun sun zaalima’ that they made it big. Mr & Mrs 55 , C.I.D ., Naya Daur , Tumsa Nahin Dekha, and a row of other chartbusters followed in the 1950s. The duo was phenomenal in the 60s, with Kashmir Ki Kali and Mere Sanam leading the hits.   For Nayyar, Rafi was precious. They created magic with songs such as ‘Tukde hain mere dil ke’ ( Mere Sanam ), ‘Maang ke saath tumhara’ ( Naya Daur ) with its patent ghoda-ghadi beat, ‘Jawaniyaan yeh mast mast’ or the title-track ‘Tumsa nahin dekha’, the classical duet with Manna Dey, ‘Tu hai mera prem devta’ ( Kalpana ), ‘Aanchal mein sajaa lena’ ( Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon ) and ‘Ae dil hai mushkil’ ( C.I.D. ). When Nayyar chose his top ten Rafi songs, it included the devotional masterpiece, ‘Aana hai to aa’ (Naya Daur).   The Rafi-O.P. innings ended on a dismal note with Heera Moti (1979), one of Nayyar’s attempted comebacks. But he could not imagine music without his favourite male singer and, in the 80s and 90s, used Mohammed Aziz and Shabbir Kumar, both known as Rafi clones.  Second line of singers  When the strict disciplinarian had a problem with Rafi because he reached late for a recording, Nayyar replaced him for a while with Mahendra Kapoor, a self-professed Rafi fan. This included songs like ‘Mera pyar woh hai’ ( Yeh Raat Phir Na Aayegi ) and ‘Badal aaye agar maali’ ( Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi ).  After S.D. Burman, Nayyar was the one to recognise Kishore Kumar’s genius and bonded well with him.  They came up with hits like ‘Meri neendon mein tum’ ( Naya andaz ) and ‘Savere ka suraj’ ( Ek baar mooskura do ), though he got Rafi to sing the classical song, ‘Man mora baanwra’ for him in Ragini.   Shamshad Begum was a favourite too. Their evergreens included ‘Reshmi salwar kurta jaali ka’ ( Naya Daur with Asha), ‘Kahin pe nigahen’ ( C.I.D. ), and ‘Kabhi aar kabhi paar’ ( Aar Paar ). The last popular song that she sang for Nayyar was ‘Kajra mohabbatwala’ from Kismet in 1968.  Nayyar respected his singers, harnessed their voices according to his needs, and understood their range and capabilities. His many timeless songs are proof that he was a master at it.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 03:46 IST,||The iconic guru||The young boy was busy leading the cows to graze in his village Vellinezhi in Kerala when a neighbour chased him off on an errand to buy betel leaves. By the time the boy returned, the animals had chewed up the standing paddy crop. He was caned by his elder brother for his irresponsible behaviour. The wailing 13-year-old was soon consoled and, in strange consolation, was allowed to learn Kathakali. Thus, in 1951, Kalamandalam got a new student — Puthanveettil Kuttan, who trained in the art form for the next seven years. His main guide was Ramankutty Nair (1925-2013), the very same person who had sent him on the errand that got him punished. A bunch of talented contemporaries also enriched Kuttan’s knowledge at the eminent institution in Cheruthuruthy, 30 km south of his village. Both Ramankutty Nair and Kuttan’s initial teacher, Padmanabhan Nair, hailed from the same verdant Palakkad village. The course moulded Kuttan into a promising proponent of the body-centric Kalluvazhi style of the dance-theatre. Yet, for the next six years, his career as a a freelance artiste remained uncertain. A break came in 1964, when nascent Kalanilayam at Irinjalakuda recruited him. There, over three-and-a-half decades, he emerged as a guru. His exquisite training skills put him in the league of Padmanabhan Nair (1928-2007), who was more a teacher-theorist than performer. Kalamandalam Kuttan died on January 13, a month short of turning 84. The end came a quarter century after he retired as the principal of the Kathakali school where he taught for 34 years. Says his long-time colleague Kalanilayam Raghavan, “Kuttan was completely absorbed in training.” Consistency in concepts Kalanilayam Mukundakumar, who teaches at Santiniketan in Bengal, talks in awe about the consistency in Kuttan’s choreographic concepts. “He was definite about the points of beginning and ending each mudra. He would be unsparing if you erred. When we moved into higher classes, the training focused on the roles we excelled in.” Septuagenarian Desamangalam Savithri, who was Kuttan’s first female student, recalls how the guru’s intense involvement enabled her debut in the invocatory Purappad at the age of eight. “Those days,” reminisces maestro Sadanam Krishnankutty, “Kuttan was integral to the Lavanasuravadham Kathakali that featured Ramankutty Nair as Hanuman. Kuttan would be Lava with K.G. Vasu, his junior, playing Kusha. He used to sing well too.” Appukuttan Swaralayam, an organiser of cultural festivals, shares his experiences on anchoring Kuttan’s lec-dems at SPIC MACAY in the 2000s. “Several of his acts, marked by intense stylisation, would get encore requests from students.” It is said that nobody portrayed Sati’s father as well as Kuttan, which earned him the portmanteau of ‘DakshanKuttan’. It’s another matter that he always loved teaching that part more than enacting it.

A FinTech cell, an export cell and a work-lab cell (to strengthen the collaboration between the academia and the industry) have been formed. We are also promoting southern districts through special incentives. So how do you intend to promote southern districts? Steps are being taken to open new industrial parks in Virudhunagar, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi, Sivaganga, Theni, Kanniyakumari, Pudukottai, Dindigul and Tirunelveli. Work is in progress in six of these districts. For setting up industrial complexes and development centres, SIPCOT will allocate land with 50% subsidy and 100% exemption from stamp duty. Around 522.60 acres at Sipcot industrial estates/industrial development centres at Nilakkottai, Pudukottai, Manamadurai, Thoothukudi and Gangaikondan have been allotted at 50% subsidy. More than 624.68 acres of industrial land has been provided at 50% subsidy to 169 factories in the SIPCOT industrial parks in southern districts. These benefits will be extended to new SIPCOT parks in the nine districts. SIPCOT will come out with food parks in Theni and Thoothukudi. A detailed project report is being prepared. There are plans to set up a 1,500-acre industrial park in Virudhunagar (Kumaralingapuram, E. Muthulingapuram and Tulukkapatti villages) and a project report is being prepared. Besides, the Chennai-Kanniyakumari expressway will be implemented with financial assistance from Asian Development Bank. What is the status of the Chennai-Kanniyakumari industrial corridor project? To start with, two terminals — Madurai-Dindigul-Virudhunagar and Thoothukudi-Tirunelveli — will be given priority. The master plan for phase-I has been completed. What is the update on the FinTech City? Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation is identifying and appointing a project management consultant. The FinTech cell is working with FinTech firms, payment service providers and industry thinktanks to increase user adoption and encourage digital payments. The cell is also working with industry stakeholders for curating courses to develop talent pool in the FinTech space. Everyone seems to be wooing Elon Musk on Twitter to invest in their States, but has anyone from Tamil Nadu reached out to Tesla? Tweets don’t translate into investments. The tweet is just a small trigger. We need to have a lot of talks. Yes, we have shared details of incentives and the electric vehicle ecosystem in Tamil Nadu with them. We have informed them of the speedy approvals for land parcels. The challenges, including waiving of import duty, are within the realm of the Union government. Ford will wind up operations at its Chennai plant as part of its revamping strategy. How does the State intend to handle this? The government is closely monitoring the situation. We are ready to extend all assistance to Ford to revive production. We have reached out to other car manufacturers and in case any one of them comes forward, we will provide all assistance. The Foxconn issue has opened up the Pandora’s box in terms of living standards of workers in the industrial belt, where many women are employed. How do you ensure living standards are good for industrial workers? As soon as the issue broke out in Foxconn, the government intervened and held meetings. The management has plans to arrange hostel facility for 5,400 women employees. Around 1,600 have resumed work. Earlier this week, the Foxconn top management met Chief Minister M.K.Stalin and detailed the measures being taken for the welfare of employees. We asked them to bring in new investments. In the long run, SIPCOT is in advanced stages of taking up industrial housing which will benefit industrial workers. A recent study shows Tamil Nadu has emerged as the most attractive investment destination in the first 9 months of FY 2022. What led to this? It is due to the multiple policy initiatives taken by the State. A life sciences promotion policy, a research and development policy, a footwear policy and an updated EV policy are on the cards. The single window portal 2.0 has helped industries. Another 100 services are being planned to be offered through the single window portal by this year. The State has repealed, subsumed or amended archaic Acts and rules to reduce the burden of compliance. Reforms to reduce and simplify over 300 such mandates were introduced and 165 obsolete/redundant Acts were repealed. How supportive is the Centre when it comes to industrial development in Tamil Nadu? We have not had issues on industrial projects. We had discussions on the defence corridor and have identified some projects. We also had discussions with Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on the textile park. Will you take forward the MoUs signed in the two Global Investors’ Meet held during the AIADMK regime? We will not drop anything. There is no discrimination. We want industrial growth. An interview is incomplete without asking the Industries Minister about the status of the second airport. Four sites near Chennai have been identified. The government and TIDCO have requested the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to depute a team to evaluate them. AAI will send a team shortly. Once the site is finalised, TIDCO will appoint consultants for preparing a techno-economic feasibility report and selection of a developer.  Steps are being taken to open new industrial parks in Virudhunagar, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi, Sivaganga, Theni, Kanniyakumari, Pudukottai, Dindigul and Tirunelveli||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/we-want-to-create-46-lakh-jobs-by-2030/article64991719.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:35 IST,||Excavations set to resume||Archaeological excavations at Gangaikondacholapuram, the city King Rajendra Chola I (1012-1044) built after his victorious expedition up to the Gangetic plains, are set to get wider in scope as Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has announced the government’s intent to take up the second phase of exploration. The Department of Archaeology will begin phase-II of the excavation in early February, having unearthed substantial portions of brick structures of what are believed to be the remains of a Chola period palace last year. Huge lake Gangaikondacholapuram had been the capital of the Cholas for about 250 years from about 1025 CE. Rajendra Chola, known for his exploits far and wide, is credited with having a strong army and an unmatched naval force. He not only built the Gangaikondacholeeswarar Temple, rivalling the Peruvudaiyar Kovil (Sri Brihadisvara/Big Temple) built by his father Rajaraja Chola at Thanjavur, but also a huge lake to the west of the city, named Cholagangam. The lake is considered the jalasthambam, signifying his victorious march up to the Ganges. Known as Ponneri now, it still remains one of the biggest in the region. It is widely believed that palaces of Chola kings had existed there about 1,000 years ago but were destroyed during the Pandya invasions or later. Excavations carried out in 1980s by the Department of Archaeology, under the direct supervision of its first director R. Nagaswamy, who died recently, had already brought to light the hidden structures of a palace and the city. More come out More portions of what are believed to be a medieval palace were exposed during the excavation conducted last year close to the trench dug earlier. Brick structures were unearthed in 13 of the 17 quadrants dug at Maaligaimedu (palace mound), situated in the vicinity of the Gangaikondacholeeswarar Temple, in the latest excavation. Walls made of burnt bricks, measuring 27 x 13 x 5 cm and 30 x 15 x 8 cm, have been exposed. Brick structures were found at a depth of just from 12 cm and up to a depth of more than two metres. Four to 32 courses of bricks were found in various depths. Roofing tiles and iron nails were recovered in large numbers. A Chola period copper coin, glass beads and bangles, hopscotch markers, spouted knobs, terracotta pieces and ceramics, such as red ware, black ware, decorated ware and Chinese ware, including celadon ware, were among the finds. The recovery of the Chinese ware indicated that trade ties had existed between the two countries then, officials say. Further excavation could lead to unearthing of more such structures and possibly antiques, sources in the Department said. “We will continue the excavation mainly at the present site, but we may expand further depending on the nature of the structures and material that we find. Apart from exposing more of the palace, we will be looking for evidences of the trade links that had existed with various countries then,” an official source indicated. “Gangaikondacholapuram has an important place in the history of the Cholas. The palace remains are the only surviving examples of the secular architecture of the Cholas in Tamil Nadu. There are good chances of unearthing more of the architecture. It is an important site which needs to be preserved and explored further,” said K. Sridharan, former Deputy Superintending Archaeologist. Call for studies Mr. Sridharan, who was part of the Department’s team which carried out the first excavation at the site in 1981, pointed out that the team had recovered the handle of a sword, coins and other antiques. Scientific studies could bring out the evidence of trade and cultural contacts with various countries, he added. Local residents are equally enthusiastic over the next phase of excavation. “We wish it proves to be a successful venture. There is still a large area to be covered — there has been a foundry (referred locally as ‘kollankuzhi’), pottery-making and dyeing industries. We hope more evidence will be unearthed to establish that Gangaikondacholapuram had been a thriving mercantile city,” said R. Komagan, chairman, Gangaikondacholapuram Development Council Trust.  The Department of Archaeology will begin phase-II of the excavation in early February, having unearthed substantial portions of brick structures of what are believed to be the remains of a Chola period palace last year||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/excavations-set-to-resume/article64991717.ece

In 2018, The Hindu had reported on the said project highlighting the illegalities in the selection of the present builder.  Unable to kick-start the work in last four years, the existing builder Shiv Infra Vision Pvt Ltd is transferring the slum redevelopment project on Andheri’s RTO land. It is the project over which allegations of irregularities were leveled against Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and State’s current Food and Civil Supply minister Chhagan Bhujbal and he was even jailed. Mr. Bhujbal was recently acquitted of all charges. A public notice for investigating the title of the said land was issued recently indicating that the project is set to change the hands, once again. The move however has raised question mark on the conduct of the then Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) officials who handed over the project to present company despite several violations of rule. linked with scam The Rs. 5,000-crore redevelopment project under the SRA in Annanagar, Vitthal-Rakhumai, and Kasam Nagar slums, Andheri, was stuck in controversy for years after it was linked with the alleged Maharashtra Sadan scam. The slum was earlier to be redeveloped by M/s K.S. Chamankar Enterprises. This was terminated in June 19, 2017 over its alleged links in the Maharashtra Sadan scam. After vacating the slums, an RTO office, staff quarter and testing track was to be built in the space. Chamankar was to get 21,000 square meter of TDR in return for building Maharashtra Sadan at Delhi. But Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kirit Somaiya and Aam Aadmi Party leader Anjali Damaniahave levelled allegations of Rs. 10,000 crore scam. The special court has already acquitted all including Mr. Bhujbal and Chamankar Enterprises. However, in the interim Shiv Infra Vision Pvt. Ltd. was appointed as the new developer by the SRA despite several irregularities. This group has now decided to sell the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mumbais-controversial-sra-project-to-change-hands-again/article38337188.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:34 IST,||Chennai Centre comes a long way||Twenty years ago, the World Bank Group (WBG) decided to set up its Shared Services Centre in Chennai, its largest outside of the United States headquarters, with just 70 staff members. Now it hosts over 1,200 member workforce in more than 15 unique business functions, delivering services to all WBG offices. “The Bank chose Chennai for its shared services operations over other locations owing to its strong talent pool, good quality life, supportive government, strong education, investor-friendly environment, and its cost effectiveness. The rapid growth of the centre and of shared services in Chennai more broadly confirms that it was an excellent decision,” a World Bank spokesperson said. Located on a 3.5-acre site at Taramani, just off Chennai’s bustling Information Technology Corridor, the centre supports the mission of the development institution to alleviate poverty and boost shared prosperity and acts as a role model for many initiatives. The Chennai operation was started when some of the WBG’s accounting functions were transitioned from its Washington DC headquarters in 2001. It provides accounting, finance, human resource, and information technology services to over 130 WBG offices across the globe. The World Bank’s spokesperson pointed out that the talent in Chennai is deep and has facilitated the office’s continuous expansion into many functional areas. “Whether seeking accounting, finance, information technology, human resources or other business skills, the Chennai talent pool has exceeded the expectations of the WBG,” he added. Most importantly, the flagship centre has served as the model for a second WBG shared services centre in Sofia, Bulgaria, according to him. Since 2018, Robotics Process Automation (RPA) has revolutionised many routine, repetitive and rules-based transaction processes in units. Today, units have invested in staff for the required project management and bot development skills and more than 53 bots are in action, including a few chatbots, the spokesperson said. In recent years, the Chennai Centre has undertaken some transformative projects. One of them is the consolidation of WBG’s worldwide payment processes. This was done following a significant multi-year effort at standardisation, digitisation, process optimisation, systems development and automation. This was paired with a parallel effort to invest in change management and staff learning and training, including creation of centres of excellence around reporting, analytics, and intelligence support, the spokesperson explained. “In our experience, Chennai has a vast talent pool that, through ongoing programmes and recruitment strategies, will continue to have the skills needed today and into the future,” he said. “The very high level of engagement among our staff is also a significant aspect of a sustainable, if not growing, future for the centre,” he added. The WBG’s Chennai Community Connection Trust (CCCT), a staff-led programme, supports marginalised and underprivileged sections through community projects such as childhood education and disaster recovery. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it supported the purchase of beds and oxygen concentrators for a hospital for children. The Center hosts delegations of industry leaders planning to set up shared services centres in India to share its experience and best practices in the journey in Chennai, the spokesperson added.  The Chennai operation was started when some of the WBG’s accounting functions were transitioned from its Washington DC headquarters in 2001.

28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:34 IST,||When sale of lottery had spiritual goal||Years ago, States like Tamil Nadu banned the sale of lottery tickets, which had become an addiction for many and which was equated with gambling. However, it is interesting to learn lottery tickets had entered India,147 years ago, not as a revenue model but to mobilise funds to repair the gopuram of the Sthanumalayaswamy temple at Suchindram in Kanniyakumari district. The district was then part of the erstwhile Travancore. It happened in ‘Kollam year 1050’, corresponding to 1875 AD, after the two stages of the gopuram were damaged in thunder and lightning on a rainy day. “As it required a lot of money, Parameswara Sharma, my great-great grandfather, who had read about the practice of selling [lottery] tickets in the U.S., pitched the idea before Travancore King Visakam Thirunal, who approved it,” said N.P. Sharma, the Sthanikar of the Vattapalli Madam at Suchindram. Sthanikar, a hereditary dignity, is the managing trustee of the rites and ceremonies of the temple. Copy preserved Dr. Sharma said the King favoured the idea of completing the work in three years in phases. “But my great-great grandfather was firm that once the work started it cannot be allowed to wait for want of funds. He was close to the King, who would address him as Paachu. The King was not optimistic when he was told about the proposal to sell lottery tickets. But Parameswara Sharma had convinced the King saying anything could be achieved with the grace of Padmanabhaswamy and the blessings of the King.” Subsequently, an order was issued and a copy of it is still preserved at Vattapalli Madam.  The height of the gopuram is 134 feet and 6 inches. According to historian K.K. Pillai, the author of the monograph, The Suchindram Temple , the gopuram stands over a plinth area of nearly 5,400 square feet (about 90 feet in length and 60 feet in width). The original gopuram was constructed by 1545 AD and the tower above the plinth was renovated in 1888.  “The Suchindram gopuram forms a striking contrast with the one at the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram, where the width at base is excessive in relation to its height. Indeed, none of the temples in the entire Travancore can boast of a gopuram so elegant and graceful as the one at Suchindram,” Pillai had written in his book. Winner not known Dr. Sharma said that as per the government order, the project cost worked out to Rs. 70,000. The government decided to utilise Rs. 30,000 from the temple coffers, while the lottery was launched to mobilise the rest. “Unfortunately we do not have details of the winner of the lottery. It was successfully conducted, and the work was completed. As the completion of the project required less than what was estimated, the surplus was surrendered to the government. But the King asked our great-great grandfather to use the amount to draw paintings in the gopuram. The sthalapurana of Suchindram was depicted in the paintings,” Dr. Sharma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/when-sale-of-lottery-had-spiritual-goal/article64991718.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:35 IST,||A conducive ecosystem for Farmer Producers Organisations||On New Year’s Day, when Salem’s Veerapandy Kalanjia Jeevidam Farmers Producer Company was showcased nationally as one of the success stories of Farmer Producers Organisation (FPO), the development did not cause any surprise. For, Tamil Nadu had been identified by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) as one having a conducive ecosystem for the formation and nurturing of FPOs. That day, the Salem FPO’s director, R. Shanthi, 39, who did not study beyond high school, interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and explained that her organisation was “fully owned and operated by women,” with 2,211 shareholders from 152 villages spread over the Sankagiri, Makudanchavadi, Veerapandi and Panamarathupatti panchayat unions. The five-year-old FPO, according to the NABARD in its State Focus Paper for 2022-23, turned the COVID-19 pandemic into a business opportunity and achieved a turnover of Rs. 18.28 crore during 2020-21 as against Rs. 1.10 crore in 2018-19. The company earned a net profit of Rs. 37.26 lakh during 2020-21. Its activities include procurement, processing, value addition and marketing of groundnut, millets, black gram and chilli, besides processing of pulses and oilseeds. What was more fulfilling for the firm at the peak of the first wave was that “we distributed 82,000 food kits, each worth Rs. 3,000, mostly to our own members, whose movement was hugely confined by the restrictions. We allowed our members to pay us in instalments as we knew their livelihood opportunities were terribly hit,” explains R. Poongodi, another director. Thoothukudi, a district where water is scarce, has seen the emergence of many FPOs, regarded as the best performers. One such is Vizhuthugal Agricultural Farmers Producer Company of Vilathikulam. Set up in 2015, it deals with dry chilly and lemon. It is the market integration partner for a primary processing centre (PPC), which has an auction hall and a cold storage of 10 tonnes capacity. The facility can handle four tonnes a day. “We have given the PPC to another FPO on lease to run it,” says Soundararajan, director of the firm. Both FPOs have been backed by the NABARD, and supported by resource institutions for professional expertise. According to the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business (DAMAB), a number of FPOs, including Tamil Nadu Banana Producer Company and Virudhai Millets Farmers Producers Company (FPC), are involved in the export of produce. The State boasts of having 716 FPOs. Explaining the importance of FPOs, a veteran administrator says there are two basic features of the farm sector. One is the strong attachment of the farmers to land which, in turn, comes in the way of land consolidation in the conventional sense. This leads to fragmented land ownership, an obstacle to enhancing productivity. To overcome these problems, FPOs offer a durable solution, as they can facilitate aggregation of resources of small and marginal farmers with better scale of operation and operational efficiency. Having realised the significance of FPOs, the State government has been supporting them through the DAMAB. The Tamil Nadu Small Farmers Agri Business Consortium is the nodal agency for FPOs. Two years ago, the State unveiled a policy document on FPOs, besides a scheme for providing access to adequate and affordable financing to FPOs. This year, the State has decided to make use of the Central sector scheme for promotion of 10,000 FPOs across the country. As a result, 50 have been formed, of which five have been given equity grant of about Rs. 24 lakh. Besides, 13 FPOs are being set up through the Tamil Nadu Irrigated Agriculture Modernisation Project. A senior official says the government has decided to give preference to FPOs while allotting shops in select municipal corporations so that FPOs can market value-added products. The FPOs face several challenges, says A.P. Karuppaiah, president of the Confederation of Farmer Producer Companies of Tamil Nadu. Calling for strengthening the wing that deals with FPOs, he says the government should take steps for common branding and standardisation of FPO products. It can utilise the FPOs’ services for procurement of paddy or pulses which can be used for the PDS. K. Ramasamy, former Vice- Chancellor, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, wants the government to commission a comprehensive survey of overseas market for produce and encourages FPOs to channelise their operations on the basis of its findings. An official of NABARD says each organisation and its mentor-institution should analyse the strengths and weaknesses in the area where they operate to carry out business activity suitably.  The State has been supporting FPOs through the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/a-conducive-ecosystem-for-farmer-producers-organisations/article64991716.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 06:35 IST,||Big flow into green energy projects||The revised solar policy announced by the State government and the fixing of tariff by the TNERC for domestic and high-tension generators have come as a boost to revive solar projects that had reportedly been stalled for a few years. The classification of more than 151 kilowatt under the category of generators with no network charges would help even small landholders put up solar plants. Against this backdrop, the State is set to see several solar projects coming up. One of the country’s leading renewable energy companies, Leap Green Energy, is set to enter the solar market in a big way and is known to have confirmed a huge investment of Rs. 1,500 crore in Tamil Nadu in the renewables, storage and green hydrogen sector. The company, based in Coimbatore, has drawn up plans for a bouquet of renewable projects comprising wind, solar and battery storage for this financial year, according to Dev Anand Vijayan, founder and chief executive officer of Leap Green Energy. Rajeev Karthikeyan, the founder and managing director, had recently disclosed the company’s plans to enter the electric vehicle charging project. Unlike other such projects, the one proposed by the company is holistically designed to be in a greenway, using hybrid renewable power, artificial intelligence and energy storage, thereby ensuring that electric vehicles are fully powered through renewable energy. Vikram Solar is operating a 1.3 GW solar photovoltaic module manufacturing unit at Oragadam, which takes its cumulative PV module manufacturing capacity to 2.5 GW. Enabling environment Gyanesh Chaudhary, vice-chairman and managing director, Vikram Solar, said the Tamil Nadu government offered an enabling policy environment and business ecosystem for ease of doing business, such as capital subsidy, interest subvention and low-tension power tariff subsidy. He said the company was seeking to establish a new integrated facility of 2 GW in Tamil Nadu for manufacturing solar modules having full backward integration with solar cells. “Tamil Nadu is well developed in terms of infrastructure, road and rail networks, ports and airports across the State providing excellent connectivity, power and other utility benefits... We believe Tamil Nadu can become a global manufacturing hub in the solar sector, and Vikram Solar will continue to support the State government to achieve it,” Mr. Chaudhary added. At the forefront He pointed out that Tamil Nadu had been one of the early proponents of clean energy and was at the forefront of India’s clean energy transition. “We believe, with the State government’s endeavour to become energy self-sufficient, there is an immense opportunity for solar energy generation across segments — rooftop, large-scale solar parks and wind-solar hybrid projects. The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited plans to add 25 GW renewable energy in the next 10 years, including 20 GW solar power. Additionally, enabling policies like net-metering will further boost solar energy adoption,” Mr. Chaudhary added.

He was 78. The multi-faceted Dr. Awachat did yeoman service in helping addicts across India through his de-addiction centre for several decades. Muktangan was set up in the mid-1980s and helped treat thousands of addicts using medicines and varied therapies. Dr. Awachat, who got his medical degree from Pune’s B.J. Medical College, was noted for his incisive writings and contribution to literary journalism.  In the early 1970s, he edited a popular Marathi journal called Sadhana which featured his writings on social issues, notably his reportage of the 1972 drought that ravaged Maharashtra. His many books include Kondmara (1985) on Dalit atrocities and Dharmik (1989), a penetrating expose on the cult of false godmen in Maharashtra.  Paying rich tributes to Dr. Awachat, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his condolence message said he was a self-taught writer and a born journalist whose writings had left an indelible impression on Marathi literature. “Dr. Awachat’s writing and social work will be an inspiration for generations to come. Maharashtra will always remember his significant contributions to the fields of de-addiction and mental health and his unique writing style left a mark on Marathi journalism,” said Mr. Thackeray. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said Dr. Awachat was a multifaceted personality who contributed to society as medical expert, journalist, author, painter, sculptor, and social activist. Big loss, says Ajit Pawar “His departure is a big loss to the social, literary and cultural spheres of society,” Mr. Pawar said. Dr. Awachat is survived by his daughters Mukta and Yashoda and their families. In 2017, Dr. Awachat was honoured with the prestigious Maharashtra Foundation (America) award, which is instituted by members of the Maharashtrian community residing in the U.S. and given to prominent individuals who have brought significant change in the fields of social service and literature through their work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/writer-activist-anil-awachat-passes-away/article64991795.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 05:52 IST,||HC asks Maharashtra govt. if tribals can be given jobs under MNREGA||The Bombay High Court on Thursday sought to know from the Maharashtra government if the tribal population in the State can be provided employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Act (MNREGA). A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Karnik was hearing a bunch of public interest litigations filed in 2007 highlighting high numbers of deaths among children, pregnant women and lactating mothers due to malnutrition in Melghat region of the State. Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, appearing for the State, on Thursday informed the court that while the government welfare schemes were available to the tribal population in Melghat region, the same was not available when they migrate to other regions after the monsoon season. Migration issue “There is then a disconnect or interruption in these persons getting benefits of the scheme. Our final aim is to ensure that there is no migration. Until then, the government's endeavour would be to provide the benefits even in those areas where these persons migrate to,” Mr. Kumbhakoni said. To this, the bench said if the tribal population is provided employment at their own villages, then they would not find the need to migrate. “Can they be given jobs under the MNREGA scheme? If you (government) want to prevent migration, then you have to find out sources of employment. That should be a part of your plan,” Chief Justice Datta said. The court then posted the matter for further hearing on February 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-asks-maharashtra-govt-if-tribals-can-be-given-jobs-under-mnrega/article38337181.ece
28 January 2022||January 28 2022 05:53 IST,||Technocrat pens novel on immigrant workers in UAE||An Assamese technocrat based in Oman capital Muscat has penned a novel on the plight of unskilled and semi-skilled workers in the United Arab Emirates. But while telling the story of a Bangladeshi, Filipino and Sri Lankan who happen to take the same flight to an UAE city, Jayanta Gopal Borpujari said there are many employers who treat immigrant workers fairly.  His debut novel, Beyond the Blinding Sun , has earned appreciation from critics as a fast-paced, action-packed thriller that gives voice to thousands of migrant workers who seek a better life in a foreign land.   “This is purely a work of fiction although the characters may seem real. Like every country offering jobs for expatriates, the UAE has its bright and not-so-bright sides, and what immigrant workers go through could be in any part of the globe short of local hands,” he told The Hindu from Muscat.  Mr. Borpujari’s debut novel tracks the West Asian dream of Bangladeshi carpenter Dilip Bhowmik, Filipino sales promoter Christina Anne Ruan trying to shake off her marriage to an abusive drug addict, and Sri Lankan Chandrika Gunashekara, a farmer’s daughter. Bhowmik gets placed at the farmhouse of an Emirati, Chandrika becomes a domestic help of a Gujarati trader with a domineering wife and Christina becomes the nanny to the children of an expatriate Jordanian doctor instead of what she was supposed to do – be the salesperson at his wife’s boutique. The friendship the trio strikes on the flight brings them together in their desperation to break free from a constricted atmosphere. A friendly policeman and a few locals including criminals help them dodge detention centres and escape through treacherous valleys, labyrinthine ghettos, seemingly impregnable police checkpoints and an unforgiving mountain range. ‘It took a year to write’ “I took a year to write the book and waited another year for a publisher,” Mr Borpujari, an electronics engineer from BITS Pilani and an MBA from Edinburgh Business School said. He is planning a sequel, to be written while handling business development for a leading business group in Oman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/technocrat-pens-novel-on-immigrant-workers-in-uae/article64991797.ece

He becomes the sixth sitting BJP MLA and the third Cabinet Minister in the Pramod Sawant-led government to quit ahead of the election. An incumbent fourth-term legislator from the Velim Assembly constituency in South Goa, Mr. Rodrigues, had been dropped by the BJP in favour of journalist Savio Rodrigues, who is the founder of an online media portal ‘Goa Chronicle.’ A disgruntled Mr. Nery, whose resignation was a foregone conclusion, had been contemplating the move for some time now. He is expected to join the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is contesting the Goa election in alliance with the Shiv Sena. He was one of the 10 Congress MLAs who had defected to the BJP in July 2019 and had held the Velim seat for the Congress since 1999. Mr. Nery, who was due to resign last week itself after being denied the Velim ticket in the first list of 34 candidates announced by the BJP, had deferred his decision at the last minute. At the time of the BJP’s first list, Mr. Nery’s colleague in the Cabinet — Goa Public Works Department Minister Deepak Pauskar — had exited the party after being dropped for the Sanvordem constituency. The BJP had fielded ex-MLA Ganesh Gaonkar in lieu of Mr. Pauskar. Last week, another BJP MLA Wilfred D’sa — the sitting legislator of Nuvem constituency — had bid adieu to the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ahead-of-polls-another-goa-minister-quits-bjp/article38337032.ece

The Chief Minister filed his nomination from Sanquelim, which he won in 2012 and 2017. “This time, too, I am confident of winning,” said Mr. Sawant who was accompanied by the party’s Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis. Elections to the 40 seats in Goa will be held on February 14. The Congress, on the other hand, lashed out at Mr. Sawant, with Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) chief Girish Chodankar alleging that serial FIRs had been filed against Dharmesh Saglani, the Congress’ candidate from Sanquelim who is facing-off Mr. Sawant. He alleged that Mr. Sawant was misusing his post to stifle the Congress candidate. With January 28 being the last date for filing nominations, most of the candidates made a beeline today to file their papers. Among those who filed nominations included Utpal Parrikar, son of late Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-will-return-to-power-with-absolute-majority/article64991796.ece
