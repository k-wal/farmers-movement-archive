This is the only manner in which merit can be a democratising force that equalises inherited disadvantages and privileges. Otherwise claims of individual merit are nothing but tools of obscuring inheritances that underlie achievements,” a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and A.S. Bopanna observed in a 106-page judgment. The court said an open competitive exam only ensures formal equality and does not end widespread ingrained inequalities in the availability of, and access to, educational facilities to certain classes of people, including the OBC. Multiple privileges The privileges that accrue to forward classes are not limited to having access to quality schooling and access to tutorials and coaching centres to prepare for a competitive examination but also includes their social networks and cultural capital (communication skills, accent, books or academic accomplishments) that they inherit from their family, Justice Chandrachud said. The cultural capital ensures that a child from the forward classes is trained unconsciously by the familial environment to take up higher education or high posts commensurate with their family‘s standing. This works to the disadvantage of individuals from social backward classes who are first-generation learners and come from communities whose traditional occupations do not result in the transmission of necessary skills required to perform well in open examination. Thus, merit is not solely of one’s own making. “The rhetoric surrounding merit obscures the way in which family, schooling, fortune and a gift of talents that the society currently values aids in one’s advancement. Thus, the exclusionary standard of merit serves to denigrate the dignity of those who face barriers in their advancement which are not of their own making,” Justice Chandrachud explained. ‘Not the best gauge’ The court said the “idea of merit” based on scores in an exam requires “deeper scrutiny”. “While examinations are a necessary and convenient method of distributing educational opportunities, marks may not always be the best gauge of individual merit. If a high-scoring candidate does not use their talent to perform good actions, it would be difficult to call them meritorious merely because they scored high marks,” Justice Chandrachud reasoned. The fortitude and resilience required to uplift oneself from conditions of deprivation are equally reflective of individual calibre and merit, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-upholds-obc-quota-in-neet/article64947595.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:27 IST,||Traders say they will keep their shops open during weekend||A newly formed Canara Udyamigala Okkuta, which is a united forum of traders and entrepreneurs in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, on Thursday threatened non-cooperation during the weekend curfew, terming it as unscientific. Addressing presspersons in Udupi on Thursday, okkuta honorary president M.G. Hegde and okkuta president Santosh Kamath said that the traders and entrepreneurs will keep their establishments open on January 22 and January 23, even if there is a curfew order in place. This decision, they said, was taken at a meeting of representatives of 30 organisations under the okkuta in Udupi on Thursday. The okkuta will also oppose night curfew, they added. They said that the okkuta felt that the decision to impose night curfew and weekend curfew was not appropriate. It has not helped in reducing COVID-19 cases. The okkuta questioned the Government allowing political and religious programmes with mass gatherings on week days. If the Government or the experts feel that such programmes are not contributing for the spread of COVID-19, then how will retail trading result in continuing the chain of infection, they asked. They said that CIBIL (Credit Information Bureau India Ltd.) scores of many traders and entrepreneurs who have availed themselves of bank loans have gone down due to irregular payment of EMIs. This came about due to weekend curfew and lockdown, as traders and entrepreneurs have suffered loses. They said that banks have now blacklisted names of such persons who have had a good track record of repaying loans during the pre-COVID-19 period as they have now been rendered unable to make regular payments due to the pandemic. Banks should remove names of such persons from their blacklist and enable traders and entrepreneurs to take new loans. They said that all business establishments will be opened on Saturdays and Sundays also to protest against the Government’s decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/traders-say-they-will-keep-their-shops-open-during-weekend/article64947723.ece

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will take up the project and complete it in two years, a communique from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO), quoting Mr. Gadkari as saying, said on Thursday. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has assured the NHAI of full cooperation and speedy approvals for implementing the project, it said. When upgraded, the entire stretch of the National Highway 75, between Bengaluru and Mangaluru, will become a four-lane road. The four-laning of the highway, on the ghat stretch from Marana Halli to Adda Hole, will accelerate the economic growth of the region, the CMO said. Shiradi Ghat is a vital link between the coastal region and the hinterland. “The Shiradi Ghat stretch needs immediate upgradation. The road usually is in pitiable condition during the monsoon season and unmotorable. Hence, the Union Government has cleared the proposal to upgrade it into a four-lane highway,” the communique said. At the same time, Mr. Gadkari has instructed the NHAI to study the proposal to build a six-lane tunnel through the Shiradi Ghat, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-approves-rs-1200-cr-project-to-widen-shiradi-ghat-stretch/article64947725.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:38 IST,||Govt. steers clear of harsh lockdown||The State government has allowed only essential services the next two Sundays (January 23 and 30) to slow down the worrying momentum of the suspected Omicron-driven third wave of COVID-19 infections. An online pandemic review meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday steered clear, at least for now, from imposing night curfew, restricting business hours and inflicting harsh lockdowns. Mr. Vijayan attended the remotely from the U.S., where he had gone for treatment last week. The meeting mandated that district administrations use hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions as the point of reference or baseline for easing or tightening curbs on life and trade in their respective areas of jurisdiction. Category A A maximum of 50 persons can attend marriages, funerals, social, political and cultural events in A-category districts. The classification (Threshold 1) applied to districts that report a 50% increase in ICU admissions from COVID-19. The government has currently bracketed Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Kollam districts in Category A. Category B The restrictions are more severe in B-category districts. A doubling of COVID-19-related ICU admissions would push a district into Category-B (Threshold-2). The classification would also apply to districts where COVID-19 contributes to 10% or more of the total hospitalisations. In such an eventuality, the district administration would ban gatherings and meetings. It would allow only a maximum of 20 persons to attend marriages and funerals. Currently, Idukki, Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, and Wayanad fall under the B category. Category C The restrictions imposed on Category C (Threshold-3) districts portend a return to COVID-19 lockdown life. The highly restrictive classification will kick in if the number of COVID-19 admissions in a district exceeds 25% of the total hospitalisation in the region. The government has proposed a total ban on social, religious and cultural events in Category C localities. To prevent an accelerated pandemic spread, the administration should shut down cinema halls, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and sporting facilities. It should allow only online prayer and worship. Only a maximum of 20 persons could attend marriages or funerals. The government should only allow in-person classes for final year degree and postgraduate students. In schools in the Category C district, the administration should allow only 10th and 12th standard students to attend regular classes. Teachers and students should switch to online learning, including those attending tuition centres. Residential schools could conduct classes in a bio-secure environment. At present, no district falls in Category C. Work from home The government has mandated work from home for mothers with children less than two, cancer patients and others suffering from severe illnesses. The rule applied to the public and private sectors. Restaurants should not seat more than 50% of the maximum capacity. However, the government has not restricted families from dining together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-steers-clear-of-harsh-lockdown-night-curfew/article64947674.ece

The party has denied Utpal Parrikar, son of the late Mahohar Parrikar, former Chief Minister, ticket from Panaji, deciding instead to stick with incumbent MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate. Barring a gap of two years, the seat had been held by Manohar Parrikar from 1994 till his untimely demise in March 2019. “We have given Utpal two other options to contest, one of which he has already refused earlier. All of us feel that he should accept the second one,” BJP’s Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis said in Delhi. He said that the BJP “has always respected Manohar Parrikar’s family”. Party prefers Monserrate Mr. Utpal has been particularly piqued that the party leadership preferred Mr. Monserrate — a three-time MLA and former Minister. Mr. Monserrate, an ex-Congressman, was one of the key players who had engineered the defection of 10 Congress MLAs into the BJP in July 2019. The BJP is contesting all 40 seats for the first time in the coastal State. The list was decided on after hectic deliberations that dragged through Wednesday and extended into the night. Spouses get tickets Spouses of BJP leaders have also been given tickets, notably in the case of Mr. Monserrate and Health Minister Viswajit Rane, who will be contesting from Valpoi — the bastion of the Rane clan. Mr. Rane’s wife, Divya Rane, has been given ticket from Poriem, which is currently held by her father-in-law and stalwart Congressman, Pratapsingh Rane. Mr. Monserrate’s wife, Jennifer Monserrate, has been given ticket from Taleigao, where she is MLA now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/parrikars-son-not-in-bjps-goa-list/article64947594.ece

Panneerselvam’s associates in illegal mining of gravel sand worth over Rs. 500 crore. Justice V. Bharathidasan issued the direction after C. Jeyapriya, Inspector of Police, Vigilance and Anti-Corruption, Theni detachment, informed the court that her request was pending with the Industries Secretary. She also said that the Theni Collector had already granted approval to prosecute the revenue officials. The submissions were made during the hearing of a petition filed by P. Gnanarajan of Upparpatti in Theni district. The litigant had sought a direction to the DVAC to register a First Information Report (FIR) against Mr. Panneerselvam for having reportedly mined gravel sand from government lands through his associates and family members. The petitioner also alleged that huge tracts of government lands were converted into private properties after completing the mining operations. He claimed to have been complaining about the illegality in Vadaveeranaickanpatti village ever since the AIADMK was in power but no action was taken by the Police Department. The petitioner alleged that the illegalities were committed through Mr. Panneerselvam’s family members and his associate V. Annaprakasam. Detailed complaint A detailed complaint running to 14 pages along with 217 pages of supporting documents were submitted to the police and yet there was hardly any action taken against the violators, he complained. On the other hand, the Vigilance and Anti Corruption officials informed the court that officers in the Revenue as well as the Mines departments were involved in the matter and hence they had to obtain prior approval from the higher officials concerned as mandated under Section 17A-(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act of 1988. After recording the submission, the judge adjourned the matter to February 4 for passing further orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/take-a-call-by-feb-3-in-illegal-mining-case/article64947650.ece

Anbalagan and his family members amassed wealth to the tune of Rs. 11.32 crore disproportionate to the known sources of their income between May 2016 and March 2021, sleuths of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) on Thursday conducted searches on multiple premises belonging to them. The agency claimed it had detected unaccounted-for cash of Rs. 2.82 crore, valuables and other incriminating documents. The searches followed an FIR registered by the DVAC against Mr. Anbalagan, his wife A. Malliga, 55, sons A. Sasimohan, 29, A. Chandra Mohan, 32, and Chandra Mohan’s wife S. Vaishnavee, 32. While the AIADMK leader was booked under various Sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, his family members were booked on charges of aiding and abetting in the corruption of his public office. According to the FIR, there was intentional, illicit personal enrichment, acquisition of properties and pecuniary resources in his name and in the names of relatives during the period overlapping with his ministerial tenure. The DVAC had arrived at the quantum of disproportionate acquisition of assets based on the affidavits filed by Mr. Anbalagan in the run-up to the 2016 and 2021 Assembly elections, and also based on “information received from credible sources”. His affidavit in 2016 reported a consolidated asset ownership of Rs. 1.60 crore. In April 2021, his affidavit reported a manifold jump in asset ownership to Rs. 23.03 crore. The DVAC, with the declared information, computed the quantum of acquisitions vis-à-vis known sources of income, savings, and expenditure, and “likely savings” during the ‘check period’ of its enquiry, namely April 2016 to March 2021, and arrived at a disproportionate asset acquisition of over Rs. 11.32 crore by Mr. Anbalagan. Undisclosed properties This aside, the DVAC’s enquiry revealed Mr. Anbalagan’s other undisclosed properties/businesses run under various names. These include various stone quarries in Dharmapuri in the names of his son-in-law, a brother-in-law, and a close associate; and a granite firm by name M/s Ganesh Granite, located at Avvai Shanmugam Road, Gopalapuram, Chennai incorporated under the name of his niece and her husband(sister’s daughter Deepa and son-in-law N.Sivakumar). Sivakumar is also 80% holding partner in another granite firm in Karimnagar district of Telangana. In a separate statement, the DVAC cited a petition filed by a N. Krishnamoorthy before the Madras High Court seeing a direction to the anti-corruption agency to investigate his earlier petition to the DVAC alleging amassment of wealth by Mr. Anbalagan. Simultaneously, the DVAC was conducting its own enquiry and based on the information collected, a case was registered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dvac-books-anbalagan-seizes-rs-282-cr/article64947651.ece

The Kolkata Steel Literary Meet, which is held at Victoria Memorial, has also been postponed. Jayanta Chowdhury, curator of Victoria Memorial Hall, said since monuments and gardens are closed, the literary meet can be held only in March. The organisers of the Apeejay Kolkata Literary Festival have opted to go virtual too. Priti Paul, director, Apeejay Surrendra Group and Oxford Bookstores, said, “The space occupied by literature and books, whether on the ground or in the virtual world, will flourish. It is in this spirit that we present the 13th — and our very first virtual edition — of the Apeejay Kolkata Literary Festival, which will celebrate and usher in the centenary year of the much-loved Heritage Oxford Bookstore.” Artisan melas put off  The local artisan melas held in the district have also been suspended or put off. Ananya Bhattacharya, director, Banglanatakdot.com , a social enterprise working for sustainable development through revival of heritage, said various fairs and festivals are being postponed to March. “This is the second consecutive year when artists have been unable to organise festivals in different parts of Bengal,” she said.  Meanwhile, the State reported 37 COVID-19 deaths and 10,959 new cases over the past 24 hours. The active cases now stand at 1,44,809.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-surge-fairs-festivals-go-virtual-in-bengal/article38300985.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 04:40 IST,||Experts: more human deaths likely in encounters with elephants in Odisha||Human-elephant encounters are likely to result in more human deaths with jumbos increasingly entering villages in search of food, warn wildlife experts. Experts on Thursday expressed concerns about the situation in Odisha, where 750 human casualties have been recorded in such encounters over the past eight years. “In the last six weeks, human-elephant conflict has been raging in all elephant-bearing districts with more elephants entering villages in search of food. We could probably see more human casualties in 2021-22 than in 2020-21, when 106 human deaths and 119 injuries were recorded,” said Biswajit Mohanty, secretary, Wildlife Society of Odisha (WSO). He said the highest human casualties were recorded in 2019-20, when 115 persons had died as marauding elephants killed them. The figures reveal a spike in conflict in the last three years. According to statistics put out by WSO, of the 97 human deaths so far this year, Sundargarh district has recorded the most deaths (21), followed by Keonjhar (12). “Due to uncontrolled mining activity, stressed elephants are angry and enter villages in search of food, killing locals in the process. Every mining proposal in dense forests that house elephant habitats and feeding grounds, has been cleared by the forest department,” Mr. Mohanty said. “Dhenkanal, which has a high number of black-stone and laterite stone quarries, recorded 11 human deaths followed by Angul (10), where coal mining expansion in elephant forests and large steel industries has led to a jump in attacks,” he said. ‘Highest toll in country’ Ranjit Patnaik, a wildlife researcher, said, “In the last three years, we have witnessed approximately one human-elephant encounter every two days and a human casualty every three days. Such a high number of human casualties, at such a frequency, had never been recorded in the past. It’s probably one of the highest in the country.” The WSO said in most cases, nearly 60% of the time, the encounters are with tuskers. “There are particular tuskers who are aggressive and make many kills. It is possible to prevent those confrontations if these tuskers are identified and continuously tracked by expert trackers,” Mr. Mohanty said. Experts, however, alleged that tracking was not being done as most trackers were actually deployed on other duties. It has been found that nearly 25% of human casualties happened when the walls of huts they were living in were toppled by elephants to raid paddy and liquor. “A massive door-to-door campaign needs to be launched by the forest department to make people aware about the dangers of storing foodgrains and liquor in bedrooms,” the experts suggested. “While the human casualties have been very high, the elephant deaths since 2014-15 have been equally high. As many as 611 elephants have died during the period April 2014 to January 18,” the WSO said, adding that 191 jumbos died unnatural deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/experts-more-human-deaths-likely-in-encounters-with-elephants-in-odisha/article64947878.ece

Four companies have won the bids in the 11th round of tendering of geographical areas (GAs) (it can be a part of a district or whole districts) by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) for covering these districts. With this, all districts in the State have been covered under City Gas Distribution Networks (CDGN). Indian Oil Corporation will cover nine districts through the recently acquired GAs. These include Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Kanniyakumari, Madurai, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Theni, Virudhunagar and Tenkasi. In this latest bidding, the company bagged nine out of 15 high-potential GAs, a press release said. IOCL Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said the company’s concerted efforts to expand the gas business reflected its commitment to realise the Centre’s vision of raising the share of natural gas to 15%. Mr. Vaidya added that in the latest bidding for CGD, they were able to secure nine high market potential GAs, which cover 26 districts across the country. “And with this, Indian Oil is poised to emerge a dominant player in the Indian CGD Market.” According to sources, other companies that won the bids include Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL), Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Ltd. (MEIL), and IRM Energy. A release from MEIL, a multi-sector global engineering major, said by winning the bids for 15 geographical areas, MEIL has bagged almost 24.6% of the total GAs that went under the hammer. MEIL was previously awarded 3 GAs under 10th bidding of the CGD, where 32 CNG stations are now operational under the brand name of Megha Gas. BPCL has been awarded two districts, Erode and the Nilgiris, and the fourth contestant, IRM Energy got Namakkal and Tiruchi. The remaining 11 districts, including Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Ramanathapuram, Namakkal, Coimbatore and Salem have been covered by companies, including IOCL, Torrent and AG&P. The State, which perhaps was the last to join the CNG bandwagon in the country, currently has over 50 CNG outlets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/more-districts-in-tamil-nadu-to-get-city-gas-distribution-networks-soon/article64947649.ece

According to sources, Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant took strong exception to the way the inspector of R.T. Nagar and his junior handled the case. He suspended them before initiating an inquiry against the duo while directing the CCB to conduct a detailed investigation into the case. “There are a lot of loopholes in the investigation by Inspector Ashwath Gowda to dilute the case. Though the seized amount of the drug was of commercial quantity, the investigating officer booked the two constables under ‘consumer’ to help them get out on bail. Moreover, the accused investigating officer Veerabhadra Swamy and Ashwath Gowda did not seek custody of the accused for questioning though it was an important case and needed in-depth investigation to ascertain their criminal background,” a senior police officer said. The accused, Head Constable Shivakumar and Constable Santosh, were absent from duty for a long time. But, their seniors did not notice their absence, which amounts to a serious lapse. This is one of the reasons why the DCP (VVIP security), in charge of security at the CM’s personal residence at R.T. Nagar, has been issued a show-cause notice, sources said. Even the South Division DCP has also been issued a show-cause notice for failing to check the background of the (arrested) policemen before deploying them in the security team of the CM. The CCB is probing the criminal links of the accused constables and negligence on the part of their seniors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ccb-to-probe-drug-case-involving-constables/article38300788.ece

Mr. Modi was virtually addressing the launch of the Brahma Kumaris’ year-long programme of events as part of the government’s celebration of 75 years of Independence, Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav . He said it should be acknowledged that the evil of ignoring duties had become a part of the national life.  “In the last 75 years, we only kept talking about rights, fighting for rights and wasting time. The talk of rights for some time, may be right, but forgetting one’s duties completely has played a huge role in keeping India weak,” he said. Addressing the gathering, Mr. Modi called for preserving Indian culture, civilisation, values and promoting spirituality and diversity, while continuously modernising technology, infrastructure, education and health.  He said the coming 25 years, which will end with the celebration of 100 years of Independence in 2047, was not a time for dreaming but for fulfilling resolutions. “The coming 25 years are the period of utmost hard work, sacrifice, and tapasya . This is a period of 25 years to get back what our society has lost in hundreds of years of slavery,” he said.  ‘Walk on path of duty’ Mr. Modi called on everyone to walk “on the path of duty”, which he said would lead the country reach new heights. Mr. Modi also called on organisations like the Brahma Kumaris that have international presence to encourage people to visit the country. He said there had been a tendency to tarnish India’s image on the international stage but if people visited the country they would get to know it. He asked the Brahma Kumaris to send 500 people each from the locations of their international centres to India every year.  “We cannot get away from this [tendency to tarnish India’s image] by saying this is just politics. This is not politics, this is the question of our country. Today, when we are celebrating the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav , it is also our responsibility that the world should know India properly,” the Prime Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/focus-on-rights-for-75-years-has-kept-india-weak-says-pm/article64947593.ece

Adding the cohort of adolescents to the guidelines, the Ministry said that for diagnosing multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), caution should be exercised while interpreting an isolated increase in COVID-19 antibodies. “If steroids are used, they should be tapered over 10-14 days, subject to clinical improvement,” it said, also revising the use of anticoagulants and adding a new section on post-COVID-19 care. The guidelines have noted that anticoagulants are not indicated routinely and that all hospitalised children should be evaluated for risk of developing thrombosis and monitored for development of thrombosis. Post-COVID care On post-COVID-19 care, the seven-page document says children with asymptomatic infection or mild disease should receive routine childcare, appropriate vaccination (if eligible), and nutrition counselling and psychological support on follow up. In addition, for children with moderate to severe COVID-19, upon discharge from hospital, parents/caregivers should be counselled on monitoring for persistence/worsening respiratory difficulty, and provided the indications for bringing the child back to the facility. “Children who develop any organ specific dysfunction during hospital stay or subsequently should receive appropriate care,” state the guidelines. Cautioning that self-medication of steroids should be avoided, it says steroids are not indicated and are harmful in asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/revised-covid-norms-for-children/article64947560.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:55 IST,||Fall in deputations to Centre in 2021||Only 10% mid-level IAS officers were posted with the Union government in 2021, a sharp fall from 19% in 2014. The decrease in central deputation of IAS officers becomes even more stark as the total pool of such officers at this level expanded from 621 in 2014 to 1130 in 2021, an increase of around 80%. According to data available with the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), the number of central deputation reserve of IAS officers has gone down from 309 in 2011 to 223. A senior government official said on Thursday that DoPT’s proposal to amend Rule 6 (deputation of cadre officers) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules 1954 was necessitated as the number of officers available under Central Deputation is not sufficient to meet the requirement of Government of India (GoI). The Hindu reported on January 19 that four amendments are proposed that will enable the Union government to seek the services of an Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS) officer posted in a State even without the State government’s consent. The Centre will be able to relieve an officer from their cadre if the State government does not give effect to the Central government’s decision within the specified time.  The official stated that the existing rules did not have specific provisions to cater to situations when services of an All India Service (AIS) officer may be warranted in the Centre to meet specific situations such as a major disaster or national security. “Similarly, services of an AIS officer with a specific domain expertise may be required for any important time-bound flagship programme or project. The extant Cadre Rules do not have specific provisions to cater to such situations, which have now been proposed through these amendments,” the official explained. AIS officers are recruited by the Union Government and their services are placed under various State Cadres, and it is incumbent upon the members of service to serve both under the State and the Centre, said the official. The total strength of any cadre is calculated by including central deputation reserve (CDR), which is around 40% of the sanctioned posts. “However, a trend of decreasing representation of IAS officers up to joint-secretary level has been noticed as most of the States are not meeting their CDR obligations and the number of officers sponsored by the States to serve the Union government are much less than the reserve,” said the official. The CDR utilisation has gone down from 25% in 2011 to 18% presently. “In spite of increase of IAS officers at Deputy Secretary/Director level in IAS from 621 in 2014 to 1130 in 2021, the number of such officers on central deputation has gone down from 117 to 114 during the period,” said the official. The official asserted that the requirement from the States is only to sponsor adequate number of officers to be posted with the Centre. “The actual number of officers to be deputed here is to be decided only in consultation with the State government,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fall-in-deputations-to-centre-in-2021/article38300475.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:56 IST,||Punjab all set to witness a multi-cornered fight||With Punjab all set to witness a multi-cornered electoral battle in the 2022 Assembly elections, the results in many constituencies could see a nail-biting contest as the margin of a win or loss could be narrow. The electoral battle was expected to be a three-cornered fight among the ruling Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). However, the entry of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP)-Punjab Lok Congress-Shiromani Akali Dal (Sankyukt) alliance, besides the debut of farmer unions under the banner of the Samyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) — an amalgamation of 22 Punjab-based farmer outfits that actively participated against the Centre’s controversial farm laws — has left the political battle arena wide open. Triangular fight The 2017 Assembly election largely saw a triangular fight among the Congress, the SAD and the AAP. At that time, 26 of the 117 constituencies saw the winning margins of less than 5,000 votes. In at least 16 constituencies, the margin was less than 3,000 votes. Data from the Institute for Development and Communication (IDC) in Chandigarh showed that the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) played the role of spoiler for key political parties in at least 12 constituencies. The IDC’s analysis showed that the BSP played spoilsport for the Congress in five constituencies, for the SAD in two, for the BJP in one and for the AAP in four Assembly segments. This time, it is contesting in an alliance with the SAD. As more parties are contesting this election, votes are bound to be divided. The AAP has been asking the voters to give it “a chance” against the “traditional” parties. But the SSM, which is not a “traditional” party and is also seeking votes against “traditional” parties such as the Congress, the SAD and the BJP, could split votes. Even AAP’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal has admitted that his party could lose some votes on account of the presence of the SSM. Upsetting Congress The Punjab Lok Congress, led by former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh which is so far not being seen as a serious threat, may nevertheless upset the Congress’ candidates in a few seats. The Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt), breakaway Akali faction led by Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, could affect the SAD’s vote to some extent. “Margins are not very big in the Assembly elections. What we are seeing is a three-cornered fight this time - the Congress, the SAD and the AAP. But the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha could be a “mega spoiler” in many seats,” said Pramod Kumar, director, Institute for Development and Communication.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/punjab-to-witness-multi-cornered-fight/article64947565.ece

Widespread in the coastal mangrove swamps, rivers, and estuaries of Odisha and West Bengal in the early 1900s, unsustainable harvesting had resulted in sharp decline in the population.   In 2008, a joint exploration of the mangroves and tidal creeks by the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) and Sundarban Tiger Reserve (STR) located a cohort of eight males, three females and one juvenile at in a pond at the Sajnekhali Interpretation Center. Since then, the conservation breeding of the species, categorised as critically endangered by IUCN Red List, has been a success with around 12 adults and close to 370 juveniles of the species having been bred in captivity so far. Marking a milestone in the conservation efforts, on January 19, ten sub-adult Batagur baska, reared for over nine years, were reintroduced in the wild by the experts of TSA and STR officials. “These animals were tagged with GPS transmitters the battery of which can last 18 months. These transmitters will help to understand survival and dispersal patterns of the turtles and adjust future large scale release programs,” Director of TSA India Shailendra Singh said.  Sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world and the release of the turtles is an attempt to understand the habitat and behaviour of these freshwater turtles whose population in the wild are difficult to track.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rare-turtles-reintroduced-in-the-wild/article64947694.ece

In a bid to woo the Dalits and the OBCs, Mr. Yadav also spoke out against outsourcing of government jobs and privatisation, saying these were being used to finish off reservations.The promise to restore the pension system to the pre-2005 era system would be included in the SP’s official manifesto.

Snatching rights He also said he was considering steps to do away with outsourcing of jobs. He said outsourcing was being used to “snatch” the rights and honour given through the Constitution provided by B. R Ambedkar. “Outsource is not a good practice. There is nothing other than exploitation in it,” said Mr. Yadav, stating that outsourcing and privitisation were means of finishing off reservations.“The BJP does not want to give the deprived and poor their rights,” he said at a press conference.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:56 IST,||Environment Ministry plan to rank States draws ire||A proposal by the Union Environment Ministry to “rank” and “incentivise” States on how quickly they could give environmental clearances to proposed infrastructure projects has drawn fire from environmentalists on the grounds that it contravenes basic principles of environmental regulation. A note to States by the Union Environment Ministry on January 17 spells out seven criteria to rate State Environmental Impact Assessment Agencies (SEIAA) on “transparency, efficiency and accountability”. On a scale of seven, a SEIAA, for instance, gets two marks for granting a clearance in less than 80 days, one mark for within 105 days and no marks for more. If less than 10% of the projects for scrutiny prompted a site visit by committee members, to examine ground conditions, a SEIAA would get one mark. More than 20%, on the other hand, would be a demerit or zero marks. SEIAA with a score of seven or more would be rated ‘five star.’ ‘Violative proposal’ The Legal Initiative for Forest on Environment (LIFE), a prominent environment organisation, described the proposal as “violative” of the Environment (Protection) Act. “A perusal of the criteria reveals that greater weightage is given for projects where due diligence is less....SEIAA members should sit in the confines of conference rooms and take decisions and earn high marks.... The process ensures that the aim will be to clear projects at the shortest possible time. The task of the SEIAA is undertake a ‘detailed scrutiny’ whereas this notification makes them rubber stamp authorities,” a statement noted.  Ministry officials told The Hindu that the ranking criteria was not intended to accelerate the speed with which clearances were accorded but to encourage the SEIAA to take quicker decisions on approving or rejecting a project, and adhere to timelines already specified by the provisions of the Act. “This system isn’t to reduce the time taken to decide on a project. If a SEIAA demands clarification, the time taken to respond won’t be deducted,” Leena Nandan, Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests, told The Hindu , “But SEIAA have been told earlier too that whatever clarifications they need must be compiled rather than repeatedly demanding them.”   Sujit Bajpayee, Joint Secretary, Environment Ministry, wrote in responses to The Hindu ’s queries that the SEIAA “had complete freedom” to complete all the necessary due diligence “without worrying about the time line” and that States would not be negatively marked for not meeting ranking criteria.  All proposed infrastructure projects above a certain size with a potential to significantly alter the natural environment must be first approved by an SEIAA, that consists of State officers and independent experts. Projects that are even bigger or involve forest land — called category A —– must be cleared by a committee of experts constituted by the Centre. SEIAA projects are category B and relatively smaller though they make up the bulk of projects that are presented for approval. ‘B’ category projects include the bulk of building and construction, small mining, and small industry projects and are considered to be ‘less polluting.’ Online process The project appraisal process is an online process where aspirant companies must upload documents on a portal called Parivesh. Kanchi Kohli, an expert on environment law and governance matters noted that the rating system “seriously limited SEIAA members from exercising their scientific, legal and administrative knowledge.” By stressing “quick and efficient clearance” the process undermined scientific rigour in the decision making process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/environment-ministry-plan-to-rank-states-draws-ire/article64947561.ece

The Congress leader, who heads the Parliamentary Standing Committee panel on Home Affairs, has asked Mr. Shah to advise the Union Home Secretary about sensitising the State governments and suggested legislative changes to the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to more effectively deal with such speeches.  Mr. Sharma’s letter, dated January 19, comes exactly a month after a dharam sansad [religious congregation] was held in Haridwar in poll-bound Uttarakhand in which the Muslim community was targeted by several speakers including controversial organiser Yati Narsinghanand, who has recently been arrested by the local police.   A similar dharam sansad was also held in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh earlier this month during which one of the speakers made derogatory references to Mahatma Gandhi.  “The actions of certain organisations and individuals in different parts of the country aimed at minorities and women are a matter of serious concern. The exhortations made inflame passions and create an environment of insecurity and distrust,” Mr. Sharma said. The Congress leader said the hate speeches are being used as a “tool” to promote enmity and disharmony on the ground of religion, caste, ethnicity etc and, if left unchecked, it will “severely undermine the rule of law and threaten the fundamental right to life, liberty and dignity”. Mr. Sharma said the recent incidents and “orchestrated acts of violence” not only made it to national and global media but also tarnished the image of the world’s largest democracy. “Free speech, though quintessence of democracy and enshrined in the Constitution, cannot be allowed to be misused to advocate, incite, promote or justify hatred and violence against a person or community...It is requested that Home Secretary be advised to sensitise the Chief Secretaries and the DGPs to take prompt and firm action to enforce the law and secure order,” he wrote. “Further, the government may consider legislative action including amendments in the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure to effectively counter all manifestations of hate speech in the larger national interest,” Mr. Sharma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-urges-shah-to-act-on-hate-speech/article64947578.ece

Speaking to reporters in the poll-bound State, Mr. Banerjee accused the Congress of creating “a misleading narrative” that the Trinamool was trying to weaken it.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:55 IST,||SC upholds OBC quota in NEET admissions||The apex court held it was the Centre’s prerogative to provide reservation in All India Quota (AIQ) seats. Granting reservation in the AIQ seats was a policy decision of the government, though subject to the contours of judicial review. similar to every reservation policy; . Justice Chandrachud said the power of the government to provide reservations under Article 15 (4) and (5) of the Constitution is not an “exception” to Article 15 (1), which enshrines the mandate that “the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them”. The court held that the power of the government to craft reservation for the OBC amplified the principle of “substantive equality” manifested through Article 15 (1). Parliament support The Parliament had backed the cause by enacting the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act 2006 to enable 15% reservation for Scheduled Castes, 7.5% for the Scheduled Tribes, and 27% for the OBC category. The Constitution Bench in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India had also upheld the constitutional validity of 27% reservation for the OBC category provided under the 2006 Act. “Though the Act of 2006 would not be applicable to the seats earmarked for AIQ in State-run institutions since it would not fall within the definition of a Central educational institution under the Act, the Union, in view of Article 15(5), has the power to provide reservations for OBCs in the AIQ seats. It is not tenable for the States to provide reservation in the AIQ seats since these seats have been ‘surrendered‘ to the Centre,” Justice Chandrachud noted. The judgment was based on petitions filed by doctors in August 2021 against a July 29, 2021, notification issued by the Directorate General of Health Services of the Ministry of Health implementing 27% and 10% reservation for OBC and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), respectively, while filling up 15% undergraduate and 50% postgraduate AIQ seats under NEET.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-upholds-obc-quota-in-neet-admissions/article38300675.ece

On Ms. Divya Rane being given ticket, he observed that he had requested Mr. Pratapsingh Rane to either join the BJP and contest from Poriem or give the ticket to the saffron party as the Congress’s fortunes were allegedly on the wane. “At the time, Pratapsingh Rane, owing to his age, had expressed his reluctance to contest from Poriem and said that Divya Rane would contest in his stead,” Mr. Fadnavis noted. He denied that there was an ‘understanding’ between the Congress and the BJP over the Poriem seat. While the Congress would definitely field a candidate from there, the BJP would defeat him, he said. Last month, the Congress announced the candidature of Mr. Pratapsingh Rane (82), a 11-time MLA who has been the State’s longest serving Chief Minister after his son, Viswajit Rane, had said he would contest against his father and defeat him by a wide margin. However, after the party approved of his candidature on December 22, the senior Rane denied that the Congress’s poll panel had finalised his nomination. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant will be contesting from his turf, Sanquelim, seeking re-election for the third time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parrikars-son-not-in-bjps-goa-candidates-list/article38300673.ece

Mr. Ahmed, who is also the grandnephew of independent India’s first Education Minister Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, said the draft should be drawn in keeping with the constitutional rights and international conventions to secure gender justice, equality and dignity of women. UCC calls for formulation of one law to be made applicable to all religious communities in matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and adoption. Article 44 does not mandate but only asks the State to make an endeavour to secure UCC for all citizens. “The PIL has been filed to weed out anomalies in minimum age of marriage, grounds of divorce, maintenance-aliminy, adoption, guardianship, succession, inheritance based patriarchal stereotypes which perpetrate inequality against women and go against global trends,” the petition said. Mr. Bakht quoted Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and said UCC was incorporated into the Constitution as a “desirable” move, but for the moment “voluntary”. “It was incorporated in the Constitution as an aspect that would be fulfilled when the nation would be ready to accept it and the social acceptance to the UCC could be made,” it stated. It, however, argued that UCC wouldn’t vide protection to the vulnerable sections, including women and religious minorities, “while promoting nationalistic fervour through unity”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/urdu-varsity-chancellor-moves-top-court/article64947583.ece

Mr. Kolhe, who is best known for playing the character of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in a Marathi television serial has portrayed Godse in a movie that is set to release on January 30 on an OTT platform. The trailer of the film was released recently. “It is clear that Amol Kolhe has played Nathuram Godse in the movie. Even though he is an actor, the film is nothing but glorification of Godse. One cannot support the murder of Mahatma Gandhi under the garb of being an actor,” said Mr. Awhad. The Minister was in the forefront of Statewide protests against the Marathi plays glorifying Godse a decade ago. Godse’s character was played by senior actors late Vinay Apte, Sharad Ponkshe who had come under severe criticism then. “Maharashtra’s progressive citizens opposed then, and even today I stand with a similar position. I will oppose this anti-Gandhi film,” said Mr. Awhad. Mr. Kolhe, however, claimed that the shooting of the film took place in 2017 when he was neither the member of the NCP nor an elected representative. “I think linking my present political affiliation to my acting choices in 2017 is unjustified. I am an actor and have played the part as required on screen. In reel life, an actor gets to play a character with whom you do not agree but it challenges you. But in real life, I have no love for Godse nor I have hate against Mahatma Gandhi,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ncp-mp-who-played-godse-under-fire/article64947582.ece

Other accused, Neeraj Bishnoi, alleged to be the main conspirator in the case, and Aumkareshwar Thakur, were remanded in police custody till January 27. Mr. Thakur is alleged to be an accused in the Sulli Deals, a similar app that posted pictures of Muslim women. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Magistrate Komalsing Rathod on Thursday rejected the bail applications filed by three students accused in the case — Vishal Jha, 21, Mayank Rawat, 21, and Shweta Singh, 19. The court held that the accused cannot be granted bail due to the seriousness of the offences and the investigation is at a primary stage and there is a possibility of their tampering with evidence. While Mr. Jha is an engineering student from Bengaluru, Mr. Rawat and Ms. Singh are from Uttarakhand. The Mumbai police had opposed their bail pleas on the ground that they had intentionally used Sikh names on their Twitter to create enmity between Sikhs and Muslims.

As a step towards developing the reservoir into a tourism site, the Water Resources Department (WRD) is enhancing biodiversity and adding green cover with participation of the public and various non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Built in 1876, the reservoir, which is nearly 93% full, is one of the city’s five major sources of drinking water. Attractions besides the Jones Tower have been added to the lake. Work is in progress for the documentation of bird species during the season and also to further develop the butterfly park in the lake’s periphery. Nearly 40 birds species, including the paradise flycatcher and orange-headed thrush, have been documented so far. Officials of the WRD said the lake and its periphery now sport a cleaner and greener look owing to the concerted joint efforts of the department, NGOs and residents. Jerold Finny, director, Alpha Matriculation Higher Secondary School, said the school and its alumni had joined hands with the Social Work Team Trust (SWOTT) and various organisations to beautify the lake through several initiatives, including clean-up, plantation and wall painting drives. The butterfly habitat created with nectar yielding plants, such as crepe jasmine and hibiscus, is a visual treat for visitors. The collaborative efforts of the WRD and organisations, including The Trust for Environment Monitoring and Action Initiating, has attracted several butterfly species, including the lemon pansy, the oriental plain tiger and the coromandel glassy tiger, he said. The week-end lake restoration volunteering initiative has been on for 104 weeks now. Members of SWOTT noted that nearly 25% of green cover has been added in the lake’s periphery. Besides the dedicated site at Alamaram, saplings have been planted outside the main bund to enhance greenery. SWOTT’s founder S. Sameer said nearly 20,000 seed balls have been planted so far, and students have started volunteering too. Students from Vivekananda School, Red Hills and DG Vaishnav College recently planted over 200 saplings. “We are also documenting the waterways around the reservoir using drones and even removed 25 tonnes of plastic from the baby canal linked to the reservoir,” he said. The trust has also taken efforts to reduce 60% of the sewage outfalls from areas such as Pammadhukulam, Kavankarai and Padianallur. SWOTT had recently made a representation to the State government to develop the reservoir as a tourism site with facilities, including boating and park, he added. Officials of the WRD noted that a team from the Tourism Department had also visited the reservoir to check the feasibility of developing it as a tourist site. Plans to create Miyawaki forests is also in the pipeline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/work-in-progress-to-turn-red-hills-lake-into-a-tourism-site/article64947917.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 04:06 IST,TAMIL NADU||Routine health services run despite rising COVID-19 cases||Despite the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in the city, routine healthcare services are running full-fledged in most hospitals. However, patient volume for non-COVID services has dropped marginally at a few places. Unlike in the previous waves of COVID-19 when non-COVID healthcare services were either suspended or slowed down, all routine healthcare services are continuing as usual in many hospitals — both in the government and private sector. At Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), all specialities were in full swing and around 100 to 120 surgeries, including electives, were performed a day, according to dean E. Theranirajan. “Prior to the third wave of COVID-19 infections, our outpatient inflow was around 15,000 to 17,000 a day. Now, we see a maximum of 9,000 to 10,000 outpatients a day. We have around 250 admissions a day,” he said. Triaging patients diagnosed with COVID-19 has helped tertiary care centres like the RGGGH to a large extent. “We are admitting 30 to 40 patients with COVID-19 a day, mostly with moderate to severe symptoms. The majority of patients are in home isolation. So, we have been able to reserve resources. As of now, COVID-19 wards are functional on two floors, and we have a separate team of doctors, including postgraduates, contract medical officers and senior professors, for COVID-19 management. With this segregation in place, non-COVID services are going on as usual. The clear-cut guidelines for COVID-19 management have helped in managing both COVID-19 and non-COVID services,” he said. As of now, 170 beds allocated for COVID-19 have been occupied, while there are 3,492 beds for non-COVID patients at the hospital, he added. P. Balaji, dean of the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, said all routine services were running as usual. “All procedures, including cardiac operations such as angioplasty and dialysis, are going on as usual. We have about 200 patients with COVID-19 as of now and are able to manage the situation. Maybe, if the numbers rise to 500 or 600, we may look at the essential services. But we have not gone to that stage. We have asked the heads of departments to decide on managing patients,” he said. He added that precautionary measures were in place. While no COVID-19 testing is done on emergency patients, those scheduled to undergo elective procedures are subjected to RT-PCR testing. The vaccination status of patients is also checked, Dr. Balaji said. At the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, outpatient department services are fully operational. “Priority is given for emergency surgeries. Not all electives have been suspended. Instead of two days a week, we have fixed a day a week for surgical specialities,” dean R. Shanthimalar said. The hospital’s outpatient inflow (non-COVID) is around 2,500 to 2,800, while inpatient numbers are in the range of 350 to 400. “The non-COVID inpatient admissions have reduced to only having sick patients who need proper care. We are insisting on Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) such as masking, physical distancing and hand hygiene,” she said. The situation was similar in private hospitals. Harish Manian, chief executive officer, MGM Healthcare, said there was only a marginal reduction in the number of outpatients at the hospital. The daily number has slightly reduced from around 600-700 to 500 now. “Non-COVID healthcare services are running as usual as we have created a green channel for COVID-19, by having a separate flow for patients with COVID-19. Due to this segregation, all routine services such as OPD, health checks and operation theatres are functioning. Elective surgeries are being performed as well,” he said. “We are yet to see how the peak will be. As there is no shutdown of travel in this wave, people are able to reach hospitals for routine care,” he added. “Since we have seen two COVID-19 waves, we have all infrastructure in place. All our healthcare services are operational. We have a separate area for patients with COVID-19,” said Venkatachalam, director of medical services, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai. “But the volume of patients, both outpatient and inpatient, have come down by 30% as we get patients from other States and many are avoiding travel. Similarly, procedures have reduced by 25%,” he added. Though the infectivity rate is high in the current wave, the severity was less, he said, adding: “We have 10 to 15 admissions of COVID-19 patients a day. Most have co-morbidities,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/routine-health-services-run-despite-rising-covid-19-cases/article64947919.ece

The Tribunal, which had taken suo motu cognisance of a media report about the electrocution incident in the Chungam Forest Division in the Cherambadi forest area at Pandalur in the Nilgiris district, in which a male wild elephant, four wild boars, a common mongoose, a striped necked mongoose, three cobras and a crow were killed, said it held Tangedco responsible for their deaths, applying the principles of “strict liability” and r es ipsa loquitur .  If the amount was not deposited by Tangedco within three months, the PCCF and the CWW were entitled to execute the award by approaching the District Collector to recover the amount under the Revenue Recovery Act, 1890 or under Section 25 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The NGT’s Southern Bench also directed that a joint task force, comprising officials of the Forest, Revenue and Development Departments, the local body and Tangedco, be constituted for conducting periodic inspections to determine whether any further repair or maintenance work was required to avoid such incidents. It also directed the authorities to adopt the guidelines framed by the National Board for Wildlife in July 2019, and set up electricity infrastructure to ensure minimal disturbance to wildlife in protected areas and those bordering the forests. The Tribunal also directed the State government to appoint a permanent advisory committee, comprising the Secretary of Environment and Forests, the PCCF, the CWW and an official from Tangedco, for evaluating the situation from time to time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-told-to-pay-rs-75-lakh-over-electrocution-of-animals/article38300847.ece

The project announced by then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi has been caught in delays for over a decade because of issues relating to land acquisition. With the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) finally handing over land in the final stretch in January 2021, the Southern Railway started construction to link the elevated stretch near the St. Thomas Mount railway station. The project will have a multi-modal transport facility of suburban trains and Metro services. ‘Only hurdle’ B. Guganesan, Chief Public Relations Officer, Southern Railway, said land acquisition was the only major hurdle for the project and the other work, including the building of two stations at Adambakkam and Puzhithivakkam, cabin modification at Velachery station and a majority of track line installation, had all been completed. A 1.5-km stretch between Adambakkam and St. Thomas Mount was the problematic portion. In the stretch, 80% of foundation and 60% of substructure work to construct elevated tracks have been completed. Elevated track construction work will commence shortly after the last two piers are built, he added. The Southern Railway is pinning its hopes on attracting more commuters in the MRTS section with the linking of the Velachery and St. Thomas Mount stations. For the large residential population in and around Adambakkam and Puzhuthivakkam, the MRTS service will be a boon, especially since there was no other dependable public transport in the area. The extension project will cover several residential localities in south Chennai, including Madipakkam, Ullagaram-Puzhithivakkam, west Velachery, Adambakkam, Nanganallur, Vanuvampet and Pazhavanthangal. Even as residents in Velachery welcome the extension of the MRTS, they want some of train services originating from the Velachery railway station.

The 2.3-km structure will permit movement of vehicles between Tambaram and Velachery. Cleaning of the work area is currently in progress. Sources in the Highways Department, which is responsible for constructing the Rs. 133 crore facility, said they had about 10 to 15 days of work remaining. “Vehicles heading towards Velachery is using the service lane right now,” an official added. The other flyover, which is 1.5 km in length and has three lanes, was inaugurated in February 2021. Work on the service lane and stormwater drains for this flyover are underway in portions and will take two months to complete. “Since the flyover is already operational, motorists will not be inconvenienced by the work. The land acquisition took some time since it is a commercial area, and there are hundreds of shops along the road. We also permitted shops to demolish structures on their own so that there would be minimal loss to livelihood, which is also important when it comes to such large projects. At present, compensation is being awarded to those whose properties have been acquired,” an official said. K. Ramaswamy, a resident of Velachery, who welcomed the completion of the flyovers, said directional signage must be installed in the area to make navigation more convenient. He said like the Kathipara grade separator and other flyovers in the city, the space beneath should be made into a garden.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/one-of-the-twin-flyovers-in-medavakkam-nearing-completion/article38300870.ece

Justice R. Mahadevan dismissed a writ petition filed by the surgeon S. Radhakrishnan and refused to interfere with an order passed by the Tamil Nadu Medical Council (TNMC) on May 4, 2021, removing the petitioner’s name from the Medical Register for a period of two years. The judge concurred with the TNMC that the writ petitioner had breached the provisions of the Code of Medical Ethics (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations of 2003 and therefore, the decision arrived at by the council does not call for any interference by the court. He observed that the entire events of the case could be likened to the plot of a crime thriller and it would be naïve on the part of the court to believe the defence taken by the writ petitioner that there was no criminal intent behind the issuance of the medical fitness certificate. It took three years for the realtor’s daughter S. Shri Subitha to obtain the documents from the Sub Registrar’s office to prove the illegality. In 2018, she lodged a complaint with the Medical Council of India which transferred it to the TNMC for inquiry and action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-upholds-punishment-for-surgeon/article38300874.ece

Many dengue cases have also been reported in the city after Pongal because of the rising number of mosquito breeding sources after the rains. Villivakkam resident S. Abhishek said he had tested positive for dengue during Pongal. “Our apartment complex is located near the Padi flyover on M.T.H. Road in Villivakkam. After the recent spell of rains, water stagnated in an open space near our house,” he alleged. “We complained to the Greater Chennai Corporation a few days ago. But the workers did not carry out mosquito control work. Officials came to our area only after a dengue case was reported. But the stagnant water is yet to be cleared,” said Mr. Abhishek. T. Nagar resident V.S. Jayaraman said the mosquitoes were swarming the residential areas as the malaria control workers have stopped regular fogging. Former Chennai Corporation floor leader V. Sukumar Babu said the malaria workers had been reassigned to COVID-19 duty. An official of the Corporation said the civic body had 3,200 malaria workers in the 15 zones. “Out of them, about 200 workers are utilised everyday to put oil balls in canals in order to prevent breeding of mosquitoes.

Palaniswami on Thursday condemned the searches conducted on the premises of former Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan, his relatives, friends and political associates. In a statement, the two leaders equated the day’s developments with similar actions taken against five former Ministers belonging to their party, and contended that the steps taken in the name of “anti-corruption” were all acts of “political vendetta”. Eventually, the authorities had returned “empty-handed”, they said.  According to them, action was taken against Mr. Anbalagan only because the former Minister went to the office of the Dharmapuri Collector a few days ago to express his solidarity with Pappireddipatti MLA A. Govindasamy, who had staged a dharna as the Collector had “refused” to meet him.  Describing their party as a “big banyan tree”, the two AIADMK leaders said the DMK will never be able to “uproot” it. In another statement, Mr. Panneerselvam referred to the issue of non-payment of incentive to a section of doctors who had worked during the second wave of COVID-19. He also adverted to the complaint that even those who had received the incentive were paid only partially and not the entire amount of Rs. 15,000. Similarly, there were reports that some doctors employed on contract had not been paid their salary for the last two months, and proper facilities for their stay were not made available, the AIADMK coordinator said, and sought the intervention of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in this regard. Speaking in Salem, Mr. Palaniswami claimed that corruption to the tune of Rs. 500 crore had taken place in the distribution of the Pongal gift hampers. He said poor quality items were distributed to ration cardholders for Pongal. Mr. Palaniswami accused the DMK government of failing to create public awareness and take precautionary measures to control the spread of COVID-19. To divert people’s attention from these problems, the DVAC was conducting searches at the residences of Mr. Anbalagan and his family members, he alleged.

Coimbatore District Collector G.S. Sameeran said that the percentage of patients under care in hospitals was varying from 9% to 11% in the last few days. The average rate of hospitalisation was around 10 %, he said. In the 10 %, only a few percent of patients were oxygen dependent and others were in hospitals due to comorbidity, he said. There were 15,926 active cases in Coimbatore district as of Thursday. According to Health Department officials, tertiary level hospitals in Coimbatore were witnessing admission of serious cases of COVID-19 namely oxygen dependent patients and those with comorbidities as the State recently updated the protocol for triaging. The triage centres in Coimbatore were carefully examining and sending them to COVID-19 care centres (CCC), home isolation, COVID-19 health centres (CHC) and COVID-19 hospitals based on various parameters. Health officials said that persons with mild symptoms were being advised to remain in home isolation or referred to CCCs in the absence of adequate facilities for home isolation. Those aged above 60, antenatal and postnatal mothers, those with comorbidities and patients requiring oxygen support were being referred to COVID-19 hospitals, they said. The main focus of the updated protocol was to avoid patients who only need home isolation or treatment in primary care facilities getting admitted to COVID-19 designated facilities. The Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) had 184 patients under treatment as of Thursday. There were 39 antenatal mothers.The total number of beds designated for COVID-19 patients at the hospital is 1,750. “Patients with a respiratory rate more than 30 per minute and an oxygen saturation (SpO2) level below 90 are admitted to tertiary level COVID-19 hospitals like CMCH as per the updated protocol. Likewise, various parameters including vaccination status are checked before referring patients to home isolation, CCC, CHC and COVID designated hospitals,” said CMCH Dean A. Nirmala. CMCH is currently triaging patients at its annex facility functioning on the campus of the Government Arts College where 100 beds with oxygen support are also available. According to the Health Department, there were 3,205 O2 beds, 2,387 non-O2 beds and 793 ICU beds in Coimbatore district apart from 3,847 beds in CCCs as of Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-around-10-patients-in-coimbatore-dt-are-in-hospitals/article64947902.ece

Pudur in Coimbatore in which a leopard sought shelter on Monday. The move was to ensure natural ambience and absence of humans on the warehouse premises which could prompt the carnivore to make attempts to get out of the building. The department had already blocked the two doors with cages. The trap system of the cage will operate if the leopard steps inside it.  District Forest Officer T.K. Ashok Kumar told The Hindu that there were only a minimum number of staff at the place from Thursday morning. Public are also not allowed to visit the place.  He said that the staff had blocked the view to one of the cages from outside using a green sheet. As the back door of the building was covered by a wall the cage placed there could not be seen from outside. Live baits kept in both cages were also removed to create a tranquil atmosphere. “We hope that the animal will attempt to come out through any of the doors on Thursday night,” he said. He added that the water dripping system arranged at the cages on Wednesday had in fact attracted the leopard as it attempted to step into one of the cages in the early hours of Thursday. Water can was placed on top of both cages with a hole to drip water into the container kept inside. Forest Veterinary Officer A. Sukumar felt that the leopard will definitely attempt to come out if it feels that there are no humans around. Assistant Conservator of Forests C. Dinesh Kumar said that the leopard was remaining calm inside the building as if it used to frequent it. In normal cases, when a leopard gets trapped in a building, it would become restless and aggressive. It would also attempt to make an escape at the earliest. Shrubs and thickets grown at the backside of the warehouse would have attracted the animal to seek shelter there, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minimal-forest-staff-around-leopards-hideout-to-enable-capture/article64947911.ece

The weavers and garment manufacturers are hit by high prices of yarn and the textile mills say the reason for the yarn rates going up is the high cotton price. The garment units in Tiruppur downed shutters for two days - January 17 and 18 - demanding measures to control cotton and yarn prices. The Chief Minister also wrote to the Union government asking for removal of the 10% import duty on cotton, ban on cotton exports and calibration of cotton yarn exports.  Welcoming this, Raja M. Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters' Association, told The Hindu on Thursday that of the 2,000 exporters in Tiruppur cluster, less than 10% have textile mills (backward integration). The rest buy yarn from different parts of the country.  "Our buyers abroad are not ready for frequent price increases. The garment units usually have just three months stock of yarn, which is to meet the needs of the orders on hand. In the last 15 months, there is a steep hike in cotton and yarn prices," he said. Mr. Shanmugham urged the government to reconsider the permission given for export of cotton and said only excess yarn and fabric should be exported. Further, trading of cotton on commodity exchanges should be monitored, he said. Ravi Sam, chairman of Southern India Mills' Association, said the problem of price increase starts with the basic raw material - cotton. "We are not for ban, suspension or any action on any textile product. We just want the government to monitor cotton trading on the commodity exchanges and measures to ensure that prices are under control. Right now, large-scale traders, who are handling relatively less quantity of cotton, are increasing the prices. This reflects on the overall price of cotton. Indian cotton is ruling at higher price compared to international prices," he said. There is acute shortage of quality cotton and its prices are higher, too. With cotton production during the current season (October 2021 to September 2022) expected to be just about 350 lakh bales, and the domestic industry requirement estimated to be 340 lakh bales, there may be a crisis between July and October as the quality of cotton available now is poor. The association reiterated its demand for immediate withdrawal of the import duty on cotton.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/textile-sector-struggles-to-cope-with-spiralling-raw-material-prices/article38300888.ece

Tomatoes arrive from Talavadi, Dharmapuri and Andhra Pradesh to the Nethaji Daily Vegetable and Fruit Market functioning on the V.O.C. Park Ground premises every day from where retailers and shopkeepers purchase. On an average, over 3,000 boxes, each weighing 15 kg, arrive at the market. During the rainy season in November and December, less than 1,000 boxes arrive, leading to sharp increase in price. In December, 2021, the wholesale price of tomato was Rs. 120 a kg while the retail price even touched Rs. 140 a kg. However, after rain stopped in the first week of January, there is an increase in the arrival of boxes every day to the market. Traders said there was a sharp increase in the arrival, from less than 1,500 boxes in December to 4,200 boxes every day now. “A box now costs Rs. 120,” said G. Ibrahim, a wholesaler. Since the arrival of tomatoes was increasing sharply, the price would be on a downward trend for the next two months, he added. Since tomatoes could not be stored for more than three days, most of the traders sold it for a minimum profit when the arrival was heavy, another trader said. The traders said the arrival of tomatoes usually dropped in May after which price would go up. “In the coming weeks, tomatoes will be available even for Rs. 1 per kg,” they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wholesale-price-of-tomato-drops-to-rs-10-a-kg-in-erode/article64947824.ece

The court took note of the fact that Mr. Chinnappan had Ph.D in Tamilology (Drama). The petitioner contended that the university prescribed one of the qualifications as Ph.D in Education, but Mr. Chinnappan held Ph.D in Tamilology (Drama). Therefore, he was not qualified. However, the Tamil University submitted that it had never published such a notification. As per the prescribed qualification, the Reader could be appointed if the candidate had a good academic record with a doctoral degree or equivalent published work. The court held the appointment of Mr. Chinnappan as valid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-upholds-appointment-made-at-tamil-university/article38301279.ece

The event in the open air classroom of the college was organised in association with Divey Foundation, New Delhi, in an effort to provide exposure to transgenders of higher education institutions.

The heavy rain coupled with the release from the Veedur dam led to a surge in water in the check dam area resulting in the complete break up of the more than a century-old anicut in November, last year. Constructed during the French regime, the anicut used to store water for around six months after every monsoon which helped farmers to irrigate around 2,000 acres of cultivable land in around 20 villages in Sellipet-Pillayarkuppam area. “The entire rainwater got discharged in to the sea after the dam sustained damage. Now, it is completely dry and we don’t know what will happen to us next year. We have been asking the government for the last several years to carry out maintenance work to increase the water holding capacity,” said Sathish Kumar, a resident of Mari Amman Koil Street, Sellipet. The farmers at Sellipet, Pilliarkuppam, Vazhudavoor, Pakkiripalayam, Kalitherampet, Vambupet, Nerkulam, Muthiranpet and Kumarapalayam are solely dependent on the weir for irrigation purpose, said Bhoopathi, another resident of Sellipet. The construction of the anicut, said Mr. Kumar, had helped in recharging the groundwater in the area. “A portion of the dam was damaged during the rain in 2015. The breach was plugged by keeping sand bags and in the subsequent monsoons, the sand bags also started getting washed away. The flow of water was so forceful that the anicut got completely damaged in the recent rain,” said Mr. Kumar. According to a Public Works Department official, a proposal to take up repair work incurring an expenditure of around Rs. 6 crore was submitted to the government in 2019. However, the Finance Department did not give its concurrence citing lack of availability of funds, the official said. “The proposal was abandoned and so we could not take up any maintenance work,” he added. Proposal for a dam When contacted, Minister for Public Works K. Lakshminarayanan said a proposal to construct the dam had already been submitted to the Chief Minister’s Office. The plan was to avail Rs. 19 crore as loan from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, he said. “We are now re-working the proposal as the Chief Minister has suggested to increase the height of the dam so that more water could be stored. The expenditure will go up as we have to re-design the dam. The new proposal will be ready shortly and will be submitted to the bank for the loan,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sellipet-farmers-left-in-the-lurch-this-year/article64947814.ece

A. Anbalagan, party secretary (East), in a statement on Thursday said people are at present made to wait for at least three days to get their results. The delay in getting the results would end up spreading the virus to family members, he said. The Health Department should put a system in order so that the results are given on the same day, he added. The party secretary also urged the government to introduce more curbs as cases were rising everyday.

When Kumarasamy Mudaliar, son of then ‘zilla board member’ Medai Thalavai Mudaliar, saw the felling of tall trees near Kadayam in 1945, he stopped it and took steps for planting tamarind trees afresh on both sides of the road from Mudaliarpatti to Ariyappapuram Vilakku. This spot is called ‘Ellaippuli’ even today. Even though this avenue of trees does not affect the vehicular traffic and neither Department of Traffic nor Highways recommend felling or pruning of these trees, a few persons cut huge branches of these trees on January 7. Even as they were cutting larger branches closer to the ground as a precursor to the felling of the entire trees, former Tenkasi MLA K. Ravi Arunan, who was crossing the Kadayam panchayat union office, confronted these people and wanted to know the persons who had ordered the cutting of the trees. They continued their operation that forced the locals to join hands with Mr. Ravi Arunan. Those cutting the trees left the spot and the trees have been saved. “The Kadayam-Tenkasi highway handles the present volume of traffic and there is no need for axing the trees. It’s being done at the behest of a few officials of the Department of Highways, who have failed to remove encroachments along this road. If temporary and permanent illegal structures made along this road are removed and potholes plugged, the road will become fit for carrying even larger trucks. Instead, trees are being axed for reasons best known to them,” said Mr. Ravi Arunan, who has sent a complaint to the Chief Minister’s Special Cell. He says that the Chief Minister should order the officials who had ordered the cutting of the trees to plant new trees in the places where it is needed. “I am prepared to give tree saplings free of cost to be planted as a damage control measure,” he said, adding the rules on felling trees should be modified so that the cutting order could be given only by the Collector concerned. When Mr. Ravi Arunan was the MLA of Tenkasi Assembly segment, the Highways Department officials decided to widen the Old Courtallam Road which threatened a good number of trees along the road. Parallel road Mr. Ravi Arunan asked the officials to lay a new road parallel to the existing road without axing the trees. As it required a lot of funds, the plan was shelved. Even then, Mr. Ravi Arunan ensured that none of these trees were felled even though the road was widened to the maximum possible extent. “If anyone dares to lay hands on any of these trees, I’ll mobilise the public against it,” he said.

According to the FIR, the class XII girl at Michalepatti was staying at the school hostel. She alleged that the warden scolded and ordered her to do domestic chores on January 9 and subjected her to cruelty. Unable to bear this, she allegedly attempted to end her life. She was taken to the house of a nurse by the hostel cook, where she was administered an injection and prescribed medicines. The following day, she was handed over to her parents residing at Vadugampalayam near Ariyalur and on January 15, she was taken to the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital as her condition deteriorated. The girl gave a statement to the police implicating the warden and died on January 19 at the hospital. The police arrested the 67-year old warden under Sections 75 (punishment for cruelty to child) and 82[1] (indulging in corporal punishment with the aim of disciplining a child) of the Juvenile Justice Act and IPC Section 305 (abetment of suicide of child or insane person) and section 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonments). Following her death, additional charges would be pressed against the accused, police said. Meanwhile, a video clip of the girl, apparently recorded in hospital, claiming the warden had persistently asked her and her family members to undergo religious conversion was being shared on social media. On Thursday, her family members and BJP cadres led by party State vice-president Karuppu Muruganandam, staged a demonstration on the Medical College Road demanding the warden be booked for attempted religious conversion. The agitators were detained and released. Ensure fair probe Meanwhile, BJP State president K. Annamalai urged the government to ensure a fair probe into the allegation of attempted religious conversion. He said the FIR did not mention about the “forced conversion”. He also called for enacting an “anti-conversion” law.

In a memorandum addressed to the Union Finance Minister, the association has pointed out that a detailed survey for laying a 41-kilometre broad gauge line connecting Mannargudi with Pattukottai was taken up in 2011-12 and a sum of Rs. 216 crore was sanctioned by the Railway Board. Subsequently, pillars were erected on the riverbeds of Bamani, Kannanaru and Nasuvini and the works failed to progress thereafter. During the same period, according to the association president, N.Jayaraman, the Railway Board accorded its consent for setting up of new rail links between Ariyalur and Thanjavur through Thirumaanur for a distance of 50.35 kilometres at an estimated cost of Rs. 452.08 crore and from Thanjavur to Pattukottai via. Orathanadu for a distance of 47.20 at Rs. 325.70 crore. Stating that these two projects still remain on paper, he claimed that provisioning of the rail link from Ariyalur to Pattukottai via. Thanjavur and Orathanadu would not only ensure quick movement of cement from the Ariyalur region to Southern districts but also help reduce the volume of traffic on the chord line section of the Southern Railway. Drawing the attention of the Union Finance Minister towards the Central Government’s goal of electrification of existing railway tracks by 2024, the association requested Ms. Sitharaman to allocate sufficient funds for electrification of Tiruvarur-Karaikudi and Thiruthuraipoondi-Agasthiyampalli tracks. Apart from making an appeal to the Union Finance Minister for allocation of funds for railway projects in the delta region, the Association has urged the General Manager, Southern Railway, to initiate necessary steps for revival of passenger services on the newly laid Tiruvarur-Karaikudi section. Urging the Southern Railway to complete the exercise of filling up of vacant gatekeeper posts on this section and revival of the Karaikudi-Chennai Egmore (Kamban) Express and early operation of Eranakulam-Vailankanni bi-weekly and Tambaram-Sengottah tri-weekly services, the association pleaded that the Villupuram-Mayiladuthurai passenger service could be extended up to Madurai through Tiruvarur-Karaikudi section for the benefit of local commuters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-allot-funds-for-railway-projects-in-delta-region/article38300925.ece

A police team, which was checking vehicles at Bommuru in Rajamahendravaram district in Andhra Pradesh on January 15, stopped a car and a van that was following it and found ganja packed in 13 bags in them. The vehicles had been registered in Thoothukudi. Besides seizing the vehicles with the ganja, the police arrested three from Thoothukudi — R. Maharaja, 23, of Ganapathi Nagar, M.

The Tiruchi Corporation mooted the project in 2018 so as to transform the narrow road into a major road for residents to commute between Thillai Nagar and Woraiyur and Chathiram Bus Stand and Mela Chinthamani. It was touted as a good alternative to the heavily congested Karur Bypass Road. There are three major roads, such as College Road, Karur Bypass Road and Konakarai Road connecting various parts of the city with Tiruchi-Karur Road and Mela Chinthamani. Of them, Karur Bypass Road and College Road see heavy traffic. The Karur Bypass Road connecting Salai Road and Tiruchi-Karur Road has evolved as one of the major commercial areas of the city. It was to divert a section of traffic, that the civic body had mooted the idea of widening the Konakarai Road. The civic body had also surveyed the 2 km road that runs parallel to the Kudamuriti River. It also identified a few houses, which were constructed by encroaching the road space, in order to clear them. It subsequently devised a plan to widen the road at a cost of about Rs. 5 crore. K. N. Nehru, Minister for Municipal Administration, who represents the Tiruch West constituency, had visited the road after assuming office in May 2021 and promised to develop it on priority. But the project is yet to see the light.  When contacted a senior official of the Tiruchi Corporation told T he Hindu that the project has been put on hold in view of the proposed elevated corridor between Mela Chinthamani and Kambarasampettai by the State Highways. The alignment of the corridor was yet to be finalised and there were chances that it could run close to the Konakarai Road near Karur Road. If the corridor connects the Konakarai Road, traffic on the road would automatically go up ultimately requiring its widening.  “We have no other option but to develop the Konakarai Road to reduce the volume of traffic on the Karur Bypass Road. We have not shelved the proposal. Depending on the alignment of the elevated corridor, the Corporation will rework the project”, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/development-of-konakarai-road-hangs-in-balance/article64947643.ece

The new short duration variety, named TRY 5, has been found better than TRY 2, the existing early duration variety suited for salt affected soil which was brought out by the college in 2002, P. Masilamani, Dean, ADACRI, said. The college had also brought out TRY 3 and TRY 4, which were medium duration varieties.  Dr. Masilamani pointed out that selection of a suitable variety played a critical role in getting good yield, especially in problematic soils. Currently, farmers were cultivating short duration varieties, which were not much suitable for salt-affected tracts, during kuruvai and navarai seasons. There was a need to develop a short duration variety which would also be of good cooking quality. “Besides, farmers get seeds at subsidised rate of varieties notified within 10 years only. Since they are no longer able to get subsidised seeds for TRY 2, there was a need bring out a new variety,” Dr.Masilamani told The Hindu .  In order to cater to the needs of farmers, the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics of ADACRI had taken up research on developing a short duration sodicity tolerant and high yielding rice variety, he said. Following mutation breeding, the promising rice variety of TRY 5 was developed, which is well suited for kuruvai / navarai seasons of Tamil Nadu. The crop matures in 110-115 days with an average grain yield of 5100 kg per hectare (ha) with an advantage of 12.64 per cent grain yield over TRY 2. The variety is moderately resistant to blast and brown leaf spot diseases and pests such as brown plant hopper, green leaf hopper and white backed plant hopper. “The rice is long and slender. The cooked rice of this variety is non sticky, soft with good flavour and taste and suitable for batter. The variety has been approved by Tamil Nadu State Variety Release Committee, following which the TNAU released it as a Pongal gift,” Dr.Masilamani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-rice-variety-for-sodic-soil-released/article64947638.ece

Sathanur had a difficult time ensuring personal distance among the customers. The people had been waiting for nearly an hour in front of the shop, throwning caution to the wind, they said. A cross section of ration card holders feels that the authorities need to improve facilities and service to ensure that the COVID-19 safety protocol were followed at the PDS shops. An aged man who had been waiting for half an hour to purchase rice said that it was difficult to wait in line. "We have been vaccinated, but it is scary to hear the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. It is easy to contract the infection and one must always be careful," he said. The people were forced to stand close to one another in order to take shelter under the scorching heat. “It is not possible to stand under the hot sun for so long. One gets tired and dehydrated quickly,” the man added. Many were women who had gone to purchase groceries for their houses. The women said that the shopkeepers could call out a few token numbers while the others waited on the side to avoid lining up for a long time and overcrowding. "We understand that purchasing the essentials take time. They should either serve the people faster or employ more people at the shop," Rajalakshmi, a resident of K. Sathanur said. The government shoul also take steps to construct sheds outside the shops so the people are not forced to wait in the heat. “The next few months are going to be hot in Tamil Nadu. If this is the case, we will all faint one day or another,” she said.

Commuters remain hopeful||The travelling public in Tiruverumbur and surroundings that have been witnessing rapid urbanisation over the last decade cling on to the hope that the Railway Board will respond positively to the long-felt demand for stoppage of express trains at the Adarsh Status station in the town. Several hundreds of residents of Thuvakudi Municipality, BHEL Township, Ordnance Factory Township, and the numerous localities on either sides of the Tiruchi-Thanjavur National Highway in the Ariyamangalam-Pudukudi stretch travel up to Tiruchi Railway Junction every day to board express trains. Revenue generation which the Railway Ministry factors in as a major criteria would easily work in favour of Tiruverumbur Station for stoppage of express trains. Tiruverumbur station qualifies for stoppage of express trains; the passenger patronage is expected to be at least on a par with the Srirangam Railway Station, according to N. Anbalagan, president, Tamil Nadu Makkal Valarchi Kuzhu. “The dire requirement is there, but strong lobbying is also needed,” Mr. Anbalagan said, adding: “We have made a representation twice to Tiruchi Member of Parliament Su. Thirunavakkarasar to take up the issue with the Railway Board.” According to Vetrivel, a regular rail traveller belonging to Kailash Nagar, stoppage for express trains at Tiruverumbur station would also mean lesser vehicular traffic towards Railway Junction from the residential localities in the Kattur-Thuvakkudi stretch. There is a strong reason for considering stoppage of express trains for a one minute duration at Tiruverumbur after the completion of the track-doubling and electrification work between Tiruchi and Tiruverumbur. Railway sources said the stoppage policy envisages recovery of cost involved in making the halt at any particular station. A specific number of sleeper class tickets per day per train for a distance of 500 km or its equivalent fare in case of other classes of travel have to be sold to cover the cost. The policy is that no stoppage is provided if the trains are passing at odd hours, and there should be no additional stoppage for long-distance trains in suburban sections. But then, factors like population and significance of the towns and new developments taking place stands the station in good stead to be considered for stoppage of express trains. Halt stations are opened on public demand if found financially viable and feasible from operating and engineering points of view. Opening of halt stations is also considered on passenger amenity grounds within the purview of the extant policy guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-express-trains-stop-at-tiruverumbur-station-commuters-remain-hopeful/article38301325.ece

The Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, which would receive anywhere between 300 and 400 fever cases a day during the ‘fever season’, is now receiving more than 500 patients suffering with high fever, cold, throat pain, body pain and headache, all symptoms of the viral fever. Doctors working with in the government hospitals and the primary health centres say that more than 75% of patients coming to the hospitals were fever cases. Government Hospitals in Koodankulam, Nanguneri, Ambasamudram, Tenkasi and Sankarankovil receive more than 400 patients a day and more than 80% of them are fever patients. “A good number of these patients will certainly test positive for Omicron variant of COVID-19 if they are tested. However, most of them avoid the test and take the tablets on getting prescription from a physician,” said a private practitioner, who is also treating at least 75 fever patients a day. The only solace is that the fever, without any lung involvement, subsides within five days after proper medication prescribed by the doctors while the Omicron patients with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, cancer and those who had undergone liver or kidney transplant would have to battle for life if they fail to come to the hospital in time. “If the patients have only fever and allied symptoms like headache, body pain, throat pain and do not have any trouble in breathing, they are advised to be in home isolation after properly taking the medicines prescribed by the doctors. If they don’t have any comorbidities, the fever will subside completely on the third or the fourth day and there is no need for panic,” said a doctor attached to a government hospital. The radiological investigation centres which had to work overtime ever since the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2019 too receive only a few fever cases. “When the first and the second waves of COVID-19 reached the crescendo, the scan centres were working round-the-clock. Some of the leading scan centres handled even up to 80 cases a day as the deadly lung involvement was killing the patients mercilessly. Now, it has dropped to just 2 or 3 cases a day,” said a radiologist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fever-patients-throng-govt-hospitals/article64947822.ece

The tourism and hospitality sector in the Nilgiris witnessed an upturn in fortunes at the end of last year, with over 2.5 lakh visitors believed to have visited the district in the last two months of 2021. However, since the turn of the year, the number of visitors had declined steeply, primarily due to the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases across the State, with visitors choosing to stay away fearing infection, the officials said. Visitors to all tourist spots across the district have declined sharply, including The Government Botanical Garden, the most popular tourist spot in the district. According to officials, an average of 9,000 people were visiting the garden during the final few months of 2021. However, the number since then has fallen sharply to around 1,500 during the week, with the number increasing slightly to around 2,500 visitors during the weekend. Small business as well as hotel and restaurant owners had hoped that the Pongal holidays would witness an influx of tourists to the district. “This was not the case, as people chose to stay away due to the increasing number of cases reported in Tamil Nadu as well as in Kerala, where a high proportion of tourists to the Nilgiris travel from,” said N. Chandrashekar, honorary secretary of the Nilgiri Hotel and Restaurant Association. The district administration has also announced a few restrictions at tourist spots and for entry into the district to minimise the chance of an increase in transmission of COVID-19 to local residents. Since this month, only people showing proof of vaccination are allowed to enter the district as well as tourist spots, while visiting hours to the parks and gardens have also been limited to between 10 a.m and 3 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tourist-footfall-to-the-nilgiris-drops-as-covid-19-cases-rise/article64947901.ece

At present, the TWAD Board officials said that final alignment work of these damaged pipelines along the Palar is being undertaken for the past few days after officials found a missing link in these pipelines. These pipelines connect areas in three districts — Tirupattur, Vellore and Ranipet — along the river, providing water supply to all local bodies in these limits for more than two decades. “Due to the restoration work of the damaged pipelines, water supply is being done through tanker lorries to residents by respective local bodies as a stop-gap measure. Piped water supply will be resumed in a week,” a TWAD official said. It was during the November floods that extensive damage was caused to water pipelines along the river covering Tirupattur, Vellore and Ranipet districts. Most of these pipelines were laid below the causeways and also along the bund of the river. These causeways, connecting Vellore and Tirupattur districts through border towns such as Ambur and Katpadi, were also damaged due to rain that resulted in the discharge of excess rainwater into the Palar and its tributaries — Poonai and Agaram — flooding areas along the river in Vellore, Ranipet and Tirupattur districts. Since then, affected residents in more than 40 villages in key border towns like Ambur, Gudiyatham, Pallikonda, K.V. Kuppam, Katpadi, Wallajah and Nemili in these three districts had to depend on tanker lorries for water supply to meet their domestic needs every day. Officials said that 600 metres of the pipelines below Madhanur causeway in Tirupattur, 15 metres in Pachai Kuppam, 60 metres in Virinchipuram (Vellore) and 200 metres in Poigai (Vellore) along the river were damaged due to last year’s rain. Further, the main pipelines between Pallikonda and Gudiyatham; Virudhampattu and Katpadi in Vellore were also damaged. These damaged pipelines were being restored with the trail tests that were done on Tuesday by the TWAD Board. Causeways restored Earlier this month, major causeways along the river were restored. The Madhanur causeway in Tirupattur district connects Ambur with around 20 villages in Gudiyatham region. The causeway, which is 90 metres long and 6 metres wide, was used by mofussil buses, lorries, cars and two-wheelers. Around 40 metres of the causeway was damaged due to rain. Likewise, Virinjipuram and Poonai causeways connect big towns like Katpadi and Walljah in Vellore and Ranipet districts respectively. Both these causeways come within the limits of Vellore. Of the total length of 80 metres, 62 metres of Virinjipuram causeway was damaged and the State Highways department restored it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/piped-water-supply-to-resume-soon-in-vellore-and-ranipet-districts/article64947816.ece

To meet the increased demand for consultation and COVID-19 tests, round-the-clock OPDs were opened in eight large hospitals in the district, including the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences and the Civil Hospital. These will have OPD counters also for children and pregnant women. This is part of the series of initiatives being taken by the district administration and the Health Department to set up additional medical infrastructure in government hospitals. Deputy Commissioner Nitesh Patil said that 24 x 7 OPDs have been opened in the Civil Hospital, KIMS, Railway Hospital, Chitguppi Hospital, ESI Hospital, Anjuman Hostel, B.R. Ambedkar Bhavan at Sangolli Rayanna Nagar and at Morarji Desai Residential School at Anchatgeri. These places already have COVID Care Centres and now, they also have the OPDs.

This is also a big jump from 24,135 cases reported in the city on Wednesday. Experts and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike estimate that the peak is still far away. But Chief Civic Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the condition in the city during the two peaks is not comparable. While there was a mad scramble for beds, oxygen, medicines and long lines at the city’s crematoriums at the peak of the second wave, even hospitalisation is very low in the city as of Thursday. While the city recorded 93 deaths on April 30, 2021, at the peak of the second wave, the city reported eight deaths on Thursday. A BBMP estimate puts hospitalisation at 1.3% of the caseload and that less than 0.5% are on critical beds, as of Wednesday. On an average, the city is seeing around 200 to 250 hospitalisations, Mr. Gupta said. As per the COVID-19 Bed Status portal of BBMP, of the 6,963 government quota beds available in the city only 659 beds were occupied and 6,304 beds vacant. Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) said nearly 600 beds were occupied in their share of beds in private hospitals in the city presently. “Given the mild infection Omicron is causing, we are of the firm opinion that hospitalisation should become the parameter to assess the severity of the situation, and not the number of cases. Presently, we are in a very comfortable situation with all medicines, oxygen and critical beds available for any patient in the city,” said Dr. H. Prasanna, President, PHANA. This is a function of the change in the nature of infection due to the new Omicron strain of the virus, the civic body’s decentralised and effective triaging and home isolation strategies and the high vaccine coverage, said Mr. Gupta. The city has achieved over 99% of first dose and over 82% of second dose coverage, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bengaluru-breaches-2nd-wave-peak-with-30540-fresh-cases/article64947837.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:30 IST,KARNATAKA||Curfew: Decision on fresh guidelines today||Amidst mounting pressure to withdraw weekend and night curfews, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai will chair a top-level meeting of experts, senior bureaucrats, and Ministers to review the COVID-19 situation and restrictions in the State on Friday morning. The government is expected to issue fresh guidelines on Friday evening. On the eve of the crucial meeting, the Union Health secretary categorised Karnataka as one of the six “States of concern” over rising COVID-19 cases. High caseload Both Karnataka and Bengaluru, that has been contributing the most to the caseload in the State, recorded a big jump in the number of cases reported - the State reported 47,754 cases and Bengaluru 30,540 cases - both highest during the third wave. However, the Test Positivity Rate has seen a slight decline from 18.8% on Wednesday to 18.48% on Thursday. Bengaluru also breached the all-time high of 26,756 cases reported in a day on April 30, 2021, at the peak of the second wave. Sources said internal studies by the Government indicate both the city and the State are far from the peak of the third wave. The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has projected two scenarios – that the third wave will peak in the State at 80,000 cases/day in the best-case scenario and the peak may go up to 1.2 lakh cases/day in the worst-case scenario. The peak is expected by the first or second week of February. This has prompted a conservative opinion “to continue restrictions, including curfews, for at least two more weeks” to prevail among the bureaucracy, sources said. However, the Chief Minister is under severe pressure not just from the affected industry segments – hospitality and trader bodies – but also from within his own party to end all forms of curfews. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, and BJP national general secretary C. T. Ravi have voiced their opinions batting for the end of all curfews, over the last three days. “It is a tight rope walk for the Chief Minister. Though he is under pressure from multiple quarters to relax restrictions, politically he will be held responsible if the situation goes out of hand,” a senior strategist of BJP said. Speaking to media persons on Wednesday, Mr. Bommai hinted at relaxing restrictions when he said the experts were themselves divided and some felt since the infection was mild and hospitalisation was not high, it would be better to carry on with life adhering to COVID Appropriate Behaviour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/curfew-decision-on-revised-guidelines-expected-today/article64947712.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:31 IST,KARNATAKA||Match-fixing in KPL tournament did not amount to cheating: HC||In a setback to Bengaluru city police, the High Court of Karnataka has held that the acts of match-fixing, allegedly occurred during Karnataka Premier League (KPL) cricket matches held in August 2019, did not amount to an offence of cheating under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and quashed the chargesheet filed against two cricketers and others in the case. “It is true that if a player indulges in match-fixing, a general feeling will arise that he has cheated the lovers of the game. But, this general feeling does not give rise to an offence,” the court observed. Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar passed the order while allowing the petitions filed by cricketers Abrar Kazi and C.M. Gautam, who were players of Ballari Tuskers franchise team of KPL, Ali Ashpak alias Asfak Hanif Thara, owner of Belagavi Panthers franchise, all resident of Bengaluru , and Amit Mavi, a bookie based in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad. BCCI’s domain The court said, “The match-fixing may indicate dishonesty, indiscipline and mental corruption of a player and for this purpose, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the authority to initiate disciplinary action. If the bylaws of the BCCI provides for the initiation of disciplinary action against players such an action is permitted. But registration of an FIR, on the grounds that a crime punishable under section 420 of the IPC has been committed, cannot be permitted.” On the claim by the prosecution that match-fixing amounts to cheating and therefore the offence under section 420 of the IPC had been invoked in the chargesheet, the court said that for invoking section 420 of the IPC, the essential ingredients to be present are deception, dishonest inducement of a person to deliver any property or to alter or destroy the whole or any part of valuable security. “No inducement” Further, on the argument by the prosecution that cricket lovers go to watch the match by buying tickets and thereby they are “induced to part with their property, that is, their money,” the court said that, “of course, money is a property, but the argument that cricket lovers are induced to buy tickets cannot be accepted”. “They [cricket lovers] may have a feeling that they are going to witness a fair game being played, but they buy tickets voluntarily. So question of inducement to buy ticket can be ruled out,” the court observed. The court also declined to accept the argument that betting amounts to gaming, which is an offence under the Karnataka police act in case of KPL matches. Game of chance “If section 27 of the Karnataka Police Act is seen, its explanation very clearly says that game of chance does not include any athletic game or sport. Cricket is a sport and therefore even if betting takes place it cannot be brought within the ambit of definition of gaming found in the Karnataka Police Act,” the court observed. “Even if the entire chargesheet averments are taken to be true on their face value, they do not constitute an offence,” the court made clear while quashing the entire criminal proceeding initiated against the petitioners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/match-fixing-in-kpl-tournament-did-not-amount-to-cheating-hc/article64947706.ece

Before the surge in COVID-19 cases, over 1,000 people purchased monthly passes to travel AC buses in January. The BMTC had stopped operating most of its AC buses once the pandemic struck as there were no takers. Even when the services resumed, there was no demand for AC bus passes. In January 2022, the BMTC started issuing monthly passes for Rs. 1,500 instead of Rs. 2,000. “After this, we sold 1,197 passes. Even though there is a surge in COVID-19 cases, we have not reduced services, and are running buses as per schedule. Currently, we are operating 311 AC bus schedules, which include 78 Vayu Vajra services to the Kempegowda International Airport,” said a BMTC official. In December 2021, when COVID-19 cases appeared to be on the decline, the BMTC reduced ticket prices for Vajra services by 34%, and the cost of day passes from Rs. 120 to Rs. 100. According to officials, within a week of the new prices, occupancy increased by 25%. “Revenue too marginally increased,” said the BMTC official. The corporation hopes that more people will switch to using AC buses. During pre-COVID times, a majority of AC bus commuters were working professionals, including those in the IT sector, most of whom are now working from home. BMTC officials are worried that if COVID-19 cases in the city continue to rise, ridership will decline again. Already, overall daily ridership of city buses has dropped to 20 lakh from 23 to 24 lakh per day from the end of December.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-1000-passengers-buy-ac-bus-passes-after-reduction-in-fare/article64947926.ece

Anas Ahmed, a Kerala-based businessman, has been accused in a money-laundering case in connection with a fraud committed through Powerbank and other such fraudulent mobile applications. In June 2021, the cybercrime police of CID arrested 11 persons, including Anas Ahmed, allegedly involved in the collection of hundreds of crores of rupees from people through an app called ‘Powerbank’. Sources said that it has been found that the accused were conducting transactions through the hawala route. The ED officials had initiated money laundering investigation into the operations of accused entities that induced the public to invest certain amount through Powerbank and other such fraudulent apps by assuring to remit interest on daily or weekly basis on the investments made. The accused entities closed their purported business after collecting huge sums of money from gullible public and had gone incommunicado. They neither paid interest nor returned the principal amount to the public and withheld the investment made by public which had resulted in the commission of cheating offences. Anas Ahmed is a partner in two accused firms, namely H&S Ventures Inc and Clifford Ventures., the ED said. These two partnership firms have been responsible for collection of approximately Rs. 84 crore from members of the public, officials said, adding that Anas Ahmed has Chinese links and is suspected of being the mastermind of the whole racket. Anas Ahmed indulged into corrupt and illegal activities through his partnership firms by deviating from the declared line of business and other activities of gaming and has collected money from public under the guise of investment schemes through fraudulent apps. The proceeds generated through criminal activities have been layered through a number of shell entities to remit out of India and also invest into crypto currencies, a release said. “The Principal City Civil and Sessions and Special Judge for PMLA Cases, Bengaluru has granted six days of custody of Anas Ahmed to the ED officials on Thursday for inquiring into the fraud committed,” a release from Enforcement Directorate stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mobile-app-investment-scam-kingpin-in-ed-custody/article38300791.ece

Citizens should, to the extent possible, stay at home. Anyone with symptoms should get tested; we have also ensured that the results are declared within 24 hours,” he said. A citizen, who used a home testing kit and tested positive, took to Twitter and stated that hours after uploading his results into the website (as mentioned in the home testing kit), he got a call from the civic body, enquiring about his condition. “I’m blown by such deep integration right from kit manufacturer down to local municipality and then their war room to reach out to patients within 24 hours,” he tweeted. Another citizen tweeted that not only did the BBMP call soon after he tested positive, but also provided a medical kit with prescriptions. A doctor also called once a day, he said. A resident of Whitefield said that within six hours of getting positive results, a BBMP doctor called to enquire about health, travel history if any, and vaccination status. Mr. Gupta said that several citizens had appreciated the BBMP’s proactive response. “We have zonal war rooms, and control rooms at the Assembly constituency level. We have over 300 personnel engaged in calling those who have tested positive for COVID-19 and checking up on them regularly,” he said. He said it was difficult to guesstimate the number of people using home testing kits. “The only way we will know is if the person uploads the result, which then gets uploaded on to the ICMR portal, which is then passed on to the civic body. However, we will not know if the person has tested positive using a home testing kit,” he said and added that as responsible citizens, they must upload their results – negative or positive - on the website (mentioned in the kit).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-3000-persons-triaged-a-day-in-bengaluru-bbmp/article38300804.ece

Renukacharya, who were at loggerheads so far, appear to have joined hands as both the leaders held a meeting in Bengaluru on Thursday for more than a hour. Both the leaders, who are aspiring to get ministerial berths, are learnt to have decided to make a fervent appeal to the BJP leadership as well as Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to not only take up Cabinet reshuffle at the earliest but also drop senior Ministers. According to sources, they have decided to demand that senior Ministers who have been part of all the Ministries in the BJP Government so far should be dropped and roped in for party organisational work. In their place, the party should give opportunity for committed legislators to serve as Ministers, they have reportedly decided to demand. Gujarat model Sources said that both the leaders want the party to adopt Gujarat model by changing all the members of the Ministry barring the Chief Minister in a bid to infuse fresh blood into top echelons of administration. This was the only way left for the party to retain power, they believe. Later, Mr. Yatnal told reporters that it would be better to take up the rejig of the State Cabinet at the earliest so that newcomers would get more time ahead of the 2023 Assembly elections to serve the State. Mr. Renukacharya termed their meeting as a courtesy visit and said they had also discussed the ways and means of countering Congress leaders whom they alleged were under the illusion that they would come to power with the help of Mekedatu padayatra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/renukacharya-yatnal-meet-to-bring-pressure-on-party-leadership/article64947703.ece

Ltd. till further orders as the court was examining the issue of correctness of invoking the provisions of the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act, 2004, against the company. The court, however, directed the company to cooperate with the authorities in the investigation taken up based on the complaints lodged by people alleging that the company had lured them to deposit money. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the interim order whilehearing the petition filed by the company questioning the legality of invoking the provisions of the KPIDFE Act, and challenging some of its provisions. Vihaan is a sub-franchisee of QNet, a Hong Kong-headquartered direct selling and multi-level marketing company, engaged in direct selling of various products and services to consumers in India. The petitioner-company has claimed it is not a financial establishment but an e-commerce-based direct selling company, and hence provisions of the KPIDFE Act cannot be invoked against it as it is not engaged in financial activities such as deposit collection. The State Government has pointed out that 22 cases had been registered against the company based on the complaints lodged by the public. Meanwhile, Senior Counsel Kamini Jaiswal, appearing for the petitioner-company, pointed out to the Bench that the Supreme Court in 2017 had stayed further proceedings initiated against the company in several criminal cases launched earlier in Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Karnataka, and Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-told-not-to-take-coercive-steps-against-direct-selling-company/article38300806.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:29 IST,KARNATAKA||Most cases are of mild fever with cold, cough||A number of patients with symptoms of mild fever, cough, cold and sore throat have been thronging clinics in Dakshina Kannada for the past few days now. A case in point is a clinic of a well-known physician at Chilimbi in the city where the doctor has been attending to a number of patients from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Physician Srinivas Kakkilaya said that the symptoms he has been attending to are of the upper respiratory track viral infection caused when the air is cold and dry. In most cases, it will be influenza and in some, they can be of coronavirus. “These are self- limiting infection and they go off in a week’s time. People can take paracetamol if fever goes up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit and beyond during this period,” the doctor said. Advising patients not to yield to indiscriminate use of antibiotics such as azithromycin for viral infection, Dr. Kakkilaya said that people should take care of their general health and opt for one or two steam inhalations during this period and also, do gargling with warm water. Family physician and Public Relations Officer of the Mangaluru chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Annayya Kulal said that the condition of patients with high risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma may start deteriorating after seven days. Such patients then need to get admitted in hospitals and undergo necessary tests. Another family physician G.K. Bhat Sankabithilu, who is the secretary of IMA, Mangaluru, said that unlike in the first two waves of COVID-19, the symptoms for the infection now are very mild in nature and they are being treated by keeping patients under home isolation for a period of one week. These symptoms are also noticed even among those who have taken two doses of vaccine. Urging people not to panic if faced with the infection, Dr. Sankabithilu advised them to isolate themselves and follow other COVID-19 norms while taking medicine as prescribed by their doctors. District COVID Nodal Officer H. Ashok said that most of the students and others who tested positive for COVID-19 recently, have recovered after one week in isolation. Those with cold, cough and other symptoms can get themselves tested at a primary health centre and follow the treatment protocol, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/most-cases-are-of-mild-fever-with-cold-cough/article38301296.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:29 IST,KARNATAKA||City to see first of three-phase MEMU trains on January 26||The city will see the first of its three-phase Mainline Electrical Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains with the Southern Railway replacing the conventional rake of Train Nos 06478/06477 Mangaluru Central-Kannur-Mangaluru Central Unreserved Express Special on January 26. While MEMU coaches have more carrying capacity than conventional coaches, the main advantage will be that the rake does not require loco reversal as the motor car coaches on both the ends can move the rake on either direction. With Mangaluru Central being a dead-end station, loco reversal was mandatory and with a MEMU train, considerable operational time can now be saved. Indigenous MEMU A 12-coach MEMU with three motor cars and nine trailer cars propelled by three-phase AC system manufactured indigenously by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai, will be deployed replacing the conventional rake of the train. While each motor car can accommodate 55 sitting and 171 standing passengers, each trailer car will accommodate 84 sitting and 271 standing passengers. Thus, a 12-coach three-phase MEMU can accommodate 3,603 passengers, 921 sitting and 2,682 standing, in all. A conventional MEMU on the other hand, can carry 2,634 passengers, in all. Passenger amenities The steel body coaches with easy to slide, light-weight sliding doors and fibre reinforced polymer interior panels will also have CCTV surveillance system and LED lights. GPS-based passenger information system, public announcement system, bio-toilets in trailer cars are the other features. Cabins of the motormen and guard are air-conditioned. The three-phase MEMU rakes with insulated-gate bipolar transistor facilitates improved acceleration and braking performance even as the regenerative braking system can help save up to 35% of energy compared to conventional MEMUs. The electricity so generated will be fed back to the grid. A 10.4 inch touch screen driver display unit in motor cars will provide information about Train Control and Monitoring System to help the motorman in operating the rake. Coaches are provided with air spring as secondary stage suspension and as a safety feature, DDU will indicate any failure to the motorman to restrict the train’s speed to 55 kmph. Schedule Train No 06477 is scheduled to leave Kannur at 7.40 a.m. to reach Mangaluru Central at 10.55 a.m. In the return direction, Train No 06478 leaves Mangaluru Central at 5.05 p.m. to reach Kannur at 8.40 p.m. The evening service is largely patronised by students and the regular travellers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/city-to-see-first-of-three-phase-memu-trains-on-january-26/article64947720.ece

Talking to reporters, Mr. Moodbidri said that an elaborate process is followed by the Expert Committee of the Defence Ministry in selection of floats. And, this is in compliance with norms that have already been laid down. “The process involves only selection of floats and there is no rejection. This decision should not be politicised,” he said. The Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) are unnecessarily politicising the non-selection of the Kerala Government’s float for their political gain. Coming hard on the Congress, Mr. Moodbidri said that the Congress leaders have no moral right to question the BJP as their party has defamed many religious leaders and places of worship in the past. While the ruling CPI(M) government in Kerala is projecting the incident as defamation of Narayana Guru, Mr. Moodbidri said that organisations such as Sree Narayana Guru Dharma Paripalana Yogam and Bharath Dharma Jana Sena, which follow Narayana Guru, have so far not said a word about it. Narayana Guru is a highly regarded social reformer and Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to keep him in high esteem, Mr. Moodbidri said.

As a part of the programme, the Wipro Foundation will be involved with these 40 institutions for a period of three years and hold activities to strengthen sustainability pedagogy practices across various disciplines/subjects in these institutions. In addition, the first 20 schools, which include Government school, are awarded prize money of Rs. 50,000. The two schools from DK were among several institutions that took part in the selection process that involved submission of project report on sustainable practices. The two institutions worked on the project related to waste management. Government School headmaster Aravind Kudla said it is the restrictions for movement because of COVID-19 and scope for creative work that made the school choose waste management. The 25 students from Classes VI to VIII, who are all members of the schools’s eco-club, were involved in the project. Among the activities that these students did include recycling news and other used papers to come up with plain grey papers. These grey papers were used by students for making posters for waste segregation awareness campaign held in the village. These grey papers were also used for drawings, poems and essays of students on waste management. The students also came out with eco bricks formed by inserting covers of toffee, chips and other eatables into empty water and soft drinks bottles. “We have planned to use these bricks in our kitchen garden,” Mr. Kudla said. The children made floormats and bags by using old clothes. Students made pen stands using discarded single-use ballpoint pens. Mr. Kudla said all these activities were conducted between September and October last year. A project report, which reflected on how students have adopted waste management in their lifestyle, was submitted in November. The Chennai-based C.P. Ramaswamy Centre for Environmental Education guided the school, which also received good support from Deputy Director of Public Instruction and Bantwal Block Education Officer, he said. “This project helped us to involve students in the learning activity when the school was closed because of COVID-19,” Mr. Kudla added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-schools-selected-for-wipro-earthian-sustainability-programme/article64947711.ece

Unable to run the shows with 50% seating capacity, theatres are said to be suffering losses and therefore film exhibitors resolved to close the theatres until the situation became normal. “What’s the point in incurring losses almost every day amidst night curfew and weekend lockdown that are driving moviegoers away from theatres,” asked M.R. Rajaram, vice-president, Karnataka Film Exhibitors’ Federation. Amidst the demand from various sections for withdrawing night curfew and weekend curfew, the federation has decided to wait until the new films are released. “In case there are no new releases in the days ahead, we have no other option but to keep the theatres shut, like we did last year. It’s not just in Mysuru but across Karnataka,” Mr. Rajaram, who is also the secretary of Mysuru Film Exhibitors’ Association, said. In dire straits He said the single-screen cinemas were in dire straits in the wake of COVID-19, lockdowns and continuing curbs. The number of theatres in Mysuru had come down from 24 to 8 in the last few years. The reasons were aplenty and not COVID-19 alone, he claimed. “We need at least Rs. 1.25 lakh to run shows daily. What if we don’t get back what we have invested? It’s very uncertain now and we cannot take risks any more. The weekend curfew has hit us very hard as collections are usually high on Saturdays and Sundays,” he said. The single-screen theatres that once used to be the heart of the cinema business in the State are facing the serious risk of slipping into oblivion with the first and second waves of COVID-19 sounding the death knell for the show business. And now it’s the third wave. With no hopes in sight, exhibitors at some places are opting to permanently shut down theatres, unable to bear the losses. More than 30 single-screen cinemas have been shut down in the State and four in Mysuru city alone, which was once the second largest cinema revenue earning centre, after Bengaluru city. With no prospects of early revival of the industry, Lakshmi theatre, which was into show business for the last 70 years in Mysuru, announced that it was closing down. Shanthala, Sree Nagaraj, and Saraswathi are the others that ceased business. Mr. Rajaram said if the pandemic was one of the key reasons, heavy taxes and lack of relief from the government during these trying times were driving many single-screens to permanently stop operations. Single-screen cinemas may become non-existent in the next few years if the problems persist, he added. In Mysuru, a few more single screentheatresare planning to shut down, unable to bear the losses. Unless there are big releases with big star cast, thetheatresmay not prosper like before, exhibitors feel.  We need at least Rs. 1.25 lakh to run shows daily. What if we don’t get back what we have invested? It’s very uncertain now and we cannot take risks any more. The weekend curfew has hit us very hard as collections are usually high on Saturdays and Sundays.M.R.

Led by their president Kurubur Shanthakumar, the farmers said there was plenty of rain in the Kabini and the Cauvery catchment areas and adequate storage in reservoirs in the State. Mr. Shantakumar said, on the one hand, farmers are in doldrums due to unseasonal rains, which is having a negative bearing on the yield, and on the other, standing crops are starved of water. The association said those endowed with irrigation pumpsets to tap groundwater are unable to do so due to frequent power outage in rural areas. Farmers are unable to grow fodder as a result of which the cattle is starving. The farmers submitted a memorandum to authorities in the Irrigation Department who promised to take up the issue with higher-ups and release water from the reservoirs by February 10. The farmers urged the Deputy Commissioner to ensure completion of procurement process of paddy with minimum support price announced by the government. The farmers want authorities to strike down the regulation that only 10 quintals of ragi and 40 quintals of paddy need to be procured from farmers with small-size land holdings. The upper limit should be 20 quintals of ragi and 100 quintals of paddy from each farmer, said Mr. Shanthakumar. He accused a few private sugar mills of making unilateral changes in the terms and conditions stipulated by the Government for sugarcane procurement.  Strike down the regulation that only 10 quintals of ragi and 40 quintals of paddy need to be procured from farmers with small-size land holdings.Kurubur ShanthakumarPresident, Sugarcane Farmers’ Association||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-stage-protest-seeking-release-of-water-from-dams/article38301047.ece

Somashekar on Thursday said the weekend curfew was imposed based on the opinions of experts in the interest of public health safety as a precautionary measure following rise in COVID-19 cases. The weekend curfew was not the decision taken alone by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, he said. Speaking to reporters, he said the government has taken various measures amidst the spike in cases for the safety of people. The Chief Minister is expected to take a call on whether to continue with the weekend curfew amidst the demand for its withdrawal. On the statements from Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and senior BJP leader C.T. Ravi for discontinuing weekend curfew citing the difficulties caused to the public, Mr. Somashekar said the leaders have expressed their views. The DCs of respective districts have been given powers to take decisions based on the prevailing situation, he said. Exhorting Health Minister K. Sudhakar’s reported comments on the views over curbs expressed publicly by the party leaders, the Minister said such statements cause misperception in the minds of the public about the steps taken by the government. “If everybody starts giving media statements, it will result in confusion. Mr. Sudhakar had only meant that it was advisable if those who are familiar with handling the pandemic with medical knowledge speak about the situation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/weekend-curfew-was-not-cms-decision-alone/article38301051.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 04:53 IST,KERALA||Rubber Act repeal to aid lobbies: Cong.||Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran, MP, has flayed the Centre’s move to repeal the Rubber Act, 1947, and introduce a new legislation. In a statement here on Thursday, Mr. Sudhakaran termed actions of the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, which had proposed Rubber (Promotion and Development) Bill 2022 to replace the Rubber Act, as “anti-farmer.” He alleged that proposal to repeal the Rubber Act was aimed at helping big lobbies. The new law should be beneficial to the farmers. Rubber farmers were a worried lot over the move to import rubber cup lumps. The Union government should initiate steps to address their concerns.

It is the first such check-dam in southern India and is meant to store water on the Manadukkam-Enrinajalamkode stream in Panathady, says E.P. Rajamohan, special officer, Kasaragod Development Project. The project, constructed at Rs. 38 lakh, is being implemented by the Irrigation department with technical assistance from the Indian Institute of Water Management, an agency under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in Bhubaneswar. Water as tool “It will last 15 to 25 years and has a storage height of 1.5 to 2.5 m,” says Mr. Rajamohan adding that such dams can be set up to a length of 100 to 150 m. “Water can be stored in the dam by pumping water into the rubber tube. When water rises in the dam during floods or rain, water can be let out from the rubber tube,” he says. Mr. Rajamohan says this prevents debris and silt from accumulating and restricting the flow of water. Instead of raising shutters, rubber tubes can be deflated to let water gush out. It is cheaper and more durable than concrete check-dams. Experts choose sites Such dams are coming up at four other locations in the district. The location was selected after a team of experts from the ICAR visited the sites and gave approval for construction. The other dams are coming up on the Madhuvahini river in Madhur panchayat, Alanthatta-Nappachal stream in Kayyur Cheemeni panchayat, Maniyattuthottu in Pilicode panchayat, andthe Manjeswaram Puzha in Vorkady panchayat.

SLMC Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, who inspected the dumping yard of the civic body at North Kalamassery on Thursday following the massive fire that erupted along the plastic heaps lying at the site on Tuesday, directed the municipal authorities to step up measures to resolve the widening gap in the solid waste management system without delay. “I will be submitting a detailed report on the fire incident and the lapses in the management of solid waste in Kalamassery before the tribunal,” said Mr. Pillai. M.A. Baiju, Chief Environmental Engineer, Ernakulam, of the State Pollution Control Board, and A.K. Naishad, chairman of the municipality’s health standing committee, were present at the site. The SLMC chief pointed out shortcomings in the segregation of waste brought to the site and recommended steps as per the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The municipal authorities claimed that non-biodegradable waste was washed and cleaned before it was brought to the site. They said an agreement was signed between the civic body and the government’s Clean Kerala Company for the safe disposal of non-biodegradable waste. The SLMC has asked the authorities to ensure that the waste taken out of the site was disposed of as per norms. It should not be dumped in other States or places in violation of rules. Those responsible for such acts would face action, it said. The board informed the SLMC that the municipality was yet to take its approval for the management of waste at the dumping site. It had also not complied with the earlier directives to plug loopholes in the waste management process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/slmc-waste-management-at-kalamassery-unscientific/article64947758.ece

Least by capital city Even the Kochi Corporation, which tops the list of the six Corporations in the State, could utilise only Rs. 42.61 crore till date, which accounts for 32.83% of the Rs. 129.79 crore allotted by the State government for the fiscal. Among Corporations, the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram utilised the least, spending only 19.43% of its Plan fund of Rs. 251.71 crore. As per Local Self-government Department figures, the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation could utilise only Rs. 48.90 crore till date.

This is one of the proliferating cases of online fraud being reported at rural cyber police stations almost on a daily basis. It started with the youngster receiving a “scratch and win” card by post with a congratulatory message for having won it on account of his online purchase from an online portal. The fraud kicked in at that moment, starting with the demand for a processing fee of Rs. 2,000. Since then, he paid close to Rs. 80 lakh at different points before it dawned on him that he was being taken for a ride. He then made a complaint to the police. The victim was lured into each payment with the promise that the entire money would be repaid with interest. “People should be on guard against being cheated in this manner. The fraudsters always use the names of popular e-commerce portals to trap their potential victims with “scratch and win” cards offering eye-popping prizes like cars and gadgets. They then dangle those prizes to cheat the victims of their hard earned money,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). Several instances of online fraud, including the receipt of a brick in place of an iPhone, have been reported from Ernakulam rural limits of late.

The CPI(M) was protecting goons, and criminals were unleashing violence in the State. But Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was trivialising such incidents as isolated ones, said Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan. He was speaking to reporters after visiting the family of Shan Babu, who was tortured and murdered by Jomon K. Jose, a history-sheeter, and others on Sunday night. He further accused the ruling party of ‘misusing’ its political clout for diluting charges slapped on goons under the Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act (KAAPA). Protecting criminals “It is the CPI(M) that is protecting the goons. The problem is not with the law, but its enforcement. The criminal who killed the 19-year-old youth is a CPI(M) activist. There has been political interference to protect him,” Mr. Satheesan alleged. Pointing out that goons can be imprisoned only under Section 3 of the KAAPA Act, he said only after further examination of the police report could the appeal committee drop the charges levelled against a goonda. Was such a police report considered while dropping the charges levelled against the goon who had killed Shan? he asked. He also sought to know whether the appeal committee had considered his application without the police report. Police failure “How did this man who was exiled from the district under the KAAPA return? Even if the KAAPA charges were suspended, the police should have kept an eye on him. The police have become a mute spectator,” he said. According to the police, Shan was allegedly tortured and killed by Jomon and his fellow gangsters. Jomon’s arrest was registered in the case.

This will be done in tandem with other major IT parks, fuelling the growth in the Malabar region, John M. Thomas, CEO, Kerala State IT Parks, told mediapersons here on Thursday. The Cyberpark, which had started with just four companies back in 2014-15, now boasted 65 companies and about 1,100 direct employees. “The existing building, which is predominantly covered under the provisions of the Special Economic Zone, is 75% occupied and is expected to be full by March or April,” he said. Mr. Thomas said that a proposal was before the government for a new non-SEZ IT building with a built-up space of 4 lakh sq.ft. The total investment would come to Rs. 200 crore, providing direct employment to 3,500 persons, he said. Addressing the media, Raveendran Kasthuri, Group CEO, ULCCS Ltd, said that the UL Cyberpark had scripted a growth story of its own over the years. “We now have over 80 companies employing over 2,000 and are eyeing another 1500-odd jobs in the next couple of years. We also reported a remarkable export value of Rs. 37.66 crore in 2020-21. It is a matter of privilege for us to partner with Cyberpark in their efforts to significantly enhance the footprint of Malabar in the success story of Kerala IT,” he said. Mr. Thomas said that the collective revenue through exports from the three IT Parks in the State stood at Rs. 15,100 crore last financial year. “And software exports from the companies operating out of Cyberpark have increased from Rs. 14.76 crore in 2019-20 to Rs. 26.16 crore in 2020-21,” he said. Kozhikode, he said, was poised for even greater growth in the years to come both because of the aggressive expansion plans of the existing IT companies and new ones setting up IT footprint, including home-grown startups. Talent pool, connectivity with access to cities such as Bengaluru and countries in the Middle East had aided in accelerating the growth of the Cyberparks in Kozhikode, both said, adding that the focus was also improving the eco-systems to facilitate major IT firms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-cyberparks-join-hands-to-synergise-operations/article64947885.ece

District Collector N. Tej Lohit Reddy said in an order that this would be applicable to all private, cooperative, and Employees State Insurance hospitals and the Government Medical College Hospital. All of them should ensue that none of the infected persons are denied admission. However, unwanted hospitalisation should be strictly avoided and emergency non-COVID cases should be taken care of without fail, Mr. Reddy said. The Collector directed hospital superintendents to assess the requirement of critical equipment to meet a possible surge in the number of patients and procure them, if needed. The authorities are reported to have taken these decisions in the wake of the spike in cases in the district and a high test positivity rate in many local bodies. COVID bed occupancy in many hospitals is nearing the saturation level. Meanwhile, the outpatient consultation timings at the MCH have been cut by one hour. Only ‘C’ category patients, who are symptomatic and require hospitalisation, would be admitted. Only one caregiver would be allowed to accompany the patients. All the theory classes at the medical college would be in online mode. Principal V.R.

Some of the teachers claimed that most of the affiliated colleges do not have facilities to take printed copies of the question papers in large numbers. Most of the printers are too slow in dispensing with copies. More costly printers would have to be bought. It is still not clear who would bear the cost for all these. Added to this is the chance of power failures during the process. They claimed that the online distribution of question papers for postgraduate (PG) courses earlier had miserably failed. Every day, the exams started very late and ended late. Now, all colleges have more number of UG courses and thousands more would be writing the exams every day as there would be regular students, those under the distance education scheme, and students appearing for supplementary exams. The teachers are also concerned about losing the secrecy of the process when a large number of copies are taken simultaneously from different printers. Functionaries of the Kerala Private College Teachers’ Association, a pro-Congress organisation, in a letter to the Vice Chancellor, said that downloading question papers just one-and-a-half-hours before the beginning of the exam, taking copies and then arranging them for distribution among students would take a long time. It would invariably delay the exams. Network failures would also pose problems, they said. Lakshmi R. Chandran, Senate member, in another letter to the VC said that colleges in rural areas were facing lack of technical facilities. It would put the college authorities under pressure. She alleged that no discussions had been held ahead of the move to make question paper distribution online. It would also put the financial burden of holding the exams on affiliated colleges.

In a letter, KMPGA functionaries urged the DME to spare junior and senior resident doctors from COVID-19 duty. They pointed out that most of the government hospitals in the periphery were not admitting infected persons. As a result, a bulk of the patients are being referred to and admitted in medical college hospitals. If this condition continues, there will be a dire need for more health workers in COVID-19 wards and intensive care units. The KMPGA functionaries sought decentralisation of COVID-19 care from government medical college hospitals, which are also academic training institutes. New doctors, non-academic junior and senior resident doctors, and intensivist medical officers should be appointed to cover COVID-19 duties instead of depending only on academic resident doctors, they added. ‘Cannot spare time’ They claimed that junior resident doctors were in the forefront of the pandemic management along with professors and other healthcare staff during the first two waves. Then, not much was known about the infection, the administration did not have time to arrange alternative facilities. There was a time when a third of the academic days in a month had to be devoted for COVID-19 duty. This affected the training of junior resident doctors. “Our academic schedule is already fixed by the university [Kerala University of Health Sciences] and taking even more COVID-19 duties again would lead to loss of academic days and training. We are at a stage where we cannot afford to compromise anymore time,” the KMPGA leaders said. They claimed that the resident doctors were concerned about the preparation for exams, submission of thesis, and completion of other academic work that are needed to become specialist doctors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/medicos-seek-exemption-from-covid-duty/article38300972.ece

Mr. Rijulal said that printing centres outside Kerala had informed that it would be difficult to print question papers and distribute them on time. About one-and-a-half month would be required to print the question paper for one subject. Because of the pandemic restrictions, delivery of parcels from outside the State to five districts under the university would be difficult. He claimed that the PG exams could be held successfully after question papers were distributed online. Around 100 teachers in colleges had been trained and exam superintendents had been given user IDs and passwords. Security features Mr. Rijulal said that either the college Principal or chief superintendent can download the papers with watermarks from the college portal. There are security features to avoid leakage. The university had instructed colleges to buy high-speed printers earlier itself. A similar system had been already implemented in APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University and Mahatma Gandhi University, he added.

The celebrations were abandoned in view of a spurt in COVID-19 cases. It was on January 21, 1922, that the British police executed Kunhahamed Haji at Kottakkunnu here and burnt his body along with all his belongings. Some historians, however, claim that the execution had taken place on January 20, 1922. Many programmes “We had planned extensive programmes, including a mega gathering at Kottakkunnu, as part of celebrating the centenary of Haji’s martyrdom. But COVID-19 has forced us to cut them short,” said C.P. Abdul Wahab, secretary of the Chakkiparamban Family Association. Gathering in school However, the family will commemorate their legendary freedom fighter by gathering at AMLP School, Valluvangadu, Pandikkad, where Haji had his elementary education. Sayed Munwwarali Shihab Thangal will inaugurate the gathering to be held as per COVID-19 protocol at 4 p.m. on Friday. A programme to be held at Eerattupetta, Kottayam, on January 26 in celebration of the Republic Day and Haji’s martyrdom was also cancelled. “We are postponing the programme to May,” said K.N. Jaffer, one of the grandchildren of Variyamkunnath. The Mapila hero’s father Moindeenkutty Haji had migrated from Malabar to Erattupetta because of British harassment. Haji’s descendants at Eerattupetta had conducted a tour in the trail of his struggle against the British on January 5, marking the centenary of his capture by the British. It was on January 6, 1922, that Haji was caught by the British through treachery from Chokad and brought to Malappuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/martyrdom-centenary-of-variyamkunnath-today/article38300973.ece

However, the huge spike in cases overnight was a result of the increase in testing by over 23,000 samples. The State tested 1,15,357 samples in 24 hours. A comparison At the peak of the Delta wave, the State had nearly 4.5 lakh active cases, of whom over 37,000 were hospitalised. ICUs had close to 2,800 patients, and ventilators, 1,500-odd patients. In comparison, now, even when 46,387 new cases have been recorded, the number of patients hospitalised is just over 7,000, with fewer than 900 persons in ICUs. However, if the case graph continues to rise at this pace, the other metrics could also reach a critical point soon. While it was expected that the daily caseload during the Omicron wave would cross the peak caseload of the Delta wave, it seems to have happened much sooner. Public health experts are not surprised and pointed out that as community transmission was rampant, more tests would naturally detect more positive cases. Home test kit The numbers detected now could still be an underestimation as a good number of people would be asymptomatic, while there would be another chunk who might have preferred to use a home test kit and isolate themselves at home. The State’s active case pool is moving close to two lakh mark, with 1,99,041 patients, adding over 1.80 lakh cases in two weeks. Of these, 3% are currently admitted in hospitals. The Health department’s data said that during January 13-19, hospitalisations increased by 70% and ICU occupancy by 48%, in comparison to the previous week. A total of 15,388 persons were reported to have recovered on Thursday. The rise in hospitalisations over the past one week could emerge as a cause for concern, going by the exponential manner in which the case graph has been rising. On Thursday, the number of patients who newly entered the hospitals rose from 1,094 to 1,337. Total number of patients admitted with COVID in hospitals has risen from 6,203 to 7,193. ICU and ventilator occupancy are rising in proportion to the increase in hospitalisation. On Thursday, ICU occupancy of COVID patients showed a jump from 790 to 838. Those requiring ventilator support also went up from 175 to 204. The official cumulative COVID-19 case fatality now stands at 51,501, with the State adding 341 deaths to the official list of COVID deaths on Thursday. These include 32 deaths which occurred in the past few days and 309 deaths which have now been accepted as COVID deaths by the government as per the new guidelines of the Centre and following the appeals filed by families. Thiruvananthapuram reported the highest number of new cases at 9,720, followed by Ernakulam 9,605, Kozhikode 4,016, Thrissur 3,627, Kottayam 3,091, Kollam 3002, Palakkad 2,268, Malappuram 2,259, Kannur 1,973, Alappuzha 1,926, Pathanamthitta 1,497, Idukki 1,441, Kasaragod 1,135 and Wayanad 827.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-case-graph-hits-a-new-record/article64947750.ece

Termed ‘Guidelines for Foster Care in Kerala, 2021,’ it details the procedures for foster care and role of stakeholders, among other aspects related to implementation of foster care in the State. According to the guidelines, children whose parents are unable to take care of them, children of all age groups living in child care institutions, children whose relatives are willing to take care of them, children in child care insitutions who have not been declared legally free for adoption (LFA), children in the 6-8 age group who do not get a family in adoption within a period of two years after they are declared LFA, those in the 8-18 age group who are LFA but have not been selected by any prospective adoptive parent for one year, and children with special needs who do not get a family within one year after they are declared LFA will be eligible for adoption. Indian citizens The criteria for selection of foster family include the stipulation that both spouses must be Indian citizens in the 35-65 age group and in good physical, mental, and emotional health. They must be willing to foster the same child, should have an income with which they are able to meet the needs of the child, and should not have any criminal conviction or indictment. To take more than one child into foster care, consent of foster parents and of the first foster child is needed. Pre-foster care counselling should be given to prospective foster parents for taking up responsibility of foster parenthood. Foster care assessment report and home study should be conducted. A child and the foster parents selected should be given the opportunity to spend time together before the placement. In the case of group foster care, the facility should be recognised as fit, the medical fitness of the care givers should be ensured, and a family-like environment rather than an institutional feel should be provided.  If the foster parents need financial support, the District Child Protection Unit ( DCPU) should convene sponsorship and foster care approval committees and take steps to provide maximum of Rs. 2,000 for a child per month in a joint account of the child and the parent.  A quarterly enquiry should be done to verify that the placement is in the best interests of the child. Termination norms The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) can start termination of foster care if the biological parent is fit to take care of the child and seeks custody, if an LFA child while in foster care finds an adoptive family, if the foster family is not willing to continue with foster care, child has been subjected to any kind of abuse or neglect in the foster home, misappropriation of foster care assistance for the child, disruption caused by death, divorce, or separation of foster parents, or the child attains the age of 18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-guidelines-for-foster-care/article38301023.ece

Rajan on Thursday sought to quash the public’s fear that the cancellation of 532 ‘illegitimate’ title deeds in Idukki would render hundreds of settler farmers in the rugged district landless. He said no ‘eligible person or legitimate entity’ would lose their land due to the government’s decision to cancel the dubious ‘Raveendran pattayams’ issued in 1999. Former deputy tahsildar of Devikulam M. A. Raveendran had distributed the ‘questionable deeds’. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and Communist Party of India (CPI) in Idukki had protested against the controversial decision to cancel the deeds. CPI(M) legislator M.M. Mani said the party would oppose evictions and dared the district administration to ‘touch’ the CPI(M) party office in Idukki. Mr. Rajan said the previous Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had found that glaring procedural irregularities had tainted the issuance of the ‘Raveendran pattayams’ and, consequently, rendered the property deeds legally invalid. Farmers’ plight Settler farmers who benefitted from Mr. Raveendran’s ‘largesse’ were soon dismayed that they could not sell their land or put up the property as collateral for bank loans. “They could not even cremate or bury their dear ones in the Raveendran pattayam land,” Mr. Rajan said. Subsequently, the government constituted a committee to examine the legality of the questionable title deeds. The committee found that most deed holders were eligible settler farmers and not illegal encroachers. Hence, the government resolved to cancel the ‘Raveendran pattayams’ and issue valid title deeds in their stead. The government also asked the District Collector, Idukki, to examine, on a case by case basis, the reason and circumstance that justified, if at all, the issuance of the "doubtful" title deeds. Mr. Rajan sought to rest the controversy that the cancellation of the title deeds would strip the CPI(M) and the CPI of their district offices and land in Idukki. He said the cancellation of the title deeds would not imperil party offices or land. CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan reiterated no resident or lawful entity would lose their land. Mr. Balakrishnan said the LDF government was committed to providing land to the landless and not rendering more people homeless. The administration would distinguish between encroachers and landless persons and act accordingly. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan demanded that the government cancel the suspicious ‘Raveendran pattayams’ in their entirety and without showing any political favouritism. He alleged the ‘dishonest’ title deeds had mostly advantaged private land developers, real estate lobbies, land grabbers and resort owners.  Glaring procedural irregularities were found in the issuance of the ‘Raveendran pattayams’ K.

In our ongoing weekly COVID meetings in Kochi, doctors meet up to discuss, brainstorm, and share knowledge and experience. In our last meeting, it was observed that the number of people testing positive is beyond what was ever seen before. Interestingly, they included even asymptomatic bystanders who had come in to help out with their relatives’ surgery and thus got tested. This shows the amazing spreading power of the variant. On the ground, there appears to be widespread infection rates among past infected as well as vaccinated individuals, including those who have received boosters. Thus, this variant has enormous immune escape potential. Besides, systemic vaccines (given intramuscularly) are not known to elicit adequate mucosal immunity. That said, it is not clear whether mucosal immunity is even possible for the coronavirus, which is a family of viruses that are known for recurrent or repeated infections every few months. As far as the Omicron variant goes, the reasons for its apparent reduction in severity is two-fold. Firstly, unlike Delta, Omicron is arriving at a time when a vast majority of adults are already vaccinated, among whom several have had natural infections, in addition. Thus, it is no longer a novel virus to humanity. This means that our adaptive response system, which is our second arm of immune response, which includes T cells, is able to respond faster. This is because there is long-lasting immune memory. (As told to G. Krishnakumar; for full report, visit www.thehindu.com)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/number-of-infected-beyond-what-was-ever-seen-before/article64947760.ece

Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Veerraju alleged that the YSRCP leaders were indulging in rampant exploitation of the mineral wealth. He said sand had become a luxury for the poor and downtrodden sections in the State. “If voted to power, the BJP will provide not only provide sand free of cost but also arrange its free transportation to the downtrodden sections. Steps will be taken to provide fine rice at Rs. 30 a kg to the underprivileged,” he said.

The infections, which were confined to the urban areas in the first week of January, have now begun to spread in the rural areas as well. While the two municipal corporations of Tirupati and Chittoor and six municipalities of Srikalahasti, Nagari, Puttur, Punganur, Palamaner, and Madanapalle saw 1,036 cases, the district’s rural side reported 1,302 cases. With the rise in COVID infections, a worrying trend has emerged in the district. Officials have observed that people are purchasing medicines directly from the medical shops without prescriptions. The trend is seen more in rural areas, particularly those that border with Tamil Nadu. Officials on COVID-19 duties said that though prompt arrangements were made at all Primary Health Centres(PHCs), area hospitals to conduct the COVID tests, some were hesitant to undergo the test. “They are instead rushing to medical shops if they develop the COVID symptoms.. Self-medication is being indulged in by people in a big way even though they do not know if they are infected or not. This will have an adverse impact sometimes,” a senior medical officer said. “Why take risk going to a testing centre when cases are peaking? It is better to take medicines,” said a 60-year-old man at Nagari, purchasing medicines for his 55-year-old spouse who has symptoms of fever and cough. Misconception The task force officials said that there is a misconception among the public that taking antibiotics, zinc, and vitamin C doses, when experiencing the symptoms, would bring down the infection, and then there would be no need for going for a COVID test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/self-medication-for-covid-a-worrying-trend-in-rural-chittoor/article64947854.ece

His affidavit in 2016 reported a consolidated asset ownership of Rs. 1.60 crore. In April 2021, his affidavit reported a manifold jump in asset ownership to Rs. 23.03 crore. The DVAC, with the declared information, computed the quantum of acquisitions vis-à-vis known sources of income, savings, and expenditure, and “likely savings” during the ‘check period’ of its enquiry, namely April 2016 to March 2021, and arrived at a disproportionate asset acquisition of over Rs. 11.32 crore by Mr. Anbalagan. This aside, the DVAC’s enquiry revealed Mr. Anbalagan’s other undisclosed properties/businesses run under various names. These include various stone quarries in Dharmapuri in the names of his son-in-law, a brother-in-law, and a close associate; and a granite firm by name M/s Ganesh Granite, located at Avvai Shanmugam Road, Gopalapuram, Chennai incorporated under the name of his niece and her husband(sister’s daughter Deepa and son-in-law N.Sivakumar). Sivakumar is also 80% holding partner in another granite firm in Karimnagar district of Telangana. In a separate statement, the DVAC cited a petition filed by a N. Krishnamoorthy before the Madras High Court seeing a direction to the anti-corruption agency to investigate his earlier petition to the DVAC alleging amassment of wealth by Mr. Anbalagan. Simultaneously, the DVAC was conducting its own enquiry and based on the information collected, a case was registered. In Dharmapuri, besides Mr. Anbalagan’s house at Keragondahalli in Karimangalam, the house of the sitting AIADMK MLA of Paapireddipatti, A. Govindasamy, was raided.

The submission was made by S. Manu, Assistant Solicitor General of India (ASG), when a few writ petitions against the survey being conducted for the project came up for hearing before Justice Devan Ramachandran. The ASG further submitted that the KRDCL had been advised to provide detailed technical documents such as alignment plan, particulars of railway land and private land, cross over of the existing railway network, and affected railway assets for the detailed examination of the project.

In-principal nod Senior government pleader T.B. Hood submitted that the DPR was prepared based on an aerial survey. It was conducted through the government agency Kerala Remote Sensing and Environmental Centre for identifying land for the project. In fact, the project had been given in-principle approval by the Railway Board. A 2016 official memo of the Union Finance Ministry said that once the in-principle approval was given to a project, all further steps, including land acquisition proceedings, should be taken. The court ordered that the steps for the survey of properties of the petitioners in the cases before the court be deferred till the next posting date.

The girl was found dead at her house at Tenhipalam on Thursday. Her mother said that the girl had attempted suicide many times before and that her requests to the authorities to give treatment and counselling to the girl had fallen on deaf ears. “None cared for my daughter,” she said. The girl had been raped by several men and three cases were registered at the Feroke police station under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The rape had taken place when they lived near Feroke in Kozhikode. Another case for sexual abuse was also registered at the Kondotty police station. The girl had lived with her mother and younger brother at different places, including Feroke and Kondotty. She had been abused by several people, including her cousins, over a long period of time. The police said they had mentioned the vulnerability of the girl’s family in their chargesheets. They said they had recommended treatment and counselling to the girl. The authorities responsible for the protection of children, including the District Child Protection Officer, in Kozhikode said they had not been alerted about the need for counselling to the girl. Meanwhile, several questions were raised on Thursday about how the girl was allowed to rejoin her vulnerable family. The Child Welfare Committee and the District Child Protection Officer are responsible for ensuring the safety of the victim in any POCSO case.

The boat had seven fishermen from Ramanathapuram on board. However, after they raised a distress alarm, another fishing boat rescued them. According to president of All Mechanised Boat Fishermen’s Association, P. Sesuraja, 450 fishing boats from Rameswaram ventured into the Bay of Bengal around 3 p.m. on Wednesday.“These days, our fishermen are going out for fishing only for two days a week, fearing arrest/attack by the Sri Lankan Navy,” he said. When the fishermen, on board a mechanised boat, were fishing near Katchatheevu, a Sri Lankan naval ship rammed it around 10.30 p.m. “The boat developed cracks and water started entering it. When it started sinking, the naval ship left,” Mr. Sesuraja said. However, the boat’s occupants alerted fellow fishermen over a walkie-talkie, and all of them were rescued by another fishing boat. Mr. Sesuraja said the livelihood of Tamil Nadu fishermen had been badly hit due to frequent attacks and arrests by the Sri Lankan Navy.“We have been demanding that the Centre and the State make efforts to facilitate talks between the fishermen of India and Sri Lanka to arrive at a peaceful solution,” he added.

Teachers, in response to the call given by the Federation of Andhra Pradesh Teachers’ Organisations (FAPTO), a conglomeration of several teacher unions, headed to the Collectorates to participate in the demonstrations. They were, however, arrested by the police on their way to the protest venues and shifted to police stations. In Machilipatnam, all routes leading to the Collectorate were barricaded up to a distance of 500 metres. Almost all the streets were filled with the sloganeering demonstrators, and the police started arresting them from different points from 8.30 a.m. In some districts, teacher leaders and others were detained at their homes. Andhra Pradesh Teachers’ Federation president K. Bhanu Murthy and general secretary P. Panduranga Varaprasad condemned the “undemocratic” arrests of teachers. “We are being prevented from making our voice heard. Even the women teachers have been dragged and bundled into police vans,” said Mr. Varaprasad. He said contrary to Chief Secretary Sameer Sharma’s claim on considerable dip in the State revenues, the CAG report states that the revenue had gone up. “The Pay Revision Commission has been turned into a ‘pay reversion committee’ now,” he said, alleging that the Chief Secretary’s press conference called to pacify the employees was “full of lies.” The leaders said the federation and the employees’ JACs, which had also called for a State-wide demonstration on Friday, would collectively stage protest against the government move. “If the government fails to consider our demands, we will not hesitate to escalate it into an indefinite protest,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/teachers-take-to-the-streets-against-prc/article64947528.ece

Schools have reopened after Sankranti holidays but many concerned parents are holding their children back at home, away from physical classes fearing spread of the infection. “COVID cases are on the rise in the apartment we live in. It’s the same everywhere,” says Sabbineni Suresh, a banker, whose son Nanda Kishore is a sixth grader. Gopisetti Nikitha echoes similar concerns over sending her 12-year-old daughter to school amidst increasing number of COVID cases. “The Sankranti festival seems to have further contributed to the burgeoning infections,” she says. The first and second waves of the pandemic kept children out of schools for a prolonged period and experts have been raising concerns over the multi-pronged impact of it on the young minds. As far as the issue of running the schools amidst the pandemic is concerned, the government is on a sticky wicket. It is constantly attacked by the Opposition party leaders who have been demanding closure of schools in the wake of the increasing virus infections across the 13 districts of the State. TDP general secretary, Nara Lokesh, in a letter addressed to the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, urged him to order closure of all educational institutions in the larger interests of the students. The Pradesh Congress Committee president Sake Sailajanath too has found fault with the government decision to continue schools amidst raging pandemic. Representatives of various teacher unions are also trying to drive their point home that schools cannot be run at the cost of the children’s health safety. But the government is determined to do the balancing act- run the schools by strictly adhering to the COVID protocol by throwing a safety net around school campuses. “In the given circumstances, the easiest thing for us to do would be to close down the schools. But, there has to be a rationale behind our actions,” said the Commissioner, School Education Department, Suresh Kumar.  Speaking to The Hindu , he said huge loss of the academic hours cannot be compensated. Online classes, he reminds, would not serve the purpose as only as very small percentage of the students have access to the required technology.  Other officials in the department also maintain that there is no evidence to show that schools have turned into a hotspot of COVID infections. “In fact, children attending physical classes amidst the tight safety net thrown around school campuses are safer than they are at home,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-challenge-a-tightrope-walk-for-school-authorities/article38300765.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy in employees’ PRC issue to arrive at an amicable solution. In a statement, PDF MLCs V. Balasubramanyam, K.S. Lakshman Rao, Y. Srinivasulu Reddy, Illa Venkateswara Rao and Shaik Sabji said the massive protests staged by teachers across the State reflected their anger at the ‘undemocratic” manner in which the government was conducting itself. They said the government should realise why lakhs of teachers, including women, hit the roads in such large numbers. They demanded that the government withdraw the G.O.s on PRC and that the Chief Minister hold talks with the representatives of employees associations in a democratic way and arrive at a solution agreeable to both the sides. CPS They said the PRC was not the only issue where the government had backtracked. Same was the case with the Contributory Pension Scheme. Because of the government’s unilateral stand and autocratic attitude, employees had to battle it out even for their basic rights, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pdf-leaders-urge-cm-to-solve-prc-issue-amicably/article38301333.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:58 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||NRTiCON Towers: HC issues notices to APNRTS, APRERA and a private bank||A single-judge Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, comprising Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu, on Thursday ordered that notices be served on the A.P. Non-Resident Telugu Society (APNRTS), A.P. Real Estate Regulatory Authority (APRERA), and a private bank with regard to their consideration to forfeit the earnest money deposits made by 18 NRIs towards the purchase of flats in NRTiCON Towers proposed to be constructed in Amaravati. The matter was posted for further hearing on February 4. A majority of them belong to the Krishna and Guntur districts and are currently staying in the U.S. They appealed to the court to direct the respondents to refund the amounts paid by them, along with an annual interest of 24% from the date of payments, and consequently to order that the amounts should not be withdrawn or utilised. The petitioners alleged that the government lacked the intention to develop Amaravati and for that reason, it shelved projects such as the NRTiCON, which was duly registered with the RERA. While not being open about their intentions, the respondents took the capricious stand that the project was still on and the petitioners had defaulted. In fact, the NRTS and other proponents abandoned the project and did not want to return the money paid by the petitioners, it was alleged. The AP-Capital Region Development Authority had initially allotted five acres to the project in November 2017. “Even if Amaravati is continued as the capital of A.P., it will not continue with the same magnitude and grandeur. The intention can be inferred from the actions of the State and its ancillaries, both Executive and Legislature. The iconic tower can never be constructed,” one of the petitioners observed in an affidavit. Senior advocate Jandhyala Ravi Shankar argued on behalf of the petitioners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nrticon-towers-hc-issues-notices-to-apnrts-aprera-and-a-private-bank/article38301075.ece

The teachers also threatened to give a strike notice if the government failed to roll back the G.O.s by Thursday evening. Raising slogans against the State government, the teachers tried to barge into the Collectorate. However, their bid was stalled by the police personnel who were deputed in large numbers. The teachers then staged a sit-in protest and continued to raise slogans against the government and the PRC before the Collectorate. A large number of women also took part in the protest. “The government did not consider our demands as per the Ashutosh Mishra Committee report for the 11th PRC, but instead appeared to have heeded the recommendations made by IAS officers, who seem to be anti-employee,” the unions alleged. The State Government did not even meet the unions before announcing the PRC, they said. Some of the teachers alleged that the prices of essential commodities, house rents and other expenses have increased over the last few years. But probably for the first time, fitments are given less than the Interim Relief (IR). The State Government is also trying to reduce House Rent Allowance (HRA).

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:58 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cultural outfits up in arms against ban on ‘Chintamani’||The Andhra Pradesh government’s ban on 100-year-old ‘Chintamani Natakam’ has triggered a row with the cultural organisations opposing it and terming it as an “attack on the freedom of the artistes, and culture and traditions of the State.” Following a request from the members of the Arya Vysya community, the government, through G.O. No. 7 issued by Rajat Bhargava, Special Chief Secretary (Culture, Tourism and Youth), had banned the staging of the play recently. Their contention was that a character in the play, Subbisetty, a trader, had been portrayed negatively, hurting the sentiments of the community members. The play highlights the age-old social evil, prostitution, and Subbisetty’s characterisation as one who loses his wealth to it, is what is being opposed now. Endowments Minister V. Srinivasa Rao had said in a statement that the government took the decision following the objection raised by the Arya Vaisyas, who argued that the community as a whole was belittled. The portrayal had raised the hackles of the Arya Vysyas during the centenary celebrations of the play organised in Eluru last year, after which they had taken up the issue with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Though the community leaders had expressed their happiness over the ban, the cultural organisations continued their protests both in Vizinagaram and Srikakulam districts. The play, which was written by Kallakuri Narayana Rao in 1920, was aimed at weaning people away from the social evil. The story revolves around the character, ‘Chintamani’, who seduces people. Another character in the play, ‘Bilavamangalam’, ignores his wife and visits Chintamani’s house frequently. His friend, ‘Bhavani Sankaram’, encourages him, which ultimately leads to his downfall. ‘Subbisetty’ too is a victim as he loses all his property and respect in society. Noted actor Bhanumathi Ramakrishna had acted in the movie, ‘Chintamani’, that was released in 1956. While actor N.T. Rama Rao had played the role of ‘Bilvamangalam’, another actor Relangi Venkataramaiah played the role of ‘Subbsietty’. Though the play was very popular, it was alleged that the organisers had changed Subbisetty’s dialogues, which were allegedly vulgar, to attract more audience. To mark the centenary of the play, a few cultural organisations had staged the play at several places in the district. Vizianagaram Zilla Poura Vedika chairman and president of Dr. P.V.G. Raju Kala Vedika Bhisetti Babji said banning the play was highly deplorable.  “The aim of the play is to eradicate social evils. The realisation that dawns on Chintamani is a clear indication that the play’s motto is good. Instead of banning the play, the government should have directed the organisers not to defame Subbisetty’s character as it has offended a particular community,” Mr. Babji told The Hindu .  Along with Mr. Babji, several representatives staged a protest in Vizianagaram to step up pressure on the government to revoke the ban. Arya Vysya InternationalFederation senior vice-president Perla Mahesh welcomed the ban. “There is a systematic attack on the community under the guise of staging ‘Chintamani Natakam’. Those who are unable to digest the fame and success of the community are trying to portray it in bad light. That is why, we welcomed the ban on the play though we have no objection to the original content in the book,” said Mr. Mahesh||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cultural-outfits-up-in-arms-against-ban-on-chintamani/article64947533.ece

The local people had noticed the statue peeping out partially in a farmland, a few months ago. With the help of an earthmover, they unearthed a 12-ft-tall statue.

When The Hindu contacted Kumar H.C., curator of the Archaeology Museum in Hassan, the officer said he had not got information about the statue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/12-foot-statue-unearthed/article38301050.ece

Teams of Health department accompanied by Municipal Administration personnel in urban areas and Panchayat Raj staff in rural areas will visit every doorstep to check whether the inmates have symptoms of COVID-19. They will carry testing kits as well as home isolation kits for distribution among those found with symptoms of the virus. “The government has kept two crore testing kits and one crore home isolation kits ready. Though there is shortage of the kits in the market, their availability was ensured with the advanced planning by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao,” Health Minister Harish Rao said. Kits have been positioned at all levels right from major government hospitals to primary health care centres and ANM managed sub-centres at the village level and those found with symptoms could make use of them for speedy recovery. Review meeting Mr. Harish Rao along with Panchayat Raj Minister E. Dayakar Rao, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and other senior officials conducted a detailed review of the situation across the State on Thursday. The review covered various aspects like preparedness of the hospitals, availability of medicine and equipment as well as beds in different hospitals. The Minister gave specific instructions to District Collectors to be prepared to tackle any eventuality as the government had already kept ready necessary infrastructure. The Minister said the survey had been contemplated as people were not coming forward for testing in spite of showing symptoms of the virus. “Instead of asking people to come to the testing centres, we have decided to take the facility to their door step. This will also ensure that there is no scope for spread of the virus because of the gathering,” he said exhorting the elected representatives at different levels to actively take part in the survey and ensure total coverage of the population. He said there were 27,000 beds equipped with oxygen supply in the 56,000 beds available across the State. As many as 76 government hospitals had oxygen generation plants at present. Availability of oxygen too had been significantly enhanced from around 120 metric tonne of the pre-Covid stage to over 340 metric tonne at present. Steps had been initiated to enhance availability of oxygen further to 500 MT in line with the instructions given by the Chief Minister. In addition, facilities like ventilators had been provided at district and mandal levels to ensure that people need not rush to the State Capital or urban centres like in the past. “The government is ready to tackle the situation. We have made all the arrangements,” Mr. Harish Rao averred. Stating that the State had witnessed 102 per cent administration of the first dose of the vaccine, he said the coverage under second dose was 77 per cent. The collectors were accordingly directed to identify the areas where the administration of second dose was delayed and speed up the process. Steps should also be taken to administer booster dose to eligible following the ICMR guidelines issued in this regard. ‘Reduce time gap’ To a question, the Minister said the State had requested the Centre to reduce the time gap between administration of first dose and second dose as it was taking too long. This was one of the reasons why the administration of the second dose was taking time. This apart, the Centre was asked to allow administration of booster dose to all people irrespective of the age group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telangana-begins-fever-survey-to-assess-intensity-of-covid-cases/article64947781.ece

The adverse impact of COVID -19 is still hunting the organisation, said the Minister. Talking to mediapersons here on Thursday, Mr. Ajay Kumar said that the TSRTC is making only half of the earnings due to COVID–19 and that it would take some more time for the organisation to come to normalcy. Referring to the Metro Rail, the Minister said that the government is ready to extend a helping hand to it. A decision will be taken based on Cabinet Sub-Committee report, he said. “Metro Rail will not be in losses if about 4 lakh passengers travel every day. It has failed to use the lands allotted to it,” commented Mr. Ajay Kumar. Answering a question the Minister said that there are no differences in the party unit of Khammam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rtc-yet-to-come-out-of-losses-says-minister/article64947777.ece

Many students from these colleges have topped the PG entrance exams in various subjects as well,” reveals R. Limbadri, Chairman, Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE). These colleges are now the source for academically strong girl students aspiring for PG courses, and in a way expediting the women’s university decision. Such is the pressure on the Osmania University by the increasing strength of girl students that the varsity has decided to convert the newly constructed boys hostel into a girls hostel. The hostel being constructed in front of the Institute of Public Enterprise (IPE) as part of the OU Centenary celebrations will now be turned into a full-fledged girls hostel accommodating more than 500 students. According to Prof. Limbadri girl students in the postgraduate courses have spiralled over the last two years with the number touching as high as 80% in some departments. Overall, the girl students have touched near 50% in PG courses. So it makes an obvious case for a women’s university, which was due for Telangana after the Padmavathi Mahila University in Tirupati went into Andhra Pradesh kitty after the bifurcation. A women’s university, according to senior professors, will also send a positive signal to the conservative parents from rural areas that their daughters will be much safer in an all women’s university. The University College for Women, Koti, popularly known as Koti Women’s College, has all the credentials to acquire the university status offering 19 undergraduate courses and 20 postgraduate courses with 29 and 17 departments respectively. It also offers certificate and self-financed courses to about 4,175 students on rolls. The college is spread over 42 acres and is much bigger in area than all private universities in Telangana. Unlike other new universities in Telangana it is already offering 55 courses under the Bucket System in BA and B.Com apart from unique courses at the post graduate level like food and nutrition, and pharmaceutical and medical related courses that are in huge demand. The demand for a separate women’s university is not new and in fact, the government proposed to sanction money for the establishment of the university four years ago. With the college all set to complete 100 years in 2024 converting it into an exclusive women’s university will be a fitting tribute to the women who strove for women’s higher education 100 years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/new-colleges-trigger-womens-varsity-decision/article64947770.ece

Needless to mention the emotional and financial distress of family members if such a thing happens. But, the question remains that “Is the current COVID wave gradually turning milder and relieving people from distress?” Well, if one goes by the recent scenario at hospitals, a large number of COVID patients are opting for Out-Patient (OP) consultations as they have mild symptoms. General physicians and pulmonologists are saying that such patients are recovering in 5-7 days. However, the observation is not devoid of a rider and a strong caution is not to let down your guard. Also, even mild symptoms are a cause of discomfort with headaches and body aches for a few days. Other milder symptoms include scratchy throat, nose block, mild cough or cold. Neglect at your own peril Some patients who had high grade fever for more than five days, and severe cold, but did not go to a doctor and did not take proper medication, landed in ICUs or needed oxygen support after a few days of the infection. The demand for COVID ICU and oxygen beds across the State have increased from a maximum of 450 and 570 till January 10 to 674 and 1,164 on Thursday. Another reason for the caution is if someone has Delta variant and neglects treatment, the health condition might worsen after a few days or a week after testing positive. This was pointed out by Health department officials earlier. And no one knows about the long term effects of Omicron variant. Senior consultant physician at KIMS Dr. K. Shivaraju, who has been seeing hundreds of COVID patients for the last few weeks, said that most of them had mild symptoms, only a few had loss of smell and taste, and there were less lung infections. “The infection is restricted to the upper respiratory tract in most cases,” he said. The doctor stressed on the role of vaccines in milder infections. Consultant physician at Sunshine Hospital Dr. Tudi Pavan Reddy said that most cases were asymptomatic or mild. “If anyone has high grade fever for seven days, and co-morbidities, they have to consult doctors. Some people are delaying this and that is leading them to ICU admission or oxygen support,” said Dr Pavan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/many-covid-patients-opting-for-op-consultations/article64947782.ece

This village was located at Cheriyal mandal of Siddipet village. There used to be a village in the past which got submerged under a vagu – Gurijakunta Vagu and a tank Krishnamma. After shifting their village to new location nearby the villagers brought some rocks with scriptures. They were found in the fields of new Dommata village by Kolipaka Srinivas, member of Kotha Telangana Charitra. The digitized photos were studied by Ramaraju Haragopal. “Paidimarri Naganayani, a local ruler brought this land donated the village to Brahmins. This was written in Telugu of 14th century,” informed Mr. Srinivas.

However, the number of tests done by them till Thursday were less. Helping Hand Foundation staff conducted 250 Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) on people with symptoms in 10 low-income localities and confirmed the test positivity rate to be around 13%-17%. The NGO members, who organise basti clinics, took up fever surveillance at Hassan Nagar, Shaheen Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, and NS Kunta. A team of volunteers conducted door-to-door survey and asked people with fever to undergo tests. Paramedics conducted RATs. High grade fever (between 100 and 103 degrees) with complaints of cold and cough were reported in children from zero to 10 years. In case of adults, along with fever, other issues reported were body pains, sore throat, headache, and weakness. “Around 95% patients are being managed under home care,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari of Helping Hand Foundation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fever-surveillance-in-slums/article38301116.ece

Group 1 notification has not been issued for close to a decade and it was ridiculous considering that there is a shortage of IAS officers and current officers are holding additional charge of three or even four departments, he pointed out. “This shortage of officers is directly affecting the functioning of the departments and in providing services to the citizens especially to the poor and the downtrodden,” he reminded, in a statement. The lower level posts of junior assistants too are not being filled for several years forcing the administration to function at a tardy pace at the district and mandal levels. It is not enough to fill clerical posts in the secretariat as the services need to be provided at the zonal levels too, he said and warned of taking up an agitation. Road widening Mr. Sanjay Kumar also thanked Prime Minister Modi and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari for approving the Elkaturti-Siddipet (N-765) road widening work in Karimnagar parliamentary constituency, which has been long pending for many years, at a cost of Rs. 578.85 crore. This will ensure total of 63.641 km of road widening works to be undertaken with a toal of three major and 32 minor bridges to be constructed or re-built. The BJP leader met Mr. Gadkari in Delhi to personally thank him for the technical and financial approvals being given for the project as he had been lobbying for the same for the last few months. It is proof to show that Centre was working in ‘good faith’. for development of infrastructure in Telangana. Once the road widening work is completed, it will not only alleviate the travel difficulties of the people of Karimnagar, Siddipet and other places, but also improve the all welfare opportunities for development in those areas, he said. Compensation to ryots In another development, a party delegation led by general secretary G. Premender Reddy, Kisan Morcha president K. K. Sridhar Reddy and others met the Agriculture Commissioner and sought suitable compensation to the farmers who lost their crops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-demands-notification-for-group-1-2-3-posts/article64947775.ece

Tourism Minister V. Srinivas Goud directed officials to take steps to recover dues amounting to several crores of rupees. The Minister said the previous governments had determined the government’s share of revenues at the time of allotment of lands at strategic locations to private players. The promoters who were running the projects successfully generating huge revenues however took to legal recourse citing minor reasons and were not giving the government its due and this was leading to huge revenue loss to the State exchequer. The Minister conducted an elaborate review with senior officials on the issue and directed them to initiate steps to recover the dues at the earliest. He directed the officials to take stringent action against promoters who were found wanting in payment. In addition to looking at legal steps, the officials should ensure that notices were served on them asking why services like water, power and other basic amenities should not be stopped. Officials told the Minister that dues from the Prasad’s I-Max were to the tune of Rs. 27.45 crore and the Jala Vihar Rs. 6.51 cr. Dues from Snow World amounted to Rs. 15.01 cr., Expotel hotel ( Rs. 15.13 cr.), Das Palla Hotel ( Rs. 5.67 cr.) and the golf course promoted by Prajay Engineers Syndicate (Rs. 5.58 cr) and Trident Hotels (Rs. 75.05 cr.)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-takes-serious-view-of-tourism-dues/article38301136.ece

The state of Telangana, home to around 4 crore people is famous for its hospitality, multicultural and pluralistic society. Currently, people from all over the country are migrating as well as reverse migrating to Telangana in search of better economic opportunities, and the state has always lived up to the expectations by providing a sea of opportunities for everyone to prosper,” said Mr Vinod Kumar in his letter. “Geographically, Telangana is a landlocked state and is strategically located interconnecting all parts of the country from North to South and East to west. The consistent growth opportunities offered in all the sectors have been the main attraction for people from all over the country to make Telangana their home. Road connectivity within the state has improved tremendously under the able leadership of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, but unfortunately, rail connectivity has not improved at all. In the past seven years, the Union government has never prioritised the needs of the state in any of its railway budgets so far. The joint venture railway projects with the State government, taken up with much enthusiasm have not moved much, and there are also other projects where detailed surveys were done but works did not begin. Since the formation of the new state, Kothapalli- Manoharabad railway line is the only project that has taken off and is being implemented with major support from the Government of Telangana in terms of free land provision as well as 1/3rd cost contribution,” explained Mr. Vinod Kumar. “The lackadaisical attitude of the Indian railway is clearly evident in the way projects are dealt with in Telangana. The list of the pending projects as well as the shelved projects is attached herewith. The thirteenth section of the AP Reorganisation Act clearly states that ‘The Indian Railways shall, within six months from the appointed day, examine the feasibility of establishing a Rail Coach Factory in the successor State of Telangana and improve rail connectivity in the State and take an expeditious decision thereon’. Unfortunately, no action has been taken regarding this so far. How many more years will this stepmotherly treatment continue? Why must the states beg for their rightful share of resources every single time?” asked Mr. Vinod Kumar adding that progressive states such as Telangana must be encouraged with more resources and rail connectivity for the overall development of the nation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/injustice-to-railway-projects-in-telangana/article64947767.ece

Under the scheme modelled after Rythu Bandhu scheme of the Telangana government, the Central government is transferring Rs. 6,000 annual benefit each to eligible farmers in three instalments. The disbursement this year began by way of 10th instalment since January 1. While the transfer is scheduled to be tentatively closed by the end of February, the data mining conducted by Libtech India has revealed that a large number of eligible farmers have not been receiving either full or partial instalments since the beginning of the scheme in February 2019. From the State, a total of 39,34,691 farmers are registered under the scheme, with an estimated entitlement of Rs. 6,558 crore. Of the total benefit, an estimated Rs. 6,165 crore has been paid and received by the farmers. Technical reasons However, the data crawling operations conducted by the study group could not find details of over 95,000 farmers online for technical reasons. Hence, the data pertaining to remaining 38,39,545 farmers has been proportionately applied to the 95,000 missing farmers too, to arrive at the estimated numbers, members of the study group informed. As per the details shared, an estimated amount of Rs. 393 crore accrued to the 4.7 lakh deprived farmers. The average amount not received by the farmers over the past nine instalments stands at Rs. 8,360 per head. Chakradhar Buddha, representative of Libtech India fixed the blame squarely on official apathy in ensuring bank account linkage. “The payment is based on either bank account or Aadhaar details, and due to the prior existence of Rythu Bandhu scheme, majority of the farmers are linked through bank accounts only the details of which are collated and submitted by Agriculture department. Minor mismatches in account details or inoperative/frozen accounts are resulting in several farmers not receiving the benefit,” Mr. Chakradhar said. According to the study, three lakh farmers have been affected by rejection of bank details and other related issues. Seventy thousand more farmers were denied the facility, owing to ineligibility, and 60,000 due to “action required by the State”. For 40,000 more farmers, Aadhaar number has not been verified. “Officials did not have details of the rejected farmers. If they take interest and ensure that account seeding is properly done, a large number of farmers who have faced rejection due to inaccurate bank details and Aadhaar details will benefit,” Mr. Chakradhar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/47l-farmers-miss-pm-kisan-samman-benefit/article38301131.ece

Revanth Reddy and Jangoan district Congress president Janga Raghava Reddy. Welcoming them into the party, Mr. Revanth Reddy said those joining included followers of Panchayat Raj Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao and worked for his victory in the last elections. Disgusted with the functioning of the government that had failed to fulfil the promises made and the TRS they all joined the Congress with the conviction that the party was going to come to power in the next elections. Mr. Revanth Reddy said no section was happy with the government and the Chief Minister’s dictatorial attitude was not being digested by the people. The CM never has time to pay a visit to the farmers when they are in dire straits showcasing his scant concern for them. Whether it’s the paddy issue or the crops lost in the unseasonal rains Chief Minister has always ignored the farmers, he alleged. The Congress chief also accused the TRS of colluding with the BJP in denying the paddy farmers their rights and instead of being concerned with their plight both the political parties have created a fake fight between themselves ultimately pushing the real issue behind. Similarly, GO 317 was a result of the BJP government’s nod to the TRS government’s appeal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/followers-of-errabelli-join-congress/article38301135.ece

Promising tool ‘RNA interference (RNAi)’ is a gene silencing approach and a promising tool for targeted and focused therapy for chronic diseases like cancer. The lack of safe and effective delivery methods for RNAi molecules is one of the key challenges against using RNAi-based therapy in biological systems. CCMB’s Dr. Lekha Dinesh Kumar and her group in collaboration with NCL’s polymer science and engineering division have developed nano-curcumin structures (derived from turmeric) to encapsulate the RNAi and other molecules that aid in targeting specific tissues. The proposed bio-drug is bio-compatible with a higher uptake efficiency, and shows effective site-specific delivery with regression of tumors in two different mouse models of colon and breast cancer. “The use of curcumin, a well-known nutraceutical with high anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties with RNAi, showed tumor retardation with six months survival in aggressive models of colon and breast cancer,” says Dr. Kumar. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and the quest to find plausible therapeutic interventions to replace non-specific chemo drugs has been leading to the development of novel strategies to combat cancer. This work has been published in the journal ‘Nanoscale’. In another study with the School of Nanosciences, Central University, Gujarat and Centre for Advanced Materials and Industrial Chemistry, RMIT Australia, they designed an eco-friendly and pH-responsive dietary fibre inulin-based nanodevice to target colon cancer. This device suggests the possibility of substituting synthetic substances with natural compounds in bio-drug formulations for better bio-degradability, tissue accumulation, and lesser toxicity. The results from this work have been published in the journal ‘Nanomedicine’, said an official release. “We have demonstrated that RNAi combined with appropriate targeting agents and encapsulations made of natural biomaterials have high translational capacity in mice models of cancer. This group of bio-drugs can revolutionize cancer therapeutics. But, it should be assessed in other cancer model systems to bring out the utility of these therapeutics in the clinical trials,” she added.  The use of curcumin, a well-known nutraceutical with high anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties with RNAi, showed tumor retardation with six months survival in aggressive models of colon and breast cancer.

Sources said the coal belt region spanning six districts recorded a little over 2,000 COVID cases in the past fortnight. These included SCCL employees like coal workers, several of their family members and outsourced workers, they added. To stem the spread of the coronavirus infections, the SCCL authorities have instructed the General Managers of all the 11 Areas to step up testing and also spraying of the disinfectant solution in the coal mines, various departments and the residential colonies in the coal belt region. Adequate number of rapid testing kits, home isolation kits, masks, and sanitisers have been made available in all the 11 Areas of the company. COVID quarantine centres and a total of 1,578 beds have been kept ready to meet any exigency, sources added. The spurt in COVID cases, albeit mostly mild and asymptomatic, has become a cause of concern for the coal mining giant in view of the surge in cases during the current peak production months at the fag end of the fiscal year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/coal-belt-region-records-over-2000-covid-cases/article64947784.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:07 IST,||Former T.N. Minister Anbalagan booked||Alleging that former Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan and his family members amassed wealth to the tune of Rs. 11.32 crore disproportionate to the known sources of their income between May 2016 and March 2021, sleuths of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) on Thursday conducted searches on multiple premises belonging to them. The agency claimed it had detected unaccounted-for cash of Rs. 2.82 crore, valuables and other incriminating documents. The searches followed an FIR registered by the DVAC against Mr. Anbalagan, his wife A. Malliga, 55, sons A. Sasimohan, 29, A. Chandra Mohan, 32, and Chandra Mohan’s wife S. Vaishnavee, 32. While the AIADMK leader was booked under various Sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, his family members were booked on charges of aiding and abetting in the corruption of his public office. According to the FIR, there was intentional, illicit personal enrichment, acquisition of properties and pecuniary resources in his name and in the names of relatives during the period overlapping with his ministerial tenure. The DVAC had arrived at the quantum of disproportionate acquisition of assets based on the affidavits filed by Mr. Anbalagan in the run-up to the 2016 and 2021 Assembly elections, and also based on “information received from credible sources”. His affidavit in 2016 reported a consolidated asset ownership of Rs. 1.60 crore. In April 2021, his affidavit reported a manifold jump in asset ownership to Rs. 23.03 crore. The DVAC, with the declared information, computed the quantum of acquisitions vis-à-vis known sources of income, savings, and expenditure, and “likely savings” during the ‘check period’ of its enquiry, namely April 2016 to March 2021, and arrived at a disproportionate asset acquisition of over Rs. 11.32 crore by Mr. Anbalagan. This aside, the DVAC’s enquiry revealed Mr. Anbalagan’s other undisclosed properties/businesses run under various names. These include various stone quarries in Dharmapuri in the names of his son-in-law, a brother-in-law, and a close associate; and a granite firm located at Avvai Shanmugam Road, Gopalapuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/former-tn-minister-anbalagan-booked/article38301248.ece

The first two might not be required this time because of the stringent COVID protocol imposed by the Election Commission. But, tears are being copiously shed by candidates who have been denied the party ticket. On Thursday, Mehraj Jahan, an aspirant for the Congress ticket from Muzaffarnagar cried in public after her hopes were dashed. “I have been holding the Congress flag for years but today I feel cheated. As per the 40 % formula, the party should have cleared at least two female candidates for the six seats in the district but it has chosen only one and that too a woman who has joined the party a day before the nomination,” she charged Javed Raeen, another prospective candidate from Barhapur seat in Bijnor, broke down as he shared the news of him being denied the party ticket. “I was present for the party even at midnight and nursed the constituency but have not been found eligible to serve you,” he said in a social media post. Wiping his tears, he said, he respected the decision of the party president. However, Thakur Aditya, a claimant for the SP ticket from Chharra constituency was not so gracious. After pouring some inflammable substance on himself, he alleged that the party robbed him off an opportunity he deserved. He tried to self immolate himself in front of the party headquarters in Lucknow but was saved by the police and bystanders. A party spokesperson, however, denied his charge and said he was planted by the ruling party to malign the party’s image.  The biggest draw in the election tearjerker so far has been Arshad Rana, a Bahujan Samaj Party worker from Muzaffarnagar. Last week, he went to the Kotwali police station to lodge a complaint against the party for taking money from him in lieu of the ticket. “ Mera tamasha bana diya hai (They have turned me into a joke). I have put posters and banners across the constituency and now they have rejected my claim,’ said Mr. Rana, crying copiously. He said he had served the party for 24 years and was promised a ticket from the Charthawal constituency way back in 2018. Perhaps, he has forgotten that BSP was known to change the ticket at the last minute and often prefers turncoats over the party cadre.  Last-minute changes On Wednesday, the party changed candidates from seven seats. In Charthwal, it picked Salman Sayeed, son of former Union Minister Saeeduzzaman who quit Congress to join hands with the BSP last week. Heartbreak is a common theme in the ruling party as well. Senior BJP leader S.K. Sharma cried after being denied a ticket from Mathura’s Maant. “The BJP is no longer the party it once used to be. Dedicated and honest workers are being ignored and robbers are getting everything,” he told the media, wiping off tears. The BSP was quick to field him from Mathura against minister Shrikant Sharma. In Aligarh, many in the cadre were hopeful that they would get the ticket after the sitting BJP MLA Sanjeev Raja was convicted for assaulting a police constable. However, when the party picked his wife Mukta for the Aligarh seat, it dashed the dreams of many.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/heartbreak-tears-before-the-game-of-ballots-in-uttar-pradesh/article64947788.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:06 IST,||Govt. caps RT-PCR test at Rs. 300||The Delhi government has capped the rate of COVID-19 tests at private labs and hospitals. “The rates for conventional RT-PCR and RAT test for COVID-19 in Delhi by private labs has been reduced. The price cap for RT-PCR test has been set at Rs. 300 and the price for home collection of samples have been set at Rs. 500. Price for Rapid Antigen Test has been set at Rs. 100,” Health Minister Satyendar Jain tweeted on Thursday. Decline in cases The Minister also said that the peak of the current wave seems to have passed. “Delhi was witnessing up to 28,000 cases a day and now it has reduced to half of it. Positivity rate too had gone beyond 30% and it is now 22%-23%. It seems that the peak has passed and the day when 28,000 cases were reported can be considered as Delhi’s peak,” the Minister said. Fewer tests When asked about the fall in the number of tests, he said, “Compared to other States, we are testing three times more according to the population. We are testing 10 times more than U.P. We are testing more than ICMR recommendations. We are not denying tests to anyone.” About easing restrictions, he said it cannot be said that Delhi is out of the danger zone as positivity is still above 20%. “Peak has passed, but COVID is not over. Earlier, we used to get only 50 cases a day and it went up to 28,000 cases a day. Numbers are still high. When cases go down, we will ease restrictions,” he said. The test positivity rate (TPR) of COVID-19 in the city reduced to 21.48% on Thursday from 23.86% a day earlier, according to a Delhi government bulletin. The TPR had peaked on Friday at 30.64%; it remained at that level on Saturday and started decreasing since then. On Thursday, the number of new COVID-19 cases over 24 hours fell to 12,306 from 13,785 on Wednesday. Forty-three new deaths were reported, taking the toll to 25,503, according to the bulletin. Of the total 15,589 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients, 82.69% were vacant on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/govt-caps-rt-pcr-test-at-rs-300/article64947792.ece

The convict, Dinesh Yadav, had on December 6, 2021, been found guilty of being a member of a riotous mob which had burnt down and vandalised the house of a 73-year-old woman, Manori, in Bhagirathi Vihar. Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat also ordered Yadav, represented by Advocate Shikha Garg, to pay a fine of Rs. 12,000. While sentencing Yadav, ASJ Bhat noted that it cannot be gainsaid that the offence committed by the convict was a “very serious one”. “However, no evidence had been led by the prosecution to prove that the unlawful assembly of which the convict was a member, had been formed in pursuance to some conspiracy,” the court said. The court further said that Yadav had been held guilty only by the virtue of Section 149 of IPC, pertaining to unlawful assembly, and there was no evidence that he had directly committed the offences. ‘Common object’ While convicting Yadav last month, the court had observed: “ ...he is to be held guilty of all those offences which have been committed by the members of the unlawful assembly for the reason that he shared the common object of other members of the assembly and knew that these offences are likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object of the assembly.” In the 13-page order, a total of 13 witnesses deposed before the court, including two head constables present on duty during the riots. The complainant, Manori, was declared hostile by the prosecutor after she deposed that she cannot identify any of the rioters as she and her family fled when the incident happened. According to the case records, 150-200 rioters barged into Manori’s house on February 25, 2020, robbed all valuable items and set it on fire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-first-sentencing-in-delhi-riots-case-man-gets-5-year-jail-term/article64947796.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:05 IST,||Playing ping-pong over evidence||Section 207 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) states that an accused should be supplied free of cost all documents used as evidence against him by the prosecution. The documents can include FIRs, copies of police reports, electronic evidence or confessional statements that may help to prepare a defence during the trial. But this legal provision has become a bone of contention in the Delhi riots ‘larger conspiracy’ case. The accused have moved applications seeking evidence, that they claim, has not been provided to them but relied upon by the prosecution in the chargesheet. The majority of these applications are pending disposal. The prosecution has, however, submitted that it has provided all evidence but the accused are seeking material over and above the chargesheet. The court has also been informed that the evidence such as the seized phones, contain “private material” of the accused and, therefore, cannot be provided to a co-accused without distinction. In April last year, Pinjra Tod activist Devangana Kalita had moved a plea seeking the electronic evidence against her. In September, her lawyer informed the court that they were still awaiting the prosecution’s response. “Five months have passed. Where is the scope of Section 207 application if there is no speedy redressal,” argued Kalita’s advocate Aditya Pujari. ‘Voluminous data’ Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad submitted that the data collected during the investigation was huge and needed further analysis for distribution. “It contains personal data of people whose equipment have been seized. If I supply data without any distinction, it amounts to infringing on their privacy. I need to analyse and conclude which data is to be given,” Mr. Prasad told the court, which had also raised concerns regarding the supply of private material to co-accused.  Mr. Pujari cited an April 2021 Supreme Court order that said every accused shall be supplied with statements of witnesses recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of CrPC and a list of objects, material objects and exhibits seized during investigation and relied upon by the Investigating Officer (IO) in accordance with Section 207 of CrPC.   Nine months on, the application, along with several others, awaits disposal. Last March, when Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha’s lawyer sought a cloned copy of his seized mobile phone, the prosecution told the court that “midway into investigations, it cannot keep distributing material against the accused”.   Advocate Sowjhanya Shankaran for Tanha had submitted that it is the prosecution’s bounden duty to provide him his phone’s data. “These are data, WhatsApp chats, alleged speeches already relied on by them but I need to know the entire content. It’s not the job of the prosecution to pick and choose what to rely upon,” the lawyer told the court. It took Tanha seven months to get the cloned copy of his cellphone.  ‘Hard or soft copy?’ The provision posed a deterrent when the court directed the prosecution to supply hard copies of the chargesheet to the accused, in addition to the soft copies already given. The prosecution challenged the order before the Delhi High Court, stating that Section 207 of CrPC mandates supplying a copy of each of the reports, statements or documents, subject to reasonable exception. The plea said, “The law does not specify supply of a ‘hard copy’ or ‘soft copy’, nor does it draw any distinction between the two.” It added that the provision did not cast any duty upon the investigating officer or agency to bear the cost of the accused’s copy. The High Court stayed the trial for five months and vacated it after the prosecution informed that the chargesheet hard copies were ready to be provided to the accused.  A defence lawyer, requesting anonymity, said the prosecution has been denying them the complete set of documents as it might “ruin their case”. “If they provide us with the electronic evidence, it might have some content in our favour, which will help us during the trial but work against the prosecution,” the lawyer told The Hindu .  Another lawyer said: “We are only asking for the material that the prosecution is obliged to provide us; not anyone’s private content. But if they have relied on specific data and are calling it a conspiracy then we are bound to get access to it.”  SPP Prasad said that the material sought is part of an ongoing police probe , which cannot be supplied to the accused whose case is pending investigation. “We are clear on relied evidence and have already supplied it to the accused, but the lawyers are asking for data not relied upon like certain audio files and recordings that have subsequently come to the knowledge of the police. They wrongly claim that documents provided are illegible and seek bail citing delay in trial,” he said.  “How can I provide content which will be the subject matter of further investigation? It will be filed in court as supplementary chargesheet and copies will be provided to them,” Mr. Prasad said. Legal experts said the prosecution often provides “illegible” and “piecemeal” material to the accused, which invariably leads to delay in the trial. “The prosecution gives imperfect copies of evidence such as a missing page and that drags the matter,” advocate Sarim Naved said.  “Lawyers might want the evidence to confront the prosecution witnesses during trial , so often applications are filed to keep it in safe custody so that they can’t claim later that the evidence is lost,” Mr. Naved said.  Advocate M.R. Shamshad said: “When the prosecution delays the process by claiming that it will file supplementary chargesheets after further probe, in such cases the accused should get a default bail under Section 167 of CrPC if the investigation has not been completed within 60 to 90 days of arrest.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/playing-ping-pong-over-evidence/article64947799.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:05 IST,||‘Sense of unease’ overrides relief of justice||Dinesh Yadav was sentenced to a five-year jail term by a Delhi court on Thursday for being part of a mob that burnt down 73-year-old Manori’s house. But instead of feeling relieved, Ms. Manori and her family felt a sense of unease as they worried about Yadav’s eventual release from jail. “We don’t know the man who has been punished. We have never seen him but it appears that he burnt down our house with others. Now we feel a little scared because maybe when he comes out, he will blame us for sending him to jail in our case,” Ms. Manori said. The 75-year-old has been living with her daughter Shahida, 48, and two sons — Ashiq, 23, and Asif, 21, — at their residence in Bhagirathi Vihar since 1990. It took them a year to repair the house after it was looted and burnt during the riots.  Mr. Ashiq wondered what would happen if the supporters of Yadav tried to harm them. “ Hamein to darr hi lagta hai … hamari to koi madad bhi nahi karega (We are scared… nobody will help us also),” he said. Mr. Ashiq added that he lives in a locality dominated by Hindus and he and his family had a healthy relationship with their neighbours till the riots broke out in February 2020.  “When the riots broke out, we thought we wouldn’t be harmed because we had such a healthy relationship with all our neighbours. But when our house was being burnt and looted, nobody came forward to help us,” he said. Mr. Ashiq had a buffalo and the family sold its milk for a living. The buffalo was nowhere to be found when the family returned after the riots. “These neighbours are the same people to whom we offered milk and curd whenever we had extra. If they didn’t help us then, why would they help us now if somebody were to harm us? They don’t even bother to check how we are managing to survive,” he said. His mother Shahida has been in trauma since the riots. “She doesn’t get out of bed. She barely talks to anyone,” said Mr. Ashiq.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sense-of-unease-overrides-relief-of-justice/article64947800.ece

The teachers and staff of these 12 colleges said they have not been paid their salaries on time leading to financial distress, and violation of human and constitutional rights of the employees. The Delhi government had earlier said it had released Rs. 53.39 crore for these colleges in October-November last year and instead blamed the individual colleges for not paying their employees. The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) in a press conference on Thursday said the money released by the government had been utilised in paying salaries for the two years when the government had not released funds, which had caused a deficit of Rs. 4 crore to Rs. 34 crore in different colleges. The delay, DUTA members said, had resulted in salaries and other allowances getting delayed by two to six months. “Fund cuts have not only made payment of full salaries and other allowances and arrears impossible in these colleges, it also has made the general maintenance and growth of these colleges difficult,” DUTA members said, while announcing that they were going to intensify their agitation demanding the release of funds. The DUTA also questioned the formation of a committee by the government to analyse fund utilisation by the colleges.“The committee will find details that have already been furnished by the colleges through their budgets that are approved by the governing bodies, which have elected members from AAP.” DUTA president A.K. Bhagi said financial audits conducted by the government had not found any serious shortcomings. He added that teachers had sent several representations to the CM and Deputy CM and have also gone to court and the NHRC, but have received only temporary solutions so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/du-employees-demand-solution-to-fund-crunch/article38301242.ece

It asked the SHO of Kotwali police station and the Deputy Commissioner of the North body to conduct the drives and file an action-taken report within a week. The order came on a plea by Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal seeking direction to the authorities to remove illegal hawkers and vendors from the no-hawking and no-squatting areas in Chandni Chowk, which has recently undergone redevelopment. Earlier, the court had directed the Delhi police to take steps to install CCTV cameras in the area to check encroachment on pavements and walkways. “Regulated hawking and vending can address issues of pedestrian walkways being encroached, lack of hygiene, law and order, among others,” the HC had earlier said, directing the municipal corporation to prepare a street vending plan. “A large population is unemployed and find it an easy and convenient way of earning their livelihood by undertaking hawking and vending activities and making their ends meet,” the court had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/remove-illegal-vendors-from-chandni-chowk/article38301238.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:54 IST,||U.S. warns Russia on invading Ukraine||The White House clarified U.S. President Joe Biden’s opposition to Russian aggression on Ukraine after Mr. Biden appeared to suggest during a press conference that a small incursion by Russia would be tolerated. In a statement released after the press conference, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that any incursion would be met with a “ severe” response from the U.S. and its allies. “President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,” Ms. Psaki said. She added that paramilitary and cyber attacks by Russia would also be met with reciprocal action. Tensions between the West and Moscow have soared as Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Biden had told reporters during a press conference to mark his first anniversary in office that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), a military alliance of the West, was united in its opposition to the idea of Russia invading Ukraine, but qualified it to say the response would depend on the size of the incursion. “It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion, and then we [ NATO allies] end up having a fight about what to do and not do, etc., “ Mr. Biden said. “ But if they actually do what they’re capable of doing... it is going to be a disaster for Russia, if they further invade Ukraine and that our allies and partners are ready to impose severe cost and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy,” he said. Mr. Biden said he had conveyed to Mr. Putin (the two held a telephone call in December) that he would fortify NATO’s eastern flank if Russia went into Ukraine. He also said Russia would prevail in the long run over Ukraine, if it invaded the country, but there would be a heavy cost. He said economic sanctions would involve a ban on transactions in dollar denominated assets. Stop expansion In a draft security agreement Moscow sent to Western countries in December, it had proposed that NATO not expand to include Ukraine. Another Russian demand was that NATO not deploy weapons or forces in countries that became NATO members after May 1997. Asked later during the press interaction if he had effectively given Mr. Putin “ permission” to make a small incursion into Ukraine, Mr. Biden said, “ …It’s very important that we keep everyone in NATO on the same page. And that’s what I’m spending a lot of time doing.” There are differences within NATO on what countries are willing to do depending on what scenario plays out, Mr. Biden said. In terms of calibrating a response, he cited the example of cyber ops being countered with similar tactics. Mr. Biden said the economic sanctions on Russia would have “devastating” consequences on it but would also have a negative impact on the U.S. and European countries and so the allies would have to be on the same page about a response to any Russian incursion.

Moscow blew up one of its old satellites in November in a missile test that sparked international anger because of the space debris it scattered around the Earth’s orbit. U.S. officials accused Moscow of carrying out a “dangerous and irresponsible” strike that had created a cloud of debris and forced the International Space Station’s crew to take evasive action. Russia dismissed those concerns and denied that the space debris posed any danger but a new incident with a Chinese satellite suggests otherwise.  In the latest encounter, China’s Tsinghua Science Satellite came as close as 14.5 m from a piece of debris, the state-run Global Times reported on Wednesday.  The “extremely dangerous” event happened on Tuesday, the report added, citing a social media post by Chinese space authorities that has since been removed.  Space debris expert Liu Jing told the Global Times that it was rare for debris and spacecraft to be just a dozen metres apart, adding that the probability of collision this time was “very high”.  Last year there were close encounters between the Chinese space station and satellites operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which led to Beijing accusing the U.S. of unsafe conduct in space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-satellite-in-close-encounter-with-russian-debris/article38300458.ece

The American Navy said the USS Benfold “asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands, consistent with international law”.  The Southern Theatre Command of the People’s Liberation Army said the U.S. ship had “illegally” entered what Beijing regards as its waters. The PLA “organised naval and air forces to engage in tracking and monitoring as well as to warn and drive (the destroyer) away,” its statement added. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in trade passes annually, with competing claims from Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Beijing has ignored a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that its historical claim is without basis. Led by the United States, multiple Western navies conduct “freedom of navigation operations”, known in military circles as FONOPs, to assert the idea that the South China Sea is an international waterway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-warships-south-china-sea-passage-sparks-row/article38300464.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:32 IST,||Should the government loosen its purse strings?||With the Union Budget 10 days away, many economic observers are now focused on what support the Centre can offer the economy, which is still struggling to recover from the pandemic. Some analysts believe that the government must keep its spending in check to prevent price rise from getting out of control. Retail inflation is hovering close to 6%, while the wholesale inflation rate is in double digits. Other analysts, however, believe that the current rise in prices is a temporary phenomenon, and that the government must ignore the fiscal deficit and ramp up spending to support the ailing economy. In a conversation moderated byPrashanth Perumal J., N.R. Bhanumurthy and Himanshu discuss the way forward. Edited excerpts: What is your view on the current trend in price inflation? N.R. Bhanumurthy:First of all, when it comes to retail inflation, the latest reading says it is somewhere close to 5.6%. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already predicted that it will remain below 6% by the end of March. However, many of us believe there are some upside risks when it comes to inflation and inflation expectations. This is for a couple of reasons. One, international oil prices have gone up to $87 per barrel this week. We also see that inflation pressure is building up across the world, especially in countries where there was a large fiscal stimulus. So, there could be the risk of transmission of international inflation to the domestic economy. But at the same time, one needs to really understand what drives this inflation. At least in the Indian context, supply-side constraints play a major role and this needs a different policy prescription. And I’m very sure that the RBI has many instruments to contain this inflation pressure. For the past three quarters, the RBI has been hitting bull’s eye when it comes to inflation forecasts, so I think when it says that retail inflation will be less than 6%, it’s likely to come true. With regard to Wholesale Price Index (WPI), I’ve been a little wary of this reading. You cannot have wholesale market prices and retail market prices diverging for a very long time. We generally expect the transmission between the wholesale market and the retail market to not be more than one or two months. But what we see now is a very prolonged divergence. We need to look at a little more in detail in terms of the coverage and commodities and all those things. We need to focus more on Consumer Price Index (CPI) and less on wholesale prices. Himanshu:We have to be very cautious in not just looking at inflation numbers in aggregate, but also what is driving inflation. I think that most of the inflation is basically driven by supply. Also, it not driven as much by domestic factors as it is by international factors. But domestic factors have added to the problem. The most obvious factor is that taxes on petroleum goods and services have increased. So, domestic factors have contributed to inflation, but the inflation is predominantly driven by the supply side. But I would also be a bit hesitant in saying that there is only little that can be done using fiscal policy. Second, I think the gap between WPI and CPI is quite a big one and it has been so for a long time. Some of the inflation in wholesale prices will be passed on to consumer prices, so inflation is a cause of concern not just for fiscal policy or monetary policy, but also for the overall health of the economy because inflation is going to impinge on the basic economics of households. How do you see the role of fiscal policy in supporting the economy in a high-inflation environment? N.R. Bhanumurthy:With regard to the fiscal policy, the current year is turning out to be a very good year in terms of tax revenues. If you look at the last Budget, the government was focused on the medium-term perspective, while leaving short-term issues to the central bank. I’m hoping that the same macro framework will continue in the coming Budget. But at the same time, measures that were brought in to help the poor in terms of providing safety nets continue. Right now, the government has fiscal room and will want to focus on the social sector as well as medium-term growth prospects. Ultimately, the biggest stimulus would be any measure that provides more employment opportunities. Economic recovery has to be on a more sustainable basis rather than in the form of short-term spikes in growth. Himanshu:I think it should spend more. If there’s any time that the government should be spending more, it is now. One has to go beyond this obsession with managing the fiscal framework. If fiscal prudence leads to growth slowing down, I don’t think that is something sustainable. The reason I say this is because there are enough of the government’s own economic indicators that show that there is excess capacity in the economy. Aggregate consumption, which is a big part of GDP, is slowing down and has been for quite some time now. I think at this point of time the focus should be on reviving the economy and that is best done using fiscal policies. The government will have to open its purse, not just in terms of improving the incomes of people in cases where it can directly do so, such as using social security schemes, but also by increasing the transfers to States. We are actually getting into a situation where the public debt to GDP ratio is going to increase because if growth is going to slow down, it would basically mean that government revenues will also slow down. So, I don’t see how it is going to be good fiscal policy if growth is going to be affected by fiscal prudence. I would recommend that we not worry about the fiscal deficit at this point of time because once growth picks up, then a lot of the fiscal issues can be taken care of. But if the economic engines are not firing up, you are getting into a vicious cycle, and then I don’t think any kind of fiscal management, either in the short or in the medium term, is going to be sustainable. So, I think we need the government to play the important role of reviving the economy. How would you answer people who talk about the risk of stagflation? N.R. Bhanumurthy:I think they are being alarmist for a simple reason. We, at least in India, have a consensus that the right inflation number which is relevant for the household is the retail inflation number. The WPI is a very segmented indicator that doesn’t include services and other things. So, let’s be clear that if we are to look at one number to gauge inflation, it is CPI inflation. And the CPI inflation is well within the RBI’s targeted range of 2% to 6%. When it comes to the faltering Index of Industrial Production (IIP) numbers, it should be noted that the IIP covers a very small component of the industry. The IIP is a very crude leading indicator. So, I don’t think we need to make a judgment based on IIP numbers. My own assessment is that we are nowhere near stagflation. In fact, for the next financial year, my own prediction for GDP growth is somewhere close to 6.5%-7%. And if we look at exports, there is a very substantial rise in exports, so the recovery seems to be very, very sharp. If we can continue with the kind of fiscal framework that was adopted in the last Budget, I think we should be looking at close to 7% GDP growth for the next year. And as we already discussed, the inflation pressure is definitely there. It may be somewhere close to 6%. So, I would not really support the argument that we are anywhere close to stagflation. Himanshu:Stagflation may be too strong a word, but I think there are certainly pressure points. Inflation and low growth persisting for a long time is something that I don’t think we can rule out completely. Where I disagree with Bhanu is with his optimism as far as growth prospects are concerned. At least when it comes to the economic numbers that I can see, it’s not something that is going to be very easy to deal with. A lot of the inflation right now is still coming from the supply side. But if the economy does bounce back once the pandemic is over, it’s not going to lead to the softening of inflation; it may actually aggravate the inflation situation. Second, as far as the growth numbers are concerned, again, I’m not so optimistic. I’m not going to make a prediction on the growth numbers for next year because in this crisis situation, most of these numbers are affected by the base chosen to calculate these numbers. I think it will be some time before we come back to a normal situation. Unless we are back in a normal situation, I think all these numbers don’t have much meaning; they are just bouncing up and down. In the broadest sense, the threat of high inflation and low growth persisting for at least some time is real. A lot depends on how the government responds to the situation, both in terms of reviving demand in the economy, but also in terms of managing inflation. These are issues for which we still have no conclusive answers. Is there something the Budget can do in terms of structural reforms to address inflation driven by the supply side? N.R. Bhanumurthy:I’m not really sure whether fiscal policy can directly address inflation driven by supply-side factors, except maybe by reviving growth. But to go back to an earlier point, if we look at the advance estimates of GDP, they suggest that the investment rate is somewhere close to 36%, which is very close to the investment rate during the high growth period that we saw in the last decade. This is one of the major indicators for me when I say we are going to see 7% GDP growth. Himanshu:There’s not much that the government can do. But what it certainly can do is protect demand, the economy, the middle class, and particularly the poor and the vulnerable from the impact of high inflation. That, I think, is the role of the government. Taxation of petroleum products, for instance, is something that is part of fiscal policy. So, that is something that the government can influence. When it comes to fertilizer prices, which are rising very fast, the government can increase its contribution and thus reduce the prices that the farmers are paying. Remember, the cost of inflation is not just a direct cost, it can also be passed on indirectly to other prices and this can have a very debilitating impact on the economy. The industry, such as the automobile sector, can start passing on its high input cost to the retail sector, that is to consumers. That’s where I think the government can actually step in and cushion the impact that high inflation has on industry as well as on consumers by lowering direct and indirect taxes. That’s something that will have an impact on what happens overall to the demand side and to the revival of the economy. So, I don't think that the government’s hands are completely tied; it certainly has a role to play. The government should be looking at the long-term picture rather than the short-term picture of generating revenues by taxing more. It should rather allow people to have a larger disposable income so that consumption in the economy increases. And one way to do it, other than through income transfers, is to reduce taxes on goods and services that are witnessing high inflation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/should-the-government-loosen-its-purse-strings/article64947963.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:32 IST,||Drop the IAS cadre rules amendments||It was Sardar Patel who had championed the creation of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS) as “All India Services” (AIS) whose members would be recruited and appointed by the Centre and allotted to various States, and who could serve both under the State and the Centre. He considered the AIS essential to knit the administrative framework of a vast and diverse country into an integrated whole and to provide a connecting link between implementation at the field level and policymaking at the top. Speaking to the Constituent Assembly on October 10, 1949, Patel said, “The Union will go, you will not have a united India if you have not a good All India Service which has the independence to speak out its mind, which has a sense of security....” Healthy conventions earlier AIS officers are made available for central deputation through a consultative process involving the Centre, the States and the officers concerned. In the past, certain healthy conventions were generally followed. No officer was sent on central deputation against his/her own will. Every year, the States would prepare an “offer list” of officers who had opted for central deputation without arbitrarily withholding any names. The Centre would choose officers only from among those “on offer” from the States. The States would relieve the officers picked up by the Centre at the earliest. When politics intruded Unfortunately, both the Centre and the States have at times flouted these healthy conventions for political considerations. In July 2001, the Centre unilaterally “placed at its disposal” the services of three IPS officers of Tamil Nadu cadre. In December 2020, the Centre did the same in respect of three IPS officers of West Bengal cadre. In May 2021, the Centre unilaterally issued orders for the central deputation of the Chief Secretary of West Bengal just before his last day in service. In all these cases, the States concerned refused to relieve the officers. Some States used to vindictively withhold the names of some of the officers who had opted for central deputation or delay their relief after they were picked up by the Centre. An egregious example was that of a senior IPS officer who was not allowed to join the Central Bureau of Investigation despite earlier clearance and was suspended by the Government of Tamil Nadu in May 2014 when she relieved herself from the State pursuant to the Centre’s direction. The Central Government has proposed four amendments to Rule 6(1) of the IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954 dealing with deputation, and has sought the views of State governments before January 25, 2022. The existing Rule 6(1) states that a cadre officer may be deputed to the Central Government (or to another State or a PSU) only with the concurrence of the State Government concerned. However, it has a proviso which states that in case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the Central Government. Two of the four proposed amendments are disconcerting. One is a new proviso making it mandatory for the State government to provide a certain fixed number of IAS officers for central deputation every year. The proposed amendment more or less compels a State government to offer IAS officers for central deputation even when these officers themselves may not wish to go on central deputation. Poor working conditions in junior-level posts, an opaque and arbitrary system of empanelment for senior-level posts, and lack of security of tenure at all levels are the real reasons for the shortage of IAS officers, which the Centre should address. With the Government of India itself enthusiastically promoting lateral entry to posts in the Centre and providing an increased share of central deputation posts to the central services, there is no need to push unwilling IAS officers on central deputation.  The other is a proviso that requires the State government to release such officers whose services may be sought by the Central Government in specific situations . Based on experiences of the recent past, State governments have a justified apprehension that this proviso may be misused for political considerations. What if the Centre unilaterally places at its disposal the services of the Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister and other key officers of a State ruled by a rival party or deputes them to other States?  Long-term damage States are right in perceiving the proposed amendments as a serious infringement of their rights to deploy IAS officers as they deem best, especially when the cutting edge of policy implementation is mostly at the State level. The contemplated changes have grave implications for the independence, security and morale of IAS officers. If States begin to doubt the loyalty of IAS officers, they are likely to reduce the number of IAS cadre posts and also their annual intake of IAS officers. They may prefer officers of the State Civil Services to handle as many posts as possible. In course of time, the IAS will lose its sheen, and the best and the brightest candidates will no longer opt for the IAS as a career. Short-sighted decisions can do long-term damage to the polity. Think cooperative federalism  In the words of jurist Nani Palkhivala, “A national consensus should clearly remind the Centre that it has not inherited the Viceroy’s mantle of paramountcy... The Centre would have no moral authority to govern unless it displays a sense of constitutional morality, particularly a sense of justice and fairness towards the States”. In S.R. Bommai vs Union of India (1994), the Supreme Court held that “States have an independent constitutional existence and they have as important a role to play in the political, social, educational and cultural life of the people as the Union. They are neither satellites nor agents of the Centre”.  We hope that the Centre will heed Sardar Patel’s sage advice and drop the proposed amendments. In a federal setup, it is inevitable that differences and disputes would arise between the Centre and the States. But all such quarrels should be resolved in the spirit of cooperative federalism and keeping the larger national interest in mind. K.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:32 IST,||The gentleman spymaster who had India enthralled||January 20, 2022 marked the 20th anniversary of the passing of Rameshwar Nath Kao, founding Head of the Research & Analysis Wing (R&AW) and, arguably, one of the most accomplished and influential intelligence chiefs of all time. From 2007 till 2019, the R&AW used to hold the annual Kao Memorial Lecture at its headquarters in the last week of January but the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic meant that the event has had to be kept on hold since then. This tribute is a modest attempt to give expression to the collective sense of excitement and pride that members of India’s intelligence community experience when the lecture is held. Encomiums aplenty have been showered — and rightly so — on Kao for his unparalleled contributions to Indian intelligence. Instead of repeating what has already been said, I propose to highlight some of the qualities that made him such a formidable and successful intelligence chief. That he was a Kashmiri Pandit like several of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s closest advisers, that she knew him from the time that he began looking after the arrangements for her father Jawaharlal Nehru’s security as a young assistant director in the Intelligence Bureau and that he enjoyed her complete confidence were, of course, factors central to Kao’s meteoric rise. But what were some of the other ingredients of the Kao formula for success as the Head of R&AW (1968-77)? There was a line  The first was the scrupulous distinction that he maintained between external and internal intelligence. In recent decades, following the rise of international terrorism as a major intelligence concern worldwide, it became somewhat fashionable to say that the dividing line between external and internal threats had blurred and it was no longer possible to treat the two as separate phenomena. There may be some merit in this contention in as much as threats from without become relevant only insofar as they have an impact within. But the distinction is fundamental and none was more conscious of this fact than Kao. This was, perhaps, understandable and inevitable considering the raison d’etre of the formation of the R&AW as an organisation responsible for the collection of intelligence pertaining to developments abroad.   On Kao’s watch, the R&AW steered conspicuously clear of dabbling in domestic intelligence collection. Whenever inquiries needed to be conducted on some matter or the other within the country, Kao invariably turned to the Intelligence Bureau for assistance. The benefits were twofold: the R&AW focused its energies, without any distraction, on the collection of intelligence about India’s external adversaries and the Intelligence Bureau could not complain about being bypassed in the discharge of its core responsibility, viz. intelligence collection on developments within the country.  The Emergency and after The second ingredient — a corollary of the first — was Kao’s sagacious policy of insulating the R&AW from the vicissitudes of domestic politics. Despite his untrammeled access to the highest levels of the political leadership, Kao studiously avoided the temptation of getting involved in internal political matters. Never was the sagacity of Kao’s approach more evident than during the Emergency. The Janata Party government that came to power following the elections of 1977 was suspicious of the role played by Kao and R&AW during the Emergency and there was an attempt to cut the organisation down to size, but no inquiry or investigation could unearth any evidence of the R&AW being even remotely involved in any of the excesses committed during the Emergency. The result was that, after some temporary setbacks, the organisation recovered its self-confidence and went back to playing its designated role in upholding national security. The third was Kao’s uncommon ability to see the big picture while, at the same time, paying what can only be described as extreme attention to detail. Be it the liberation war of Bangladesh or the denouement in Sikkim in the 1970s or the historic opening to the United States in the early 1980s during his second coming (1981-84) as Senior Adviser in the Cabinet Secretariat, Kao kept his sights firmly on the big picture, effectively translating the broad vision of the political leadership into concrete reality on the ground. Equally, the R&AW’s sober and balanced assessments shaped the making of policy, helping to ensure that it was grounded in reality and not based on idealistic preferences or wishful thinking. The fourth was his ability to spur his officers to greater heights without being overbearing or micromanaging tasks best left to ground-level operatives. As the head of R&AW, Kao was ably assisted by a fine band of lieutenants, several of whom, like him, had been handpicked to man the Intelligence Bureau before being drafted into the external intelligence set-up. Without them, Kao would not have been half as successful as he was and he knew it. He gave them his full trust and backing and they, in turn, delivered the results that made the R&AW the formidable machine that it was to become so early in its existence. The fifth was his disinclination, bordering on abhorrence, to engage in any form of self-projection. This attitude was best brought out by his response to the ill-informed criticism directed against the R&AW, and against him personally, for failing to prevent the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in August 1975. The criticism pained him, especially since he had personally warned the Bangladeshi leader more than once about the threat to his life. It was in this context that he propounded the dictum that those engaged in the profession of intelligence must never expect to be rewarded for their successes but must always be prepared to be punished for their failures. Old world Added to these ingredients were an exquisite old-world courtesy, refinement and innate humaneness that shone through his dealings with all, from the mightiest in the land to the lowest. Such, in fact, was the generosity of spirit that characterised Kao’s dealings with his subordinates that, at times, it made him blind to the failings of some of them. In the years ahead, India’s external intelligence agency will have to grapple with a complex array of challenges; from correctly anticipating the moves of an assertive China to countering the ever-mutating threats from the forces of radicalism and terrorism emboldened by developments in our immediate neighbourhood to safeguarding the expanding digital infrastructure that is likely to increasingly underpin our security and prosperity. To be able to rise to the occasion, those serving the R&AW will do well to hew to the first principles that the organisation’s founding father laid down and practised with such aplomb.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:32 IST,||Court and compensation||It took much persuasion by the Supreme Court and all its assertiveness to get the Union government to agree last year to pay a token compensation of Rs. 50,000 to the families of each of those who were claimed by COVID-19. The time has now come for the Court to assert its authority once again to ensure that neither tardiness on the part of the States nor incorrect rejection of claims deprives genuine victims of their right to the ex gratia amount. In the latest hearing, the Court had to pull up a couple of States for not disbursing the amount fast enough and express concern about the high number of rejected claims. In the backdrop of reports that there has been significant under-reporting of deaths due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Bench had passed orders some months ago to the effect that no person’s family shall be denied the benefit on the ground that the death certificate did not specify the cause of death as due to COVID-19. Early experience since the outbreak showed that many deaths were attributed to co-morbidities rather than to the infection itself. Also, many died after testing negative during hospitalisation or after their discharge. To address this situation, the Court directed that any death occurring within 30 days of a person testing positive, or being clinically determined to suffer from the infection, will be eligible for the ex gratia payment. In addition, the Court devised an appeal mechanism in the form of grievance redress committees at the district level. In the latest order, the Bench, comprising Justice M.R. Shah and Justice Sanjiv Khanna, has directed that if a claim has been rejected due to defects in application, the family must be given an opportunity to rectify the shortcoming and then be paid the compensation. Noting that in some cases, the number of claims is lower than the number of registered deaths, the Court has directed that officials reach out to the families on their own. It has extracted assurances from some States that claims that had been cleared but yet to be disbursed would be cleared as early as possible. Significantly, it has also mandated the disclosure of the reasons for rejection to the applicants so that they could either rectify errors or go on appeal to the committee to redress such grievances. In yet another bid to ensure that eligible families are not denied the benefit, the Court has roped in the legal services authority in each State and district to ascertain whether compensation has been paid to the kin of everyone recorded as dead due to the pandemic in official records, and facilitate the payment if it is yet to be made. The Supreme Court has done much to grant some succour, low though the quantum may be in the light of the staggering impact the pandemic has had on lives and livelihoods, to millions of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/court-and-compensation/article38300444.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:32 IST,||Yemen’s tragedy||The Saudi-led coalition, in which the UAE was a part, started bombing Yemen in 2015, hoping to swiftly dislodge the Houthi rebels from Sana’a and reinstate the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi in the capital. Almost seven years later, the Iran-backed Houthis, who were holed up in northern Yemen and began counter-attacks with missiles and drones into Saudi Arabia, have expanded the war all the way to the Gulf coast of the UAE. Monday’s drone attacks on Abu Dhabi by the Houthis, in which two Indians and a Pakistani were killed, were a message to the Emiratis on what they are capable of. It may not be a coincidence that the attacks were carried out at a time when the UAE-backed forces have been making slow gains in Yemen’s conflict against the Houthis. But the UAE’s involvement in Yemen has had many turns. It quit the Saudi-led coalition in 2020 as the war had hit a stalemate. Since then, the Emiratis have provided tactical support to the Southern Transitional Council, a separatist body in southern Yemen that drove the Saudi-backed forces loyal to President Hadi out of Aden. The dynamics changed again when the Houthis began pushing into territories outside their stronghold, especially Marib; if they take Marib, they would be a step ahead to push into the south. Faced with the prospects of further Houthi territorial gains, UAE-backed forces such as Giants Brigades (a militia from the south) have joined hands with the government. Then came the Abu Dhabi attacks. These could escalate the conflict. The immediate response from the Saudi-led coalition has been to carry out a massive air strike on the partly destroyed Sana’a. The UAE has also vowed retaliation. A Houthi strike to scare away the Emiratis from Yemen could trigger the opposite reaction from Abu Dhabi, which now has powerful proxies in the south. The cycle of violence spells tragic news for Yemen’s 30 million people for whom the country has been turned into what UNICEF has called “a living hell”. Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Arab world, is facing a three-way crisis — thousands have been killed in the conflict, many more abandoned or suffering by the collapse of the government and social services; and mass hunger. The first step to address this tragedy is to end the fighting. But, unfortunately, the parties in the conflict and their regional backers are keen on escalating the conflict further rather than finding a solution. If the fighting over the last seven years holds any lesson, it is that there can be no military solution to Yemen’s problems. To dial down tensions, there have to be talks, not only between the rebels, separatists and the government but also between their backers — Iran, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. If these regional powers agree to rein in their proxies and work towards rebuilding Yemen, that would also help them restore stability and security in the Arabian peninsula.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/yemens-tragedy/article38300450.ece

Yahya Khan, planned to have the civilian leader Mr. Bhutto, now President, arrested on his return from the United Nations in December. The Sun, in a despatch from its Rawalpindi correspondent, said Mr. Bhutto was to have been charged with conspiracy to overthrow the military government of President Yahya by violent means. President Yahya planned to replace Mr. Bhutto as Vice-Premier and the Foreign Minister designate by Mr. Abdul Qayum Khan of the United Coalition Party, the newspapers said. The report added that the Peshawar Police had orders to arrest Mr. Bhutto as soon as he crossed the Afghanistan border on his expected return to Pakistan by road. Meantime, however, Mr. Bhutto flew back to Pakistan from New York, stopping over in London and Rome and by the time he arrived, Dacca had fallen to Indian troops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/yahya-tried-to-arrest-bhutto/article38300451.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:32 IST,||Letters||The proposed changes by the Centre to Rule 6 (deputation of cadre officers) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules 1954 are ill-advised (Page 1, January 20) These would not only be against the principle of federalism but also encroach upon the plans of States to utilise the specialised services of IAS officers for various key departments or projects. G.V.N. Murthy, Hyderabad There is already a situation where there has been a significant usurpation of State powers by the Centre. The planned move will be a blatant encroachment onto the administrative domain of the States. It is clear that the Centre wants unbridled powers to keep States on a tight leash . The mess that arose in the case of the Chief Secretary of West Bengal State is bound to manifest itself in the days ahead. The Centre should drop the ill-conceived and regressive move in the overall interest of seamless administration and uphold constitutional propriety and federal polity. V. Johan Dhanakumar, Chennai   The Supreme Court of India’s proposed order to marshal efforts to pay the promised solatium to the next of kin of those died of COVID-19 and children “orphaned, abandoned or left with one parent” in the mayhem will be a great judicial intervention (Page 1, January 20). The ombudsman will definitely be a saviour to many an aggrieved family of the victim in case of a dispute over the selection and the sanction of the financial compensation. With the third COVID-19 wave showing no sign of ebbing as yet, any undue delay in making ex gratia payment would hurt families. S. Sanjeevi Rao, Puducherry   It is a matter of regret that the so-called ‘expert committee’ to select the tableaux for the Republic Day parade appears to be ignorant of the names of freedom fighters, particularly from the South. Some of the alleged remarks made by the members of the committee can be said to be shocking. The entire episode looks murky and politicised in order to keep certain non BJP-ruled States out of the national parade, making one wonder whether we are living in a democratic country or under a dictatorship. This undemocratic and divisive development is not good for an India once known to be in possession of an enviable virtue — ‘unity in diversity’. Tharcius S. Fernando, Chennai The process of selection of tableaux for the Republic Day parade appears to be controversial. It would be in the fitness of things to provide representation to every State in a parade of extreme national importance — to highlight and celebrate our federal concept of governance. Shortcomings, if any, can be corrected without such penalties. Ayyasseri Raveendranath, Aranmula, Kerala  The very purpose of rolling out a tableau is to showcase India’s culture and history. And the reason why there is a (foreign) chief guest is to make him or her aware of this greatness. In general, efforts should be made to make people know what they do not know. This is what the beauty of history is all about. The perception now is that States said to be out of favour with the Central government, viz. , Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal, have been penalised, while BJP-ruled States or proxies have had no trouble at all.  T. Anand Raj, Chennai    The Taliban Prime Minister’s move to seek recognition from Muslim nations (‘World’ page, January 20) is strange. Does the Taliban have any locus standi to do this when it has curtailed the freedom of women and even deprived them of their basic rights? The suffering of women in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan now is no different from the earlier occasion when the Taliban held sway. Instead, it is imperative that Muslim nations nudge the Taliban to restore full human rights. This must be a precondition to any sort of recognition.  Shujaath Ahmed V., Chennai   There is no doubt that Sania Mirza (‘Sport’ page, “Sania to quit at the end of the season”, January 20) is India’s superstar in women’s tennis who redefined the game in India. Her decision to step back, citing personal reasons that are at the fore, is dignified. Jayashree Thampi, Thiruvananthapuram Ms. Mirza has been a wonderful player with an incredible zeal toward the game of tennis She has been a source of inspiration for many a junior player.

(HUL), India's largest consumer goods maker, reported standalone third-quarter net profit grew 17% to Rs. 2,243 crore aided by strong all-round performance but warned that high raw material costs and inflation could hit margins in the near term. EBITDA margin at 25.4% improved 100 basis points year-on-year. Sales climbs Sales revenue increased 10.4% to Rs. 12,900 crore. While the performance comes in the backdrop of high inflation and slack in rural demand, HUL said sales in its business segments that make ice creams and beauty products returned to pre-pandemic levels. “In the context of unprecedented inflation, we continue to manage our business dynamically driving savings harder across all lines of P&L and taking calibrated pricing actions using the principles of net revenue management,” the company said in a filing with stock exchanges. “We have delivered a strong and resilient performance in the quarter despite moderation in market growth and significant levels of commodity inflation,” said CMD Sanjiv Mehta. “The growth is extremely competitive with our market share gains being highest in more than a decade.” Mr. Mehta said in the near-term, the operating environment would continue to remain challenging. HUL said it would continue calibrated price increases, in line with moves at consumer goods peers. ‘Rural demand weak’ Observing that demand from rural India had lulled, HUL urged the government to continue some support measures it had extended at the onset of the pandemic. Consumer goods makers had expected buying to pick up as pandemic restrictions eased, but high inflation has limited consumers' spending power and piled pressure on companies already grappling with rising raw material and shipping costs.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:53 IST,||India Ratings pegs FY23 GDP growth at 7.6%||India Ratings and Research on Thursday said the country’s economy is likely to grow by 7.6% in 2022-23. The agency said the economy will show a meaningful expansion, after a gap of two years, as the real GDP in 2022-23 is expected to be 9.1% higher than that in 2019-20 (pre-COVID level). “However, the size of the Indian economy in FY23 will be 10.2% lower than the FY23 GDP trend value,” India Ratings said. “A continued weakness in private consumption and investment demand is estimated to contribute 43.4% and 21%, respectively, to this shortfall,” it added. The agency said if the impact of Omicron on fourth quarter growth turns out to be greater than its estimate, then there could be some upside to FY23 growth originating from the base effect. Earlier this month, the NSO in its first advance estimate said gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow at 9.2% in 2021-22. The economy had contracted 7.3% in FY21. India Ratings’ Principal Economist and Director Public Finance Sunil Kumar Sinha said the government and RBI are expected to support the growth recovery. He said the government will not be in a hurry to move towards fiscal consolidation, which means there will be a significant amount of fiscal deficit even in the FY23 Budget, essentially to support growth. The agency expects the fiscal deficit to come in at 5.8-6% of GDP in 2022-23. Mr. Sinha said as inflation trajectory is on the higher side and economic recovery is still fragile, RBI will desist from raising the policy rate in the near future. Highlighting the risks to the ongoing recovery, the agency said NSO’s advance estimate for FY22 shows that private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), grew only 6.9% in FY22, despite a low base and sales data of many consumer durables showing robust growth. “This indicates that the consumption demand is still weak and not broad-based. In fact, the slowdown in PFCE had begun even before the COVID-19 pandemic had hit the Indian economy,” the agency said. The RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey shows that consumer sentiment, which had collapsed May 2019 onwards, have not yet recovered to pre-COVID levels. ‘Structural weakness’ Wage growth both in the rural and urban areas is facing significant headwinds and has been declining since mid-2020. More importantly, real (inflation-adjusted) wages are indicating an erosion of households’ purchasing power, it said. Another factor that has impaired the consumption demand lately is an abrupt rise in the health expenditure of households. These trends may be cyclical, but the picture even at the structural level is not healthy for households. “Households savings have declined and their leverage has gone up significantly since FY12, suggesting that a large part of the consumption demand in the past has been financed through either reduced savings and a higher debt or both,” India Ratings noted.

According to JLL’s ‘Capital Markets Update Q4 2021,’ the year 2020 saw a sharp recovery in investments on account of two large portfolio deals amounting to $3.2 billion announced in the last quarter of the year. On the other hand, investments in 2021 have been much broad-based with the first three quarters reporting improvement compared with the year-earlier period. “One of the major reasons for the decline in investment volume has been the intermittent breakdown in the investment process due to the severe impact of the second Covid wave during the first half of 2021,” JLL said. “Though the investment climate showed signs of recovery during the third quarter of the year, the onset of a new variant and the uncertainty about its impact disrupted deal closures in Q4, 2021,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/institutional-realty-stake-dropped-14-in-2021-jll/article64947608.ece

On a day when out of 15 matches featuring Indians taking on overseas rivals, only three produced home winners, Prannoy and Sindhu won in contrasting manner. Priyanshu, ranked 127, raised visions of making the men’s quarterfinals when he led 16-13 in the decider.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:53 IST,||No immediate plan to halt ISL: AIFF||The Indian Super League season will chug along despite a COVID -19 outbreak in the bubble in Goa that has brought the postponement of six matches, including Friday’s game between Jamshedpur FC and Mumbai City FC at Bambolim. All India Football Federation general secretary Kushal Das said that ISL will not take an immediate break despite several players, coaching staff, family members, and hotel staff inside the ISL bubble testing positive. The affected teams have been barred from training and have struggled to field competitive XIs. In contrast, the I-League was suspended after just one round of fixtures as cases mounted. “We have a strong medical team. It [decision] can’t be based on sporting merit, but on medical advice,” said Das. “There have been a few cases here and there. ISL was nearly 45 days into the competition before we started having cases. With I-League, it was reported in the first round.” Only Chennaiyin FC and Mumbai City FC have not reported any cases while ATK MB is the worst-hit, with three of its matches already called off. SC East Bengal CEO Shivaji Samaddar has called for a circuit breaker to help stabilise the situation. “A break of around 10 -12 days is quite necessary. A lot of clubs believe a break will sort things out. Instead, the ISL management spoke about putting in stricter SOPs and continuing. They have made the gymnasiums out of bounds and made tests mandatory every day even to go to practice,” Col. Samaddar said. Chennaiyin FC’s Hungarian boss Bozidar Bandovic, however, doesn’t want the league to pause. “We don’t have cases. We’ve been following all the rules and protocols. What other teams do and how they’ve got cases, that’s a question for others. For us, there is no question of a break,” he said. Bengaluru FC coach Marco Pezzaiuoli doesn’t favour a break too. “If the League takes a break and has to be finished within the same timeframe, then it means an already tight schedule has to be made tighter," he said.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:58 IST,||India looks to arrest middle-order slump||K.L. Rahul’s men will have to improve drastically against a buoyant South African side in the second ODI on Friday in order to keep the series alive. The middle-order, which had been a problem is still sticking out like a sore thumb and no one knows what exactly the solution is. Once again, it was a case of one opener — Shikhar Dhawan on this occasion — and the indomitable Kohli holding fort before the middle-order caved in on a slower pitch where there was turn and the ball gripped, making a run-of-the-mill seamer Andile Phehlukwayo look formidable. South Africa crushed India both strategically as well as on skills and therein lay serious questions about Rahul’s wares as captain. The big question The most dominant query was what exactly was Venkatesh Iyer doing in the team if he was not bowling at least four to five overs as the sixth bowler when Yuzvendra Chahal and Shardul Thakur were being taken to the cleaners? There wasn’t a singular inspired bowling change unlike Proteas who introduced Aiden Markram’s off-breaks first-up and bottled up the Indian skipper. The game was lost at the halfway stage once Dhawan and Kohli were out in quick succession following their 90-plus stand. Suddenly, the strip where batting looked easy became difficult. Shreyas Iyer’s well-documented struggles against the short ball were again exposed and would know that a place in the Indian playing XI comes at a premium. The likes of Rishabh Pant and the two Iyers will have to play a bigger role. The difference between the two sides was how the spinners fared — Ashwin and Chahal in their combined 20 overs gave away 106 runs for a single wicket while Markram, Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj bowled 26 overs between them for 124 runs and snared four between them.  The teams (from):   India: K.L. Rahul (Capt.), Jasprit Bumrah (Vice-capt.), Shikhar Dhawan, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer, Venkatesh Iyer, Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Ishan Kishan (wicket-keeper), Yuzvendra Chahal, R. Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Deepak Chahar, Prasidh Krishna, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Siraj, Jayant Yadav, and Navdeep Saini.   South Africa: Temba Bavuma (Capt.), Keshav Maharaj (Vice-capt.), Quinton de Kock (wicketkeeper), Zubayr Hamza, Marco Jansen, Janneman Malan, Sisanda Magala, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Lungi Ngidi, Wayne Parnell, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dwaine Pretorius, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi, Rassie van der Dussen, and Kyle Verreynne.

Also out on a day of shocks was former World No. 1 Andy Murray, losing to Japanese qualifier Taro Daniel in straight sets. Second seed Medvedev is the highest seed left in the men’s draw and the favourite after the deportation of reigning champion Novak Djokovic. Stern test But the 25-year-old Russian faced a stern test of his title credentials, and temperament, in the face of an unpredictable but talented Kyrgios, who revved up the home crowd in their prime-time evening showdown. The 26-year-old Australian beat Medvedev, the reigning US Open champion and last year’s losing finalist in Melbourne, in their only two previous clashes. It was a madhouse inside Rod Laver Arena with showman Kyrgios dealing out all his assortment of unplayable serves and tweeners before a partisan home crowd, while embroiled in a running battle with the chair umpire. But calculating Medvedev dealt with it all to ease through 7-6(1), 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 and will now face Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp. Greek fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, chasing a maiden Major, also fought his way past former junior World No. 1 Sebastian Baez of Argentina 7-6(1), 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-4. There was to be no fairytale run for Britain’s three-time Major champion Murray, going down 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to 120th-ranked Daniel, who moves into the third round of a Slam for the first time. Australian wild-card Chris O’Connell pulled off an upset with a straight-set win over 13th seed Diego Schwartzman of Argentina. In the women’s draw, third seed Muguruza, US Open champion Raducanu and sixth seed Anett Kontaveit suffered upsets. Kovinic, Tauson shine The 19-year-old Raducanu, the 17th seed but making her debut in Melbourne, struggled with blisters on her serving hand as Montenegro’s Danka Kovinic won 6-4, 4-6, 6-3. WTA Finals winner Muguruza is also out, losing 6-3, 6-3 to 61st-ranked veteran Alize Cornet. Kontaveit, seen by many as a serious title contender after a breakout 2021, committed 27 unforced errors as she was stunned 6-2, 6-4 by fast-rising Danish teenager Clara Tauson. But second seed Aryna Sabalenka lives to fight another day, just, after coming from a set down for the second successive match to beat China’s World No. 100 Wang Xinyu. An emotional farewell Former US Open champion Samantha Stosur bid an emotional farewell to singles tennis after her 6-2, 6-2 loss to 10th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. While the 37-year-old will continue to play through 2022 on the doubles circuit with Chinese partner Zhang Shuai, she announced in December her home Grand Slam would be her final fling in singles. Stosur said she had "done more than I ever thought was possible". "I couldn't have asked for more. I've had many great moments here in Australia and around the world. It's been amazing," she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/muguruza-raducanu-among-high-profile-casualties/article38300718.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:58 IST,||COVID cannot halt Indian march||Four-time champion and strong title contender India stormed into the Super League quarterfinals of the Under-19 World Cup thrashing minnows Ireland by 174 runs on Wednesday. India had just 11 players available after six members were forced into isolation after testing COVID positive. Put in, India rode on Harnoor Singh’s brisk 88 and a run-a-ball 79 by opening partner Angkrish Raghuvanshi to post 307 for five. The Hrishikesh Kanitkar-coached side then bundled out the opposition for a meagre 133 in 39 overs. Nishant Sidhu led the team after skipper Yash Dhull and his deputy Sheikh Rasheed were among those isolated. Chasing 308, Ireland was teetering at 17 for three after losing both openers Liam Doherty (7) and David Vincent (8) and Jack Dickson (0) inside the first seven overs. Medium-pacer Garv Sangwan (2/23) sent back skipper Tim Tector (15) in the 15th over, to leave the side reeling at 36 for four. Joshua Cox (28, 46b) tried to take the game deep, but it was too little too late. Sangwan struck again, this time removing Cox, who was caught by Dinesh Bana in the 21st over as Ireland lost half its side for 66. Scott Macbeth (32) only delayed the inevitable, but from thereon it was just a matter of time with left-arm spinner Aneeshwar Gautam (2/11) and off-spinner Kaushal Tambe (2/8) cleaning up the lower order. Later, Australia defeated Scotland by seven wickets. Teague Wyllie’s unbeaten 101 was supplemented by Aidan Cahill’s and Campbell Kellaway’s contributions as Australia overhauled Scotland’s 236 for eight.  The scores: India 307/5 in 50 overs (Angkrish Raghuvanshi 79, Harnoor Singh 88, Raja Bawa 42, Nishant Sindhu 36, Rajyavardhan Hangargekar 39; Muzamil Sherzad 3/79) bt Ireland 133 in 39 overs (Joshua Cox 28, Scott MacBeth 32, Joshua Cox 28).   Scotland 236/8 in 50 overs (Charlie Tear 54, Tomas Mackintosh 54, Muhaymen Majeed 26 n.o.) lost to Australia 240/3 in 39.5 overs (Campbell Kellaway 47, Teague Wyllie 101 n.o., Aidan Cahill 72).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/covid-cannot-halt-indian-march/article64947538.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:57 IST,||‘Difficult to play in these bubbles’||Virat Kohli’s decision to quit the Test captaincy may have come as a surprise to many, but not to Kevin Pietersen (KP). “I am not surprised Virat decided to take that extra pressure off, it is difficult to play in these bubbles,” Pietersen, who is here to play for World Giants in the Legends League Cricket, said on Thursday. “I have got close friends in golf, football and other sports and they are some of the best players in the world. They say it is very difficult to play under the conditions of the last couple of years.” Pietersen said it wasn’t right to judge a sportsperson’s performance during the pandemic. “It is very unfair, too harsh and too critical,” he said. “Kohli needs crowds for his juice to get going. He is an entertainer. People who are critical of modern sportsmen (under these circumstances) are foolish. These bubbles are very hard to play in and I have been in a couple of them for the broadcast. It is incredibly difficult.” KP is looking forward to Rahul Dravid’s progress as India’s coach. “He is a good friend,” said Pietersen. “He has done wonders for India’s youngsters and I am looking forward to his progress with the senior players.” As for the captaincy, he feels India is spoilt for choice. “You have got Rohit Sharma, K.L. Rahul,” he said. “I have always loved the Hitman. He is a fabulous player. His captaincy has been great for Mumbai Indians. (As for) Rishabh Pant, not yet, but maybe one day.” He said it was stupid to blame the IPL for the poor performance of England’s Test team. “Very few of them play in the IPL,” the former England batter said.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:32 IST,||Deepika Kumari, Atanu Das dropped from TOPS||Star archer Deepika Kumari and her husband Atanu Das were on Thursday dropped from the Sports Ministry’s Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) due to their below-par performances in the National-ranking tournament. The Mission Olympic Cell (MOC) last month decided to review support for Deepika, a former World No. 1 recurve archer, and Atanu after the National Ranking Archery Tournament in Hyderabad. “Considering their below-par performances in the event, MOC decided to not include them in the TOPS list for now,” the Sports Ministry said in a statement. The archery couple was rated highly after their exploits in the different World Cups, but both Deepika and Atanu have failed to shine at multi-sport events — the latest being the Tokyo Olympics, where much was expected from them but they returned empty-handed. Their problems compounded after the World Cup Finals in Yankton, USA last October. The decision was conveyed to the duo by MOC members, SAI and Archery Association of India officials. Deepika said the TOPS omission will only motivate her to comeback stronger. “I appreciate that SAI officials informed me before the MOC meeting itself that there was a possibility of me being excluded from the TOP Scheme. I will be motivated to return with good scores in the competitions ahead,” Deepika was quoted as saying in the sports ministry release. Atanu Das added: “We were very disturbed that we could not get the results we wanted in the Olympic Games. And we took a break from competitive archery after the Olympic Games. I know it is a matter of time before we find the form and get back to where we belong.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/deepika-kumari-atanu-das-dropped-from-tops/article38300777.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 04:00 IST,||Baskaran welcomes HC judgement||Former India hockey captain V. Baskaran welcomed the Madras High Court judgement on revamping sports associations in Tamil Nadu. Though delayed, the Olympian said, the judgement would revolutionise the ecosystem of sports in the State.  He said all points raised by the Judge were valid and could be addressed. If implemented in a phased manner, it will help sportspersons and make Tamil Nadu a model sports State. “There should be a start somewhere. It is not impossible. It can be done,” Baskaran told The Hindu on Thursday.  Digitalisation About digitalisation, Baskaran said when it is being implemented across schools in Tamil Nadu, why can’t it be done in sports associations in the State? “Is it so difficult to run a website? I don’t think so.” Quite a few important office-bearers in State associations continued to hold on to the post for more than two terms. “These things should stop,” he said. According to Baskaran, the Tamil Nadu Olympics Association, which doesn’t have many Olympians in its fold and which has the authority to question the associations, was not doing much. “For 25 years, politicians and bureaucrats have been handling State associations. Why not give an open application in the newspapers for sportspersons who are willing to be involved in administration,” the Chennai Hockey Association president said. Transparency “Tamil Nadu football is in coma, table tennis has two associations. These things should change. There should be more transparency,” he said. Baskaran felt the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) should be more active and question the associations on how they handle funds. “How many associations are accountable. SDAT should rein them in. Will it do so is the million-dollar question,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/baskaran-welcomes-hc-judgement/article64947922.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:53 IST,||Discipline will be key, says Jitender||Discipline will be the watchword for Jitender Yadav, who is all set to take over as the Indian women’s wrestling team’s chief coach from Kuldeep Malik. The 48-year-old Indian Air Force coach, who has worked as a chief coach with junior teams on international assignments and as a coach with three Pro Wrestling League (PWL) sides, said his experience of working with PWL teams would be handy in handling star wrestlers.  “I have worked with Sakshi Malik, Pooja Dhanda and Ritu Phogat at the PWL. I know how to work with prominent wrestlers. They will be put through individual and group training as per their need,” Jitender told The Hindu on Wednesday.  Jitender said he would look to maintain discipline at the National camp. “One of the main reasons why we did not do well in the (Tokyo) Olympics was (the lack of) discipline. If there is discipline, performance will come.” Jitender stressed careful selection of overseas training venues. “Suppose if we camp in the USA, China or Japan, where women’s wrestling is better, we can gain from that experience. What’s the use of going to a country where the standard is not so good? I have already had a word on this with the federation top brass.” Mat-side support From his experience of officiating as an international referee and judge, Jitender said mat-side support to the wrestlers during bouts would be important. Tactical move “I can read the body language of a referee and know why he has given a particular decision. A coach should be prompt to seek a video referral to either get a deserving point or give some rest to his wrestler (as a tactical move).” The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) has also replaced Rajeev Tomar and Anil Maan, who worked with the men’s freestyle team, with Army man Balwant and Railways’ Sujeet Maan. “The WFI has rested Kuldeep Malik. Rajeev and Anil wanted to spend some time with their families after working at the National camp,” said WFI assistant secretary Vinod Tomar.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:53 IST,||Stunning comeback by Tottenham Hotspur||Steven Bergwijn scored two goals deep into stoppage time to snatch Tottenham a dramatic 3-2 win at Leicester in the Premier League on Wednesday. The Netherlands forward looked to have earned a draw for Spurs by driving home from close range in the fifth minute of added-on time, yet there was more drama to come. Soon after the restart, Leicester lost possession, Harry Kane played a perfectly weighted ball behind the Leicester defence and Bergwijn ran onto it, rounded goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and converted his shot off the post from an acute angle in the seventh extra minute. Kane had scored his customary goal against Leicester — it’s now 18 in 17 matches against the team from the Midlands — to equalise for Tottenham in the 38th, cancelling out the 24th-minute opener by Patson Daka. James Maddison then looked to have won it for Leicester after surging into the penalty area and sending in a shot that deflected into the net off sprawling Tottenham defender Japhet Tanganga in the 76th. Turnaround Manchester United staged a second-half turnaround as goals from Anthony Elanga, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford earned a 3-1 win at Brentford to boost the team’s top-four ambitions in the Premier League on Wednesday. United stayed in seventh place, but is only two points behind fourth-place West Ham in the race for Champions League qualification. A depleted Sevilla was held to a 1-1 draw by Valencia on Wednesday, leaving Real Madrid four points clear at the top of La Liga. Sevilla had the chance to close the gap to two points by winning its game in hand at Mestalla but Goncalo Guedes’ equaliser on the stroke of half-time earned Valencia a share of the spoils. A Mouctar Diakhaby own goal had given Sevilla an early lead.  The results: Premier League: Leicester 2 (Daka 24, Maddison 76) lost to Tottenham 3 (Kane 38, Bergwijn 90+5, 90+7); Brentford 1 (Toney 85) lost to Manchester United 3 (Elanga 55, Greenwood 62, Rashford 77).   La Liga: Celta Vigo 2 (Hugo Mallo 29, Lorenzo 38) bt Osasuna 0; Valencia 1 (Guedes 44) drew with Sevilla 1 (Diakhaby 7-og) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/stunning-comeback-by-tottenham-hotspur/article64947621.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:58 IST,||Ranji set to be cancelled||The Ranji Trophy is set to be cancelled for the second successive season due to the nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases resulting in lack of a window ahead of the Indian Premier League’s 15th edition. However, the BCCI is optimistic about staging the other major domestic tournaments. The Hindu understands that considering the exponential rise in COVID-19 cases and the countdown for IPL, likely to begin on April 2, having already begun, it’s “all but curtains” for the premier domestic First Class tournament.  “The IPL bubble will start around March 20 and at the moment, there seems to be no clarity over when the latest COVID-19 wave will start subsiding, so we will be stretched for time to organise the Ranji Trophy,” a BCCI insider said on Thursday. The Ranji Trophy was set to begin on January 13 but the third wave resulted in BCCI announcing on January 4 the “postponement” of the Ranji Trophy, Col. C. K. Nayudu Trophy (U-25 men’s) and Senior Women’s T20 League. It is understood that to stage the league stage of the Ranji Trophy, the BCCI will require 35 days. However, the BCCI authorities have informally started sounding off the associations to shelve their Ranji preparatory camps. The BCCI, though, is confident that the other tournaments, including the Cooch Behar (U-19 boys’) Trophy that had to suspended ahead of quarterfinals, can be held. “The other tournaments can even clash with the IPL and we will make every effort to host as much as possible,” added the source.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ranji-set-to-be-cancelled/article38300731.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:53 IST,||Indian women begin against Malaysia||The Indian women’s hockey team will look to carry on the momentum from the historic Tokyo Olympic campaign when it opens its title defence against Malaysia in the Asia Cup here on Friday. The Indian women recorded their best-ever Olympic result after finishing fourth in Tokyo last year, narrowly missing out on a podium. The Savita Punia-led side, the most experienced in the tournament, will now be hoping to use that experience to good effect in its first major event after the Olympics. Goalkeeper Savita will lead the side in the absence of Rani Rampal, who has been rested to recover from a hamstring injury. “The best part about this team is that, many of us have been playing together for a long time and I feel this experience and team camaraderie will give us the edge over other teams. “Our main priority will be to remain focused on our game and ensure we execute the plans against each team without making errors,” Savita said on the eve of their opener. The defending champion is grouped in Pool A along with Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. After Malaysia, the Indians will play against Japan on Sunday before squaring off against Singapore in their final pool game on January 24. Positive start The Indian skipper also emphasised on the need to make a positive start to the tournament. “We have played Malaysia quite a few times in the past and they are a good side. Doing well against them will give us the right start to the tournament,” Savita said. “As a team, we believe in focusing on our own game and not worry too much about what the opponent team can or cannot do. We just want to play to our strength.” The Tokyo campaign has also been instrumental in instilling a ‘never-give-up’ attitude in the players,” she said.  The best part about this team is that, many of us have been playing together for a long time||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-women-begin-title-defence-against-malaysia/article64947624.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:58 IST,||India and Iran fail to break the deadlock||The Indian players sitting in the dugout waited with bated breath as Manisha Kalyan advanced on the left-wing and put in a cross for Pyari Xaxa. The striker made an attempt, but toe-poked the ball just wide of the post. It was the 52nd minute of the game and India had a good opportunity to take the lead against Iran. But missed chances cost the home team dear as it was held to a goalless draw in the AFC Women’s Asian Cup opener at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday. India enjoyed better ball possession and also created several chances, but failed to find the target. After it was unable to handle Iran’s technical ability and direct approach in the first half, India controlled the match in the second half. The hosts could have also gone ahead in the opening 45 minutes itself if they had been sharper. After the half-hour mark, an unmarked Manisha headed over the bar from close range. Three minutes later, Pyari miscued a shot from the edge of the box. Indumathi ran in and took possession, but blazed the ball wide and high. Coach Thomas Dennerby’s pep talk during the break seemed to worked wonders as the Indians put up a disciplined show in the second period. They produced a wave of attacks, but could not break down the Iran defence. Stunning save Substitute Grace Dangmei could have put India ahead in the 77th minute, but her header from close range was stunningly saved by Iran goalkeeper Zohreh Koudaei. The Iranians, who had qualified for the first time, stood out despite facing a higher-ranked India. Even though a goal eluded them, they left the pitch with a smile and a lot of satisfaction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-and-iran-fail-to-break-the-deadlock/article64947537.ece

The plans FIFA outlined on Thursday aim to stop wealthy clubs stockpiling players they have signed, encourage developing young talent, and promote competitive balance in football. However, curbs that should take effect in July have limited scope — players aged 21 and under are exempt from FIFA’s rules — and need further cooperation from national federations to pass their own measures. Clubs will be limited to a maximum of eight players loaned in and eight players loaned out at any one time in the 2022-23 season. The quotas will be cut to seven in the season after and six from the season starting after July 1, 2024. Clubs will also be restricted to the number of deals they can do with a favored trading partner in another country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/limits-on-player-loan-transfer-system-soon/article38301015.ece

I know he can serve big and that's already really tough,” Medvedev, the reigning US Open champion, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/medvedev-slams-low-iq-fans/article38300720.ece

Bhat of USA 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 in the boys’ quarterfinals of the Central Excise & CGST ITF Juniors tennis tournament at the BTA Complex here on Thursday. The girls’ singles quarterfinals saw top seed Shruti Ahlawat of India bettering sixth-ranked Vlada Mincheva of Russia in a contest that stretched till the decider.  The results (quarterfinals): Boys: Ruslan Tiukaev (Rus) bt Zach Stephens (GBr) 6-3, 6-4; Saheb Sodhi bt Amir Milushev (Uzb) 6-3, 6-2; Aryan Shah bt Aayush P.

Chirag Ghorpade, the schoolboy from Bengaluru, and Coimbatore veteran Arjun Balu lit up the free practice sessions with some serious pace to kickstart the third round of the MRF MMSC FMSCI Indian National Car Racing Championship 2021 at the MMRT, here on Thursday. Ghorpade, who heads the championship table, topped the two sessions in the premier MRF F1600 category with a best lap of one minute, 39.950. On the other hand, veteran Balu, piloting the Race Concepts-prepared Honda VTec, was in a league of his own in the Indian Touring Cars category. He was about a couple of seconds quicker than his nearest rivals, the Rayo Racing pair from Hyderabad Jeet Jhabakh and Ishaan Dodhiwala, both driving Volkswagen Polo. Bengaluru’s Varun Anekar (Race Concepts) and Performance Racing’s Deepak Ravikumar of Chennai, set the fastest laps in the Indian Junior Touring Cars and Super Stock categories respectively. Earlier, two teenagers from Bengaluru, Tijil Rao (Momentum Motorsport) and Ruhaan Alva (MSport), topped the two practice sessions in the Formula LGB 1300 category. Haryana’s Justin Singh put in the quickest lap of the day in the MRF Saloon Cars (Toyota Etios) with an effort of 02:03.391.   Steven Bergwijn scored two goals deep into stoppage time to snatch Tottenham a dramatic 3-2 win at Leicester in the Premier League on Wednesday. The Netherlands forward looked to have earned a draw for Spurs by driving home from close range in the fifth minute of added-on time, yet there was more drama to come. Soon after the restart, Leicester lost possession, Harry Kane played a perfectly weighted ball behind the Leicester defence and Bergwijn ran onto it, rounded goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and converted his shot off the post from an acute angle.  The results:   Premier League: Leicester 2 (Daka 24, Maddison 76) lost to Tottenham 3 (Kane 38, Bergwijn 90+5, 90+7); Brentford 1 (Toney 85) lost to Manchester United 3 (Elanga 55, Greenwood 62, Rashford 77).

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 09:57 IST,||The prized possession||The exclusive quality of the Divya Prabandha hymns is the forceful way in which we are shaken out of our ignorance over many issues pertaining to our own welfare. In a discourse, Koil Sri Devarajan Swami drew attention to Tirumangai Azhwar’s life and works that are symbolic of God’s all pervading grace which is extended to all, regardless of individual merit. It is very natural for us to be swayed by worldly attractions and wealth. These and our attainments tend to make us filled with pride and ahamkara. This was the state of Tirumangai Azhwar when he ruled over a small territory for a brief period. Azhwar confesses that by sheer God’s grace, he was not only made to realise his folly but also blessed to receive directly from Him the most prized asset, the Tirumantram. He cries out ecstatically, “I have now found that the ‘Divya Narayana Nama’ holds the key to eternal happiness that is sought by all.” Azhwar becomes a votary of God and his hymns convey his experiences of God’s grace as manifest in the archa, vibhava and antaryami forms. He realises the value of this wealth in comparison to all other kinds of worldly possessions. Since it is well secured and stored in the cave of one’s heart as stated in the Upanishads, it cannot be stolen. It is always available to the devout and can be used at any time. But at times, like material wealth which can become a burden, this wealth can also be a cause of worry or anxiety when one gets distracted or distanced from God owing to the compulsions of samsara. A common sentiment expressed by the Azhwars is one of extreme regret when they do not think of God. They feel sad if they do not remember Him even for a moment. Is not Bharata distraught when he is separated from Rama?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/the-prized-possession/article38300702.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:31 IST,||2021 among seven hottest years on record||The past seven years have been the hottest on record, the United Nations confirmed, adding that 2021 temperatures remained high despite the cooling effect of the La Nina weather phenomenon. “The warmest seven years have all been since 2015,” the UN's World Meteorological Organization said in a statement. And despite the fact that two consecutive La Nina events captured global attention for large portions of the year, 2021 still ranked among the seven warmest years on record, the WMO said. “Back-to-back La Nina events mean that 2021 warming was relatively less pronounced compared to recent years. Even so, 2021 was still warmer than previous years influenced by La Nina,” WMO chief Petteri Taalas said in the statement. This, he said, shows that "the overall long-term warming as a result of greenhouse gas increases is now far larger than the year-to-year variability in global average temperatures caused by naturally occurring climate drivers." La Nina refers to the large-scale cooling of surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, with widespread impacts on weather around the world. The phenomenon, which typically has the opposite impacts as the warming El Nino phenomenon, usually occurs every two to seven years, but has now hit twice since 2020. WMO reached its conclusions by consolidating six leading international datasets, including the European Union's Copernicus climate monitor (C3S) and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which announced similar findings last week. The datasets showed that the average global temperature in 2021 was around 1.11 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels measured between 1850 and 1900.AFP||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/2021-among-seven-hottest-years-on-record/article64947970.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:47 IST,||The sky is the limit||In April 2022 the Phyang monastery in Ladakh will welcome stargazers. Monks here suggested promoting the site as an astro hub after visiting Astrostays, a homestay on the banks of Pangong Tso. The homestay is an initiative of the Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE), which is facilitating solar energy projects in remote Himalayan villages. “The monastery felt that a stargazing experience from the Buddhist cosmology point of view would generate interest. We are working towards setting up an observatory at the monastery by March,” says Sonal Asgotraa, founder of Astrostays. Astrostays was established in 2019 in Maan village in Ladakh and in a few months, nearly 350 visitors looked through their GoTo Dobsonian telescope to track stars, planets and constellations. Guides are locals who have been trained in astronomy and taught to use the telescope. The revenue generated from the astro tourism facility was pumped back into the community to build solar water heaters. With international travel getting tougher during the pandemic, more domestic travellers are discovering the joys of astronomy clubs, local campsites and accessible destinations with spectacular night views. Astro tourism enthusiasts plan ahead and travel to experience solar eclipses, meteor showers and other celestial events. In 2020 and 2021, Chennai-based astronomer and astro-photographer Neeraj Ladia, CEO of Space Arcade, led sessions for astro-photographers and families that wanted to stargaze. They travelled to Yelagiri in groups of 20 to 30. “The hilly areas away from the city have darker skies that are conducive for stargazing. Between the first and the second waves of COVID-19, we observed people showing interest in these short trips. The open space and small gatherings made it safer,” he points out. He also recommends Kodaikanal and Jawadhu hills for astronomy getaways. “There are a few secluded, darker spots while driving from Chennai to Pondicherry via ECR; these are also good for astro-photography.” Join the astro party In India, there are efforts to tap into the growing potential of astro tourism. Plans are afoot to turn Benital village, located around 2,600 metres above sea level in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, into an astro village. The Chamoli district administration and Gurgaon-based startup Starscapes conducted a two-day ‘astro party’ in Benital in December 2021, with about 50 visitors. An astro park is in the works in Mandu, Madhya Pradesh, and in Jaipur, the State Department of Art and Culture introduced a Night Sky Tourism project after the first wave of COVID-19, to encourage visitors to look up through the telescopes set up at Jawahar Kala Kendra and Jantar Mantar. The Ladakh administration, in association with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, plans to promote astro tourism in Hanle village. Meanwhile, Starscapes is expanding its footprint by setting up observatories in Jaipur, Coorg and Udhagamandalam, among other locations. Their journey began from an observatory in Kausani, the hill station in Uttarakhand located 1,890 metres above sea level, which is a hotspot for astro-photographers Dark, clear skies Technically speaking, all you need are cloud-free, dark skies without light pollution emerging from the cities. Astro-photographers lead expeditions for photography enthusiasts, while the locals trained in astronomy do the honours in other cases. Sonal recalls being guided on a late evening trek by locals in Ladakh who knew their way merely by gazing up at the sky: The guides have the knowledge of traditional astronomy. With some training, we realised we could tap into the potential and help them earn additional income.” Starscapes and Astrostays hope to tie up with hotel chains and eco tourism operators. In the event of overcast skies, there is always the backup plan of showcasing recorded videos or teaching astro-photography. Paul Savio, co-founder and CEO of Starscapes, says the potential of astro tourism in India holds promise: “The rise in disposable income has made people look for new avenues of experiential tourism.” So far, Starscapes has had more than 40,000 look-ups (people who have purchased tickets and looked through their telescopes). “This is still a small number for a large population like ours. But there are signs of growth,” says Savio. At stargazing events, stories from science and mythology merge to form narratives like the ones screened at planetariums. Only, the live narrative changes according to the patterns on the sky. Starscapes is looking to tap into unexplored stargazing locations. “For instance, tourists in Goa can try stargazing in South Goa, where it is possible to view darker skies,” says Savio. The start-up whets the appetite of new stargazers by organising watch parties in different cities with portable telescopes. Savio adds that stargazing can be driven with the enthusiasm of children and hence tie-ups with schools and universities will also help. In Chamoli and Jaipur, for instance, they hold fun practical sessions where students stargaze and also make pin-hole cameras. Soak in a meteor shower In Gujarat, Narendra Gor has been working with the Kutch Amateur Astronomers Club since 1991, and later as part of Stargazing India team. He recalls the enthusiasm when stargazing was included in the itinerary of Rann Utsav in 2008. “Since then, several families that have come for Rann Utsav have enjoyed the astro tourism experience. I’ve met people who travelled all the way from Mumbai and Bengaluru to track meteor showers.” Stargazing India is active also in Maharashtra, Odisha (during the Konark beach festival in winter) and Chhattisgarh. Ajay Talwar has been a stargazer since the mid 1980s and took to astrophotography in the 1990s. He talks about leading budding photographers on expeditions and singles out experiences in the Himalayas, with its dust-free dark skies. He also suggests visiting the northern states during winters. “In the South, often clear skies are restricted to December and January. In Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, there are many remote locations with no citylight pollution. Indore and Ujjain are also conducive for stargazing since they are on a plateau.”  When the second wave of COVID-19 was on the decline, Gurgaon-based HR professional Sudha Reddy Patnaik and her friend Nupur Chakraborty, a marketing professional, headed to Kausani, not knowing what to expect. The hill station offered a few sightseeing experiences during the day. After dark, they visited the Starscapes observatory only to be disappointed due to the cloud cover. On day two, however, they eagerly peered through the telescopes and were awed by Jupiter and Saturn with its clearly visible rings, as well as the Andromeda galaxy. “The planets and stars moved as we gazed into the telescope,” says Nupur. The experience whetted her appetite for astro tourism. She rues having visited Ladakh in the past but not being familiar with stargazing possibilities. Her friend Sudha seconds that and says the next time around, she will take her friends and family along: “At Kausani, we were guided by an astronomy expert from the local community who was very enthusiastic. I never knew stargazing could be so much fun.”  Calling stargazers||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-sky-is-the-limit/article64947932.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:33 IST,||With a dash of peri-peri||Watching how banana chips are made is akin to watching a performance. The cook works a slicer through peeled raw bananas at top speed. Thin discs of fruit fall in rapid succession into a container below. Then, they are dropped with a flourish into a giant wok of boiling coconut oil. As the golden-yellow chips crisp up, they are scooped out with a large perforated ladle, and tossed in the air for a microsecond before being laid out on a tray. One cannot help but marvel at the chip-maker’s skill. For anyone who has grown up in Kerala, this is a familiar sight. The Malayali’s relationship with banana chips is unquestionable, not even potato in its fancy versions has been able to replace it. However, to appeal to a wider, and younger audience, the classic banana chips are now being reinterpreted. A spicy twist Alappuzha-based startup Beyond Snacks has come out with banana chip flavours such as peri-peri, salt and black pepper, and sour cream, onion and parsley. “The idea was to give the time-tested snack a global makeover,” says Manas Madhu, director of Beyond Snacks. “Attempting to contemporise banana chips did seem daunting initially, but we wanted to show that it could be a lot more than just banana chips,” he adds. The team tried out a variety of flavours before narrowing it down to a few. “The spiciness of peri peri worked really well, sour cream too complemented the original flavour; but tomato fell flat,” he adds. As an experiment, the team set up a stall at a popular consumer fair in the State and their chips were an instant hit. “We had to keep getting more stock as the demand was huge. This is when we were sure that there is scope for innovation,” Manas says. The company, which launched its banana chips in 2020, now has a manufacturing unit in Kalamassery, Kochi, and is a prominent presence on e-retail platforms delivering across the country. More flavours will be rolled out soon, such as barbecue, North Indian, and sweet and sour. It retains the ‘original style’ classic salted version, too. In Bengaluru, PR Heaven Chips has launched five new flavours developed in-house: biryani, noodles, cheese, black pepper and tomato. While biryani is aimed at an older demographic, the noodles and cheese versions appeal to younger people and children, says Anish Swaminath, general manager of PR Heaven Chips. “Unlike potato, banana has a very distinct flavour. So the new flavour should complement it,” he adds. Anish continues, “Though banana chips are a Malayali staple, we seem to consume potato and tapioca chips more than banana, perhaps because we have always shied away from contemporising it.” Launched in November 2021, PR Heaven Chips has its manufacturing unit in Thrissur and will soon be sold through distributors in the State and supermarkets. Delhi-based Motherland Aromatic South has tied up with the 55-year-old, Coimbatore-based traditional chips maker A1 Chips to bring in a twist to tradition. Banana chips with the flavour of curry leaves, thin chips with rock salt, and sweet ripe ones are the versions sold online. “We wanted to give a gourmet aesthetic to banana chips and tap into another socio-economic bracket,” says Devika Mohan, the brand manager. Now, even traditional players are welcoming change. A1 Chips has over 11 flavours, including chilli masala, Malabar masala, salsa masala, sweet chilli, pepper, aloo tandoori and honey for a sweet touch. “It is all about adapting to newer tastes. Banana chips are our signature product, and anything we add to it only improves its value,” says Sudeesh Dhamodaran, joint managing director of A1 Chips. The brand has 53 outlets in various parts of south India, all of which have these varieties. Sudeesh, however, loves to eat original Kerala banana chips dipped in lime pickle. “It is the best,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/with-a-dash-of-peri-peri/article64947699.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:45 IST,||Pause and effect||Much of the trauma faced by humankind — from plagues to wars — has been fictionalised and made immortal through art. The time of dread, as Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison puts it, “is precisely the time when artists go to work”. COVID-19 has been an unprecedented event in the history of humankind, and artists, over the past two years, have found a way to merge these realities into art, ranging from poetry and to novels to cinema.  The pandemic is becoming a movie genre in itself, where the films are not just being made during the phase, but also about them. Amazon Prime’s 2020 anthology Unpaused is one such example. Now, they are back with season two titled Unpaused: Naya Safar with five new shorts. Excerpts from an interview with Shikha Makan and Neena Kulkarni, the director-actor duo from one of the shorts, Gond Ke Laddu: Over the years we have seen a lot of anthologies on OTT platforms. What do you think about this sub-genre? lShikha: It is a very interesting format because it gives you the freedom to play with the craft aspect of storytelling and also be able to make a point across.  The sheer diversity of thought, ideas and expression are creatively very interesting to engage with as a filmmaker. It also helps the audience make more choices. Neena: I did a project called Gandha (Fragrance) in Marathi where the director Sachin Kuldalkar had directed three films unrelated to each other but carrying the same thing theme (the sense of smell). It is like reading short stories and it is a wonderful opportunity for that many people to come on board.  Neena, what has OTT platforms brought for you as an actor? lOh lots, lots! I come from a time when there were only plays and films. Later, I got into television. I have seen a lot of mediums, like daily soaps or short films, take shape and thrive. It is also very interesting for the actor to see a new medium because there are new ideas to be exchanged. Shikha, when you are telling the story of a pandemic, an ongoing calamity, what are some of the challenges that you face? lIf you are compelled to tell a story because of the circumstance, then you are immersed in it as a filmmaker. It is a matter of perspective, what approach you take, how you are looking at the pandemic around you and also how it has affected you. Certain things influence you and if you can portray that in a story in a way that it resonated with a lot of people, then that’s good. Human stories are stories that we are always seeking, whether they are tragic or light-hearted.  What inspired your short, Gond Ke Laddu ?   lThere are two parts in this story: an old mother living alone in a small town who desires to send something special to her daughter. The other part of the story touches upon the realities of a delivery agent and his wife. Gond Ke Laddu connects these stories with an unexpected twist.  During lockdown, it was very common for me and my friends to worry about our parents who were living away. In my family, food made at home holds a lot of value. At the same time, there were a lot of stories written about delivery agents as they were almost at the frontline. Neena, what are some of the things that you would want to face to challenge yourself as an actor? lI have acted in almost all genres. Now, it is about enjoying what comes my way and also being curious about why I have been chosen for this particular role. There is a lot of competition even amongst senior actors so you cannot be complacent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/pause-and-effect/article64947945.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:47 IST,||A jewel in the hills||“At first, I couldn’t believe my eyes,” recalls Pravin Shanmughanandam, a birding enthusiast. He was looking at a gorgeous bird perched atop a tree at the Anamalai Hills near Pollachi, a mountain range of the Western Ghats, considered one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in the world. “It was evening. First, I saw a pair of Tickell’s blue flycatchers. Once the flycatchers took off, this colourful bird showed up right in front of me. I was unsure of photographing it as my camera was in the backseat of the car. Luckily, the bird stayed on, bobbing its head and looking for a prey, perhaps a crab, lizard or small fish.” It was the oriental dwarf kingfisher, cherished by bird-watchers as a ‘Jewel of the Western Ghats’, and much adored for its bright and beautiful appearance. “One of the smallest among kingfishers, it sports red, violet, blue and yellow colours and is endemic to coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent and countries of South-East Asia too,” says Pravin, co-founder of Pollachi Papyrus, a magazine that promotes responsible tourism. While the Konkan coast along the Western Ghats is a stronghold for this species (where bird watchers flock to during themonsoon to photograph them in pairs during breeding), Pravin was surprised to spot it at the edge of the reserve forest, and proximate to human activity. “They were a pair, busy hunting. I could only get a glimpse before they disappeared into the thickets. I managed to get a few images of one of the individuals.”His observation becomes the first record of the species in Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) and the first photographic record in the Anamalais, which covers a bigger landscape including Nelliampathy, Eravikulam, Parambikulam and Vazhachal in Kerala. The Anamalai Hills are home to large mammals such as the Asiatic elephant, tiger, leopard, as well as endangered species like wild dogs, Nilgiri tahr, and lion tailed macaques. They are also home to all the 18 endemic bird species of the Western Ghats. Peter Prem, field biologist at ATR has observed that over 300 species have been recorded across the five ranges that comprise 954 square kilometres of reserve forests. A thriving ecosystem The latest addition to the list is the oriental dwarf kingfisher, also known as the three-toed, black-backed, or miniature kingfisher. “This is exciting news for Nature enthusiasts. Researchers say it comes as a no-surprise given the ATR consists of various types of habitats such as thorny scrub, dry and moist deciduous, riverine forest, tropical rainforest and shola-grassland. Man-made habitats such as monoculture plantations and large reservoirs harbour a variety of birds,” says Pravin. The bird is only slightly larger than a medium-sized hummingbird and measures 12.5 to 14 centimetres in length (including bill and tail). They are highly territorial when selecting their habitation range. Normally, these territories are located where ample food sources are available. Says Pravin, “The record in the region becomes significant and calls for conservation of critical habitats.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-jewel-in-the-hills/article64947934.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:47 IST,||With a dash of peri-peri||Watching how banana chips are made is akin to watching a performance. The cook works a slicer through peeled raw bananas at top speed. Thin discs of fruit fall in rapid succession into a container below. Then, they are dropped with a flourish into a giant wok of boiling coconut oil. As the golden-yellow chips crisp up, they are scooped out with a large perforated ladle, and tossed in the air for a microsecond before being laid out on a tray. One cannot help but marvel at the chip-maker’s skill. For anyone who has grown up in Kerala, this is a familiar sight. The Malayali’s relationship with banana chips is unquestionable, not even potato in its fancy versions has been able to replace it. However, to appeal to a wider, and younger audience, the classic banana chips are now being reinterpreted. A spicy twist Alappuzha-based startup Beyond Snacks has come out with banana chip flavours such as peri-peri, salt and black pepper, and sour cream, onion and parsley. “The idea was to give the time-tested snack a global makeover,” says Manas Madhu, director of Beyond Snacks. “Attempting to contemporise banana chips did seem daunting initially, but we wanted to show that it could be a lot more than just banana chips,” he adds. The team tried out a variety of flavours before narrowing it down to a few. “The spiciness of peri peri worked really well, sour cream too complemented the original flavour; but tomato fell flat,” Manas adds. As an experiment, the team set up a stall at a popular consumer fair in the State and their chips were an instant hit. “We had to keep getting more stock as the demand was huge. This is when we were sure that there is scope for innovation,” Manas says. The company, which launched its banana chips in 2020, now has a manufacturing unit in Kalamassery, Kochi, and is a prominent presence on e-retail platforms delivering across the country.More flavours will be rolled out soon, such as barbecue, North Indian and sweet and sour. It retains the ‘original style’ classic salted version, too. In Bengaluru, PR Heaven Chips has launched five new flavours developed in-house: biryani, noodles, cheese, black pepper and tomato. While biryani is aimed at an older demographic, the noodles and cheese versions appeal to younger people and children, says Anish Swaminath, general manager of PR Heaven Chips. “Unlike potato, banana has a very distinct flavour. So the new flavour should complement it,” he adds. Anish continues, “Though banana chips are a Malayali staple, we seem to consume potato and tapioca chips more than banana, perhaps because we have always shied away from contemporising it.” Launched in November 2021, PR Heaven Chips has its manufacturing unit in Thrissur and will soon be sold through distributors in the State and supermarkets. Delhi-based Motherland Aromatic South has tied up with the 55-year-old, Coimbatore-based traditional chips maker A1 Chips to bring in a twist to tradition. Banana chips with the flavour of curry leaves, thin chips with rock salt and sweet ripe ones are the versions sold online. “We wanted to give a gourmet aesthetic to banana chips and tap into another socio-economic bracket,” says Devika Mohan, brand manager.  Now, even traditional players are welcoming change. A1 Chips has over 11 flavours, including chilli masala, Malabar masala, salsa masala, sweet chilli, pepper, aloo tandoori and honey for a sweet touch. “It is all about adapting to newer tastes. Banana chips are our signature product, and anything we add to it only improves its value,” says Sudeesh Dhamodaran, joint managing director of A1 Chips. The brand has 53 outlets in various parts of South India, all of which have these varieties. Sudeesh, however, loves to eat original Kerala banana chips dipped in lime pickle. “It is the best,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/with-a-dash-of-peri-peri/article64947935.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:45 IST,||To be 17 again||Somewhere in 2013, ‘Darbuka’ Siva decided to take a break from the music scene. Ironically, it was the same year he was selected for OneBeat, an initiative of the US State Department that brings together musicians from all over the world for creative collaborations. During this period, Siva began to look inwards, rummaging through memories of his high school years. He maintains that creativity comes from memories; although there was no starting point to any of these, except for the snapshots that presented themselves.  “It’s like a dream; you never know when it actually begins and remember only the middle part and what happens before you wake up. For me, composing a piece of music is akin to a dream. As was writing for Mudhal Nee Mudivum Nee ( MNMN ). It is this collection of memories that I kept going back to,” says Siva over phone, ahead of the film’s premiere on Zee5 on January 21.   Siva had the idea and flow; he knew exactly at which point the story needed to begin and where it needed to end. But all these thoughts resided in his head without a form until one day, Siva put them to paper. “Whenever I share my school memories with people, they get super stoked. I thought it would be exciting to work on the story. I kept grinding the idea before I started writing the script. MNMN is still 50% fact and 50% fiction but I won’t tell which is what,” he adds with a laugh.  Of course, there was the element of nostalgia that he wanted to reflect through his work. But Siva says he wanted to steer clear of romanticising the 90s era. “Growing up is always a fascination. I’m sure 30 years from now, someone will make a film about the 2020s,” he says, adding, “More than anything, things seemed to have been simpler back then… our sensibilities have changed now.”  Seventeen is a tricky age to cross — be it your high school sweetheart or dealing with your first heartbreak. It is that hormonal phase that prepares you for the real world, as highlighted in MNMN ’s trailer. By recreating the memories he grew up with, it is safe to assume Siva was in a way preserving what was deeply personal.  He says revisiting these moments was the fun part of the writing, but the catch was to stitch them in a cohesive fashion. “For me, a very intense moment is not very different from say a romantic or funny incident. I tend to put them on the same scale. In a way, what I realised was, I kind of miss all these moments.” Order in chaos Right from the start, Siva was adamant about not casting stars. He wanted actors who do not come with baggages. Filmmaker Gautham Menon put out the audition announcement on Twitter, after which Siva received over 5,000 applicants. From the shortlisted 50, he picked 13 to play the primary characters. Two months after training all the actors, mostly newcomers, Siva called his technicians and made his actors enact the entire film like a play in front of them. “Because this was my first film, I had to finish four-five scenes a day. Filmmaking, at the end of the day, is all about execution.”  In MNMN , Siva also serves as the music director. Does that come with added pressure? “It actually eased a bit of pressure,” says Siva, admitting that he did not want to be indulgent because of his dual roles as director and composer.  “When I make music for others, I always put my thoughts in the backseat. It is nice to get perspective from others because, if you are also the director, you just get carried away sometimes.”  The biggest takeaway for Siva was the fascination — of converting an idea into a film and seeing it materialise in an inspiring way. But Siva will fondly remember MNMN for an even better reason. He met his wife, Purva Raghunath, who plays Catherine Mersey in the film during the course of filming. “She came for the audition and made it through. We got married last year. In fact, it is inspiring how art and life collides sometimes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/to-be-17-again/article64947943.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:46 IST,||A bagful of memories||“Divide them equally between yourself and your brother,” instructs my mother in a grave tone, adding: “No fighting.” She is not talking about family property. My mother decided to give away her precious manjal pai collection last week. Some of which are real gems, dating back to when telephone numbers consisted of five digits. They bear names of retail stores such as Anto Cutpiece Centre, Madras, AG & Co Jewellers, Madurai, SR Gunavathy Lucky Centre, Kumily, and were handed down to her by her father.   The yellow cloth bag is back in the limelight, thanks to Meendum Manjapai, a campaign that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin launched last month. “One never bought a manjal pai ,” says Tamil writer Perumal Murugan. “They were given to you when you went shopping to say, a textile store.”   He has fond memories of eating groundnuts and sweet tubers off the bags when he was a little boy. “I would accompany my grandmother when she visited my aunt in a village five kilometres from Tiruchengode,where we lived,” he recalls: “We travelled by foot and I vividly remember her manjal pai . She always carried something to eat for my aunt.” Perumal Murugan says that he continues to use the bags for vegetable shopping. “But people look down on it these days,” he adds, chuckling: “There have been times when my children refused to come out with me if I carried a manjal pai .”   About the size of an A4 sheet, the manjal pai is more than just a cloth bag. “It is a framework for sustainability,” says Krishnan N Subramanian, who runs YellowBag, a Madurai-based organisation that makes cloth bags.  “It satisfies all parameters for a sustainable product: has a long shelf-life, can be washed and reused, can be recycled as a dust cloth once worn out, is locally-made. I know of women in Madurai who paid for their children’s school fees by stitching the bags,” he says.  The manjal pai ’s roots can be traced to the fact that South Indians associate the colour yellow with auspiciousness. “Which is perhaps why the bag came in that colour,” says 82-year-old M Velayutham, the founder of publishing house Vijaya Pathipagam, Coimbatore. “Families used the bags to give wedding favorsof coconuts and fruits. On it, they printed names of the couple along with the date of the wedding. I printed some for my daughter’s wedding in 1989,” he remembers.  People did not employ the bags only for shopping. “I used it as a school bag,” says Velayutham, recalling how he would walk with it in the crook of his arm. “I also took it when I travelled light,” he adds. Velayutham recalls that khaki bags made from the fabric spun at Binny Mills, in erstwhile Madras, were once popular too. So were slightly big white ones in which lentils and rice were sold. Reused and repurposed  “My mother would tailor these into pillow covers with the printed portion turned inwards,” recalls A Pandimadevi, whose father owned a grocery shop in Dindigul. “Father used the same manjal pai for years, in which he carried the keys of the shop,” recalls the 60-year-old. “The first thing he did once back home was hang the bag by a nail on the wall.”  The bags have also been used to carry cash. “A businessman myself, I remember placing cash inside, folding it and walking with it secured at the armpit,” says MPratapKumar, who runsGem & Co at George Town. “Stand at a street corner in North Chennai and you will see that it is still used by a lot of people today, especially senior citizens,” he observes.  With vintage value and precious memories associated with it, it is no wonder that some people will not part with their manjal pai . “My grandmother had a few that she would refuse to give away to her daughter or daughter-in-law no matter what,” laughs Krishnan. And as for my mother, I am sure she has another secret stash hidden in her almirah.   It has a long shelf-life, can be washed and reused, can be recycled as a dust cloth once worn out Krishnan N Subramanian, YellowBag||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-bagful-of-memories/article64947938.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:47 IST,||Eye on greater heights||When Snenthra Babu was seven, she watched her father, Babu Ponnuswamy, play billiards and snooker with his friends at their community hall. The green baize table and colourful balls fascinated young Snenthra. She would stare at how the balls collided with a ‘tik’ sound and sank into holes in the corners of the table. Since she was tall and viewing the table was not a problem, her dad would let her play occasionally.  Seeing her natural affinity for the sport, Babu asked her one day if she would take it up seriously if he hired a coach. “I was surprised at how she did not even think twice before saying yes,” he recalls. This was in 2018. Four years later, Snenthra is a National-level billiards champion, winning a sub-junior gold medal at the National Billiards and Snooker Championships 2021 in Bhopal. She also won bronze in the junior category in the event held in December. Just two months before that, she won five medals (two golds, two bronzes, and a silver) at the State-level billiards and snooker tournament organised by Tamil Nadu Billiards and Snooker Association (TNBSA) in Chennai. Three years ago, she participated at the World Open Under-16 Snooker Championships in Russia. Snenthra owes much of her success to her coaches Naveen and Prem Prakash, a 25-plus-time State champion in billiards. Her parents and school, she adds, are also supportive of her sporting pursuit. Without their backing, it can get difficult to juggle sports and studies because she has to train for seven to eight hours a day. Cue sports might appear deceivingly easy. But it is not, says Snenthra. “You need to think a lot. It is not just about you winning a point with a shot. You must also play in such a way that it is difficult for your opponent to score. So, every shot you attempt is important. Unless you keep practising them, you cannot get it right in the tournament where you are under pressure.” Medals apart, billiards and snooker have taught her the virtues that she applies to her life outside sport. “Without patience and focus, you cannot excel in this game. With snooker, especially, you need a bit of luck as well. With more balls on the table, it is a highly uncertain game. So, at times, you need to accept your luck and adapt quickly to the situation.” After her success at the National level, Snenthra is preparing to test her mettle in an international event, the World Women’s Billiards, which is scheduled in Europe this May. Her immediate target is to win a medal at this event. And her long-term goal is Olympic success. Besides individual glory, Snenthra wants to take cue sports to greater heights in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/eye-on-greater-heights/article64947933.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:46 IST,||Now, drink from a rice bran teacup||Recently, a video of a man showcasing products made from rice bran went viral. In the video, posted on Twitter by Supriya Sahu, Principal Secretary of Environment Climate Change & Forests of Tamil Nadu, the man holds up eco-friendly food containers, cups and glasses. She wrote, “Food containers made out of rice bran are leak proof, affordable, disposable and earth friendly. Hotels, restaurants, food joints, it’s time for you to stop using banned plastic packaging in Tamil Nadu and switch to sustainable eco alternatives #meendummanjappai #Manjapai.” Later, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor retweeted and urged the Government to scale up production of such eco-friendly alternatives for daily use. “Madam visited our stall at an exhibition in Chennai organised by the Tamil Nadu Government to promote the Meendum Manjappai campaign. After she shared the video, I have been getting a number of calls. People are eager to know more,” says Kalyan Kumar, the man in the video. So far a millet exporter from Trichy has approached him to repurpose 12 tonnes of millet waste, a farmer from Panruti connected to find ways to upcycle rice straws, and several coir farmers from the Pollachi belt near Coimbatore have asked for ways to utilise coir waste. Reduce, recycle and reuse  Kalyan’s modest machinery unit, SPS Kalyan Machine Designers, located at Mathampallayam, 25 kilometres from Coimbatore, has been getting a steady stream of visitors ever since the video went viral. “Any chakkai (organic waste) can be upcycled using the multi-biodegradable machine that we make here,” says Kalyan, holding up a tray made from banana fibre. Along with rice bran and areca leaf plates stacked on his table, there are air-tight food boxes made using saw dust from teak wood. Tea cups made from discarded red chilli stalks also vie for attention. “This can be used to serve hot beverages like soups,” he adds.   Kalyan says the machine can recycle as many as 15 raw materials, including rice bran, rice husk, rice straw, wheat bran, and nine types of non-poisonous wood powder, tamarind seeds, and peanut shells. “Even vegetable waste like skin of stick tubers ( kuchi kelangu), banana tree, and discarded banana branches can become raw material,” he explains.  Over the last two years, he has supplied machines across Tamil Nadu as well as Sri Lanka, Australia, and Saudi Arabia. One of his latest machines will soon be dispatched to a customer in Belgium to repurpose beer waste into wine glasses and tea cups. “The ratio is 700 grams of organic waste to 300 grams of food grade solution, which I provide (he has patented this), to make the end product. Name any organic waste, I can give you a ready solution,” he says with an air of confidence. While initially they made machines that relied on a single raw material, for example areca leaves, to make plates and spoons, later he experimented with saw dust and rice bran, which are available across all seasons in South India. “Used rice bran tea cups can be easily converted into animal food or manure,” says Kalyan, adding that anyone can make a profit of up to Rs. 30,000 per month as the machines can be scaled up to make 2,000 cups (in 60 ml to 120 ml sizes) per day. The cost starts from Rs. 4 lakh and can go up to Rs. 40 lakhs. Caring for the environment is the key, reiterates Kalyan who also tapped into the demand for eco-friendly air tight-food containers during the pandemic. “If we have to cut down on use of paper and plastic cups, we have to constantly innovate. For tea cups, we can also provide a bottom guard to paste seeds and it can be used for mass dispersal of seeds for green drives. Cups made with rice bran and coir can be used for packaging glass items, especially for export markets.” Kalyan advocates recycling waste. “A used paper cup stays the same for three years. But the bio-degradable products degrade within eight hours of contact with water. At meetings with tea shop owners we learnt that they prefer paper and plastic cups because of easy availability. An eco-friendly alternative like a rice bran cup (in which the beverage stays warm for up to 45 minutes!) can enter that space only with awareness and mass production,” he says, adding, “It is very encouraging when people come forward and buy such innovations. It gives us hope.” For details, call 9597715496  H.ead||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/now-drink-from-a-rice-bran-teacup/article64947940.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:45 IST,||Muhurtam in the metaverse||While most brides and grooms are stressed about booking a venue and shopping for trousseaus and more, Dinesh SP and his fiancée Janaganandhini Ramaswamy are busy planning a metaverse. When Tamil Nadu announced a Sunday lockdown, guest lists were limited to 100 people. The couple, wanting their family and friends present, decided to revise their plans for the Sunday festivities. Introducing a virtual setting of the metaverse for their February 6 wedding reception so they could invite as many people as they wish; the virtual guest list stands at around 2,500 now. Dinesh admits that some have not been so readily accepting of this concept. He understands, though, as many are still adjusting to virtual calls in lieu of offline face-to-face meetings. “I had to explain to a lot of people what the metaverse even was,” admits Dinesh. He adds “I was happy to do that, especially with elders where I had to shift the language to compare it to a video game. Once they understood that all that needed to do was use a login for the website, they were excited. It may take five years for India to integrate the metaverse so I also wanted Indians to experience this now and why not through a wedding?” A project manager at IIT Madras, Dinesh is no stranger to emerging tech. For this event, he approached fellow metaverse evangelist Vignesh Selvaraj, the CEO of Chennai-based startup TardiVerse that uses blockchain tech to create meta-spaces. Vignesh and his team of around seven people were immediately on board with the idea and worked round the clock to make it happen. So how does one get in? Aside from having to be on the guest list, Dinesh points out the meta-reception will have a gateway in the form of a blockchain wallet that requires a unique and secure login. Once a guest logs in, they can choose from some preset avatars. Then, they can move about in the virtual reception space and greet the couple. The best part? All of this is set at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry’s Great Hall. Dinesh and Janaganandhini, having first met on a work project, share a mutual love for all things Harry Potter and the two thought, given the malleable nature of the metaverse, why not celebrate their love at the famous feast hall? One has to ask: will there be virtual food on display such as biryani or even Butterbeer perhaps? Dinesh chuckles, “There’s an idea! I’ll check on getting that put in this week.”  Amid the complex tech, family lies at the heart of the meta-reception. An avatar of Janaganandhini’s father who passed away in April 2021 will be ‘present’. “I thought to give life to my future father-in-law in the metaverse,” says Dinesh. Though the event is taking place at Hogwarts, tradition is still important to the couple; their avatars will be dressed in a sari and a veshti. “Ultimately, while I love technology and blockchain and metaverse,” concludes Dinesh proudly, “this whole thing is a gift for my girl.”  All of this is set at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry’s Great Hall.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:45 IST,||What happened before War and Peace?||When filmmaker Venkateshkumar G was cleaning a cupboard in his Valasaravakkam house in 2019, he stumbled upon an old Tamil book penned by his great grandfather, Rao Sahib K Kothandapani Pillai, an Indian diplomat and a Tamil scholar.  The book, titled Kadhaimanikkovai: Stories from Tolstoy , was a translation of three stories of the great Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy and was published in 1932 as a text book in the Madrs Presidency.  “I had heard the name ‘Leo Tolstoy’ but didn’t know much about him. I read that translated book with great interest,” recalls Venkateshkumar, over a Zoom call. He sent a digital copy of the book to the Leo Tolstoy Museum at Yasnaya Polyana, Russia, which was delighted to receive it. The museum curators, in turn, invited him to Russia, for which Venkateshkumar prepared and presented a speech on Tolstoy’s influence on Tamil literature. His fascination for Tolstoy started then. It slowly became an obsession, with the filmmaker reading up as much material as he could find on him. Venkateshkumar, who has done two feature films in Tamil apart from a bunch of shorts, is now set to start his dream project: a Russian film on Leo Tolstoy.  Featuring the events leading to the writing of Tolstoy’s epic War and Peace , the film is slated to kickstart in Russia soon, once pandemic restrictions lift. “There has been material on Tolstoy’s life, but very few tend to focus on his student life at Kazan University and the many events that shaped his outlook forwards life, which led to the writing of the classic War and Peace .

A tryst with cinema  A decade ago, Venkateshkumar had a full-time corporate career, when he fancied making short films and thus worked on a short titled White Dirt on manual scavenging.  “I was busy at office when I received a call,” he recalls, “The person said, ‘Balu Mahendra has watched your short in the Internet and wants to meet you’. I immediately excused myself and rushed off.”  At Cinema Pattarai, a film school that the veteran late Tamil filmmaker ran, White Dirt was screened to its students. Afterwards, Balu Mahendra beckoned Venkateshkumar and said three words, “ Ithu dan cinema. (This is cinema).”  It spurred Venkateskumar to take up filmmaking in a bigger way.  He went on to direct other documentaries and features, including Lightman , which portrays the life of lightmen in Tamil cinema.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:46 IST,||Vultures, demystified||Bharathidasan Subbiah has spent the past 10 years on the ground in various parts of Tamil Nadu, studying vultures — their habits, habitations, patterns and problems. There was a lot to document and understand, it was seven years into the process that he felt he knew enough to write on the subject. “I started writing my book three years ago,” says the conservationist over phone from Coimbatore, “And only now is it ready.”  Titled In Search of Vultures , the book is published by Kalamkriya, the social interest publication wing of Chennai-based Sanmar Group. It is bilingual and heavy on information and images. Every page — and sometimes every column — written by Bharathidasan in Tamil, sits beside its counterpart translated into English. It lists facts as simple as the number of vulture species in existence on the planet, in the country, and in the State, as well as explaining issues as complex as the biochemical hazards endangering these birds. In between, it also weaves in instances of vultures being included in various cultures, mythologies and rituals, establishing them as an inherent part of human existence.  As the book’s name suggests, Bharathidasan’s focus is on the fact that the creature, once a common sight across the State, is becoming rarer and rarer to come by. The reasons for this are many, and human activity is more to blame than other phenomenon. This is not a claim made lightly, as the book relies not only on Bharathidasan’s own research, but also on the works of other conservationists and filmmakers. “As critical as the vulture is to our ecosystem, it is sad to see that even today, the bird is seen in a negative light,” he rues, highlighting the need for simple, accessible information that can turn this tide.  The author-conservationist believes that there is enough information out there to change public perception of the bird. The most stark example, featured in the book, is a town called Thirukazhukundram. Located near Chengalpattu, the town (named after the bird) has a temple whose priests had been feeding prasadam to vultures till well into the late 1900s. “I was a very young child when the late ornithologist Salim Ali wrote about witnessing these birds partake of temple prasadam .

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:33 IST,||Vultures, demystified||Bharathidasan Subbiah has spent the past 10 years on the ground in various parts of Tamil Nadu studying vultures — their habits, habitations, patterns and problems. There was a lot to document and understand, it was seven years into the process that he felt he knew enough to write on the subject. “I started writing my book three years ago,” says the conservationist over phone from Coimbatore, “And only now is it ready.”  Titled In Search of Vultures , the book is published by Kalamkriya, the social interest publication wing of Chennai-based Sanmar Group. It is bilingual and heavy on information and images. Every page — and sometimes every column — written by Bharathidasan in Tamil, sits beside its counterpart translated into English. It lists facts as simple as the number of vulture species in existence on the planet, in the country, and in the State, as well as explaining issues as complex as the biochemical hazards endangering these birds. In between, it also weaves in instances of vultures being included in various cultures, mythologies and rituals, establishing them as an inherent part of human existence.  As the book’s name suggests, Bharathidasan’s focus is on the fact that the creature, once a common sight across the State, is becoming rarer and rarer to come by. The reasons for this are many, and human activity is more to blame than other phenomenon. This is not a claim made lightly, as the book relies not only on Bharathidasan’s own research, but also on the works of other conservationists and filmmakers. “As critical as the vulture is to our ecosystem, it is sad to see that even today, the bird is seen in a negative light,” he rues, highlighting the need for simple, accessible information that can turn this tide.  The author-conservationist believes that there is enough information out there to change public perception of the bird. The most stark example, featured in the book, is a town called Thirukazhukundram. Located near Chengalpattu, the town (named after the bird) has a temple whose priests had been feeding prasadam to vultures till well into the late 1900s. “I was a very young child when the late ornithologist Salim Ali wrote about witnessing these birds partake of temple prasadam . I remember being fascinated by the idea, of members of a purely scavenger species eating sakkara pongal . But it did happen, and it was documented, though the ritual had stopped long before I could eventually visit the place,” he says.  In his book, Bharathidasan mentions not only the writings of naturalists and ornithologists who have either witnessed or tried to explain these incidents (and their gradual dwindling), but also Buddhist, Hindu and other scriptures that mention something similar. The intention here is to understand why this deviation from the norm occurred and why it stopped. “We tell this story on field when we want people to feel interested in vultures,” says Bharathidasan, signing off with, “It helps create a bit of intrigue.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/vultures-demystified/article64947700.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:46 IST,||The travelling bun||“Master, oru tea!”: This command forms the background score at RMS Sweets Marimuthu Tea Stall, located at Gopalpatti. The small-town, 47 kilometres from Madurai, is popular for tamarind, fragrant senthooram mangoes, and a unique, fluffy sweet treat — paal buns.   We elbow our way into the crowded shop one evening — past a gaggle of schoolboys ordering vadas , farmers biting into murukku and khaki-clad bus drivers sipping tea — and arrive at the glass counter, where the buns await.   The shop, which has been around for almost three decades, has been making paal buns for 24 years now. It is among the town’s most popular haunts for the delicacy. “Maida, curd, cooking soda, and sugar,” lists M Shubash, the owner, explaining how the snack is made. “We knead the dough at around 10 am and let it ferment for half-an-hour. Then, we roll small sections, fry them in hot oil, and drop them into sugar syrup.”   Every tea shop at Gopalpatti, which has around 3,000 houses, boasts a hefty aluminium tray bearing the golden buns, each the size of a big lemon. Unlike at tea shops in other parts of Tamil Nadu where vadas and bajjis dominate, in this small town, most customers order paal buns first, following them with something spicy, before washing it all down with hot tea. The snack tastes like a squishy badhusha — soft and mildly sweet as you make your way into the centre.   R Raj Mohan, a driver at a local Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus, tells us that he has picked up the buns for several friends over the years. “The moment anyone hears I travel the Gopalpatti route, they ask for paal buns,” he smiles. Though they have been popular with the locals for over four decades, it is the tourists and travellers who made them popular.  “Gopalpatti is the only small-town in the vicinity for villagers nearby who want to shop for clothes or jewellery,” says Shubash. “Pilgrims who travel by foot to Palani from Madurai and Karaikudi too pass by,” he adds. Gradually, the snack travelled from the small tea shops of Gopalpatti.  A few blocks down the road, is Thamodharan Tea Stall. It is here that we trace the history of this snack. Between handing customers paal buns, K Narayanan, who runs the place describes how they have been making these buns for 40 years. “It all began in Alanganallur,” says Narayanan, pausing to drop coins into a drawer. He adds, “They make something similar at tea shops there. Many years ago, a ‘master’ from the town, arrived at Gopalpatti. He introduced it here and gradually, it caught the fancy of locals and tourists alike.”   N Suppuraja, the oldest employee at RMS Sweets knows the story well. He has been at the shop from the time it was started. “It didn’t move well the first day we put it up for sale,” says the toothless 75-year-old. But before he knew it, paal buns were disappearing off their trays. “It is called ‘paal’ bun of all things,” he chuckles. “But there is not a drop of milk in it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-travelling-bun/article64947937.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 05:58 IST,||King of the road||Tam-Tam. Tempo. Tuk-Tuk. Auto. Depending on which part of the country or world you come from, you would know the autorickshaw by one of these names. This taken-for-granted vehicle has quite a chequered history and continues to re-invent itself even today. Beginnings The story of the auto rickshaw, as we know it in India, begins around 80 years ago. Italy was badly hit during World War II. As part of the post-war revival effort, it was important to get people and goods up and running. However, Italy typically had narrow urban streets and steeply sloping narrow hilly roads, which were in a poor state. Piaggio, an Italian company now known across the world for its scooters, was a big manufacturer of fighter jets during the war efforts. Its jet manufacturing facility had been bombed and, in any case, there was no demand for fighter jets. Corradino D’Ascanio, Piaggio’s talented aircraft designer, came up with the idea for a two-wheeler, which he called the Vespa (meaning wasp in Italian). The scooter got people moving but the problem of transporting goods remained. D’Ascanio again put his skills to use to design a three-wheeled ‘Ape’ (meaning ‘bee’ in Italian) in 1947. The name from the humming sound made by the engine. The Ape had from the bee like sound it’s engine made with a flat goods carrier at the back. In India Around the same time, a newly independent India was looking for self-reliance and self-respect. N.K. Firodia, a doyen of Force Motors, a freedom fighter and industrialist, saw the photo of this ‘three-wheel’ goods carrier in a trade magazine. He bought a Vespa and a couple of Apes, studied them, made several modifications and showed them to Prime Minister Nehru and Home Minister Morarji Desai, both of whom were impressed. In collaboration with Piaggio and Bajaj Auto (then known by a different name), production began in Pune. The Ape became the Auto Rickshaw and transformed into a very popular passenger vehicle. It soon spread other countries as well. By 1971, Bajaj Auto began manufacturing autos independently. While it continues to have a major share of the manufacturing, other companies include TVS, Mahindra, Atul Lohia and others. Piaggio shifted its Ape manufacturing to India. D’Ascanio probably would have never dreamt that one day his humble transport vehicle would become more than a passenger and goods vehicles. Today autos are used as sales carts and even mini fire engines. Any surprise then that EV versions are also coming up?  The scooter got people moving but the problem of transporting goods remained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/king-of-the-road/article64947809.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 05:57 IST,||Inspired by Nature||Hanuman and Nala are playing with the miniature rockets they made earlier. Nala: Hanuman, did you know that it was believed that VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) machines that travelled straight up were a better mode of transport? But when it comes to efficient and safe travel, it has been proven that STOL (Short run Take-Off and Landing) machines that travel like birds and have a short runway to take off and land are the best.  Hanuman: Really? But why?  Nala: Taken an example from Kali Yuga. The balloon rocket we made were invented in 400 BC by Archytas and was called the ‘Wooden pigeon’. But, even after 2000 years, the technology has progressed very slowly due to the high-risk factors involved and the limited methods to test them.  Hanuman: Tell me, how did the modern-day planes come to be?  Nala: A scientist named Otto Lilienthal, who patented the gliders, ended up losing his life in a glider accident. The Wright brothers, who were big fans of Lilienthal, were sad to learn of his death. They resolved to build a successful flying machine and modified Lilienthal’s model. After seven years of hard work, they built a successful vimana: the “Kitty Hawk flyer”.  Hanuman: What was the modification they made in Lilienthal’s glider?  Nala: Lilienthal was unable to control the glider. And the Wright brothers found the solution in Nature.  Hanuman: How?  Nala: Have you noticed how birds fly? They use the tail to control their direction. The Wright Brothers implemented the same mechanism to build the first successful controllable glider and then added engines. It became an aeroplane!  Hanuman: Wow! That sounds so simple...  Nala: But, in reality, it was not as easy as it sounds. The Wright Brothers failed so often but they never gave up.  Hanuman: Sigh! I wish I could build something too...  Nala: Why not? We can build a plane too!  Hanuman: Are you serious? But how?  Nala: We can build a bi-plane using ice cream sticks and glue.  Hanuman: What is a bi-plane?  Nala: A plane with two main wings stacked one above the other. Just like the Wright Brothers’ first model.  Nala: Let’s build a static model this time. Next time, we will add the engine and the propeller to make it work.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 05:59 IST,||A match with a difference A fair fight||The story so far:Ankita and her twin Aniket get into trouble with their mother over their ‘puddle-jumping’ competition. In the evening, Madhavi narrated the day’s happenings to her husband, Raman. “What are we going to do with this girl? She is going from bad to worse. She is intelligent but won’t study. She gets into fights everyday and her teachers and the neighbours complain regularly about her behaviour. Why can’t she be more like Aniket who is a model student. His teachers rave about him.” Raman just smiled; they had gone through this routine several times before. “But, don’t forget Anki is a karate champ.” “Is that going to get her into Engineering or Medical?” “She can excel in some other field, can’t she?” “Like what? A security guard in a mango garden? She will end up eating all the mangoes.” Quick moves Ankita was standing in line, waiting for her school mates to get into the bus. She had been on her best behaviour for a week now; a record. Her dress was almost as neat and clean as Aniket’s when she got home. She had not got into fights or ragged any teacher. There had not been a single complaint against her. Just then, a tall boy pushed her back and went before her. “What do you think you are doing?” Ankita snapped. When he turned around, she saw that it was Vijay, the new boy in their class. “Every line starts from where I stand,” he said. “Don’t act smart. Get lost.” “Hey, look, I don’t fight with girls.” “Why? Are you scared you’ll get beaten up?” “If you don’t shut up, I’ll alter your silly twin’s features. That way, everyone will able to differentiate between the two of you. Though, ideally, you should come in shorts and he in skirts,” Vijay sniggered. The next moment, he found himself airborne before landing with a bump on the ground. Before he could get up, Ankita pounced on him and twisted his arms. He began yelling in pain. Suddenly, someone whispered, “Anthony Sir is coming.” This was their P.T. teacher and everyone, including Ankita, was scared of him. “What’s happening here?” Anthony Sir demanded. “Nothing, sir. Vijay was teaching me a new kick-boxing move when he lost his balance and fell. I was helping him to get up.” Anthony looked suspiciously at Ankita and then at Vijay. “Is that what happened?” “Yes Sir!” Vijay knew he had no choice. How could he tell Anthony Sir that a girl had clobbered him? The next day, Aniket gave Ankita a piece of good news. (To be continued)  The next moment, he found himself airborne before landing with a bump on the ground.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/a-match-with-a-difference-a-fair-fight/article64947806.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 05:59 IST,||happy ending||My father sent us away when I was six. “You’re the man of the family now. Take care of your mother,” he said. And he was gone. I was half asleep, and Ma was crying softly. Papa had disappeared into the crowd that was milling about the dock. “Papa! Papa!” I cried and took a step away from Ma, but she clung to my hand. “Come on, let’s go,” she said, and walked up the ramp onto the deck, dragging me behind her. Now we had a better view of the crowd. I thought I saw Papa in the distance, but I couldn’t be sure. In a new place Whistles and horns blew — and we could feel ourselves moving. I sniffed. Why had Papa made us go away? I couldn’t figure it out. We reached Ma’s home in Bombay. Grandfather didn’t say anything when he saw us. He just hugged us and led us in. “I know it’s difficult, but both of you must be brave,” he said Both of us tried. I started going to a school. “You’re happy here and you’ve made new friends, haven’t you?” asked Grandpa. “I miss my friends back home,” I replied.  “Don’t say that, Arun beta . This is home.”  Several months passed. I didn’t hear from Papa. No one did and no one talked about him. I didn’t like that. Why did they act like he didn’t exist? I missed Papa; there was no one to whistle and joke with me the way he did. In fact, no one here was joking and laughing much. Everyone was serious. Then, one day, there were fireworks on the streets and people were laughing and shouting and hugging each other. “Independence Day!” said Grandpa proudly. Ma nodded but she didn’t look proud or happy or anything. I knew she was thinking about Papa — like I was. But by now, I knew better than to say anything. That night, suddenly there was a lot of activity in the house. I thought I heard Ma crying. I ran towards her room, but Grandpa stopped me. “Not now,” he said. A while later, Grandma came into the room and said, “You have a baby brother.” “Maybe, now I won’t miss Papa so much,” I thought. But when I saw my brother, I was disappointed. He was tiny. This was no fun. But Ma looked happy. Maybe my little brother had helped her forget that Papa had sent us away. Maybe soon I would forget too. But, weeks passed and I didn’t forget. Sometimes, I missed Papa so much I could almost hear his voice — and the tune he always whistled when he came home from work. A surprise visitor I heard that whistle early one morning and eagerly ran to the window but it was just the postman in a khaki uniform, carrying a bag full of letters. I turned away, sadly. Then I stopped. Wait a minute! The postman? So early in the morning? I rushed back to the window but, by now, the front door was open and the ‘postman’ was holding Ma with one hand and he was calling me. Papa! I can’t remember moving at all but, suddenly, I was in his arms. Ma looked at Papa and said, “You did it! You ran away!” “Yes. I kept working as long as I could — and then, I left in secret. In disguise. My own son didn’t recognise me, so I think my disguise was good, huh?” Ma laughed — and then she brought out my little brother. Papa sat down and looked at him. “Born on India’s Independence Day,” said Papa. “That’s a great day to be born.” *** Kapil looked at his Grandpa. “I don’t understand why your Papa sent you away and why he didn’t WhatsApp or Skype and tell you what he was doing, like my Papa does now that he’s in a different country?” Grandpa Arun laughed. “That was 1947. No WhatsApp or Skype or the Internet. We were in Sindh, which was to become a part of Pakistan. So, he sent Ma and me by boat from Karachi to Bombay. He couldn’t write to us. He couldn’t tell us anything about his plans.” “I guess I’m lucky,’” said Kapil. “I talk to my Papa and see his face every day.” Grandpa Arun hugged him. “Yes, but I was lucky too. My Papa found his way back safely, and we were a family again. A bigger family than when he had sent us away, and that made it even better!’  I missed Papa fiercely.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:42 IST,||Abstract, but rooted||Malavika Sarukkai can be considered a pathbreaker. Over the years, one has seen her foray into new areas in Bharatanatyam, creating narratives with tailored music and abstract movements. Malavika’s set at the Music Academy performance had pieces that were uniquely composed and structured, but it ended with the conventional thillana, a Balamuralikrishna composition in Brindavani in adi tala. The opening ‘Nritta Kavya’ paid homage to Shiva with Sivashtakam (composed by B. Seetharama Sharma). This was followed by a ragamalika ‘Thari jham ta rita jham’ that seemed to be inspired by the Odissi pallavi. The jathis in between had different tempos, mostly brisk, using karvais to good effect. The dancer was in fine fettle, light-footed and energetic. The almost 14-minute piece was a treat with beautiful music and rhythms. Malavika’s abstract-style Gangavataran (‘Ganga Stotram’ composed by M.S. Sukhi) was the highlight of the fairly long programme. She built a narrative about the stately Bhagirathi, flowing down Shiva’s locks and meeting with the sensuous, green Alakananda in Devprayag, and then flowing as the Ganga. It opened to a darkened stage and funereal music. Shiva had his back to us, and while the Shiva nama was sung, Bhagirathi flowed down from his head, in slow hand movements, to the beats of the tabla and chants. Here, the lights were blue on one side and yellow on the other, symbolising Ardhanariswara. Bhagirathi’s journey through highs and lows, accompanied by beautiful swaras, nritta and karvais, was seamless, but could have been crisper. Then came the capricious Alakananda, leaping about gracefully, with Kathak-like tatkaar accompanying the music. They meet and converse in different tones, one a bit gruff, the other using softer syllables like ‘takita’ and the tabla. A few lines are in Hindi, ‘Sukha dayini’, followed by a benediction to Ganga. It was 18 minutes of drama, played out strongly. Catchy folk beat For Malavika’s style to work, the music, lighting and performance have to go together. It is abstract dance-theatre. Two mood pieces, with Andal’s ‘Nachiyar Thirumozhi’ verses, followed. One she named ‘Seasons of the Rains’ (Kapi), with a verse from the second canto where Andal and the Ayarpadi gopis, lost in love with Krishna, plead with him to not destroy their sand castles. “Protective of their surging emotions, which like sand castles, can be easily provoked, the girls did not want him coming close,” narrated Malavika. It was a light piece set to a catchy folk beat. The other, ‘Thoodu’, in which ‘Vinnila Melappu’ and two more verses from the eighth canto were chosen. has Andal in despair because Krishna has not come to fetch her as promised, and she tries to send dark rain clouds as messengers to him. Malavika’s visualisation was unusual — she broke it into three parts and used one form with a suitable dhyana sloka for each — standing Perumal, seated Lakshmi Narasimha, and reclining Ranganatha. With excerpts from the ‘Venkateswara Suprabhatam’, ‘Lakshmi Narasimha stotram’ and ‘Vishnu Sahasranamam’, linked with the verses and swara patterns, this was another musical gem. It was tuned by Vanathi Raghuraman in ragamalika, talamalika. Malavika uses minimal mudras, letting her expressions, music and lighting do the rest. The soundscape has a big part to play. The cymbals were soft and barely heard, while the nattuvanar (M.S. Sukhi) rendered jathis in a base voice. The rich, soothing landscape was made possible by Vasudha Ravi and Murali Parthasarathy on vocals, with Nellai A. Balaji (mridangam), Sai Shravanam (tabla), Srilakshmi Venkataramani and Easwar Ramakrishnan (violin), Navin Iyer and Sruthi Sagar (flute), and S. Ganapathy (dholak).

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:44 IST,||Abstract, but rooted||Malavika Sarukkai can be considered a pathbreaker. Over the years, one has seen her foray into new areas in Bharatanatyam, creating narratives with tailored music and abstract movements. Malavika’s set at the Music Academy performance had pieces that were uniquely composed and structured, but it ended with the conventional thillana, a Balamuralikrishna composition in Brindavani in adi tala.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:43 IST,||Composer and chronicler of his times||Dr. T. R. Aravindhan not only teaches dentistry but has an enduring interest in documenting the original versions of Carnatic music compositions. In his talk on Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar for Rasika Ranjani Sabha's 'Music in Perpetuity' lecdem series, he shared some meticulously compiled information on the composer-musician, comparing his works with those of Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar. While Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar's varnams, keerthanams and ragamalikas are all praiseworthy, Aravindhan focused on those compositions that are representative of the structure of the ragas of his time and how they are important in understanding the evolution of different phrases in ragas.  Tyagayyar, the youngest son of Veenai Kuppier, a direct disciple of Tyagaraja, learnt music from his father and one can see Tyagaraja’s influence in his keertanas. At a time when vidwans who composed kritis were only teaching them to their disciples, Tyagayyar published two books — P allavi Swara Kalpavalli in 1900 and S ankirtana Ratnavali in 1907. The latter apparently preceded Sangita Sampradaya Pradarshini, Subbarama Dikshitar’s magnus opus. It is interesting to read the note by Tyagayyar that the beautiful Surutti raga varnam ‘Ento premato’, popularly believed to be by Veenai Kuppier, was composed by Tyagayyar himself.   Thyagayyar published a set of 108 compositions titled ‘Sri Venugoplaswamy Ashtottara Shatha keertanas’ in his Sankirtana Ratnavali. These keertanas are individual compositions on his family deity, Sri Venugopala. said Aravindhan.  Apart from the Venugopalaswamy keerthanas, he also composed three prayer songs on Ganapathi (Dhanyasi), Saraswathi (Kalyani), and one in praise of Tyagaraja in Karaharapriya, considering him his guru. The epilogue has three keerthanas — one on Lakshmi in Atana, a Punnagavarali composition, and a mangalam. The first five keerthanas are in the prathama ghana ragas such as Nattai, Gowla, Arabhi, Varali and Sri, and the following five keertanas are in the dvitiya ghana ragas, Ritigowla, Narayana Gowla, Kedaram, Bowli and Nattakurinji, but not Saranga Nattai as in the paddhati before Tyagayyar’s times. The distinct features of the first 43 keertanas (beginning with Nattai and ending with Madhyamavati) and the next 65 (beginning with Ahiri and ending with Madhyamavati) could point to their having been intentionally composed as two sets. Experiments too It is interesting that Pantuvarali is mentioned as the 51st melakartha, as classified in present times, unlike the times of Tyagaraja with the suddha gandhara sounding similar to today’s Subha Pantuvarali. As Aravindhan said, this shows him as someone who documented the structure of the music of his times and did not strictly stick to the patanthara alone. Singing parts of Tyagayyar’s Gowri Manohari keertana ‘Parakela jesevu’ and comparing it with Tyagaraja’s ‘Guruleka etuvanti’, Aravindhan pointed to a similar structure between them. Tyagaraja created many new ragas bound exactly by arohanam and avarohanam, and Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar, perhaps influenced by this structure, created many more such new ‘scale ragas’, particularly Prati madhyama janya ragas. Tyagayyar was the first to use Gouda Malhar, contrary to the popular belief that Muthiah Bhagavatar used it first in 'Sarasamukhi'. Talking about the rare ragas used by both Tyagaraja and Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar, Aravindhan listed Jaganmohini, Guntakriya, Supradipam, Kapinarayani, Jayantasena, Salagabharavi. Tyagayyar used Mangalakaisiki, which was a grand raga during Dikshitar's time, Kannadabangala, and Ardradesi only as scale ragas. There are no kritis by Tyagaraja in these ragas, he noted. Scales of raga  Aravindhan averred that Tyagayyar followed Sangraha Chudamani , a Sanskrit work written by Govindacharya describing the scales of ragas. The new ragas created by Tyagayyar such as Mechakangi, Kananakusumavali, Ratnakanti, Ghoshini, Lokaranjani, and Pushakalyani followed the definite scale structure seen in Sangraha Chudamani . Tyagayyar has also composed kritis in ragas such as Kuntala, Simhelam, Sharadabharanam, which are mentioned in Sangraha Chudamani , but these ragas were not handled by Tyagaraja. Aravindhan demonstrated this by singing ‘Koribhajinchi’ composed by Tyagayyar in Pushakalyani, which is not found in Sangraha Chudamani .   He compared this sampoorna-shadava raga composition with a vivadi note, shatsruti dhaivatam, with Dikshitar’s Vamsavati composition ‘Bhaktavatsalam’ to explain how the scale structure and the ragas differ from each other. It demonstrated Tyagayyar’s ability to project a scale as a raga and the scholar wondered how he could have come up with Pushakalyani, noting that the Ashtottara Shata keertanas preceded the S angita Sampradaya Pradarshini .  The differences Though Tyagayyar is seen as a follower of the tradition established by Tyagaraja, a few differences can be seen in the handling of some ragas. While Supradipam (17th mela Suryakantham janya) was handled in scales by Tyagayyar, ‘Varasiki vahana’ by Tyagaraja is an example of seeing it as a complete raga. In another example of handling a vakra raga, Aravindhan demonstrated raga Ghoshini, that has two vakra structures in the scale, handled by Tyagayyar with much simplicity, in contrast to Tyagaraja's ‘Ninuchala nammiti’ in the same raga and Chenjukamboji, a raga with a complicated arohanam-avarohanam, and showed how both styles sound delightful. Aravindhan quoted Vishnu Narain Bhatkhande, a famed Hindustani musician, who travelled extensively to explore south Indian music. He interviewed Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar, where Tyagayyar says he did not follow any book for his music compositions and his works were based on what he knew. His compositions are records of the music of his time. Taking Nilambari as an example, Aravindhan showed how the arterial phrase of ‘n s g g m’ was used by Tyagayyar.arecording of Bidaram Krishnappa demonstrated the earlier plain handling of the madhyama without oscillation. In ‘Palukavatela’, in Balahamsa raga, Aravindhan pointed to how the kriti is also an example of Tyagayyar’s rhythmic prowess, seen in the way he has handled Rupaka tala in different arithmetic combinations and how the sangatis move progressively. This style, he said, is unique to Tyagayyar. Aravindhan showed how Hamir Kalyani has changed to its present version by comparing its phrases with Tyagaraja’s now popular ‘Manamuleda’. The practice of using prati madhyamam first and then suddha madhyamam appears to have come in much after Thyagayyar’s times. An excerpt from an interview with vidwan Maruthuvakudi Rajagopalayyar, an important representative of Tyagaraja’s Umayalpuram sishya parampara, demonstrated how Kalyana Vasantham has also changed over time. Highlighted by references from treatises and audio recordings, the lecture held many points of interest. The writer specialises in Carnatic music.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:43 IST,||The beauty of the margam||In the midst of watching thematic presentations, a simple Bharatnatyam margam came as a breath of fresh air. Aishwarya Ananth Kartikh chose classic compositions from the repertoire for her performance at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Natya festival. She began with ‘Eeshana sandhi’ kavuthuvam in Malahari raga, composed by the Thanjavur Quartet, and choreographed by her guru Sudharani Raghupathy. The timeless Anandabhairavi varnam, ‘Sakhiye indha velaiyil’, also a composition of the Thanjavur Quartet was the central piece. A nayika pleads with her sakhi to bring her lord to her. Aishwarya explored the emotions of shringara in detail. Sensitive portrayal Bright stars taking over the night sky, the fragrance of flowers in bloom, and Kamadeva shooting his love arrows were some of the sancharis delineated with sensitivity. She transitioned beautifully from shringara to bhakti when describing Rajagopalaswamy. The popular padam ‘Yarukagilum bhayama’ in raga Begada which came next also drew attention to her abhinaya. Dancing at a leisurely pace, Aishwarya’s movements and footwork showed her strong classical foundation. Aishwarya was supported by Nandini Anand Sharma on vocals, Priya Murle on the nattuvangam, Eshwar Ramakrishnan on the violin, Dhananjayan on the mridangam, and Muthukumar on the flute.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:44 IST,||When youngsters stole the show||When the 35th Koodiyattam Festival concluded at Ammannur Chachu Chakyar Smaraka Gurukulam, Irinjalakuda, on January 12, the organisers, artistes and connoisseurs had many reasons to rejoice. It was for the first time that a wealth of promising young talent, all products of the institution, could prove their virtuosity by sharing the stage with seasoned artistes. The second half of the 12-day festival was especially noteworthy for the maturity with which these youngsters presented numerous characters. Moulding students The festival was also a demonstration of the persevering efforts of the institution to mould students to carry forward the hoary tradition of the Sanskrit theatre as well as the prestige of the Ammannur School. From the time the infrastructure for conducting such an elaborate festival became available in 1992, the dates January 1 to 12 have been permanent in the Koodiyattam calendar, including for aficionados from overseas. This year, of course, the live shows were streamed live for faraway audiences while a small number of local connoisseurs turned up at the venue.  The theatre’s presentation format — Purappad, Nirvahanam, Koodiyattam, and even the rarely staged ‘Mudiyakkatha’, the grand finale — was strictly followed. The performances in the first half were anchored on ‘Asokavanikamgam’ from Ascharyachoodamani .  Elaborate start The festival began with the purappadu of Mandodari in the play by Athira Hariharan, daughter of veteran artistes Usha Nagiar and mizhavu exponent Hariharan, a remarkable performance. The nirvahanam or pre-story recital of the character was so elaborate that it was presented by Aparna Nangiar, Saritha Krishnan and Kapila Venu over three days. While Aparna enacted the origin of Mandodari’s parents, Saritha portrayed the circumstances that led to Mandodari’s birth. Kapila used her unmatched histrionics to showcase Ravana’s severe penance and the boons he was granted by Shiva. As for the Koodiyattam part, Usha donned the role of Mandodari and Saritha of the sakhi. ‘Torayudham Koodiyattam’ from Abhisheka Natakam was the focus of the subsequent days. Gurukulam Tharun did a commendable job of Sankukarnan’s purappadu on the sixth day followed by nirvahanam the next day. The young actor with only six years of training exhibited laudable maturity. Sooraj Nambiar, among the seniormost in the fraternity, did Ravana’s nirvahanam on the eighth day. At their best The Koodiyattam on the ninth day seemed like an exposition by the youngsters. Gurukulam Tharun (Ravana), Gurukulam Krishnadev (Sankukarnan) and Gurukulam Anjana (Vijaya) revealed their best by depicting various anecdotes including the building of Ashok Vanika, Ravana’s fury when he is informed of its destruction by Hanuman etc.  Interestingly, Krishnadev and Tharun appeared on the next day too, with the long hours of performance on the previous day no way affecting their gusto. Sooraj Nambiar’s depiction of the much sought-after Kailasodharanam and Parvathy Viraham roles on the 11th day deserves special mention. Gurukulam Sankaran portrayed Vibhishana.  Ammannur Kuttan (Parameswaran) Chakyar, head of the gurukulam, turned up on the last day to don the role of Ravana. His command to set fire to Hanuman’s tail and make arrangements for the security of Lanka was unique in all respects. The festival concluded with the traditional Mudi akkitha led by Kuttan Chakyar. An array of percussionists contributed their might for the success of the festival. They included Kalamandalam Rajeev, Kalamandalam Hariharan, Kalamandalam Vijay, Kalamandalam Rahul and Nepathya Jinesh, all on mizhavu, and Kalanilayam Unnikrishnan, Moorkanad Dinesh Warrier and Kalamandalam Sudheesh on edakka.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:44 IST,||Crystal gazing into 2022||I started the New Year as always performing with Jayanthi Kumaresh at Kalakshetra in Chennai. And, as always, the concert saw a large turn-out, including WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan. We seized the opportunity and asked her how this wave was going to play out and what we ought to be prepared for. Her response was — don’t fret and fear. I paused to reflect on how the two earlier waves had impacted the artiste community. Many losses have been irreplaceable, including the loss to a whole generation of young creators of being introduced on a live stage. Their worldviews have been altered forever. Given the plethora of problems that everyone has faced, the problems of performers or visual artists do not strike me as the most severe or disturbing. In my columns through the pandemic, I focused on platforms and technologies that have dominated the hybrid landscape. I have highlighted trends in the performing arts including the blurring of boundaries in collaborative endeavours and creations. In the coming year, we will see leaps in technology and the arrival of more platforms that commoditise art and commercialise its value. There will be some winners and some losers, with many in the latter category being valuable creators in the real world but befuddled by the new technological normal. We will see more untrained but potent talent make it to the centre stage and, of course, the ever-pervasive effect of social media and fame-crazy celebrities in creating content that acquires virality for questionable reasons. The next generation of music creators are here. Many of them got here with hard and inventive work, while some others have benefited by making good choices. Content will become even more diversified — more productions, films, musicals and stage shows will emerge from the mists of the pandemic. The era of the ‘big star’ is over. Every talent will have its share of the spotlight but should learn to focus on the journey and the craft and not on validation. It will be a more confusing world to navigate, and technology will get even more entrenched and demanding. It is up to each one of us to learn where to draw the line, what to share, how to moderate and conduct ourselves. Sadly this is easier said than done. Hybrid living Stress and psychological distress will definitely rise among creative individuals, given the hybrid reality we have to confront, and the resetting that will inevitably occur. Content collaboratives will emerge — more syndicates will form that bring together multimedia and live art. Definitions of ‘classicism’ will continue to be debated and reshaped as they have been in the past. There is no more a denial of the notion that we have changed. As a race. As humankind.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:43 IST,||Crystal gazing into 2022||I started the New Year as always performing with Jayanthi Kumaresh at Kalakshetra in Chennai. And, as always, the concert saw a large turn-out, including WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan. We seized the opportunity and asked her how this wave was going to play out and what we ought to be prepared for. Her response was — don’t fret and fear. I paused to reflect on how the two earlier waves had impacted the artiste community. Many losses have been irreplaceable, including the loss to a whole generation of young creators of being introduced on a live stage. Their worldviews have been altered forever. Given the plethora of problems that everyone has faced, the problems of performers or visual artists do not strike me as the most severe or disturbing. In my columns through the pandemic, I focused on platforms and technologies that have dominated the hybrid landscape. I have highlighted trends in the performing arts including the blurring of boundaries in collaborative endeavours and creations. In the coming year, we will see leaps in technology and the arrival of more platforms that commoditise art and commercialise its value. There will be some winners and some losers, with many in the latter category being valuable creators in the real world but befuddled by the new technological normal. We will see more untrained but potent talent make it to the centre stage and, of course, the ever-pervasive effect of social media and fame-crazy celebrities in creating content that acquires virality for questionable reasons. The next generation of music creators are here. Many of them got here with hard and inventive work, while some others have benefited by making good choices. Content will become even more diversified — more productions, films, musicals and stage shows will emerge from the mists of the pandemic. The era of the ‘big star’ is over. Every talent will have its share of the spotlight but should learn to focus on the journey and the craft and not on validation. It will be a more confusing world to navigate, and technology will get even more entrenched and demanding. It is up to each one of us to learn where to draw the line, what to share, how to moderate and conduct ourselves. Sadly this is easier said than done. Hybrid living Stress and psychological distress will definitely rise among creative individuals, given the hybrid reality we have to confront, and the resetting that will inevitably occur. Content collaboratives will emerge — more syndicates will form that bring together multimedia and live art. Definitions of ‘classicism’ will continue to be debated and reshaped as they have been in the past. There is no more a denial of the notion that we have changed. As a race. As humankind. The generations emerging out of the pandemic have a different learning trajectory, thanks to missing out on crucial years of live learning. Their expectations are different, along with a more pixelated worldview, and validation metrics that seem to be set on quantifiable metrics available on social platforms. We need more patience with ourselves as creators. We will need more compassion in evaluating ourselves as well as others in our networks. We have to embrace change, and be gracious about it.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:43 IST,||When youngsters stole the show||When the 35th Koodiyattam Festival concluded at Ammannur Chachu Chakyar Smaraka Gurukulam, Irinjalakuda, on January 12, the organisers, artistes and connoisseurs had many reasons to rejoice. It was for the first time that a wealth of promising young talent, all products of the institution, could prove their virtuosity by sharing the stage with seasoned artistes. The second half of the 12-day festival was especially noteworthy for the maturity with which these youngsters presented numerous characters. Moulding students The festival was also a demonstration of the persevering efforts of the institution to mould students to carry forward the hoary tradition of the Sanskrit theatre as well as the prestige of the Ammannur School. From the time the infrastructure for conducting such an elaborate festival became available in 1992, the dates January 1 to 12 have been permanent in the Koodiyattam calendar, including for aficionados from overseas. This year, of course, the live shows were streamed live for faraway audiences while a small number of local connoisseurs turned up at the venue.  The theatre’s presentation format — Purappad, Nirvahanam, Koodiyattam, and even the rarely staged ‘Mudiyakkatha’, the grand finale — was strictly followed. The performances in the first half were anchored on ‘Asokavanikamgam’ from Ascharyachoodamani .  Elaborate start The festival began with the purappadu of Mandodari in the play by Athira Hariharan, daughter of veteran artistes Usha Nagiar and mizhavu exponent Hariharan, a remarkable performance. The nirvahanam or pre-story recital of the character was so elaborate that it was presented by Aparna Nangiar, Saritha Krishnan and Kapila Venu over three days. While Aparna enacted the origin of Mandodari’s parents, Saritha portrayed the circumstances that led to Mandodari’s birth. Kapila used her unmatched histrionics to showcase Ravana’s severe penance and the boons he was granted by Shiva. As for the Koodiyattam part, Usha donned the role of Mandodari and Saritha of the sakhi. ‘Torayudham Koodiyattam’ from Abhisheka Natakam was the focus of the subsequent days. Gurukulam Tharun did a commendable job of Sankukarnan’s purappadu on the sixth day followed by nirvahanam the next day. The young actor with only six years of training exhibited laudable maturity. Sooraj Nambiar, among the seniormost in the fraternity, did Ravana’s nirvahanam on the eighth day. At their best The Koodiyattam on the ninth day seemed like an exposition by the youngsters. Gurukulam Tharun (Ravana), Gurukulam Krishnadev (Sankukarnan) and Gurukulam Anjana (Vijaya) revealed their best by depicting various anecdotes including the building of Ashok Vanika, Ravana’s fury when he is informed of its destruction by Hanuman etc.  Interestingly, Krishnadev and Tharun appeared on the next day too, with the long hours of performance on the previous day no way affecting their gusto. Sooraj Nambiar’s depiction of the much sought-after Kailasodharanam and Parvathy Viraham roles on the 11th day deserves special mention. Gurukulam Sankaran portrayed Vibhishana.  Ammannur Kuttan (Parameswaran) Chakyar, head of the gurukulam, turned up on the last day to don the role of Ravana. His command to set fire to Hanuman’s tail and make arrangements for the security of Lanka was unique in all respects. The festival concluded with the traditional Mudi akkitha led by Kuttan Chakyar. An array of percussionists contributed their might for the success of the festival. They included Kalamandalam Rajeev, Kalamandalam Hariharan, Kalamandalam Vijay, Kalamandalam Rahul and Nepathya Jinesh, all on mizhavu, and Kalanilayam Unnikrishnan, Moorkanad Dinesh Warrier and Kalamandalam Sudheesh on edakka.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 03:44 IST,||With promise and grace||Born into a family of musicians and dancers, it is not surprising that young Mahati Kannan has blossomed into a promising artiste. At the Music Academy Virtual Dance Festival, 2022, she began with ‘Gaja mukha naadhan’, a kavuthuvam taken from a 300-year-old manuscript. A musically rich piece, it had sollus and lyrics flowing seamlessly. To commemorate the centenary year of K. N. Dhandayuthapani Pillai, Mahati chose a jathiswaram composed by him. Since it was based on raga Hamsanadham, Mahati’s aunt Padma Subrahmanyam had choreographed it using the karana movements of a swan and Mahati gracefully captured the gait and flight of the bird. The highpoint was when the swaras ‘dha ni dha ma’ merged beautifully with the movements. Presented with ease The varnam chosen for the evening ‘Vanamala Sri’ was composed by KunnakudiVenkatrama Aiyar in raga Valaji. Beginning with the Krishna Thulabaram episode, it went on to the tried and tested episodes of Krishna stealing butter, breaking pots, and teasing gopis for sancharis, along with the Vamana avatar. Mahatimoved from one expression to another with ease. Alternating between vocal and instrumental music in each line of the varnam made for a rich aural experience. ‘Madura Madura Meenakshi ‘ in raga Bageshricomposed by Swami Dayananda Saraswati followed,where suggestive abhinaya and simple gestures were used to portray the goddess Meenakshi. The joy of rhythm and movement was explored in the ‘Gati beda prabhandam ‘ composed by Padma Subrahmanyam in raga Kedaram with lyrical inputs from Isaikavi Ramanan. The musical ensemble consisted ofGayatri Kannan on vocals, B. Kannan (veena), Nagai Sriram (mridangam), and Sruti Sagar (flute). The choice of songs focused more on suggestive sancharis for abhinaya, ideal for a young dancer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/with-promise-and-grace/article64947949.ece

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:43 IST,||A steady growth of SC entrepreneurs||Tamil Nadu, a front-ranking State in the sector of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), is witnessing a steady growth of entrepreneurs from the Scheduled Castes. Though the number of the SC entrepreneurs is not proportionate to the share of the community in the population, it is growing. In fact, as per the 4th All India Census of MSMEs (registered sector) census undertaken in 2006-07 and published in 2011, the State had the highest number of SC-owned enterprises with 18,120, about 15.24% of such units at the all-India level. (When the Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum system of registration of enterprises came to an end in June 2020, the number of SC-owned enterprises went up to 56,047). Relying on the census data, Milind Kamble, founder-chairman of the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (DICCI), told the Global Investors’ Meet in Chennai in September 2015 that the State had the largest number of SC entrepreneurs in the country. He is still quoting the data because, he says, no such census has been carried out since then. About 10 years later, only the National Sample Survey 73rd Round (2015-16) was carried out. In the subsequent years, other States had overtaken Tamil Nadu but this may be temporary in view of the non-availability of comprehensive data. The State government is taking steps for encouraging the entrepreneurs hailing from the community, says K.S. Bhagyalakshmi, vice-president of the Tamil Nadu chapter of DICCI. Some weeks ago, the office of the State Industries Commissioner and the Director of Industries and Commerce instructed the General Managers of District Industries Centres and the Regional Joint Directors to ensure that members of the district units of the DICCI or any such body were invited for meetings of the task force committee to select beneficiaries under the New Entrepreneur-cum-Enterprise Development Scheme (NEEDS) and the Unemployed Youth Employment Generation Programme (UYEGP). Under these schemes, SC participants are given support. Ms. Bhagyalakshmi was a beneficiary of the first batch of candidates trained under the NEEDS. Today, she is into the production of eco-friendly products such as non-woven, cloth and jute bags and training of aspiring entrepreneurs. V. Arumugam, who hails from a village near Arakkonam, is also a NEEDS beneficiary. Running a firm in the field of fabrication material and press tool components, he was sent to Greece in 2019 for an exhibition, courtesy the Chennai regional office of the National SC/ST Hub of the Union Ministry of MSMEs. E. Sivagamasundari, of Nellikuppam in Cuddalore, may not have so much exposure as the two, but with determination, she is pursuing the production of herbal products for the last six years. When IAS officer Gagandeep Singh Bedi was Cuddalore Collector years ago, he spotted her potential and encouraged her to start a unit for herbal products. She is taking steps to increase production capacity with a financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakh to buy machinery. One can come across such entrepreneurs, who have branched into different fields, from providing logistics services to running petrol bunks to having units in textiles or food processing or agro products. There is one entrepreneur, Shobana Soundararajan of Villupuram, who is running two holiday resorts, including one in Puducherry. However, it is not a path of roses for SC entrepreneurs. An entrepreneur, who has been running a foundry unit near Chennai for nearly 40 years, does not want to be identified as one belonging to the community. “You know why” — that is all he would say. Another entrepreneur says the problem of social discrimination in business is somewhat nuanced. About 10 years ago, he could, with great difficulty, get a site in a town of Thoothukudi district for setting up his outlet for cooking gas cylinder distribution. After some years, when he got a competitor who belonged to an intermediary caste, he could observe a good number of his customers migrating to him. The common complaint among many entrepreneurs is the reluctance of banks to provide loans. Though an official of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) brushes it aside, the document containing the agenda for the 168th meeting of the SLBC held in December stated about 10,370 applications were pending at the end of September 2021 for Rs. 139.25 crore. At a special SLBC meeting held in October, in which Chief Minister M.K. Stalin was present, Principal Secretary (Adi-Dravidar and Tribal Welfare) K. Manivasan said that despite the release of government subsidy, the applications were pending with some of the major banks. The SC entrepreneurs refer to the arrangement by the Central government wherein out of the 25% target of annual procurement from MSMEs, 4% should be set aside for SC enterprises. They suggest that the State adopt a similar scheme. Also, Tamil Nadu can take its cue from the Karnataka scheme of 4% interest subsidy on loans sanctioned by the Karnataka State Financial Corporation for expansion or modernisation of the units owned by the SC/ST entrepreneurs. With more proactive measures, Tamil Nadu can reach the top slot in the number of units and employment generation, they say.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:42 IST,||‘IT vital to make T.N. a $1-trillion economy’||Information and Technology (IT) MinisterT. Mano Thangaraj says his Department will play a crucial role in helping Tamil Nadu achieve $1-trillion economy. In an interaction with The Hindu , he said that among his key priorities are bringing in more investments and enhancing the startup ecosystem. Excerpts:  What new initiatives have you brought into the IT sector? IT will play a crucial role in making Tamil Nadu a $1-trillion economy. The Department has taken several initiatives. For instance, to improve interaction with the industry, the government launched ‘IT Nanban’, where the industry can register themselves and access all Government Orders, policy documents and tenders. The Chief Minister launched ‘e-Munnetram’, a portal developed by TNeGA, that allows close monitoring of progress of the major infrastructure projects worth more than Rs. 100 crore. We launched the dashboard at the CMO that allows real-time monitoring of projects. How has the CM dashboard helped and what new features do you intend to add? To begin with, 17 dashboards were commissioned. Since everything is real-time, it is easy to find where the delay is and to resolve issues immediately. More dashboards will be gradually added that will include performance monitoring of MSMEs, municipal administration, TWAD, highways, TANGEDCO, forest, TNPCB, labour and employment, Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation, transport corporations, Mines & Minerals; Commercial Taxes, NRI Tamils, differently abled, scholarship disbursement, fisheries and all other sectors. The focus will be on bringing the infrastructure projects across 10 major departments onto the CM dashboard to improve on monitoring of the infra development projects throughout the State. The State is home to big players such as Cognizant, TCS and Infosys. In the last few years, most investments in the IT space have come in from existing players in an expansion mode. We haven’t seen any new big names in this space. What is the government doing to draw big companies and fresh investments? Many firms are in talks with us. We will be going abroad to woo investors, meet Indian investors abroad and explain to them the advantages of investing in Tamil Nadu. The plans have been put on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have unveiled a ‘data centre policy’ that provides incentives for companies in that space. You will see some investments coming in that space. We are working with the Industries Department to draft a policy around incentivising the growth of ‘Global Capability Centres’, the captains of Indian and non-Indian multi-national companies, which promote development of high-end products and services. During the CII Connect 2021, you mentioned IT sector would enable other industries to become globally competitive. What is your Department doing to ensure traditional industries embrace next generation technology to stay relevant? The IT Department is working with the Industries Department to develop a platform for the industry, the academia and research bodies for inputs on projects, services, facilities and consultations on using the latest technologies across different sectors. The Department has partnered with the Agriculture and Health Departments to develop solutions using artificial intelligence and machine learning for identification of crop pest and diseases and for diagnosing and screening for cataract, TB and other diseases. Discussions are under way with other departments. What is the progress of the advisory committee constituted under your chairmanship three months ago? We have experts from the academia and startups among other areas in this committee. During the first meeting there were discussions on skill development in emerging technologies and a digital transformation strategy to be adopted by the government. We will soon come out with a roadmap and plan. Companies say most graduates are not updated with latest technologies and skills. What initiatives will you be taking to make them employable by the IT sector? Yes, there is a big gap and we are working to narrowing it. The job market has changed after the pandemic; work dynamics have changed. We are studying the market and understanding how we can help job-seekers. The ICT Academy has been working with industry to develop technical courses for skilling the youth. TNeGA is working with the academy to make these online courses accessible to rural students through the ‘e-sevai’ centres. We have made changes in the ICT Academy — new teams are in place. When it comes to startups, Tamil Nadu has not been able to make it to the top three. There is lack of access to funding here. How do you propose to address this? We are working with industry captains, the Union Ministry of Information and Technology, Software Technology Parks of India and other State Departments to develop the startup ecosystem. During the stakeholder consultations, the IT Department has identified several opportunities for developing the startup ecosystem — mentoring, incubation, accelerators and financing. The policy is being drafted to include the financial and organisational support to fill these gaps.  To begin with, 17 dashboards have been commissioned.

Though the district administration said the deceased might have died of severe cold, family members said the victims had consumed spurious liquor and died after complaining of severe headache, blurred vision and burning sensation in the stomach. All the victims belonged to villages under Maker and Amnour police stations of Saran district. “He had consumed illicit liquor and developed complications including burning sensations in stomach and severe headache with blurred vision on Wednesday evening. Later he died,” family members of one of the victims Ramnath Rai of Narsingh-Bhanpur village under Amnour police station told media persons. The dead have been identified as Krishna Mahto of Parmanandpur village, Mohd. Isha of Basantpur village, Ramnath Rai of Narsingh-Bhanpur village — all under Amnour Police Station; Bihari Rai of Nandan village, Bharat Rai of Navkadha village, Pappu Singh of Tara-Amnour village — all under Maker Police station of Saran district and Anil Mistri of Siwan district. However, the district administration insisted spurious liquor was not to blame for the deaths. “No one has died because of consuming spurious liquor,” said Saran District Magistrate Rajesh Meena. A senior police official Indrajit Baitha who visited the villages ,also said, “None died due to spurious liquor; they might have died due to severe cold.... Someone might have spread rumour over the deaths due to illicit liquor.” Questioning the official denial, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) MLA from Darauli in Siwan district Satyadeo Ram, who visited victims’ families, said: “The family members admitted before me that the victims had consumed liquor and developed some body complications before they died.” “The prohibition policy of the State government has completely failed. Now, the district administration chooses to cite wrong reasons of death, instead of consumption of illicit liquor, to save their skin,” Mr. Ram said. Nalanda incident The Saran incident comes less than a week after the deaths of 11 people in Chhoti Pahadi area under Sohsarai police station of Nalanda district after consuming spurious liquor. There again, the district administration had initially denied that illicit liquor was to blame for deaths but was forced to acknowledge the same after family members of the victims insisted. Meanwhile, hearing an anticipatory bail application filed by one Gangaram of Begusarai district, the Patna High Court on January 19 observed that the police and excise department officials in the State “seem to be working in connivance with liquor smugglers in Bihar”.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:37 IST,||Rajasthan govt. stops auction of farmers’ agricultural land||Facing a difficult situation on the waiver of farmers’ debts, the Congress government in Rajasthan on Thursday stopped the auction of agricultural land belonging to farmers who failed to repay the loans obtained from commercial banks functioning under the control of Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The issue had taken a political turn after the banks started serving notices on the defaulting farmers. Though the State government had offered to get the loans disbursed by nationalised and commercial banks waived through a one-time scheme, the banks initiated action for land attachment and auction under the Rajasthan Agricultural Credit Operations (Removal of Difficulties) Act, 1974. A large number of defaulting farmers in several districts have received notices, besides facing pressure to make settlement with banks. In a recent instance, a farmer, Kajod Meena, died in Dausa with an outstanding Kisan Credit Card loan of Rs. 7 lakh. The bank auctioned his 15-bigha land for Rs. 46 lakh earlier this week when his family failed to repay loan amount. The district administration has since cancelled the auction process. The Opposition BJP has accused the ruling Congress of failure to protect farmers’ interests despite the loan waiver promise made in its manifesto for the 2018 State Assembly election. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had announced that all loans of farmers would be waived within 10 days of assuming power. Shortly after being elected to power, the Congress had rolled out a loan waiver of Rs. 14,000 crore, including Rs. 6,000 crore announced by the previous BJP regime, by which over 20.56 lakh farmers had benefited. The waiver was enforced for the loans obtained by cultivators from the cooperative banks functioning under the State government. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said the government officers had been instructed to stop the process of attachment and auction of land. “We have urged the Centre to waive the farmers’ loans from nationalised, commercial and land development banks through one-time settlement. The State government is ready to bear the farmers’ share in the waiver scheme,” Mr. Gehlot tweeted. Awaiting nod Mr. Gehlot said the State government had passed a Bill in the Assembly for banning the land auction of farmers having agricultural land up to 5 acres, but the Governor has not yet given his nod. “This situation has arisen because the Bill could not become an Act in the absence of the Governor’s assent,” he said. The Bill had sought to amend the Civil Procedure Code for protecting the agriculturists’ land measuring up to 5 acres against attachment and sale in execution of a decree issued by the court in the cases of monetary award. It was passed by the State Assembly on November 2, 2020, along with three other Bills to stop the applicability of the Centre’s controversial agriculture sector laws in the State through the amendments making them ineffective in certain respects. While Mr. Gehlot expressed hope that the Bill would receive the Governor’s assent soon and land auctions would not take place in future, BJP State president Satish Poonia said the Chief Minister was “patting his own back” after reacting when the situation fell on his head. “What will happen to the farmers whose land has already been attached?” he asked. One-time waiver Mr. Gehlot had recently sent a proposal to the nationalised banks to bring a one-time loan waiver scheme for the State’s farmers on the lines of a scheme introduced by the State Bank of India, in which the agricultural loans, classified as non-performing assets (NPA), were waived. While 90% of the loans were waived by the bank, the farmers paid the remaining 10%, which the State government was willing to give. Though the farmers’ loans from nationalised banks were declared NPA on November 20, 2018, they are yet to be waived.

Coincidentally, in post-independent India, policies to enhance access to school and higher education were helmed by some Chief Ministers who were unable to complete schooling. The Congress’s K. Kamaraj had not only taken schools to the villages but launched the far-sighted noon-meal scheme to ensure retention of students. The scheme, improvised and expanded by the successive regimes, has become an acclaimed universal model to attract students to schools and prevent dropouts. Two language policy Consistency on the State’s two language policy drafted to oppose the Centre’s attempted Hindi imposition, brought with it a by-product, English proficiency, a key driver of global employment opportunities. If this prepared graduates for the corporate world, privatisation of engineering education by the M.G. Ramachandran regime, despite its critical drawbacks, ensured Tamil Nadu was ready with qualified manpower to supply to the information technology sector in its early years. Today, if many middle class and rural households boast of a family member making a career in the U.S. or elsewhere, it was made possible by the access to technical education. Three other factors facilitated this upward mobility for families that did not belong to the socially privileged classes. First, the affirmative communal reservation policy driven by the core understanding of the political class that not family vocation but education is empowerment. Second, the vision to create necessary infrastructure for the IT and manufacturing sectors when the time was ripe by the M. Karunanidhi (DMK) dispensation during 1996-2001. Third, the Tamil Nadu Placement Programme launched during Jayalalithaa’s regime (2001-06) that brought competent job aspirants under one platform and reversed the lopsided recruitment policy of corporates of heading to city colleges for talent hunting. Competitive politics between the DMK and AIADMK may have consumed certain development schemes following regime changes. However, when it came to education, there were only exceptional reversals. If Karunanidhi, in his last tenure as Chief Minister, pumped in resources to launch more government engineering colleges, the AIADMK regime, under Edappadi K. Palaniswami, took a leap forward in commissioning government medical colleges with the Centre’s support. The State prides itself on specialised universities to govern the fields of technical education, medical education, legal education, arts, science and humanities colleges, teachers’ education, sports education, fisheries research, music, and open and distance learning among others. Horizontal reservation for students of government schools to pursue undergraduate medical and engineering education is another welcome model. Some of the deemed to be universities have become preferred destinations for global students and teachers, who bring in the much-needed diversity on the campus.  In school education, Tamil Nadu was a model for activity-based learning, and the Uniform System of School education (USS or Samacheer Kalvi ) has to an extent bridged the disparity in the quality of education.  However, far from resting on its laurels, a course correction may be warranted for Tamil Nadu to retain its advantageous position in the technology-driven world. The desire for private school education is veering towards the CBSE, ICSE, IB and Cambridge Boards of education. In the long run, this may defeat the purpose of USS and widen the knowledge gap between the haves and have-nots as the non-USS institutions are largely driven by capitation and high tuition fees. The USS and government schools need to be strengthened and teachers empowered to innovate and freed from burdensome non-teaching work. The school assessment system, which is loaded in favour of scoring marks, requires an overhauling to assess the potential of a child instead of its rote learning ability. Along with the intelligence quotient, teachers must help students develop an emotional quotient to face challenges. Quality of output While access to higher education must continue to be non-restrictive and funding must be provided for the under-privileged, policies are needed to regulate the quality of output from colleges. In recent decades, unfortunately there is a competitive tendency by successive governments to force universities to increase the pass percentage of graduates, particularly in engineering colleges, by diluting evaluation standards. College students must be assessed at a higher level by the university system, failing which the worrisome trend of churning out unemployable graduates would pose challenges of a different kind. Universities need committed and strong intellectual academic leaders to guide the future generation and must be truly autonomous to devise their policies. The lesser the government’s interference, the better for the education system. These issues, if addressed by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in his government’s proposed State Education Policy, will help the State stay focussed in its mission education.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:36 IST,||Spinning a new magic with photography||Former Andhra Ranji left-arm spinner and chairman of ACA selection panel Satyaprasad Yachendra (59) is spinning magic with his pictures, exploring the scenic splendour of Ladakh Valley for close to 15 years. “Every time you visit Ladakh, you feel as if you are going there for the first time. Such is the beauty of the valley with the imposing Himalayan Ranges in the backdrop,” Prasad said. “For me, it is like a spiritual home,” said city-based Prasad, who also extensively toured Lahaul and Spiti in Himachal Pradesh and the northern part of Sikkim. The gentleman, an avid photographer to freeze the sprawling and magnificent landscapes, took to photography since he was a child, thanks to his father (Madana Gopal Yachendra), who was a lensman himself.  “Somehow, the mere thought of Ladakh Valley spurs me to plan a visit at any given point of the year. Such is the fascination I have for the picturesque locales there,” Prasad said in a chat with The Hindu .  “Photography in the Valley itself can be one of the biggest challenges for any photographer given the kind of conditions, with virtually no villages in sight and apparently no possible scope for help in case of any emergency,” he said. “You, along with like-minded photographer-friends, have to be on your own in these places. But, I tell you, every time you visit Ladakh, it gives you an impression of being a fresh, unexplored locale till then,” he said with a big smile. “Definitely, digital photography made things a lot easier. But, at the same time, the urge to be the best, as many now-a-days are armed with all sorts of latest camera equipment, could well inspire you to come up with truly standout pics,” he explained. And, right now, the nature lover-cum-photographer is coming out with a coffee table book depicting his journeys to ‘Great Ranges’. “I must say the Telangana government has been encouraging photography a lot by organising the India Photo Festival every year, where world-renowned lensmen come and share their experiences,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/spinning-a-new-magic-with-photography/article64947691.ece

A directive to this effect has been issued by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) consequent to an appeal made by environmental activist Giridhar Kulkarni. The circular also states that the post-mortem report too should be uploaded on the department website within 24 hours after the completion of the exercise. Tiger deaths This will be akin to the mortality data maintained by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) about the tiger deaths from across the country and is brought to public domain through its website. The communique points out that the elephant task force, constituted by the High Court of Karnataka, had also stated that “in all cases of elephant mortality, we recommend that, as is being done now by the NTCA, all post-mortem examinations be held with external observers and the Karnataka Forest Department create a separate section on its website on which to record and display the post-mortem report”. Besides, the office of the PCCF (Wildlife) too had issued a similar communique in September 2013 and it is yet to be implemented. Hence, the communique issued to the information technology and communication wing of the Forest Department directs that steps be taken to comply with the directives at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/forest-dept-to-give-wildlife-mortality-details-on-its-website/article38300703.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:42 IST,||A pioneer in lymphoma treatment||It was a double-whammy for Rocky, a dog of native breed. Its pet parent had died in a road accident at Poonamallee, a Chennai suburb, and it was diagnosed with lymphoma, a type of cancer common among dogs. Fortunately, the mother of the pet parent decided to spare no effort to save the dog; she felt it was the best thing she could do in her daughter’s memory. Rocky, who would have died in a few weeks, has lived on for six months, and is expected to live another year. It is not just Rocky. Appu, Brook, Julie, Sweety and five others are in remission, having been treated by the Canine Lymphoma Centre of the Madras Veterinary College (MVC) at Vepery, a pioneering institution. Extension sought “The project was funded by the Department of Biotechnology of the Central government in 2018... Now we are running it with available resources. It will be of great help if the project is extended. The study of canine lymphoma can offer insights into human Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma as a comparative model,” said M. Chandrasekar, Professor, Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine. He had undergone a programme in the U.S. in lymphoma treatment. The lymphoma centre has evolved a 25-week protocol for treatment. It is being followed all over the world. It has so far treated around 100 dogs free. The prognosis, however, depends on the five stages of the disease. Prognosis is poor for stage three when all lymph nodes are involved, stage four when the liver and the spleen are affected and stage five when the cancer has affected the bone marrow. A long period “The treatment can extend the life between seven months and one-and-a-half years, and it is a long period in the life of a dog since lymphoma affects dogs at their middle age. The objective of the treatment is to improve the quality of life for the man’s best friend,” said P. Selvaraj, Professor of Medicine. The MVC is a leading centre in the country in the early screening and diagnosis of B and T cells using flow cytometry, which is available at the Translational Research Platform for Veterinary Biologicals (TRPVB) at Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Madhavaram. The lymphoma centre regularly receives samples from neighbouring States. Dr. Chandrasekar is in touch with the Italy-based European Canine Lymphoma Network. Even though it is not clear on what causes the disease Dr. Chandrasekar and Dr. Selvaraj said lymphoma was detected mostly in urban areas and pollution could be a factor. While breeds, such as the Golden Retriever, Basset Hound and Boxer, are found to be prone to lymphoma, other breeds too can be afflicted with the disease. “Polluted water and food and passive smoking can cause lymphoma in dogs. Constant use of insecticidal drugs to control ticks and fleas can result in the disease,” said Dr. Chandrasekar, advising pet parents to watch for early symptoms. The centre has also published a booklet and a manual for owners. “There will be swellings in the chest. They may grow to the size of a tennis ball. Similar swelling can appear on the legs and other nodules. The dog will become dull and may refuse food. Swellings near the chest will cause difficulty in breathing,” he said. Diagnosis The diagnosis is done through scanning and a fine needle aspiration and flow cytometry. “Chemotherapy is the first line of treatment. It is almost like the protocol followed to treat human beings,” Dr. Chandrasekar said. But it is essential to stabilise other parameters before chemotherapy. Complete blood profile is done before starting chemotherapy. “Chemotherapy should be done only in bio-safety cabins. Just a drop of the drug can burn a large portion of the skin, and inhaling of the drug is also dangerous,” explained Dr. Selvaraj. In most cases, the symptoms will disappear, and the dogs will become normal. When there is a relapse, it will be difficult for the animal as the lymphoma cells develop resistance to drugs used for chemotherapy. “What holds good for humans also holds good for dogs. Do not miss the annual check-up of your doctor. It will help in early diagnosis of all diseases,” stressed Dr. Chandrasekar.  The project was funded by the Department of Biotechnology of the Central government in 2018... Now we are running it with available resources. It will be of great help if the project is extended M.

21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:42 IST,||The untold story of a silent revolution||A silent revolution in the research and development (R&D) space has been on in Tamil Nadu in recent years. Industry captains say the State’s progress has remained an untold story, and there is potential to make it a hub for innovation. According to statistics from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, Tamil Nadu’s R&D spend stood at Rs. 668 crore in financial year 2017-18, accounting for about 9.5% of Rs. 7,264.81 crore spent in India. This was the second highest, after Gujarat, which accounted for 10.9%. The State has 751 R&D institutions as of 2021 and 2,742 patents were filed in 2017-18 accounting for 17.6% of the 15,550 applications filed by Indian nationals. Only Maharashtra, with 24.6% of patents, was ahead. French glass and building materials maker Saint-Gobain explored at least four different States where it had a manufacturing footprint to set up an R&D centre. “Finally we zeroed in on Chennai, first because of the talent pool, second because of the IIT Madras Research Park ecosystem and the fact that we can have an R&D facility right in the heart of the city. The attrition levels are also lower,” says B. Santhanam, CEO Asia-Pacific, Saint-Gobain. The company set up its R&D facility in 2012 and moved into a permanent place at IIT Madras Research Park in 2016 and has done 120 patents, including 26 filed last year. Another success story is the Mahindra Research Valley (MRV) set up in 2012, 60 km from Chennai in Mahindra World City. “In 2005, we decided to relocate our R&D set-up from Nashik and create a facility near Chennai. It was a bold and difficult decision to make since that was the team that developed our successful product — Scorpio,” says R. Velusamy, chief of Global Product Development, Automotive Division, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. The XUV 500, All New Thar and XUV700, developed at MRV, have seen robust bookings since launch. MRV has also filed 1,591 patents. Mr. Velusamy says the vast talent pool in Tamil Nadu, which produces two lakh engineering graduates annually (35 of its colleges are in the top 200 in India), has created a vibrant ecosystem and is playing a leading role in the success of many companies in India and globally. The roots of R&D go way back to the establishment of Central Leather Research Institute in Chennai in 1948, as a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-CLRI). “While many are talking about academia research and industry collaboration in recent times, in 1948 itself we had the trio of the University of Madras, CLRI and the leather industry working together,” says K.J. Sreeram, Director, CSIR-CLRI. He says the aim was to convert the trader-oriented industry into a technology-oriented manufacturer of leather products. CLRI’s future initiative will include footwear research. It has undertaken an all-India foot sampling survey to collect over a lakh samples from different age and gender groups and finalise a report this year. This will ultimately lead to India having its own foot-sizing scheme. “The R&D investments have by and large been in areas where there is also industrial activity within the State. Tamil Nadu is among the first three positions in India in automotive, auto components, general engineering, space tech, software, wind energy, healthcare, cotton spinning and readymade garments. Many of these sectors are becoming highly competitive and there is a significant role for R&D to add value,” explains Srivats Ram, MD, Wheels India, and president, Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In the automotive sector, the government, the industry and the academia could collaborate to improve the quality of R&D such as software engineering, Artificial Intelligence, cyber-technologies, electrification of vehicles involving new battery technologies, he says. Mr. Santhanam says the State’s R&D story isn’t only about automotive sector. There are companies in engineering and construction which have set up their R&D capabilities. Naveen Unni, managing partner, Chennai, McKinsey and Company, says his firm has studied at least 10 countries known to have a strong R&D presence. These are in two groups: the first with long established ecosystems like Switzerland, Norway, the U.S., the U.K., Sweden and Japan; and the second is a recently developed R&D ecosystem like South Korea, China, Singapore and Ireland. The key takeaway for Tamil Nadu could be to make leadership in R&D a priority, identify the sectors and channelise the funding to create a favourable regulatory framework.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-untold-story-of-a-silent-revolution/article64947656.ece
21 January 2022||January 21 2022 06:43 IST,||Betting big||Tamil Nadu, known as the Detroit of Asia for over two decades with the presence of major automobile manufacturing units and allied industries in and around Chennai, has quickly embraced the Electric Vehicle (EV) wave. In the last six months, the DMK government of M.K. Stalin has inked 10 memoranda of understanding in the EV space, entailing an investment of Rs. 6,541 crore and jobs for 26,865 people. Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu has said the government is working on a revised EV policy with special features that will help in the manifold increase in production and infrastructure development for EV production and the needs of users. Talks under way According to Pooja Kulkarni, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Guidance, the nodal agency for attracting investments, over a dozen EV companies have committed themselves to invest in the State. Over 15 companies are in active discussions; around 20 companies, which are engaged in technology development, charging infrastructure, after sales services, are in talks with the government. She says the State is taking conscious steps to address the issues in the demand for charging infrastructure. “You would soon see policy and infrastructure announcements being made.” “Tamil Nadu has the natural strength of being India’s automobile hub, making EV ecosystem growth more of an organic phenomenon,” she said. “With over 20 OEMs and a vast base of tier-1-tier-3 suppliers engaged in manufacture of tyres, wheels, steering, seats, sheet metal, brakes, suspension, harness and so on, Tamil Nadu is a mature ecosystem for catering to EV growth,” she says. Ms. Kulkarni said e-mobility solutions in public transport are another area the State is exploring. Soon Tamil Nadu will receive investment in the manufacture of passenger transport vehicles. For the EV industry, the government has been looking beyond Chennai. A lot of investments has come in and around the Hosur region and companies like Ather Energy, TVS Motors, Ola Electric and Simple Energy are among the firms to have established their presence. In Coimbatore, start-ups such as Boom Motors and Sri Varu Motors, apart from Greaves Electric Mobility, are rolling out electric two-wheelers from their manufacturing units. Greaves is expanding in Ranipet. Chennai is also being promoted as it provides the advantage of ‘ease of importing’ EV components and exporting EVs through seaports and airports. The industrial auto clusters in Chennai help to reduce the logistics costs and supply chain risks such as inventory cost, component unavailability and transport losses. Mobility park A first-of-its kind Rs. 300-crore EV future mobility park is coming up at Soolagiri in Krishnagiri. Efforts are made to develop an industrial park at Manallur. Once operational, these parks will facilitate the creation of a vendor ecosystem that will serve EV OEMs. Common facilities will be provided to the vendor industries for prototyping, testing and training in these EV parks. Charging infrastructure has been among the biggest constraints for the EV industry. But officials say the government is working on ways to set up charging stations with the active participation of public sector units like Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation and private players. Ms. Kulkarni says the government will develop schemes with appropriate capital subsidies to enable private operators to set up public charging stations. Provision for charging stations will be made at hotels, shopping malls, cinemas and apartments. Service-providers could also set up renewable energy generating stations on their own premises. “Under the network value chain, the State is planning to create a recycling environment by promoting reuse of EV batteries and focussing on urban mining of rare materials within the battery for reuse by battery manufacturers.” The State is looking at encouraging startups introducing innovative battery swapping solutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/betting-big/article64947654.ece

Copies of the complaint have been given to Sugar Minister Shankar Patil Munenakoppa and Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath. On Thursday, KRRS leaders led a protest in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s Office in Belagavi. Leaders Jayashree Gurannanavar and Basavaraj Ingle met the Deputy Commissioner and urged him to protect the loanee farmers. “The Mugat Khan Hubli-based factory has collected KYC documents from the farmers and workers and taken huge loans in their names. It has made them sign 40-page documents, making false promises that it will give shares in the factory and COVID-19 compensation. The factory has not told the farmers that it is arranging loans for them. The local branch of the Bank of India has released the loans, considering the factory as the guarantor. The farmers don’t know this and neither has the money come to their accounts. Now, each farmer has a loan burden of around Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 8 lakh, which he has not taken, but is being forced to repay,” Ms. Gurannanavar told the Deputy Commissioner. She said that the fraud was detected when some farmers went to the Bank of India branch at Mugat Khan Hubli to take loans under the livelihood programme of the Government. The Deputy Commissioner assured them of looking into the issue sympathetically and seeking directions from the Government. Shocked  “Kallappa Chalavadi, a young farm hand from Mugat Khan Hubli, went to the bank to get a loan sanctioned from the Dr. Ambedkar Corporation. But he was shocked when the officer rejected his application, saying that he has already taken a loan from their branch. He realised that the factory has taken a loan in his name and appropriated the money,” Ms. Gurannanavar told The Hindu .  According to her, the factory has cheated 150 to 160 families and taken around Rs. 15 crore in such loans. The KRRS has also filed a complaint with the Bank of India branch. The bank’s senior manager has issued an acknowledgement and an assurance that the managers will try to resolve the issue in a week. Sugar factory chairman and Janata Dal(S) leader Naseer Bagwan was not available for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sugar-factory-accused-of-taking-loans-by-cheating-farmers/article64947692.ece

This was the first such postgraduate programme offered by any university in the country, the central varsity said. In the first batch for the course, the university admitted 45 students, including a foreign student. The “inter-disciplinary programme” course was in line with the New Education Policy 2020, said rector V.K. Shukla. The course would make the world aware of many unknown aspects of Hindu Dharma and help in taking its teachings to more people, he said. The lecture sessions for the first week of the course also has as subjects, “Evolution of Hindu Dharma”, “What is Hindu Studies” and “Indian Epistemology & Metaphysics.” Vijay Shankar Shukla, director, Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts, underlined the need to have such a course and said that the idea behind this went back to 18th century scholar Ganganath Jha and “travels through time to Mahamana [Madan Mohan Malviya].” “However, the link was broken for some reasons. But, with the initiation of this course the goal appears to have been achieved,” he said. The course under Faculty of Arts would be conducted in collaboration with the varsity’s Department of Philosophy and Religion, Department of Sanskrit and Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/banaras-hindu-university-starts-new-course-on-hindu-studies/article64947688.ece

Schools in the State were closed in the wake of the spread of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The State’s School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad on Thursday said, “After the increase in COVID positive cases in the State, the government had decided to discontinue offline classes till February 15. But after discussions with experts and also looking at the present drop in the number of cases, it has been decided to reopen schools from Monday.” The proposal to reopen schools from Classes 1to 12 was sent to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Ms. Gaikwad added that even though the government has allowed the reopening of schools from Monday, the final decision on fixing the date stands with local authorities such as the Municipal Corporation and Zilla Parishad. “These bodies will take a decision based on the local situation with respect to COVID-19,” she said. The State’s Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant, too, on Thursday said that the proposal to reopen colleges in the State had been sent to the CM and he would take the final decision on it. The State government had directed that all schools and colleges be closed till February 15 when the Omicron variant led to a surge in the number of positive cases. But a number of teacher and parent organisations from the interiors of the State, where the number of COVID-19 patients remained low, questioned the government’s decision on the blanket closure of classes. Teacher organisations had also written to the Education Department, requesting the decentralisation of decision-making in closing schools, and allowing local authorities the right to decide. They said online education could not be an alternative to in-person education, and also drew attention to the poor quality of education reaching students, especially of primary classes, in the online mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/maharashtra-government-to-reopen-schools-from-january-24/article38300994.ece

Meanwhile, the Press Club of India (PCI) has urged the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) “to ensure that the club [KPC] be allowed elections in the interest of transparency and democratic functioning”.  In a joint statement issued by ten organisations registered with the KPC, Kashmir-based journalists demanded the restoration of the KPC’s status quo as on January 13, 2022. “The journalists resolved to seek an explanation from the registering authority on the grounds on which the KPC’s re-registration was placed ‘in abeyance’ and the club shut down in an arbitrary manner,” a spokesperson said.  The journalist bodies resolved to explore all avenues for the restoration of the KPC at the earliest. “It also gave a week’s time to the last elected 11-member body to brief the journalist bodies on the developments with regard to restoration of the KPC. It also condemned the attempted forcible takeover by a tiny group of journalists and subsequent shutting down of the KPC by the J&K administration,” the spokesperson said. Naming the umbrella body as the Kashmir Media Coalition, the journalists expressed gratitude to the various prominent journalist bodies — including the Editors Guild of India, the Press Council of India, the Indian Union of Journalists, the Foreign Correspondents Club, the Chennai Press Club, the Kolkata Press Club, the Press Club of India, the Mumbai Press Club and the Delhi Union of Journalists; and international media watchdogs Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) — for their support and solidarity. ‘Extremely unfortunate’ The Press Club of India (PCI), in a letter to J&K L-G Manoj Sinha on Thursday termed the armed takeover of the KPC on January 14, 2022 as “extremely unfortunate”. The PCI demanded early elections at the press club. “What is most troublesome is that a factional war within journalist groups was presented as the front behind which the administration executed its coercive action. This was done weeks after KPC’s registration was renewed and just when the club authorities had announced fresh elections to its executive body,” the PCI said. The PCI sought the Lieutenant-Governor’s urgent intervention “to restore the land and registration of the Club”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/journalists-join-hands-to-fight-for-kashmir-press-club/article38301002.ece

The meeting is expected to be attended by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar; former Chief Minister of Maharashtra and current PWD Minister Ashok Chavan; Cabinet Minister of food and civil supply Chhagan Bhujbal; Minister of Water Resources Department, Jayant Patil; transport Minister Anil Parab, Minister for Tourism and Environment Aaditya Thackeray; Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat and Minister for Urban Development, Eknath Shinde. The meeting is labelled as “important” with the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s ruling on January 19, granting two weeks time to the State Backward Classes Commission to submit an interim report to the State on the data collected by its agencies. The State government had informed the apex court that it has collected some data on the basis of which reservation can be sustained. The court then directed the State to share its data with the Commission and in-turn directed the Commission to submit an interim report on the same in two weeks. The State had moved an application before the court to recall its order of notifying 27% of OBC seats to general category. To which justice A.M. Khanwilkar had said, “There is no question of recalling the order, it can be modified at best. There can be no reservation for OBC without the ‘triple test’ and a dedicated Commission has to decide that..” The bench however clarified that the data collected by the State on the socially and educationally backward classes would be independent of the census carried out by the Centre. The Supreme Court on December 6, 2021, had directed the Election Commission to treat OBC category as nullified and on December 15, the apex court had directed the EC to consider OBC seats as open category.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/uddhav-calls-cabinet-meeting-to-discuss-quota-issue/article64947684.ece

Senior advocate Anil Anturkar, the government's lawyer, said though such a restriction encroaches on the fundamental right to move freely under Article 19 (1)(d) of the Constitution, it is “reasonable” in view of the pandemic. “This is a reasonable restriction imposed on the citizen's fundamental right and such prohibition has been imposed in the larger public interest, for their own benefit,” he said. He was arguing before a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M.S. Karnik during the final hearing on Public Interest Litigations challenging the ban on travel by local trains by those who have not taken both the doses of vaccine. The notification requiring vaccination certificate for local train travel was issued in August 2021. Petitioners’ counsels Neelesh Ojha and Tanveer Nizam had argued that the notification was illegal, arbitrary, and violated the right to equality and free movement. Advocate Anturkar said this was a precautionary step, taken in the light of the earlier experience. “Maharashtra suffered terribly during the first wave (of the pandemic) due to dearth of medical oxygen. Therefore, we want to be very cautious this time and take all possible precautions to minimize spread of cases,” he said. While vaccination may not guarantee full immunity, it is “a step to avoid hospitalization and death” and the restrictions on train travel have been imposed “to avoid extreme eventualities,” the government counsel added. The petitioners had also contended that the Union government's “national plan” to tackle the pandemic precluded any kind of discrimination, including that between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated ‘Not discrimination’ Mr. Anturkar denied that the restriction on train travel amounted to discrimination. “Is there a national plan under the Disaster Management Act to tackle COVID, and does it prohibit State governments from discriminating between the vaccinated and unvaccinated when it comes to access to public utilities?” he further asked. The High Court asked the Union government's lawyer to clarify the position on this point and adjourned the hearing to Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/local-train-ban-for-unvaccinated-in-public-interest/article64947686.ece

The agency has got his six-day custody from the court concerned. The accused, Anas Ahmed, is a partner in H & S Ventures Inc and Clifford Ventures that allegedly collected about Rs. 84 crore from the victims. “Anas Ahmed has Chinese links and is suspected of being the mastermind of the whole racket,” said the ED. The fraud was committed through applications like “Power Bank”. In Chennai prison Ahmed was earlier lodged in the Puzhal Central Prison, Chennai, in a case registered by the CB-CID there. It is alleged that he, along with his associates, promised to remit interests on a daily or weekly basis on investments made through “Power Bank” and other such fraudulent applications. However, the entities were shut down after collecting huge sums of money from gullible public, following which the accused persons went underground. “Anas Ahmed indulged in corrupt and illegal activities through his partnership firms by deviating from the declared line of business/activity of gaming and has collected money from public in the guise of investment schemes...the proceeds generated through criminal activities have been layered through a number of shell entities for sending the funds abroad and also investing them in crypto currencies,” an official said. The Chennai Police, in June 2021, registered a case on the basis of multiple complaints alleging that investors were cheated via “Power Bank” and “Tesla Power Bank” mobile applications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/alleged-mastermind-of-power-bank-case-held/article64947678.ece
