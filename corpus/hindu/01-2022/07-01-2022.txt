The Constitution (One Hundred and Third) Amendment Act introducing EWS quota came into force on January 14, 2019. On January 17 the same year, the government released an official memorandum (OM) informing that families earning a gross annual income below Rs. 8 lakh would be identified as EWS for benefit of reservation. “The Amendment came on January 14. On January 17, the OM comes... So the whole process of consultation, discussion, etc, with Social Justice Ministry was completed and everything was done by January 17?” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud asked Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta. Mr. Mehta said the Rs. 8 lakh limit was derived after study. “It was not an unstudied position,” the top law officer maintained. The Bench, also comprising Justice A.S. Bopanna, then pointed to an affidavit filed by the government in October last, which revealed that the Rs. 8 lakh threshold was “largely based” on the criterion to identify the creamy lawyer in the OBC quota. The court said this earlier position in October was quite contrary to the later conclusions of the government’s own expert committee, headed by former Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, in December. The committee, formed by the government to review the Rs. 8 lakh limit, in its report on December 31, maintained that the Rs. 8 lakh threshold fixed to identify EWS was not a “mechanical adoption” of the OBC creamy layer cut-off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-says-rs-8-lakh-ews-cap-derived-after-study/article38162353.ece

While Union government sources blamed the State government and the police for the incident, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi played down the entire controversy as a diversion from the thin attendance at a rally that Mr. Modi was scheduled to address in Ferozepur. At a rally in Machhiwara on Thursday, Mr. Channi said: “Punjabis have never ever shied away from making sacrifices for the nation and none can question the nationalistic credentials of Punjab… barely 700 people turned up at the rally site. This forced him [the PM] to retrace his steps and later the blame was pinned on our government citing security threat to him.” The Chief Minister added that five days earlier, the Special Protection Group (SPG) that handles the Prime Minister’s security had taken over the venue and was in charge of his travel. ‘Exposed to risk’ The Union Home Ministry said a three-member committee of Sudhir Kumar Saxena, Secretary (Security), Cabinet Secretariat; Balbir Singh, Joint Director, Intelligence Bureau; and S. Suresh, Inspector-General, Special Protection Group, will probe the serious lapses “which led to the exposure of the VVIP to grave security risk”, adding that “the committee is advised to submit the report at the earliest”. The Ministry had earlier termed the incident “a major lapse in the security of the PM”. It had sought a detailed report from the State government and asked it to fix responsibility for the lapse and take strict action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-panel-to-probe-security-lapse/article38162355.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:44 IST,||TTD, Ramakrishna Mission lose FCRA nod||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), the Ramakrishna Mission, and the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST) in Shirdi are among the 6,000 NGOs that did not have their FCRA registration renewed by the Union Home Ministry recently. The Tirupati Venkateswara temple in Andhra Pradesh and the Ramakrishna Mission are registered as Hindu religious organisations, while the SSST falls under the “religious (others)” category of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA). Registered associations can receive foreign contributions for social, educational, religious, economic and cultural purposes. The FCRA registration is mandatory for receiving foreign funds. The Ministry did not comment on why the FCRA registration of the three religious associations had not been renewed. A few days ago, after reports emerged that the FCRA registration of Missionaries of Charity, set up by Nobel laureate Mother Teresa, had not been renewed, the Ministry issued a statement on December 27, saying that it had refused to renew the organisation’s registration as “some adverse inputs were noticed”. The Ministry asserted in an order on December 31 that NGOs that had had their request for renewal turned down would not be eligible to either receive or utilise the foreign contributions to their designated bank accounts. According to annual returns filed by the TTD on December 22, 2021, for the financial year 2020-21, it had Rs. 13.4 crore in its designated foreign contribution bank account, of which Rs. 13.3 crore had been donated by foreign pilgrims who visited the temple. The SSST filed its annual returns on December 31, stating that it had more than Rs. 5 crore in its foreign contribution account. The Ramakrishna Mission registered in Maharashtra filed its returns in July, declaring that it had Rs. 1.3 crore in its designated foreign contribution bank account. The FCRA registration of other Ramakrishna Mission ashrams registered in West Bengal, Bihar and other parts of the country has also not been renewed. A senior government official said the NGOs that have not had their FCRA registration renewed may re-apply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ttd-ramakrishna-mission-lose-fcra-nod/article38162358.ece

Raghavendra Rao has been booked on charges of abetment to suicide in connection with the heart-wrenching incident of suicide by a debt-ridden businessman Ramakrishna, who immolated himself, his wife and two daughters to death in old Paloncha on Monday. With Raghavendra Rao, who is still at large, coming under a cloud of allegations of land settlements and undue interference in financial disputes, his father released an open letter to the people of Kothagudem constituency on Thursday. In his letter, the four-time MLA said: “I am pained by the tragic suicide incident and distressed over the misinformation campaign by some elements attributing the incident to the ruling TRS party.” I will keep my son away from the constituency and party activities till the completion of the investigation and trial into the case in an impartial manner, he said in his three page letter. Earlier in the day, the selfie-video shot by Ramakrishna before resorting to the extreme step on Monday went viral on social media creating ripples across the State Meanwhile, activists of various political parties and mass organisations staged protests in Kothagudem and Paloncha on Thursday demanding harshest punishment to the accused in the suicide case. The CPI district council and CPI (ML-ND) sought deterrent action against the accused.  Paloncha Assistant Superintendent of Police Rohith Raj told The Hindu that special teams have been deployed to track down Raghavendra Rao, who is still absconding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/suicide-abetment-noose-tightens-around-trs-leader/article38162667.ece

At a press briefing after a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs J.C. Madhuswamy said that a few Ministers had expressed their views on whether a State-wide weekend curfew till January 19 was needed when several districts had very low COVID-19 test positivity rate. A review would be held with the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee before the next weekend, he said. Several trade bodies and the Congress had also opposed the weekend curfew as “unscientific” and alleged that “it hits hard on the livelihoods of the people”. Bengaluru Urban district accounts for the maximum number of cases: on Friday alone it reported 4,324 new positive cases. Severe restrictions would be imposed on movement of people, except in sectors exempted from the curfew --- all industries, health, government bodies, grocers, and home delivery. Those working in these sectors need to furnish valid documents to have hassle-free movement. “We will enforce the rules in a strict manner and anybody found travelling without a valid reason and proper documents will be booked and detained,” City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said. Though both inter-State and intra-State travel was allowed, all public transport --- buses and metro --- would run with less frequency, only to cater to essential services. Air and train travel has been permitted and both public and private transport allowed to and from railway stations and airports, with valid travel documents by commuters. Groceries, milk, meat, street vendors, and PDS shops will be open. All eateries have been allowed to be open only for takeaways, even as home delivery of services is being encouraged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/weekend-curfew-in-state-begins-tonight/article38162383.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked the employees associations to “think practically and not to expect more” in view of the precarious State finances. The employees associations were expected to respond positively as the State was passing through “turbulent times”. The employees were expected to appreciate the current situation and not impose additional and unbearable financial burden on the government, he said. Mr. Jagan, however, was quick to add: “I am your family member. You will hardly find a person who is more compassionate and humanitarian than me. I will do whatever I can to the best of my ability. The government will issue a statement on the PRC in the next 2 to 3 days.” The Chief Minister held a meeting with 13 employees’ associations on implementation of the Pay Revision Commission (PRC), on Thursday. Barring the assurance that the government was considering the release of pending five dearness allowance instalments as the first priority, Mr. Jagan made no mention about the other major demands raised by the employees’ associations, including the abolition of the Contributory Pension Scheme. Explaining the State finances, Mr. Jagan said the State Own Revenues (SORs), usually, increase by 15% every year, and the SORs should have touched about Rs. 84,000 crore by 2020-21. But, the SORs that were Rs. 62,503 crore in 2018-19 came down to Rs. 60,934 crore in 2019-20. The SORs further dipped to Rs. 60,688 crore during 2020-21. On other hand, expenditure on salaries and pensions was Rs. 52,513 crore in 2018-19 and has increased to Rs. 67,340 crore by 2020-21. The salaries and pensions bill was Rs. 36,000 crore during the first seven months of the financial year of 2021-22. In comparison, the neighboring Telangana government had paid Rs. 22,608 crore during the same period.  “We are talking about pay revision but Omicron is spreading fast. We don’t know what impact it will have and how it will affect our revenues. Are we in a position to make a decision (on pay hike) and go ahead?,” says Jagan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/prc-jagan-asks-staff-to-think-practically/article38162349.ece

Long seen as one the most stable of the ex-Soviet republics of Central Asia, energy-rich Kazakhstan is facing its biggest crisis in decades after days of protests over rising fuel prices escalated into widespread unrest. Under increasing pressure, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev appealed overnight to the Russia- domina- ted Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), which includes five other ex-Soviet states, to combat what he called “terrorist groups” that had “received extensive training abroad”. Within hours, the alliance said the first troops had been sent — including Russian paratroopers and military units from the other CSTO members — in its first major joint action since its founding in 1999. “Peacekeeping forces... were sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan for a limited time to stabilise and normalise the situation,” the CSTO said in a statement, without specifying the number of troops involved. The CSTO’s current Chairman, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, earlier announced that the alliance would agree to the request, saying Kazakhstan was facing “outside interference”. Footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry showed military planes being loaded with troops and armoured trucks before taking off for Kazakhstan. In the worst reported violence so far, the police said dozens of people were killed in overnight battles with security forces at government buildings in the country’s largest city Almaty. Videos on social media showed pillaged shops and burned buildings in Almaty, automatic gunfire on the streets and residents screaming in fear. Officials said more than 1,000 people had been wounded in the unrest, with nearly 400 hospitalised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/russia-led-troops-deployed-in-kazakhstan/article38162356.ece

According to a press release issued by Enforcement Directorate, Mr. Appugol was arrested under provisions of Money Laundering Act 2002 in a case of cheating the public of Rs. 250 crore. The Enforcement Directorate initiated investigation in the money laundering case against Mr. Appugol and 15 others on the basis of an FIR registered by Khade Bazaar Police in Belagavi under Sections 406, 408 and 420 of IPC. According to the release, investigation revealed that the society had collected Rs. 250 crore of deposits till March 2017 from more than 26,000 people promising them high interest. However, the society failed to return the money to the depositors in time thereby cheating them. According to the investigation, the funds of the society were misused for purchasing movable and immovable property causing huge loss to the depositors. The Enforcement Directorate, after arresting Mr. Appugol, produced him before the City Civil and Sessions Judge and Special Judge for PMLA cases in Bengaluru. The judge remanded the accused in Enforcement Directorate custody for seven days, the release said. Mr. Appugol was earlier arrested by Belagavi Police in connection with cases of cheating.

Objecting to some students coming to the college with scarves, a group of students came to the college sporting shawls. They said that they have the support of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and the Bajrang Dal And, a representative of these students met the college principal later and said that if no action is taken to stop wearing of scarves, then more students will come to the college with shawls. The college management was surprised with this development as girls have been coming to college for many years wearing scarves. “We were surprised with the objection now. There was no prior representation by these students to the principal questioning students wearing scarves,” said a representative of the college management. The college’s governing council on Thursday held a meeting of students, parents and lecturers. Representatives from the Department of Collegiate Education, Mangalore University, and the police also attended the meeting. Following an hour-long deliberation, the college management asked students to come to college from Monday by wearing uniform. Meanwhile, to a question at a press conference here on Thursday, Vice-Chancellor of the university P.S. Yadapadithaya said that no student should resort to such a method to dilute the academic atmosphere. The focus of students should be on studies as the normal academic activities have already been disturbed due to matters related to COVID-19. Colleges should nip such issues in the bud. The university will discuss the matter further by forming a committee and arrive at a decision and later, a circular will be issued to all affiliated colleges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/college-asks-students-to-stick-to-dress-code/article38162807.ece

Addressing the weekly press briefing on Thursday, Arindam Bagchi addressed a number of issues related to India-China ties. He stressed that China should not complicate the bilateral relations “further”. “Calling Tuting as “DouDeng” or River Siyom as “XiYueMu” or even Kibithu as “Daba” does not alter the fact that Arunachal Pradesh has always been and will always remain an inalienable part of India,” he stated. China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs last week announced “standardised” names of 15 locations in Arunachal Pradesh. This was the second time since 2017 that such an exercise was carried out by Beijing. Mr. Bagchi said, “We hope that instead of engaging in such antics, China will work constructively with us to resolve the outstanding friction points in areas along the western sector of the LAC in India-China border areas”. Bridge in Ladakh Referring to the reports of China building a bridge across the Pangong Tso (lake) in Ladakh, he observed that the government was “monitoring this activity closely”. The construction was taking place in an area that’s been under China’s “illegal occupation” for six decades. “India never accepted such illegal occupation,” he asserted. Mr. Bagchi also took up the issue of a recent letter that the Political Counsellor of the Embassy of China sent to a group of MPs who attended a meeting of the All Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet (APIPFT), and urged the Chinese authorities to “refrain from hyping normal activities” by the Indian parliamentarians. “The substance, tone and tenor of the letter are inappropriate. Chinese side should note that India is a vibrant democracy and Hon’ble MPs, as representatives of the people, undertake activities as per their views and beliefs,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/renaming-arunachal-places-a-ridiculous-exercise-says-india/article38162063.ece

The State’s Director-General of Police (DGP) had cleared the PM’s road trip. Advance security liaison (ASL) meetings were held and intelligence inputs on sabotage possibilities shared, but the State police did not adhere to the Blue Book guidelines of the Special Protection Group on the Prime Minister’s security, they alleged. Stating that the overall responsibility for ensuring the PM’s safety was with the State government under the Blue Book’s Chapter 1, Rule 1, the sources said the SPG had the duty of providing proximate security. Under Rule 2, the State police were required to make all the protective arrangements, while Rule 5 made the DGP responsible for implementing the rules. The ASL meetings were conducted by the SPG, the Punjab administration and the police on January 1 and 2. A contingency plan for a road journey from Bathinda to Ferozepur was discussed in detail. Therefore, a route survey for the identification of vulnerable points was to be conducted to secure them with strong police deployment.  The contingency rehearsal for the road journey was carried out on January 4. The sources said the State police’s internal communications showed exchanges on securing the roads for his visit, taking into account the possibility of any dharna or movement of farmers or protesters for disrupting the PM’s rally.  Bad weather A Union Home Ministry statement on Wednesday said Mr. Modi was to reach the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala in Ferozepur by helicopter, but with bad weather, the road route, “which would take more than two hours”, was opted for. A rally at Ferozepur was cancelled. The PM’s itinerary, as shared by the Punjab Congress on Twitter, said he was to leave the Bhatinda airport by helicopter at 10.30 a.m. and arrive at the Kila Chowk helipad (Ferozepur) by 11.05 a.m. The motorcade was then to take a 10-minute drive to the memorial.  As word got out that Mr. Modi was to travel by road from Bhatinda, a distance of over 100 km, supporters of a farmers’ union, who were on their way to the office of the District Commissioner for a protest, mobilised more people, forcing the motorcade to stop for 15-20 minutes on a flyover and return, said another government official. “The previous night [January 4], protesters had gathered at various points, but the police asked them to return and they came back the next morning,” said another official. On Wednesday, Surjeet Singh Phul, Bharatiya Kisan Union(Krantikaari) president, told The Hindu that its members were protesting on the Ferozepur-Moga stretch against the PM’s visit. On Thursday, he posted a video on Twitter stating that nearly 1,000 people, while on their way to the DC’s office, were stopped by the police around 10.30 a.m.  ‘Traffic jam’ “Soon the gathering swelled to more than 2,000 people. We did not intend to stop his motorcade, but when we were stopped, we had no option but to wait there… whatever happened there was spontaneous, there was no pre-planning, when we caused a traffic jam, PM was caught in it,” Mr. Phul said. The protesters, he said, had picketed the main roads and highways leading to Ferozepur. Government sources said that when flying from Bathinda was not possible, the SPG Director discussed with the Punjab DGP the possibility of going by road. After clearance from the police chief, the road journey was planned. Senior Superintendents of Police piloted the motorcade. “Even if timely information about the blockade was relayed to the PM’s motorcade by the police control room, the situation of getting stuck on a flyover could have been averted...,” said an official, adding that all along the route, there was skeletal police deployment. When the motorcade got stuck, no visible efforts were made by the policemen to clear the blockade, they said. In accordance with the Blue Book, a car was ear-marked for the Chief Secretary and the DGP but neither joined. The sources said the police control room failed to inform the pilot of the motorcade about the protests.

This is the first time in seven months that daily cases have crossed the one lakh mark in the country. Previously, 1,01,209 new cases were registered on June 6, 2021. On Thursday, Maharashtra reported 36,265 new infections, followed by West Bengal (15,421) and Delhi (15,097). The figures do not include cases from Tripura, Lakshadweep and Ladakh. Until Thursday morning, the total number of infections detected of the Omicron variant stood at 2,630, with the biggest single-day jump of 495 Omicron cases, according to Union Health Ministry data. Meanwhile, the Centre has urged nine States and Union Territories to ramp up COVID-19 testing to ensure that infected people do not spread the virus to others. In a letter to Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Jammu and Kashmir and Bihar, Additional Secretary of Union Health Ministry Arti Ahuja pointed out a considerable decline in COVID-19 testing amid rising cases and positivity rate and termed it a “cause of concern”. In the absence of sufficient testing, the true level of infection spread in the community would not be revealed, Ms. Ahuja said in her letter dated January 5. States have been asked to review and ensure availability of sufficient stock of testing reagents and kits. On Thursday, Gujarat recorded 4,213 cases, taking the tally of active cases to 14,346. There are 28 patients on ventilator support. So far, a total of 204 Omicron cases have been reported from the State. Odisha recorded its first Omicron virus variant-related death on Thursday in Balangir district, where a 45-year-old woman died while under COVID-19 treatment. Andhra Pradesh reported 547 new infections, the highest single-day tally in the past 71 days. Karnataka reported 5,031 new cases with Bengaluru Urban alone accounting for 4,324 cases. Kerala reported 4,649 new cases. Fifty more Omicron cases have also been confirmed, taking the total number of Omicron cases detected so far in the State to 280. In Assam, 844 new cases were detected when 35,562 people were tested for COVID-19. Two new deaths have also been added to the State’s COVID toll. The current test positivity rate is 2.37%. Arunachal Pradesh reported 32 new COVID-19 cases, nine more than the previous day, with the tally rising to 55,407, a health department official said. Arunachal Pradesh now has 75 active cases.

Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur termed the security breach “not just a lapse, but a major lapse in the Prime Minister’s security in Punjab”. Whatever steps needed to be taken for justice would be taken, he stated. “After gathering necessary information, whatever steps, as big and stringent as they may be, will be taken...I believe the country’s judicial system gives justice to all and in the case of this whatever steps need to be taken will be taken,” he said while briefing the presspersons about Cabinet decisions. The BJP and some of his Cabinet colleagues squarely blamed the Congress, which is in power in Punjab, over the issue. “Prime Minister Modi was in Punjab where the Congress is in power and his security was compromised. It is utterly shameful that Congress people are saying bad words about him,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said at a public meeting in Uttarkashi. Minister of State at the Prime Minister’s Office Jitendra Singh described on his Twitter account the protests carried out by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (youth wing of the BJP) in Dehradun as a “BJYM protest at Dehradun Congress Bhavan against the Congress conspiracy to kill PM Modi.” He appended the hashtag #ModiJiJiyoHazaroSaal (Modi may you live a 1000 years) to the tweet.  Senior BJP leaders in various States carried out Mahamritynunajaya Yagya in various temples, with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and his Tripura counterpart Biplab Kumar Deb leading in this effort.   Sources in the party said the issue was in a manner of the “ main bhi chowkidar hoon [I am also a chowkidar]” campaign that Mr. Modi ran during the 2019 polls. Party social media followers have been changing their handles to “I am Modi” to identify with him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-goes-all-out-holds-rituals-to-back-pm/article38162077.ece

The communication comes in the light of the spike in cases. The Ministry has directed that the control rooms should be adequately staffed with doctors, counsellors and volunteers, and shall be equipped with ample phone lines to cater to the assigned population. Computers and broadband must be provided for uninterrupted connectivity and depending on the case load, the hubs shall remain functional round-the-clock to provide validated guidance/support to the patients. Arti Ahuja, Additional Secretary, Health Ministry, stated in the communication that the control rooms must have real-time data on availability of COVID-19 testing centres, ambulances and so on. Information must be provided to callers on how to avail the services. The control rooms are also expected to monitor the availability of different types of beds across the assigned health facilities. Counselling can be offered to patients/attendants to avail services based on clinical symptoms and availability of beds. Monitoring status “Clear and transparent mechanism for allotment of beds must be ensured by the control rooms and dedicated ambulances shall be allotted to each control room based on area caseload for transportation of patients, as per the need. The control rooms shall also be responsible to make outbound calls to the patients under home isolation for regular monitoring of their status,” the letter said. Ms. Ahuja said one of the core responsibilities of the control rooms shall be to collate the daily status report of all patients under home isolation in the jurisdiction and submit it to the district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-tells-states-to-revive-control-rooms-at-district-level/article38162088.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:45 IST,||Use drones more effectively: Civil Aviation Ministry||In a nationwide programme to take the third eye to the sky, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) has called for more effective utilisation of drone applications and urged the Ministry of Home Affairs to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, situational analysis, crime control, VVIP security, disaster management, etc. In a note sent to at least a dozen Ministries, the Secretary, MoCA, Rajiv Bansal, said drones offered tremendous benefits to almost every sector of the economy, including but not limited to, national defence, agriculture, law enforcement, and mapping, among others. As part of the initiatives to make India a global hub for drones under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and in the backdrop of the Union government rolling out the liberalised Drone Rules 2021, he suggested the heads of various Ministries promote effective use of the technology. The suggestions include deployment of drones for combat, communication in remote areas, counter-drone solutions, etc., by the Ministry of Defence; and delivery of medicines, collection of samples from remote or epidemic/pandemic-affected areas by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Acting on the recommendations that unmanned aerial vehicles could be used to undertake disaster management, incidence response, inspection/maintenance works and project monitoring, the Ministry of Railways wrote to General Managers across its network to implement the ideas, sources in the Railways said, adding that the Principal Chief Security Commissioner, Western Railway, had been nominated as the nodal officer to co-ordinate with the Aviation Ministry for guidance and support. Real-time surveillance The Petroleum and Natural Gas, and Power Ministries, have been asked to fly drones for real-time surveillance of assets and transmission lines, theft prevention, visual inspection/maintenance, construction planning and management, etc. Drone operations suggested for the Environment, Forests and Climate Change Ministry include anti-poaching actions, monitoring of forests and wildlife, pollution assessment, and evidence gathering. High-quality videography As a complete replacement to expensive helicopter-based videography, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting could use drones for high-quality videography of events and difficult-to-reach-places at a fraction of the cost and approvals required. This move would also facilitate low altitude shooting without noise, and prevent dust pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/use-drones-more-effectively-civil-aviation-ministry/article38162071.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:46 IST,||WHO yet to authorise use of Covaxin among adolescents||On December 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that adolescents aged 15-17 will be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine beginning January 3. Two days after the announcement, the Health Ministry issued guidelines for the vaccination programme for teenagers. While clearly stating that teenagers aged 15 or older will be able to register on Co-WIN, the Ministry emphasised that only Covaxin will be administered to this age group. Indian authorities granted Covaxin an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for use in children aged 12 and above on the same day the Prime Minister made the announcement. However, the Ministry guidelines wrongly state that Covaxin is the “only vaccine with WHO’s emergency use listing (EUL) for the age-group 15-18”. On November 3, 2021, the WHO issued an emergency use listing (EUL) for Covaxin for use in adults. The press release of November 3 says that WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which formulates vaccine specific policies and recommendations, had on October 5 reviewed Covaxin and “recommended” the vaccine in “all age groups 18 and above”. On November 3, WHO also took to Twitter to broadcast its decision to include Covaxin in the emergency use listing of COVID-19 vaccines. In a series of tweets, the WHO reiterated that the expert group had reviewed and recommended the “use of Covaxin in two doses, with a dose interval of four weeks, in all age groups 18 and above”. A WHO statement issued on November 24 last year once again stressed that Covaxin had not received emergency use listing for use in children. It stated that though Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech had been approved in India for children of 12-17 years, the vaccine had “not yet received WHO EUL for this age indication”. Age-specific data For Covaxin to be approved for children above 12 years to be granted an emergency use listing, Bharat Biotech has to submit manufacturing quality data, clinical and non-clinical data of the vaccine in children above 12 years and labelling details. Bharat Biotech began the process of seeking WHO’s EUL for Covaxin for use in adults when it submitted its application on July 9, 2021. Bharat Biotech was repeatedly asked by the WHO to clarify and submit additional data. The vaccine was approved for EUL four months after the application was submitted. Bharat Biotech Chairman and MD Krishna Ella had said “negative publicity” — particularly by the media — led to delay in getting the EUL. But Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was categorical on the reasons for the delay. “Let’s be very clear, the timeline for Emergency Use Listing a vaccine depends 99% on manufacturers — the speed, the completeness with which they can get data to the independent groups that assesses for WHO. We just want to be very, very clear on that point,” he had said. The WHO’s emergency use listing is a prerequisite for vaccine supply through the COVAX facility; the EUL also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines. The WHO’s emergency use listing procedure is a risk-based procedure for assessing and listing unlicensed vaccines and drugs to expedite the availability of these products to people affected by a public health emergency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/who-yet-to-authorise-use-of-covaxin-among-adolescents/article38162098.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:31 IST,||Greater spread can lead to more mutations: doctors||Agreeing with the revised shorter home isolation period of seven days for mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases announced by the Health Ministry recently, doctors note that going by new data it has been found that the most infectious period is two or three days before the first symptom and two or three days after. “This is good enough time to contain the spread, as even the RT-PCR reports show that most people become negative by Day 7,” said Mrinal Sircar, director of pulmonology and critical care, Fortis Hospital, Noida. However, he cautioned that COVID-19, even if it is from the less lethal Omicron variant, should still be taken seriously as more spread means potentially more mutations of the virus. No repeat tests needed Doctors said that patients often demand repeated COVID-19 tests because of the fear that they are not clear of the infection. Dr. Kapil Gupta, consultant, emergency medicine, HCMCT Manipal Hospital, said, “The pathology is only for ten days as most of the symptoms subside by then. So, the new guidelines are for seven days of home isolation and the last three days should be without fever. Government has advised against unnecessary testing once you have been cleared of the virus. We faced a problem of people coming for re-testing during the first two waves. To use our resources optimally, we need to avoid this,” he said. The United States’ CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines has recommended five days of home isolation for mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Thereafter, patients have been told to self-monitor for the next five days, but they can step out with masks and adhering strictly to COVID-appropriate behaviour, said Gurmeet Singh Chabbra, director of pulmonology, QRG Super Speciality Hospital, Faridabad. So far, most patients who have contracted the Omicron variant have only had mild symptoms. “Still, we have to take this seriously as increased transmissibility of Omicron, which is about three to four times that of the Delta variant, will result in a large number of patients. It is causing reinfection in those who had got it in the past and breakthrough infection in those already vaccinated. Though hospital admission due to Omicron is 50% to 60% less compared to Delta, a large number of cases will result in overburdening of the health care system,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/greater-spread-can-lead-to-more-mutations-doctors/article38162090.ece

According to an order issued by the Tourism Department, 1,034 kanals and six marlas of land in Gulmarg and 354 kanals in Sonamarg have been notified as strategic areas by the authorities, while exercising powers under the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act.  It said the Corps Commander must ensure strict adherence to the environment laws. “The Corps Commander shall ensure that no other applicable law in force in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is observed in breach,” said the order. This is for the first time since the Control of Building Operations Act, 1988, and the J&K Development Act, 1970 were amended in 2020 that the government has issued such a notification. As per the amendments, the government can notify “strategic areas” for use by the armed forces and regulating construction through a “special dispensation”. The government said a special mechanism needed to be put in place for such strategic infrastructure needs. The government noted that the notified “strategic areas” were within the existing armed forces land.  Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti tweeted, “Allocating thousands of kanals to armed forces, that too in tourist areas, confirms GOI’s intention to convert J&K into a military garrison. Under the ‘state land’ pretext, our land is up for grabs and, to add insult to injury, locals are being evicted from their homes.”  CPI(M) leader M.Y. Tarigami asked the government “to review its decision”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/land-in-gulmarg-sonamarg-notified-as-strategic-areas/article38162328.ece

For the upcoming Assembly elections, the enhanced amount of Rs. 40 lakh would apply in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab and Rs. 28 lakh in Goa and Manipur, according to the Law Ministry’s notification on Thursday. Apart from a 10% increase in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the last major revision in spending limits for candidates was carried out in 2014. The EC had formed a committee in 2020 to study the spending limit. “The committee invited suggestions from political parties, chief electoral officers and election observers. The committee found that there has been increase in number of electors and Cost Inflation Index since 2014 substantially. It also factored in the changing modes of campaigning, which is gradually shifting to virtual campaign,” the EC statement said. The committee recommended enhancing the limit after taking into account the “demand from political parties” and the “increase in electors” from 834 million in 2014 to 936 million in 2021, as well as the increase in the Cost Inflation Index by 32.08% from 2014 to 2021-22, the EC said. “The Commission has accepted the recommendations of the committee and has decided to enhance the existing election expenditure limit for candidates,” the EC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/expenditure-limit-for-ls-assembly-candidates-hiked/article38162334.ece

(HAL) for Stage 2 training of Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots, has successfully demonstrated the capability to carry out six turn spins, displaying an important requirement for the platform. The aircraft will require another two years of testing after which it will be ready for induction, R. Madhavan, Chief Managing Director, HAL, said. “The IJT needs another two years of testing. There were some major modifications done in the aircraft. So all the earlier tests have to be repeated and demonstrated in the new configuration,” Mr. Madhavan said. “If the requirement [from the IAF] comes within that time, we can roll out immediately,” he stated. With this, the HAL would have the entire range of trainer aircraft — HTT-40 Basic Trainer Aircraft (BTA), the IJT, Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT) and the Lead-in Fighter Trainer (LIFT) being conceptualised based on the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas twin seat trainer aircraft, Mr. Madhavan noted. The IJT, meant to replace the ageing Kirans of the IAF fleet, had earlier completed demonstration of capabilities in terms of altitude and speed envelope, load factor, satisfactory stall characteristics and limited armament capability as required by the IAF. However, the programme came to a halt in 2016 and flight testing resumed in April 2019. Major modifications Major modifications were undertaken such as shifting the vertical tail aft on the airframe and increasing the rudder area. Stating that spin flight testing is inherently a high risk manoeuvre and therefore progresses incrementally turn by turn, the HAL said due to the complex interplay of aerodynamic and inertia forces, the motion of the aircraft in spin was unpredictable and flight testing was the only way to assess the acceptability or otherwise of its characteristics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hal-jet-trainer-demonstrates-its-prowess/article38162336.ece

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:44 IST,||Government panel to probe security lapse||Mr. Channi asked forces inimical to Punjab to stop defaming the State. “The anti-Punjab forces should shun vendetta politics and ponder over why the people especially farmers don’t like them,” he stressed. The Ministry of Home Affairs said in a tweet that it had constituted a committee to enquire into the serious lapses in the security arrangements during the Prime Minister's visit to Ferozepur on January 5 “which led to the exposure of the VVIP to grave security risk”. The three-member committee will be led by Sudhir Kumar Saxena, Secretary (Security), Cabinet Secretariat with other members being-Balbir Singh, Joint Director, Intelligence Bureau and S. Suresh, Inspector General, Special Protection Group. “The committee is advised to submit the report at the earliest,” MHA said. A statement by Punjab government said, “In order to carry out a thorough probe into the lapses that occurred during Prime Minister’s visit to Ferozepur yesterday, the Punjab government has constituted a high-level committee”. The committee, comprising Justice Mehtab Singh Gill (retd.) and Principal Secretary, Home Affairs and Justice AnuragVerma, would submit its report within three days. Pointing the finger at Mr. Channi for the security lapse, the BJP dismissed the State government’s probe committee. Terming it a mere ‘eyewash’, its State president Ashwani Sharma said the Chief Minister was behind the whole conspiracy and, therefore, the committee would not be able to find the truth behind the incident. The BJP had urged Governor Banwarilal Purohit to suspend State’s Home Minister and the Director General of Police. Mr. Sharma alleged that necessary protocols were not followed to receive the Prime Minister. “Also, who leaked the Prime Minister’s route is something that is a matter of probe,” he observed after a delegation of BJP leaders met the Governor on the issue. “It was a murder of democracy as hurdles were created and all roads leading to Ferozepurwere barricaded so that buses ferrying people from the State all over were stranded and the police acted in cahoots with the State government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/government-panel-to-probe-security-lapse/article38162065.ece

According to the police, two militants, Suhail Qadir Khanday from Pulwama’s Tral and Suhail Mushtaq from Pulwama’s Niklora of The Resistance Force and the Mujahideen Gazwatul Hind (MGH), both off-shoots of the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Muhammad, were held recently near Barzulla Bridge in Srinagar. “They further identified two associates, Basit Bilal Makaya from Qamar Abad, Qamarwari, Srinagar, and Naikoo Imad Nasar from Shopian’s Kiloora as Over Ground Workers. They were arrested too,” the police said. They said that during questioning, the arrested militants said they were operating in Srinagar city on the directions of Dr. Asif Maqbool Dar of MIG Colony Bemina, at present living in Dhamam, Saudi Arabia, and Sajjad Gul of HMT Parimpora, at present in Pakistan. “Both the handlers Dr. Asif and Gul were providing these militants and OGWs weapons and money through a network of OGWs,” the police said. “As per the investigation, the targets in city for killings were also selected and conveyed to them by Dr. Asif and Gul,” the police said.

They have done their best to justify the Rs. 8 lakh limit.” Justice Chandrachud, however, moments before rising for the day, said it was in national interest that NEET counselling should continue. “In national interest, counselling has to begin,” he stated. The court shared the concern raised by lawyers that the country needed specialist doctors to combat the prolonged public health crisis posed by the pandemic. The court has listed the case for pronouncement of orders at 10.30 a.m. on January 7. In his arguments for the Centre, Mr. Mehta asked whether anybody with “common sense” would think Rs. 8 lakh was an “irrational” income limit for determining EWS. He said EWS had “stricter criterion” and considered the gross annual income of the family and not just that of the individual seeking reservation benefits. He referred to the Pandey committee report, which said the Rs. 8 lakh criterion struck a “fine balance” between over-inclusion and inclusion errors. The report has said, “The figure ensures that most low-income people who are not required to pay income tax are not excluded and are covered in EWS and at the same time it should not be so high that it becomes over-inclusive by including many incomes tax-paying middle- and high-income families into EWS”. Mr. Mehta said the constitutional term “economically weaker” did not mean those below the poverty line, but people in the low-income groups, who may have small savings, but not enough to reap the benefits of a good higher education in the best universities like others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-says-rs-8-lakh-ews-cap-derived-after-study/article38162072.ece

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:45 IST,||Congress leaders’ voices differ over Punjab fiasco||Leaders of the Congress on Thursday spoke in different voices on the breach in the security of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's convoy during his visit to Punjab on Wednesday. At an official press conference, the Congress maintained that there was no security breach, and accused the BJP of defaming Punjab and Panjabiyat. However, Lok Sabha member Manish Tewari, and Rajya Sabha member Abhishek Singhvi called for fixing accountability for the lapse. Mr. Tewari went a step further and asked for a probe by a sitting High Court judge. The comments from the MPs on social media came on a day when the party fielded Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge to speak to the media and defend the Punjab government. Citing instances when the Prime Minister’s motorcade was held up in Delhi, Noida and Lucknow, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told reporters that Mr. Modi never used the same words to ‘defame’ the Chief Ministers then as he did in the case of Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi. “You want to defame entire Punjab, its three crore people and Punjabiyat and Punjabi culture. Punjabi tradition is such that they will protect you with their own lives and every Punjabi has that courage,” Mr. Khera said. On September 22, 2017, when the Prime Minister was visiting his Varanasi constituency, some girls of Banaras Hindu University were protesting against harassment, at the Lanka Gate area, and police failed to remove them, the Congress spokesperson said. “Did you hear the Prime Minister utter these words, which he uttered yesterday for Punjab, in Punjab? ‘Thank You Mr. Chief Minister, Main Zinda Laut Aya [I am returning alive].’ You didn't hear this against [Uttar Pradesh CM] Adityanath. Why didn’t he use these words in U.P.,” asked Mr. Khera.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-leaders-speak-in-different-voices-on-breach/article38162080.ece

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:45 IST,||The jiva’s swaroopa||Sastras say that the relationship of the jiva with God is eternal and unbroken. Visishtadvaita philosophy explains the nature of the association between the ‘jiva tatva’ and ‘Ishwara Tatva’ as that which exists between the body and the atma. This perspective known as ‘sarira-sariri bhava’ or ‘sarira-atma bhava’ is unique to this school of thought, pointed out Asuri Sri Madhavachariar in a discourse. The import is that the entire creation comprising the sentient, chetana and the insentient, the achetana, form the body of the Lord who is the ‘sarva antaratma’, the antaryami or indweller in each and every aspect of creation. Just as the atma is the support of the jiva’s body mind intellect complex, the Paramatma is the sole support of all creation, the sole Master who commands everything and everyone in this universe. Whether the jiva accepts it or not, he belongs to God alone and is by nature bound to Him. He is always subservient and answerable to Him and this is explained as the Sesha Seshi bhava. The jiva, through several births in the past, had thought himself to be independent and his own master. Only when, by the grace of Lord and of the preceptor and his own past good samskaras, he is taught about this relationship that the jiva has the chance to shed this ignorance and appreciate his privileged role as Sesha to none other than the Almighty, the Sarva Seshi. In our daily life the jiva plays different roles in different contexts, as son, father, employee, employer, teacher, student, husband, wife, etc. These roles are owing to individual karma and can change with time or circumstance. But just as a conch is always white, the jiva is never without this quality of ‘seshatva’ with respect to the Lord.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-jivas-swaroopa/article38162083.ece

But the BJP, his alliance partner, has not been supporting him. Whoever is not supporting his [the CM’s] policies should be discarded but this is the CM’s prerogative,” RJD State president Jagadanand Singh told mediapersons at the party’s headquarters in Patna. Reacting to it, the BJP took a swipe at the RJD saying the party wanted to “come to power through the back door”. “But this isn’t going to happen since Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is a mature politician,” said BJP leader and party State spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel. The JD(U) and RJD had formed the government together in November 2015 before Mr. Kumar dumped his ally and joined hands again with the BJP in July 2017. ‘Won’t be forgiven’ Mr. Singh said party leader Tejashwi Yadav has instructed that the RJD support the Chief Minister on issues that are in Bihar’s interest. “If you [Mr. Kumar] backtrack on these two issues under the BJP’s influence, the people of the State will not forgive you,” he said. Recently, Mr. Kumar had said that he was still waiting for his alliance partner BJP’s response on conducting a caste-based census in the State as all other parties had extended their support on the issue. “Once we get the BJP’s response, we will hold an all-party meeting to decide the modalities for conducting a caste-based census in the State on our own,” he had said. Earlier, leaders of 10 political parties, including the BJP, had met and requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to conduct a caste-based census in the country. BJP leaders, however, later said it would not be possible since it could create a social rift. The Bihar legislature has twice passed resolutions to hold a caste-based census in the State. ‘No harm in support’ The JD(U) saw nothing wrong in the RJD extending support, with party MP Sunil Kumar Pintu saying “these issues have been our party’s demand for a long time”.

No one found involved in the incident, will be spared,” Simdega Superintendent of Police Shams Tabrej said. Murder, rioting The 13 named and 25 unknown accused persons have been booked for murder, rioting with deadly weapons and unlawful assembly, said the SP.

The victim Sanju Pradhan, 32, was lynched barely 100 metres away from his home near Besrabazar under Kolebira police station of Simdega district on January 4, by a mob of over 100 people allegedly for illegally felling trees for stealing and smuggling wood. “Four people had come to my residence and taken away my husband to Besrabazar and after beating him up, they set him on fire. Is this the punishment for illegally felling trees,” asked a distraught Sapna Devi, Pradhan’s wife. “They killed my husband in presence of some policemen,” Ms. Devi alleged.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 04:03 IST,TAMIL NADU||Plea in HC to vacate injunction on blacklisting contractor||The Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board (TNUHDB) has urged the Madras High Court to vacate an interim injunction granted by it on December 2 against the blacklisting of P.S.T. Engineering Construction, a contractor accused of poor quality construction of tenements at Kesava Pillai Park at Pulianthope, Chennai. In a counter-affidavit filed before Justice N. Anand Venkatesh in response to the contractor’s civil suit, TNUHDB said the contract was signed in December 2017 for 864 tenements in a stilt-plus-nine floor design, consisting of various blocks, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (housing for all scheme). However, after allotment of the tenements to the beneficiaries, it was noticed that the cement plastering on the walls was peeling, and the construction was not up to the mark. Immediately, TNUHDB suspended from service an assistant engineer and an assistant executive engineer who were supposed to ensure quality. In the counter-affidavit filed through Special Government Pleader Edwin Prabakaran, TNUHDB said it had also requested the Centre for Urbanisation, Buildings and Environment (CUBE) of Indian Institute of Technology-Madras to conduct a study. After a scientific examination through spot studies and collection of materials, CUBE filed a report confirming the poor quality of construction and unacceptable workmanship in plastering. Therefore, TNUHDB issued a show-cause notice to the contractor on October 8, 2021, seeking an explanation as to why the company should not be blacklisted. The contract provides for arbitration, yet the contractor had chosen not to invoke that clause and instead approached the High Court under its commercial division. Though the contractor had claimed to have been awarded a bonus of Rs. 90.19 lakh in August 2019 for having completed the project in advance, that could not be taken as a credit in view of the fact that the buildings were subsequently found to have defects, TNUHDB said. It also denied the contractor’s allegation that the Greater Chennai Corporation had utilised the tenements as a “hospital” before allotting them to the beneficiaries and that Corporation employees had caused a great damage to the buildings by installing iron grills on the parapet walls and then removing them. TNUHDB contended that the buildings, after construction, were taken over by the Corporation under the Disaster Management Act and were used as a COVID-19 care centre, and not as a hospital as claimed by the contractor, and that only minor modifications were made which could not have had any effect on the structure. After taking the counter-affidavit on file, the judge adjourned the case to January 11 for receiving the contractor’s rejoinder and extended the interim injunction till then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-in-hc-to-vacate-injunction-on-blacklisting-contractor/article38162454.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 04:05 IST,TAMIL NADU||Unprecedented rain flags need for better weather models||The northeast monsoon of 2021, which is yet to withdraw, has brought abundant rain to the city. While spells of heavy rain are common during the monsoon, two spells of intense and unprecedented rain in a short span in November and December caught the city and meteorologists off guard. This monsoon brought copious rain to Chennai without any major weather system. The 148.5 cm rain received between October and December led to a surplus this season. This monsoon broke records and Chennai’s annual rainfall in 2021 was one of the highest — 226 cm as against the normal of 140 cm, surpassing the 2015 record of 209.5 cm. December was almost dry in the city, until the unprecedented rain of over 20 cm lashed many places. Though the city was given a forecast of moderate rain, the intense rain between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. could not be predicted by nearly all global weather models. While the northeast monsoon is usually volatile, meteorologists noted that a long-range forecast of intense rainfall in a short span, arising out of mesoscale phenomenon, needs scientific advances. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the India Meteorological Department had a mechanism to provide forecasts for a short or extended period and used data from a combination of observation networks, including radars and satellites. “We cannot depend on a single observation network. It is not like we missed forecasting the event. We do not have the scientific advancement to forecast mesoscale phenomenon that occurs in smaller areas within a few hours,” he said. Though the IMD issued forecasts for a short or extended period, events like the one that had occurred last week were not captured by the weather models. The IMD had also issued a now-casting forecast of heavy rain on December 30 for the next few hours when the event began, he said. While climate change cannot be ignored, the extremely heavy rain in the city cannot be correlated to the impact of climate change. Factors such as urbanisation and pollution should also be studied for the changes in the local weather pattern, meteorologists said. Senior meteorologist Y.E.A. Raj argued that spells of heavy rain in the city was not uncommon. Cyclones and depressions were not a must for a good monsoon, and 2021 was a classic example. There was scope to improve weather observation infrastructure. “But it is impossible to achieve 100% accuracy in all weather predictions.” Meteorologists and weather bloggers pointed to an increase in the occurrence of the high intensity rainfall of over 20 cm at many places within three to six hours. Weather blogger K. Srikanth said that besides Chennai, Nagapattinam, Karaikal and Thoothukudi experienced intense rain in November. Dynamic high-resolution weather models might have to be created — based on the past experience and by prioritising the phenomenon like western disturbances— to detect such events. Tools like the single-layer canopy urban model that could detect the impact of urban heat island could also be incorporated. Meteorologists underscored the need for a denser network, including more radars, to improve forecasts. But there were financial implications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/unprecedented-rain-flags-need-for-better-weather-models/article38162461.ece

The State Government accorded an administrative sanction of Rs. 46 crore recently, for the facility that will help those driving from Sardar Patel Road to Rajiv Gandhi Salai avoid waiting at the signal. “At least 60% of the traffic in that direction turn towards Rajiv Gandhi Salai, which is why it was designed as a unidirectional flyover. It will take off at a point, 300 metres from the existing IIT flyover, and land on OMR,” a source in the Highways department explained. Asked if it would be possible to connect the proposed flyover to the existing one, the official said it would not suit the traffic pattern in the area. “Vehicles proceeding from Kotturpuram would not be able to use the new flyover in such a scenario,” he said. The 640-metre flyover will take 18 months to be constructed and will require land for the formation of service lanes on either sides. Land, measuring up to a width of five metres, would be required for the lanes. Any trees on the way would be transplanted. The facility, with 18 spans, will be a simple L-shaped one and traffic will be diverted during the construction. R. Krishna a resident of Thoraipakkam, who welcomed the flyover, said even though it would be difficult for travellers during the construction period, it would help reduce waiting time at the signal later. “Two more flyovers are coming up on OMR. We need flyovers at Thoraipakkam and Sholinganallur junctions too, where the traffic volume is quite heavy. The DMK government had announced that five new flyovers would be constructed on OMR. Hopefully those would come up soon,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tenders-to-be-called-soon-for-flyover-at-madhya-kailash/article38162467.ece

Sumathi on Thursday said “external forces” were responsible for the problems faced by the copper smelter at Thoothukudi, which led to a mass protest and the police firing in which 13 persons were killed. This led to the closure of the plant in May 2018. “They were opposing the plant’s expansion,” said Ms. Sumathi, who has been with the company for 25 years. At that point, the company was planning to ramp up its capacity from 4 lakh tonnes to 8 lakh tonnes, and the stock exchanges were informed of the plan. As soon as the news went out, “these external forces were meeting the local people and NGOs” from February 2018, she said. Asked who these “external forces” were, she said that because the matter was in court, it would not be appropriate for her to divulge the details. Asked about pollution and other issues, Ms. Sumathi said there were issues before 2013, but nothing came up after 2013. “The technology used were the best and the plant followed international standards.” She said the local people wanted the plant re-opened as the economy in that area had shrunk after it was closed. “Closing down is not the solution. We are open to dialogues, which will help us improve operations. Constructive dialogue is the way-out,” she said. According to her, the main concern at Thoothukudi was not sulphur dioxide; it was the dust levels. She said this emerged from a study conducted by the Centre for Climate Change and Adaption Research, Anna University. The study, she said, pointed out that PM10 mainly came from the mineral dust containing silica, owing to the resuspension of road dust. Since closure, the plant at Thoothukudi had been incurring a loss of Rs. 5 crore a day. A lot of water had entered the plant during the recent rain. A sum of Rs. 800 crore-Rs. 1,000 crore would be required to revamp the plant, if and when the permission came, Ms. Sumathi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/external-forces-behind-plants-woes-sterlite/article38162499.ece

As part of the drive against narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ordered by Director-General of Police C. Sylendra Babu, the Narcotics Intelligence Bureau-CID organised a competition among the police of all districts to produce short films to educate the people on the ill-effects of drug abuse and motivate them to share any input that could help to avert the storage, distribution and consumption of drugs. Kancheepuram tops According to police sources, the first place was bagged by the Kancheepuram district police that produced a five-minute film by roping in actor ‘Jayam’ Ravi. The concept, conceived by Superintendent of Police M. Sudhakar, was titled ‘Mounathai Kalaipom’ (‘Lets break the silence’). The film dealt with how youths addicted to drug could indulge in crimes against innocent persons and why people should not be mute spectators to the menace. “We appealed to the people to break the silence and pass on information to the police. Unless members of the public participate in the fight against drug abuse, it will not be possible to achieve the result,” Mr. Sudhakar said. Second, third places Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, ADGP, Narcotics Intelligence Bureau-CID, said Ariyalur and Theni districts took the second and third places. During the campaign, the contact number, ‘10581’, and the WhatsApp number, ‘9498410581’, were being shared with people to reach out to law-enforcement agencies. The details of informers would be kept strictly confidential.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-make-short-films-to-prevent-drug-abuse/article38162492.ece

They were among the 196 students tested on Wednesday. “The results of 262 students are awaited. We have not permitted them to leave the campus for the fear that they could spread the infection. Though we have been told to shut the hostel, they would not be allowed to leave until the test results are out,” said MIT Dean T. Thyagarajan. As on date, around 1,300 students had vacated the campus, he added. Of the 41 boys who are under isolation in hostel, 39 received both doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Three students, below the age of 18, have not been vaccinated, he said. Health minister Ma. Subramanian, Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi and Chengalpattu Collector A.R. Rahul Nadh visited the campus. He told mediapersons that the premises had been disinfected and the treatment of students, placed under isolation in the hostels, is apace. Mr. Ponmudi said, of the 1,659 students in hostel, 81 had been infected, 40 left for home and 41 were in hostel. Excluding the three first-year students, aged below 18, 39 others had been fully vaccinated. The students are in separate rooms in the hostel, he added. Those who have been sent home were asymptomatic. Among the infected, 66 students had shown S gene drop, indicating that they had been infected with the Omicron variant of the virus. Study holidays The minister said all colleges have been instructed to provide study holidays to students. With regard to a complaint that a self-financing women’s college in Kodambakkam had conducted exams, Mr. Ponmudi said there was delay in communicating the State’s decision to close down campuses. The exam schedule would be revised if there is a need, he added. Mr. Subramanian said those who have been infected with the Omicron variant could be isolated and treated at home itself, especially those who have received two jabs been with two doses. “There is no need for all infected persons to come to hospitals. In Chennai, the number of cases are bound to increase, but there is no need to panic,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/13-more-students-in-mit-test-positive-for-covid-19/article38162457.ece

Addressing a seminar organised by the Federation of Indian Granite and Stone Industry (FIGSI), he said decisions to streamline the industry would be taken after discussions with its representatives after Pongal. The seminar on ‘Natural Stone’ was organised along with the Indian Monument Manufacturers’ Association and the Tamil Nadu Granite Quarry Owners and Exporters Association (TNGQOEA). Pointing out that several people have lost their livelihoods, particularly in the Madurai belt, Thangam Thennarasu, Industries Minister, said the government would take measures to regulate the industry. N. Ashoken, vice-president, FIGSI, said Tamil Nadu contributed nearly 80% of the granite monument production and export. Nearly Rs. 1,200 crore worth of monuments were produced and exported from the country every year. It was a labor intensive industry with nearly 15,000 workers engaged in the State. The building slabs industry, particularly concentrated in the Krishnagiri and Hosur belt, also employed about 5,000 workers. As there was more demand for Indian exports due to slowdown of Chinese exports, the State Government must help boost manufacturing and exports, he said. R. Veeramani, founder-president of FIGSI, said the Government should review the situation and simplify the procedures to obtain quarry licences and renewals to enable the growth of the stone industry, which was a rural-oriented and labour intensive sector. The Government must formulate a conducive policy for the development of the sector. More granite quarries must be opened, he demanded. FIGSI president Ishwinder Singh said as there was a shortage of raw materials like rough granite blocks, materials were being transported from other States. N. Mahesh, president, TNGQOEA, said only 20% of the 900 quarries were operating in the State and several applications for licenses or renewals were pending. Moreover, only 10% of the granite stones or raw materials were available in the State, and the remaining were procured from other States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-will-consider-demands-of-granite-industry-minister/article38162497.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:34 IST,TAMIL NADU||MLAs to meet on Saturday to discuss NEET Bill||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Thursday called a meeting of the MLAs of all parties for January 8 to chalk out the next course of action on the Bill adopted in the Assembly to exempt Tamil Nadu from NEET. In a suo motu statement in the Assembly, Mr. Stalin said Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s refusal to meet the MPs of all parties from Tamil Nadu to discuss the Bill went against the ideals of democracy. “The government’s efforts are aimed at fulfilling the aspirations of eight crore people of Tamil Nadu and helping students realise their dream. As Mr. Shah has not given an appointment to the Tamil Nadu delegation, the request has been submitted at his office,” he said. Mr. Stalin said Tamil Nadu was a model for other States in upholding social justice, and the history of Tamil Nadu and the Dravidian movement underscored the fact that success was the result of prolonged struggles of people. “The State achieved the development only through these struggles. The fight against NEET is the next phase of the struggle for social justice, and we will not go back even an inch from our commitment.” ‘Rights snatched away’ Alleging that the Centre had snatched the rights of the State governments that had launched medical colleges, Mr. Stalin said NEET had rendered 12 years of school education useless and the school system irrelevant. “Moreover, NEET is in favour of students who have the opportunity to get special coaching. It has not only shattered the students’ dreams but also violated the federal principles...” Mr. Stalin said the Assembly adopted a Bill to exempt the State from NEET on September 19 and sent it to the Governor. But it had not been forwarded to the President. “When I met the Governor, I took up the issue with him.” The Chief Minister said the MLAs should take part at the meeting scheduled for January 8 since they had supported the Bill in the Assembly. “The fight for social justice will be based on the decision to be taken at the meeting.” AIADMK MLA and Former Minister R. Vaithilingam on Thursday wondered whether Tamil Nadu could succeed in its efforts to get the State exempted from NEET. “While we stand by the State government in its efforts, we do not know whether we could succeed. Our leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami tried to get exemption for the State. Yet he could not do so. Instead of wasting the time and future of students, we could organise training for students to clear the examination,” he said during the debate to thank the Governor for his address to the Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mlas-to-meet-on-saturday-to-discuss-neet-bill/article38162482.ece

Ashok Rao had developed multiple blood vessel blocks in his heart. When he consulted cardiologists at MGM Healthcare, he was advised a bypass surgery. While he was being evaluated for the surgery, he was diagnosed with a pre-existing end stage liver disease. The mortality rate is high for a major open-heart surgery in a person with severe liver failure. A multidisciplinary team, including Thiagarajan Srinivasan, director of the Institute of Liver Transplant and Hepatobiliary Surgery, Kailash A. Jain, clinical lead of cardiothoracic surgery, besides cardiac anaesthetists and intensivists, performed the surgery that lasted nearly 20 hours. There were multiple challenges such as massive blood loss and a high risk of heart attack and arrhythmias, during and after the surgery, the doctors said Surgical plan The team held several rounds of meetings and a virtual combined surgical plan was rehearsed before the actual surgery, according to them. Now six months after the surgery the patient is doing well, they said. Kailash A. Jain, senior consultant and clinical lead of cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac surgery, told reporters here on Thursday that the patient’s medical evaluation showed triple vessel coronary artery disease and a decompensated liver disease for which a coronary artery by-pass and liver transplant was suggested. “Doing both the surgeries in the same sitting was decided in discussion with the multi-disciplinary team, as doing one surgery alone increases the risk and worsening of function of the other organ,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-undergoes-liver-transplant-coronary-bypass-surgery/article38162452.ece

Nagar witnessing waterlogging during the recent heavy rain, Municipal Administration Minister K.N. Nehru said in the Assembly on Thursday. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said that a probe would be initiated into the implementation of Smart City scheme in T. Nagar. During a debate on the motion of thanks to the Governor's address to the House, Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami raised the issue and referred to the heavy waterlogging in various parts of the city, especially T. Nagar. He said that the DMK government did not take up desilting work when it had five months after assuming office in May. Mr. Stalin pointed out that waterlogging was generally reported in T. Nagar even when other parts of the city had water stagnating after rain. “During the erstwhile DMK governments, we have desilted the Mambalam Canal and it was set right but the Smart City scheme was not implemented properly by the AIADMK government”, the CM said. Mr. Palaniswami pointed out that only 3-km of the 5.3-km stretch of the Mambalam Canal was under the Smart City scheme and went on to list the works undertaken during the AIADMK regime. Mr. Nehru intervened to contend that the primary reason for waterlogging in T. Nagar was because of the debris that was dumped in the Mambalam Canal. “Your officers [under the AIADMK government] had told us,” he said. The AIADMK leader said that the officers under the DMK government should have visited the site. He demanded higher compensation for farmers affected by the recent rain. Instead of waiting for the Central government to sanction funds, the State government should use the State Disaster Response Fund, he added. Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said funds under the SDRF have been spent and after getting the Assembly nod, compensation would be granted to farmers. Revenue Minister K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran said that Rs. 96.92 crore was sanctioned on January 4 to provide input subsidy relief assistance to farmers, whose agricultural and horticultural crops were damaged in the recent rain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/parties-blame-each-other-for-waterlogging/article38162458.ece
07 January 2022||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||WRD chalks out plans to bridge missing links in waterways||Every monsoon, areas around Pallikaranai marshland are prone to flooding as many inadequacies in surplus courses and water channels await a solution. In a bid to bring respite in the next few years, the Water Resources Department has chalked out detailed projects to connect missing links. While some of the proposals are awaiting funding, the department is also engaged in feasibility study for a few other projects. Surplus water from various groups of tanks in the upstream drain into the marshland through different routes. However, most of the surplus water spills over to the neighbourhood of Perumbakkam and Semmencheri as there is no defined route after DLF due to urbanisation. Residents noted that some of the areas like Tsunami Nagar, Perumbakkam and Karanai were waterlogged during heavy rain last month. However, flooding was not as severe as it was in 2015 as WRD had taken up works to alleviate waterlogging, said Satish Galley, a resident of Semmencheri.  The surplus from Madurapakkam Odai, Ottiyambakkam Odai and Navalur group of tanks confluence at a point near the swamp. However, the place has been converted into a residential zone, creating missing links in draining water, officials of the WRD said. “It now takes five or six days for the waterlogging to reduce. We’re planning to connect the surplus water to the swamp through open drains or concrete channels,” he said . There are plans to divert surplus water from Ottiyambakkam group of tanks through a two km channel to Arasankazhani Velanthangal tank before it reaches the point near DLF. Another channel would be created to carry the excess water to the swamp from the Arasankazhani Velanthangal tank. The project submitted through Commissionerate of Revenue Administration and Disaster Management is awaiting the government’s nod. Similarly, there is a missing link in Madurapakkam Odai that drains into the swamp near DLF. “We are planning to provide three small channels of a total distance of 1,500 metres to carry water from upstream of the problematic spot near DLF and link it to the Odai downstream of DLF,” said an official. The department is also studying the feasibility of diverting the surplus of Agaramthen group of tanks to Perumbakkam tank and then linking it to the marshland. “We are planning to connect the missing links in the open drain near SIPCOT in Siruseri and link it to Kazhipattur Maduvu. Surplus water then would be carried to the Buckingham Canal near Muttukadu,” the official added. Measures would be taken to improve infrastructure to channelise the floodwater within a year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wrd-chalks-out-plans-to-bridge-missing-links-in-waterways/article38162464.ece

Municipal Administration Minister K.N. Nehru introduced the bills for creation of Municipal Corporations for Cuddalore, Kancheepuram, Sivakasi, Karur, Tambaram and Kumbakonam. He said considering the rapid pace of urbanisation in the State, it was imperative to reorganise the urban local bodies. Mr. Nehru said as per the 2011 Census, 48.5% of people in the State lived in urban areas. “Over 53% of the people in the State live in urban areas now. It has, therefore, become essential to merge areas with urban characteristics with the respective local bodies to create the necessary infrastructure,” he added. Curbing online gambling Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Thursday told the Assembly that the Government would soon put an end to online gambling. Responding to AIADMK member R. Vaithilingam, who cited media reports about a bank employee who killed himself and his family after losing money in online gambling, the Chief Minister said though the AIADMK government enacted the Tamil Nadu Gaming and Police Laws (Amendment)Act, 2021, it was quashed by the Madras High Court. “The Government has approached the Supreme Court against the High Court order after consulting legal experts. The hearing is going on. We will soon put an end to online gambling,” Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bills-to-create-new-local-bodies-introduced-in-assembly/article38162471.ece

In his view, the “silence” of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on the issue would be taken “as his tacit support of the sabotaging of the Prime Minister’s security.” He said former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda condemned the “security breach”. Protest meeting He participated in a meeting to protest the security breach, organised by the Tamil Nadu BJP youth wing. “The Congress government in Punjab deliberately planned to sabotage the Prime Minister’s security detail. Information was deliberately leaked to some protesters, and his convoy was deliberately made to be stuck on a flyover for more than 15 minutes close to the Pakistan border,” Mr. Surya claimed.

Therefore, God cannot be summoned by any court to be produced for mere inspection or verification as if it is yet a material object in a criminal case, the Madras High Court observed on Thursday. Justice R. Suresh Kumar made the observations while passing interim orders in a case filed against the move to move the main deity of the Paramasivan Swamy Temple at Siviyarpalayam in Kangeyam taluk of Tiruppur district for being produced in court.  A group of local residents had filed the writ petition and its counsel C.K. Chandrasekar told the court that the idol was stolen a few years ago. It was recovered by the police and reinstalled in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple as per the Agama principles.  However, recently, a special court dealing with idol theft cases ordered production of the idol for inspection in the case pending before it and the Executive Officer of the temple decided to oblige. The objections raised by the villagers fell on deaf ears, the counsel said.  Finding force in his submission, the judge ruled that if it was a processional deity, the Executive Officer would have been justified in producing the same before the special court after following the rules laid down in the Agamas .  “However, in the case of the main deity, if the same is installed once after performing pujas pursuant to Samprokshanam or Kumbabishekam at the sanctum sanctorum, then the deity cannot be removed instantly, even of course pursuant to the order passed by the court concerned,” he said. The judge said the special court could appoint an advocate commissioner and order him to examine the idol, in the presence of the Executive Officer as well as a few devotees, and submit a report to the court.  If the deity is installed once after performing pujas at the sanctum sanctorum, then the same cannot be removed instantly||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-says-main-deity-of-temple-need-not-be-produced-in-court/article38162501.ece

The night curfew imposed by the State Government came into effect from 10 p.m. on Thursday. There would be a complete lockdown on Sunday. Though the State government has said that those going to railway stations or airport can travel carrying their tickets, passengers are worried. Officials of Airports Authority of India said some passengers had contacted them asking if they would be able to reach the airport at night. “We have informed them that they will not be stopped and will have to just show their tickets. Those dropping the passengers and leaving the airport too can just produce the ticket copy. Those arriving at the airport can take the prepaid taxi services. Since we have already witnessed such lockdowns, commuters need not worry,” an official said. Jude Mathew, Tamil Nadu Independent Rental Vehicle Owners and Drivers Association, said last time many drivers faced issues while ferrying passengers. “When we go with passengers, they let us go. But while returning, the drivers faced problems. We request that police should let them go when they show the passengers’ ticket copy,” he said. Chennai Metro Rail’s last train leaves the terminal stations, like Wimco Nagar, Chennai airport and St. Thomas Mount at 9 p.m. and the services end at 10 p.m. A senior official of the Southern Railway said discussions were still on about operating suburban train services during the Sunday lockdown and night services. A senior official of the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) said except for essential staff of the government departments, no buses would be operated on Sunday. The MTC would also stop the 100 night services. Other buses would also not be operated after 9.30 p.m., the official added. A senior official of the State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) said since the lockdown has been announced only for this Sunday, the decision on operating buses on January 16 would be taken later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rising-concerns-over-reaching-transport-hubs-during-curfew/article38162443.ece

While the AIADMK contended that the common man would be affected, the DMK argued that these clinics did not have the necessary infrastructure. During a debate on the motion of thanks to the Governor for his address to the House, Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami referred to the decision. Health Minister Ma. Subramanian intervened and said that except for a table and a chair, infrastructure was not at all available at these clinics. When Mr. Palaniswami asked the Minister to take a survey of the clinics to check whether or not the infrastructure was available and the clinics were benefiting the poor, Minister for Public Works E.V. Velu said that even Kalaignar Health Insurance, which had benefited the poor, was not allowed to continue with the same name by the AIADMK government. “So, why are you getting angry?” “I am not angry,” Mr. Palaniswami responded, when Chief Minister M.K. Stalin intervened and said Mr. Velu’s statement should not be misconstrued. “But the infrastructure at the mini-clinics was not available...” Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments P.K.

Chellakrishnan from Omalur. Due to the pandemic, the shandy was closed for four-and-a-half months in 2021 and for six months in 2020. Farmers said that a third wave would have adverse effect on transactions in the coming weeks and they fear that the shandy would be closed if cases continued to increase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-curfew-affects-sales-at-cattle-shandy/article38162612.ece

All the shops, hotels, restaurants, commercial establishments, provisional stores, roadside eateries and street vendors were asked to close their business by 9.45 p.m. so that transactions are not carried out after 10 p.m. Since, the city roads are likely to witness unusual traffic from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., police personnel were deployed on arterial roads and at important junctions to regulate vehicle flow. Also, barricades have been erected on arterial roads and at the city’s entry points to prevent vehicle movement during the curfew. Since petrol outlets were allowed to function round-the-clock, workers have been advised to carry their identity cards and produce it when policemen demanded. Senior police officials said that on the first day of the night curfew, motorists and pedestrians, who were found on roads after 10 p.m. or venture out without an emergency or valid reason would be warned. Also, warnings would be issued to tea stalls and other establishments if they run their business after 10 p.m. Since industries were allowed to function, workers were asked to carry their identity cards while persons commuting on their own and rented vehicles to board trains and buses should produce valid tickets. Earlier in the day, the Corporation’s V.O.C. Park and the Children’s Park, were closed until further notice. .

Out of the 10 Traffic Police Stations and one Traffic Planning Unit, Madurai City Police have eight traffic police stations in the southern parts. As a result, the northern parts have only two Traffic Police Stations – Tallakulam with a Inspector and Mathichiyam with one Sub-Inspector. In the wake of increasing traffic movement in north Madurai, the lone Inspector was facing difficulties in regulating traffic in arterial roads of the vast areas under Tallakulam, Anna Nagar and Sellur police ranges. Hence, the Commissioner of Police has made the Inspector of Police (Traffic Planning Unit) to hold additional charge of regulating traffic in Mathichiyam and Anna Nagar police station limits. Similarly, the Reserve Inspector of Police (High Court Security) has been given additional charge of regulating traffic under Mattuthavani police station limits. The Inspector (Tallakulam Traffic) will hereafter take care of traffic regulations in K. Pudur, Tallakulam, Sellur, Koodal Pudur and Tiruppalai police station limits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-more-inspectors-to-regulate-traffic-in-north-madurai/article38162800.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:32 IST,TAMIL NADU||Postpone jallikattu till COVID-19 threat is over, say govt. doctors||Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association (TNGDA) that has already suggested COVID-19 precautionary measures to the State government has flagged the impending danger of conducting jallikattu in the wake of a possible third wave of COVID-19. Even as the State government has gone to the extent of imposing night curfews, total lockdown on Sundays and banning congregation of people in places of worship on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, the attempt by the district administration to go ahead with the jallikattu events has come in for flak. The officials are divided over the issue. “We have been trying hard to convince people to take vaccine as Madurai district has fallen way behind in the State average of vaccination coverage,” an official said. While the officials are weighing the option of conducting jallikattu without spectators, a section of them is against it as the sheer presence of a large number of people involved - the participants, organisers, huge posse of police personnel posted for security arrangements - could end up as a super-spreader of COVID -19. “As of now, the final call on Avaniapuram jallikattu, on Pongal day, will be based on the High Court directive,” an official said. The officials have also planned to postpone the Alanganallur jallikattu by a day as the State government has announced complete lockdown on Sunday. Usually, 500 to 600 bulls would be registered for each of the three major events to be held in Madurai district.With the bulls coming from as far as Sri Lanka and from Tiruchi, Coimbatore and Pudukottai districts, each bull will have to be accompanied by 10 to 15 persons.“Besides transporting them, a handful has to be deployed to catch the bulls that run out of the jallikattu arena,” the official said. Though the tamers will be allowed in batches of 75 persons, the 600-odd bull tamers would assemble in a small space and wait for hours till they get their turn to enter the ‘vadivasal.’ At least 2,000 police personnel will have to be posted, besides hundreds of officials from revenue, Animal Husbandry, Health departments, and from local bodies and organising committees. “When even celebrations related to Pongal have been cancelled, conducting jallikattu does not make any sense,” said TNGDA State president K. Senthil. “It will be highly impossible for tamers to wear face masks and maintain social distancing given the hyperactive mood they would be in to catch the bulls,” he said. They also run the risk of getting attacked by bulls in the event of face masks blinding their vision if they are not adjusted frequently. Dr. Senthil also warned that the coronavirus can mutate into another variation any time. “We should not forget that the most dominant variant of Corona virus – Delta – emerged in India and we have lost hundreds of lives just six months back,” he said. A big stress Any outbreak of third wave of COVID-19 will result in a big stress on the health infrastructure, he added. He suggested that instead of cancelling the jallikattu events, the government can consider postponing them till the threat subsides. “We are open to any guideline given by the State government in the wake of COVID threat,” said K. Prabhu, secretary of Palamedu Grama Pothu Mahalingaswamy Madathu Committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jallikattu-can-be-postponed-till-covid-19-threat-is-over-forum/article38162614.ece

Within two days, we had many people and shops calling in about sending bales,” U. Ravichandran, a paddy farmer and head of the Mannargudi farmers union, told The Hindu .  “The heavy rains in recent weeks have led to a shortage of hay in our area,” said Mr. Ravichandran, who also donated bales worth Rs. 10,000 for the cause. R. Sangeetha, Executive Officer of the temple, however clarified that the shortage was a temporary one, and it was independently solved by the authorities in a matter of days. “We regularly maintain a stock of 1500 bales of hay for the cow shelter at the end of the harvest season every year, and we bought hay alone for Rs. 2.5 lakh in 2021. Shortage temporary  The stockpile started reducing on December 21, following which we bought around 50 bales on that day, and replenished the supply soon after. But it was a struggle, because the wet weather had delayed the hay making process. We have never solicited donations for this and Mr. Ravichandran’s well-intentioned appeal was made without prior verification with us. In fact after the WhatsApp message, we have bought some 50 bales of hay at Rs. 270 per bundle for the gaushala , and also explained the situation to Mr. Ravichandran,” Ms. Sangeetha said.  The shelter provides 10 bundles of fresh grass and fortified fodder separately for the cows.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/social-media-appeal-bales-out-cow-shelter-in-mannargudi/article38162592.ece

Stringent action will be taken against manufacturers and sellers of poor quality cement, Collector R. Lalitha said in a press release. The manufacturers and sellers have been reminded of the directive issued by the Board of Indian Standards (BIS) to refrain from making claims that are not backed by the relevant Indian standards. The BIS has, so far, issued mandatory certification for 14 cement standards, and has cautioned the manufacturers against using certain terms implying sturdiness and high-performance. It is mandatory for the manufacturer to display the relevant IS code on the bag for easy identification of the type of cement in the bag. In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 14 of the BIS Act, 1986 (63 of 1986), the Central Government had issued the Cement (Quality Control) Order, 2003, whereby the appropriate authority can draw samples of cement bearing the Standard Mark from retailers and wholesalers for ascertaining whether they are of the specified standard, the Collector said. The DIC has been authorised to confiscate poor quality cement, the release said. Information regarding this could be shared by the public with the General Manager of DIC over phone (8925533969), the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dic-to-ensure-conformity-of-cement-quality-to-bis-mark/article38162586.ece

Rajenthra Bhalaji when the top court was already seized of his case. “Is it proper for your Government to arrest him when the matter was pending before the Supreme Court? Would heavens have fallen otherwise,” Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana asked the State Government, represented by Additional Advocate-General V. Krishnamurthy. Justice Surya Kant, on the Bench, asked the State, “Is it your intention that the Supreme Court should be deprived of a hearing?” “Why are you in a hurry?” Justice Hima Kohli asked. Mr. Krishnamurthy said the Madras High Court had rejected Mr. Bhalaji’s plea for anticipatory bail. “He was arrested. He has been remanded in judicial custody,” Mr. Krishnamurthy added. Senior advocate for Mr. Bhalaji, Dushyant Dave, submitted that besides arresting his client, the police had even raided his lawyers. The court issued a notice and agreed to hear the case on Monday. The Bench stayed all further orders against Mr. Bhalaji. “Why are you attacking the lawyers? Is this the way? What are we coming to,” the CJI addressed the State. The former AIADMK Minister was on Wednesday arrested in Karnataka over an alleged job scam. Two separate FIRs were registered previously by the Virudhunagar police following complaints. The alleged victims had been promised various jobs in the State Government departments, including in the State-run dairy cooperative Aavin. Mr. Bhalaji had held the Milk and Dairy Development portfolio in the previous AIADMK government. Remanded, imprisoned Mr. Bhalaji was brought to Virudhunagar at around 1.30 a.m. on Thursday and was grilled by senior police officers at the District Police Office. He was taken to the Judicial Magistrate Court II at Srivilliputtur after a medical examination. Judicial Officer V. Paramveer ordered his remand. Sources said he was initially taken to the Madurai Central Prison. However, he was redirected and sent to the Tiruchi Central Prison. Amid tight police escort, Mr. Bhalaji was brought to the prison in the evening and was lodged in the high security block.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/why-the-hurry-to-arrest-rajenthra-bhalaji-sc-asks-govt/article38162488.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 05:54 IST,TAMIL NADU||Thenpennaiar ravaged by indiscriminate sand mining||Despite an order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to prevent illegal mining of sand, unbridled extraction of sand continues on the banks of the Thenpennaiar river in Soriyankuppam and surrounding villages in Puducherry, resulting in serious environmental degradation and systematic destruction of the groundwater aquifers in the region. The Thenpennaiar river is the main source of irrigation for a large extent of lands in the north-western districts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. At Soriyankuppam, the river divides the limits of Puducherry and Tamil Nadu. The NGT in 2015 had directed the Puducherry Government to take all measures to prevent illegal transportation and quarrying of sand in the river, and to establish two check-posts for monitoring the transportation of sand. “Though illegal sand extraction was stopped for a brief period, it was now taking place regularly while the authorities were keeping mum. The illegal sand extractors had dug up the riverbed for as deep as 20 ft. The illegal extraction not only has a negative effect on ground water recharge but has also led to the erosion of the river banks and wreaked havoc on the aquatic life forms and their habitat,” said V. Chandrasekhar, president, Bangaru Vaickal Neeradhara Kootamaippu. Unmanned check-posts The two check-posts at Thookupalam and Periyar Nagar, set up on the directions of the NGT to check sand mafia, remains unmanned. The check-posts have remained non-operational for a long time and the sand mafia has been having a free run. One of the check-posts is now used as a cattle shed while a fruit stall has encroached upon the other, he added. “The river sand is stored in bags, not exceeding 50 kg, and subsequently transported on two-wheelers to different destinations through the two check-posts,” says Ramalingam, a farmer. The Mining and Minerals Development and Regulation Act (MMRDA) clearly stipulates that illegal miners and transporters should be imprisoned for a period of two years with a fine of Rs. 25,000. However, not a single person has been fined so far, say environmentalists. A senior official said revenue inspectors had been instructed to keep vigil against sand mining in the region. “We have also dug up cattle trenches on the way leading to the river bed for preventing the entry of vehicles. However, people have been entering the areas surrounding the river belt and mining sand at night. Sand extraction is viewed as a source of revenue generation for a few families. We will be intensifying the raids to curb the activity,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thenpennaiar-ravaged-by-indiscriminate-sand-mining/article38162883.ece

Confirming this, Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar said the last-hour change was communicated by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports after evaluating the gravity of the COVID-19 situation and the rapid transmission of the new variant. The Ministry, in a communication, instructed all Chief Secretaries to not send participants to attend the event physically. It was decided to cut the festival short to three days from the originally planned five days. As of now, the Prime Minister is still expected to inaugurate the event virtually. However, the actual schedule might be tweaked as a physical visit is ruled out, sources said. As recently as Wednesday, Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports Anurag Thakur, had visited Puducherry to launch the logo and mascot the “Saksham Yuva-Shashakt Yuva”, and also surveyed arrangements for the inaugural ceremony. The festival was billed to have 7,500 participants to mark the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of Indian Independence. "The decision was probably arrived at, taking into account the transmission risk associated with a large contingent of participants undertaking travel to Puducherry from several States," Mr. Ashwani Kumar said. Though the administration had undertaken various measures toward enforcing stringent COVID-19 protocol for the event, having a large number of participants from various States in transit at a time when the third wave was sweeping through the country would have been deemed to be too high a risk, officials said. Fresh COVID-19 cases have been increasing recently in the Union Territory and Opposition parties have been calling for the cancellation or postponement of the youth festival. “It is expected that a larger number of youth would now be able to attend the event in virtual mode. However, there is bound to be a cut-back in the programmes, particularly cultural performances, with the truncation of the festival to a three-day affair,” an official said.

The State government should not remain a mute spectator to the current developments as in the past when the upper riparian State had constructed more dams in addition to the main Krishnaraja Sagar Dam. Participating in a demonstration here on Thursday, organised by the Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee along with various farmers associations in the region, the Delta farmers regretted the silence on the part of Chief Minister M. K. Stalin over the recent statement of Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai defending the Karnataka’s proposal to construct a dam across River Cauvery at Mekedatu. Talking to the media at the demonstration site, Committee president P. Maniarasan recalled how in the past the upper riparian State had constructed the Kabini, Hemavathi and Herangi dams in the Cauvery Basin without obtaining the consent of Tamil Nadu and as well as the Central government. Referring to the justification by the Karnataka Chief Minister on the grounds that it would help store surplus water, Mr. Maniarasan said that not more than 50 tmc of water flows into the sea whenever the entire Cauvery Delta receives good monsoon. Such being the case, constructing a dam to impound 67.16 tmc of water would not only deprive the lower riparian regions in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry of the excessive water flow but also make the entire region below Mekedatu depend on the upper riparian State for water, he added. The demonstrators called upon the government to ensure that the Mekedatu issue was dropped permanently as a point of discussion in the Cauvery Water Management Authority meetings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-remain-a-mute-spectator-on-mekedatu-issue/article38162596.ece

Senthil Raj chairing the meet, which was convened to identify the challenges in the health sector through comprehensive discussion with stakeholders. “Public health sector service delivery will be effective only if the community actively participates in the whole process of planning and service delivery. In this regard, to increase citizen empowerment and social accountability of the health sector to its citizens, the Tamil Nadu Health Systems Reforms Programme has proposed to convene District and State Health Assemblies with the support of World Bank. The purpose of the DHA is to discuss health challenges and felt needs of the people and establish a dialogue between different stakeholders at the community level,” Dr. Senthil Raj, who is a physician, said on the purpose of the meet.

As per the latest order of the government, buses can not be operated beyond 50% of their capacity. The bus crews and passengers should ensure personal distancing while travelling in buses. But, most buses, which were being operated from Tiruchi for various destinations, did not seem to bother to enforce the directives. Almost all buses bound for Salem, Erode, Karur, Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Ramanathapuram, Karaikudi, Devakottai, Tiruvarur, Dindigul and Nagapattinam were operated with full capacity. Many were seen travelling standing in close quarters and there was hardly any gap between the standing passengers. Except for a few, most passengers did not wear masks too. Moreover, no passengers were sanitised before boarding the buses. “No one bothers to follow the personal distancing norms. We find it difficult to implement the directives as no one is ready to wait till the arrival of the next bus,” says a conductor of a State Transport Corporation bus. Some passengers entered into arguments with the bus crews questioning the State government for failing to operate more buses, specially when it had given instructions not to load passengers more than 50% of the capacity. “If we miss this trip, we will have to wait for thirty more minutes for the next bus. Even if we are ready to wait for the next bus we may not find a seat as passenger crowds continue to swell,” said K. Satish, who was bound for Karaikudi. The bus stand was crowded since early morning. Since various colleges except for the medical colleges in around Tiruchi have closed the hostels in view of the holidays declared by the State government till January 20, a large number of students thronged the bus stand to return to their native places. Buses being operated in city limits too failed to comply with the Government directives on limiting passengers. Almost all buses were operated with maximum capacity in Tiruchi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-directive-goes-for-a-toss/article38162588.ece

Established by the Union Ministry of Commerce, the FIEO had recently conducted a skill development programme for export of banana from Tiruchi. “The feedback we got from farmers is that the agro-climatic condition in the region best suits the ‘poovan’ variety of banana. But, since it has very poor shelf life, the post-harvest wastage is to the extent of 35%. Hence, our emphasis will be on manufacture of value-added products like banana powder for which there is a huge export market,” K. Unnikrishnan, Deputy Director General - Southern Region, FIEO, Chennai, said.. The FIEO had teamed up with Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), District Industries Centre, and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade to provide insights into making banana exportable to overseas markets, certification, quality standard requirements, value addition and marketing, to help the producers and FPOs to get better price realisation. Farmers who also interacted with faculty of ICAR - National Research Centre for Banana and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, were sensitised to judicial use of fertilisers. The emphasis in future will be on scientific cultivation, post-harvest handling, processing, and marketing the processed products, including fibres for textiles and handicrafts, to overseas destinations, Mr. Unnikrishnan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fieo-keen-to-transform-banana-cultivators-into-exporters/article38162604.ece

Cotton auction at the market, functioning under the Tiruchi Marketing Committee of the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business, resumed this week and would be held on every Tuesdays through the season up to March/April, officials said. This Tuesday, the auction met with a good response both from farmers and traders, with the total trade on the day being valued at Rs. 1.82 crore. Nearly 950 farmers had brought in 4,831 bags or 1.83 lakh kg of cotton and about 23 traders from various parts of the State participated in the auction. The maximum price offered was Rs. 10,701 a quintal and the average price was 9,925 a quintal, according to sources. Farmers from Thuraiyur, Musiri, Thathaiyengarpet, Uppilliyapuram and Manchanallur had brought cotton for auction and traders from Panruti, Sembanarkovil, Kumbakonam and other places participated in the auction, according to official sources. “The farmers were happy that they got a good price of Rs. 107 a kg right at the first trade and are confident of getting good returns right through the season. In the past few years, they used to get only about Rs. 75-80 a kg. The good price will help offset to a certain extent the loss in yield caused by rain,” an official said. Cotton auctions at the regulated market in Thuraiyur were being held in a big way since 2019. The auctions have averted the need for the farmers to go to the cooperative trading centre at Namakkal, saving them transport cost (of Rs. 30 a bag) and other incidental expenses. Last year, cotton worth about Rs. 11 crore was auctioned at the market and the year before that the value of the cotton traded was about Rs. 9.75 crore, he added. Cotton has been raised on about 11,470 hectares (ha) in the district against the 2021-22 annual targeted area of 14,500 ha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cotton-auction-gets-off-to-a-good-start/article38162595.ece

According to the latest communication, direct admissions for unfilled seats will be conducted till January 15.The principals are understood to be under pressure since the seats will have to be filled to justify the existing faculty strength. Previous extensions for admissions were granted during October and November. There are quite a few factors for the repeated extensions that reflect perceptible decline in patronage. They include general ignorance of students about the significance of ITI education, absence of updation in the teaching-learning methodologies, and the conduct of online exams which both teachers and students find out of place, according to the institution heads. According to a principal of a Government ITI in the region, it will be in the interests of students to motivate teachers about the importance of skill development training for students from economically poor families. In no other academic programme in government institutions there is a plethora of benefits for students. A student is entitled to Rs. 750 per month as stipend, free books, drawing equipment, laptop, bicycle, uniform, and footwear. Students staying in hostels also avail the benefits of free stay and food, Velmurugan, Deputy Director, Department of Employment and Training, and Principal, Government ITI, Tiruchi, said. Students who undergo regular programmes are going through a phase of disorientation since they feel out of place due to the system of computer-based test being conducted at the All-India level by the Directorate General of Training under the aegis of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. The students in the Government ITIs in Tamil Nadu were not comfortable with the computer-based All India Test for Craftsman Training Scheme. The performance of the students in the All India Trade Test was quite disheartening, say teachers. Due to the trend of shrinking admissions for the regular two-year programme, the institution heads foresee a possibility in the coming years for ITIs being utilised solely for conduct of short-term vocational training.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/extension-for-iti-admissions-puts-pressure-on-principals/article38162615.ece

The students, many of who reside in special schools would be approached by a team of the health department under the guidance of the District Differently-Abled Welfare Office. The drive to vaccinate intellectually disabled children began at the Intact Special School in K. Sathanur, where 30 students, the majority of whom were girls were given Covaxin, the authorised vaccine for the age group. Since the campus was residential, the caretakers were instructed to monitor the students after the jab was given. Mohammed A. Hakkim, doctor in charge of the vaccination drive, and S. Chandramohan District Differently-Abled Welfare Officer inaugurated the drive and vaccinated the students. Their blood pressure and other vitals were checked prior to the vaccination. “We have inoculated 30 students here, there are a few more students at special schools and other homes for them in the district,” Dr. Hakkim said. The dose was 0.5 ml, same as that of adults. Meanwhile, Tiruchi has inoculated nearly 50% of the eligible 1.2 lakh population between 15 and 18 last week. While on the first day of the drive - January 3, 14,556 people were vaccinated, 24,666 took the jab on January 4 and 18,008 on January 5. Including Thursday's performance, the tally would increase over 50%. Health officials said that while they were able to reach students at educational institutions, tracing dropouts and those working would be more difficult. “We are committed to achieving 100% soon,” the official said. On Wednesday, Pudukottai had inoculated 49.38% of the eligible population between 15 and 18, while Ariyalur had vaccinated 51.18%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drive-to-inoculate-children-with-developmental-disabilities-begins/article38162590.ece

As the number of COVID-19 cases getting reported and admitted to the hospitals every day is on the rise after a lull following the second wave that caused more mortality ever since the viral infection started spreading across the globe in the first quarter of 2019, the Tirunelveli district administration has repeatedly cautioned the public against being complacent. in the wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing as they visit public places. Police Commissioner of Tirunelveli City N.K. Sentharamai Kannan too, warned the violators of fines for violating COVID-19 protocols. However, the scant respect being shown by the public now warrants stringent action against the violators, it seems as More than 80% of people in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai neither wear masks nor maintain physical distancing in public places including textile showrooms, restaurants, supermarkets, mega stores etc., police officials said. “As our repeated appeals have failed to encourage the public to follow the COVID-19 protocols, we’ve been compelled to implement the rules forcibly to contain the sudden spurt in the viral infection. We’ve started deploying inspection teams to check violations at public places and any violations will be viewed seriously with fines,” says V. Vishnu, District Collector. Mr. Senthamarai Kannan too has warned that the violation of COVID-19 protocols in public places would invite on-the-spot fines by the police. On their part, the Tirunelveli District Police are also conducting COVID-19 awareness events in every part of rural Tirunelveli. Rallies, masks distribution, lectures in schools etc. are being held. “The police, who are now appealing to the public during awareness programmes to follow the COVID-19 protocols, will act tough hereafter as we are staring at the third wave with the Omicron threat looming large,” says P. Saravanan, Superintendent of Police, Tirunelveli.. Tenkasi Superintendent of Police, Tenkasi District, R. Krishnaraj distributed masks to the public in Tenkasi Bazaar on Thursday and appealed to them to strictly follow the protocol. “We appeal to every one of you to cooperate with the official machinery to contain the viral outbreak by wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing while visiting public places,” Mr. Krishnaraj said. The police swung into action in Thoothukudi city on Thursday following widespread violations by slapping fine of Rs. 200 each on those who did not wear the masks when they conducted surprise checks near Cruz Fernandez Statue. “This punitive measure will continue and become intense,” S. Jayakumar, Superintendent of Police, Thoothukudi, warned. Led by Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vilaathikulam, Prakash, the police organised awareness programmes in Vilaathikulam on Thursday by distributing masks to the public, autorickshaw drivers, traders and commuters while asking them to wear the protective coverings as mandated by the government whenever they came out of their houses. “Since the Tamil Nadu Government’s Department of Public Health has appealed to everyone to scrupulously follow the COVID-19 protocol in the wake of the Omicron threat, every citizen should cooperate with the official machinery in containing the outbreak,” Mr. Prakash appealed. Residents of Ward 17 of Thoothukudi Corporation near Third Mile, in an attempt to encourage the occupants of their ward to get vaccinated for achieving 100% vaccination status, have announced prizes for three vaccinated persons to be selected through lots. The CPI(M) has taken this initiative to make this area of Thoothukudi Corporation become the ‘First 100% vaccination ward’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/scant-regard-for-covid-19-protocol-leads-to-stringent-action-in-districts/article38162621.ece

They were became operational about a fortnight ago. “Once the pay back period of five years ends, the revenue generated from the solar power can be utilised for various welfare works in the city,” said P. Ashok Kumar, Commissioner of Vellore City Corporation. Every day, on an average, the solar panels generate 11,000 units of energy. This is transferred to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) substations. In return, the electricity bills of high-tension connections of the civic body which run its water treatment plants, pumping stations and two gas-based crematoriums with are off-set. Thus, the civic body saves Rs. 24 lakh every day, which it otherwise would have had to pay the power utility. The Rs. 10.40-crore was taken up under the Smart Mission Project in 2018 to tap renewable energy along the river in Vellore. A total of 7,400 solar panels were installed on the sandy tracts of land along the river with a maximum capacity to generate 2.4 MW of power. At present, only 50% of the capacity is being generated every day. Subsequently, the officials said, power generation would be scaled up as maximum sunlight would be available for more hours, especially during summer. The Corporation officials said that unlike some of the second tier cities such as Coimbatore where bright sunlight was available only for a certain number of months in a year, Vellore is blessed with clear skies throughout the year, except during the peak of northeast monsoon between October and December. This helps the civic body tap the maximum clean energy under the project. In the coming months, the Corporation plans to install solar panels on the rooftop of its building on Infantry Road to generate 40 kVA of solar power. Such a measure would save the civic body Rs. 80,000 a month towards electricity charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sandy-tracts-of-land-turn-green-pastures-for-vellore-corpn/article38162944.ece

These teams were deactivated last year, after the cases started to decline. As a direct consequence of the increase in number of cases, the number of containment zones has also increased. In just six days, the number of containment zones has increased from 110 on January 1 to 182 on January 5. According to the daily BBMP's COVID-19 War Room reports, there were 221 containment zones on Thursday.  BBMP Chief Health Officer Balasundar told The Hindu that over 100 containment zones were reported from apartments. The civic body's health officials coordinated with the residents’ associations in these apartments, apart from intimating the local police about the cases and persons under home isolation/ quarantine.  “That apart, with the spike in cases, the Home Guards have been roped in for quarantine watch. These teams will check on those under quarantine, apart from coordinating with the residents’ associations,” he said. Similarly, contact tracing teams have also been reactivated. Teachers and personnel from other departments who were earlier deployed for contact tracing are being roped in again, Dr. Balasundar said. The BBMP has also posted KAS officers to monitor activities pertaining to COVID-19 management in each of the 27 Assembly constituencies. Eight KAS officials have also been posted to monitor the zonal COVID-119 War Rooms. The War Room reports show that the most number of containment zones are in Mahadevapura and Bommanahalli zones. Explaining reasons for more positive cases being reported from these two zones, the CHO said that Mahadevapura, being the IT hub, sees a lot of employees who have undertaken domestic and international travel. “We have seen that many cases are reported among citizens residing in wards coming under Mahadevapura zone (Bellandur, Doddanekkundi etc.) and Bommanahalli zone (HSR Layout). However, in other wards where there are more cases being reported, such as Mangammanapalya, near Electronics City, the source of infection is being traced to a fruit market that sees a lot of merchants/ traders coming from other States,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/contact-tracing-teams-reactivated/article38162405.ece

Puram Road, the State Cabinet on Thursday asked five agencies of the city and Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Company Limited (KRIDE) to prepare a master plan for free movement of traffic to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and other two roads. The State Cabinet also approved Rs. 6,000 crore for developing the city’s infrastructure. The city’s civic agencies (BDA, BBMP, BMTC, BWSSB, and KRIDE) have been asked to prepare the plan and submit it to the State Government. Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J C Madhuswamy, who briefed the media on the State Cabinet meeting, said the civic agencies of the city have been asked to come up with a plan to streamline transport in the city for easing traffic by increasing road lanes from the city to Airport from existing three to five. “The cost of the projects is yet to be estimated. The funds for the project will be sanctioned in the next budget,” Mr Madhuswamy said. BMRCL has already started a comprehensive study to ease the flow of traffic at Hebbal junction and to increase its capacity based on projected traffic density in 2051, the Minister said. A total of 12 projects were listed by the minister which were aimed at increasing the number of traffic lanes of various major roads in the city. According to the proposal by various civic agencies, three flyovers are proposed along Ballari road to increase the number of lanes from the city to the airport from three to five. Other road widening projects include: a three-lane underpass from Tumakuru Road to KR Puram, two-lane flyover from KR Puram towards the city, two-lane flyover from KR Puram towards Airport, widening service road from Airport to KR Puram from two-lanes to three-lanes, widening KR Puram-Tumakuru road to four lanes among others. The Minister said an elevated skywalk has been proposed near the busy traffic intersection at Banashankari, located close to Banashankari Metro Station, bus stand, Banashankari temple and the market. The skywalk would help pedestrians and ease the movement of BMTC buses at the busy junction. Mr. Madhuswamy said the Cabinet approved an allocation of Rs 6,000 crore to Bengaluru for implementing various projects in the next three years. A sum of Rs 2,000 crore each would be spent each year over a three year period. Funds would be allocated under the Chief Minister’s Nagarotthana scheme, he said. The funds will be used for the development of basic infrastructure in the city and is in addition to the works taken up by BBMP, he said. The Cabinet granted administrative approval to procure 300 electric buses for BMTC at the cost of Rs 100 crore, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/prepare-master-plan-to-decongest-traffic/article38162389.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:56 IST,KARNATAKA||Retail sector questions weekend curfew||The retail sector, which was one of the worst affected by the pandemic, has questioned the Government’s rationale behind imposing weekend curfew. Representatives, instead, urged the Government to allow retailers to remain open for business with adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour (CAB) instead of a lockdown. “Does the virus spread only during night time and weekends? Why should we shut down our businesses when political rallies with thousands are being allowed?”These were the two common refrains in the industry. Many trade bodies, including the Karnataka chapters of Retailers Association of India (RAI) and National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), have petitioned the State Government to reconsider the weekend curfew and instead focus on enforcing CAB. RAI has urged the Chief Minister to consider new criteria for restrictions. RAI argued that the number of hospitalisations should be the criterion for the kind of restrictions imposed because of the pressure it puts on the healthcare system. Senior trade activist from Chickpet, the wholesale hub of the city, Sajjan Raj Mehta said most markets in the city did over 60% of their business during the weekends and closing them down would adversely affect an already bleeding sector. Mohammed Nazin, Vice President, Bangalore Commercial Association, agreed. “Commercial Street is already wearing a deserted look. Restrictions by the Government have a chilling effect and people do not venture out even on weekdays,” he said. However, a senior civic official said the arguments made by traders that the bulk of their business happens on weekends, substantiates the rationale why the city needs a weekend curfew. Ajay Nagarajan, CEO, Windmills pub, said the industry had seen some green shoots since November and the Omicron scare and restrictions that followed suit have ruined it. “The industry has suffered for 20 months now and won’t survive another bout of lockdown. Many establishments will shut down, leading to loss of business and jobs,” he said. Chandrashekhar Hebbar, President, Karnataka Regional Hotel and Restaurants Association, said that 50% occupancy during weekdays and only take aways during weekends will essentially make several establishments unviable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/retail-sector-questions-weekend-curfew/article38162400.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:05 IST,KARNATAKA||COVID-19: Second dose vaccine coverage in Karnataka crosses 80%||Over 80% of the adult population in Karnataka is now fully vaccinated. With this, Karnataka now stands third in the country - after Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat - in terms of second dose coverage among large States. While it is still a challenging task for the State Health Department to cover the remaining population, officials said the second dose coverage picked up in the last one month, mainly owing to the Omicron scare. From 51% on November 16, second dose coverage in the State shot up to cross 80% on Thursday. The first dose coverage has crossed 98% with 4.8 crore the 4.89 crore eligible adult population been covered. State health officials, who admitted that they were finding it hard to sensitise people to get vaccinated till November, said people were reluctant to get vaccinated mainly because the number of new COVID-19 cases had reduced drastically. Now the demand has picked up again following a surge in cases. According to data from CoWIN and the State Health Department, the second dose coverage in 17 of the 31 districts is above the State average of 80.4%. Bengaluru Urban (excluding BBMP), which was the first district in Karnataka to achieve 100% second dose coverage on December 23, has exceeded its target by 4%. Officials said this was due to the floating population in the district. Bengaluru Urban is followed by Kodagu (94%), Mandya (88%), Ramanagaram (87%), and Hassan (86%), which are among the 17 districts with high second dose coverage. North Karnataka districts – Kalaburagi (72%) and Raichur, Yadgir, and Koppal at 74% each – have recorded the lowest second dose coverage. The trend of poor vaccination in several north Karnataka districts has been continuing for months now. BBMP coverage BBMP, which has an eligible population of 91,70,000, has achieved 77% second dose coverage. The first dose coverage here is the least at 93%. Arundhathi Chandrashekar, State Mission Director, National Health Mission, said there is an urgency among people now to get vaccinated as cases are surging. “As of Thursday, we still have 41.8 lakh people due for the second dose. It is a challenge to cover the remaining population mainly because of migration. Now, following directions from the Government of India, we are contacting those who are due for the second dose and asking them to take the jab wherever they are. With the requirement of mandatory vaccination in many activities, we are hoping more people will soon come forward and get vaccinated,” she said. “Another problem is a technical issue. Many, especially in rural areas, would have given a different number for the first dose and taken the second dose with a different number. According to our estimates, nearly half of the remaining population who have to get their second dose could have already taken it with another number. There are still many who are hesitant to get vaccinated as they would have developed minor adverse events after the first dose,” the official explained. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the State is confident of crossing 90% second dose coverage by the end of January. “The second dose is bound by the 12 week (84 days) interval and hence we have to go by it,” he said. “We had committed that we would complete vaccination by December 31 and we are pretty much there. We have achieved 98% first dose coverage. The last few lakhs are the most difficult ones and we are hopeful that we will achieve cent per cent in the next few weeks,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-second-dose-vaccine-coverage-in-karnataka-crosses-80/article38162396.ece

Though the Cauvery Neeravari Nigama (CNN) put up a proposal to the Government in November 2013 seeking exemption under KTPP Act for purpose of preparing a DPR, the then Government examined the proposal for six long months and in April 2014 the Government decided that an agency to prepare DPR should be identified through a tender process,” Mr. Karjol told presspersons. “The global expression of interest was floated only in October 2014,” he added, releasing the sequence of events in the Mekedatu project DPR preparation. The revelation came in the light of the Congress remaining adamant over conducting the padayatra from Mekedatu to Bengaluru, seeking implementation of the project. The Minister said: “Nine months later in July 2015, the deadline for obtaining blank documents was fixed and technical bids were opened in August 2015 following which it was referred to the tender scrutiny committee. The Financial bids were opened in October 2015 and the tender scrutiny committee rejected the bid of CNN on the grounds that the rates quoted were unreasonable.” Meanwhile, Mr. Karjol accused that the then Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil wrote to the Chief Secretary in June 2015 stating that the work of preparing DPR be entrusted to a consultant directly without tender process by obtaining exemption under KTPP Act though a similar request by the CNN had been rejected earlier. Mr. Karjol said: “While the Water Resources Department had rejected the bid of WAPCOS, a Central Government undertaking, stating that the bid amount of Rs. 22.07 crore was expensive, the WAPCOS had in fact placed the bid at Rs. 3.26 crore and another company El Technologies had bid for Rs. 3.24 crore. Both these bids had been rejected owing to a conspiracy.” Surprisingly, the Minister said: “The Government granted exemption under KTPP Act on February 25, 2016 and the very next day the tender was given to El Technologies at the rate quoted by it. A completed tender process had been scrapped providing a lame excuse.” Further, he said while El Technologies submitted the Rs. 5,912 crore DPR in June 2016, the State Government took another nine months before granting in-principle approval in March 2017. The preliminary report was submitted in August 2018, after a gap of five years. “The then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Mr. Patil have to explain the reason for taking the non transparent way and the political forces that were at work then.”  Political considerations subsumed the interest of Karnataka on Cauvery projects.Govind KarjolWater Resources Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karjol-blames-congress-for-delaying-preparation-of-dpr/article38162423.ece

Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi getting stranded on his way to a rally in poll-bound Punjab on Wednesday, was a “BJP ploy” to “defame” Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and the Congress Government. Speaking to presspersons here on Thursday, he said: “The PMO, the Union Government and the BJP leaders have been providing wrong information to the media to defame the Congress Government, which is being led by a Dalit Chief Minister in Punjab.” He blamed the Modi Government for the security lapse and said the Centre controlled the SPG and the IB, and the entire incident was a result of the “poor turnout” at the public rally, which Mr. Modi was to address. He claimed that as against the BJP’s expectation of 75,000 people attending its public event, only around 700 had turned up in addition to 5,000 police personnel. “The BJP leaders are making efforts to destabilise the Government headed by a Dalit CM,” Mr. Kharge alleged. The Congress leader claimed that “because it is a Congress Government and it is an election year, the BJP is playing politics of polarisation”.  The PMO, the Union Government, and the BJP leaders have been providing wrong information to the media to defame the Congress Government, which is being led by a Dalit Chief Minister in Punjab.M.

It is also found that there are absolutely no materials to indicate the magnitude of impugned action so disproportionate that erratic evaluation would go unnoticed under the impugned Ordinance,” the court observed. Petitions dismissed Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the order while dismissing the petitions filed by Vishweshwara C. and Shashank S. Reddy, both pursuing MBBS course. The court wondered how the petitioners can insist that deviation valuation has to be done in a particular manner while rejecting the petitioners’ contention that while determining deviation between first two valuation of theory papers, the varsity should consider the difference between the marks awarded by the two evaluators and not the difference of marks against the maximum marks prescribed. “This court is unable to understand as to how the petitioners, who have failed in subjects can question the Ordinance and also suggest as to how the evaluation of the papers has to be conducted by the university. Any indulgence by this court in this regard would only lead to catastrophe and would lead to compromise in standards in medical education,” the court observed in its order. The court also said that the petitioners cannot insist that university should adopt four valuation system that is applicable to PG students. “There cannot be discrimination among different classes. The petitioners have not placed any material which would indicate that the impugned Ordinance is violative of Article 14 and the same leads to discrimination,” the court said. Justice Magadum also made it clear in the judgment that the Ordinance under challenge thoroughly contains an academic element and therefore, the court cannot encroach upon and test the wisdom of experts and also encroach into the inherent jurisdiction of experts body who are vested with power to revive, revamp the policies relating to the academics. It was contended on behalf of the university that the Ordinance, which came into force from February 1, 2021, was promulgated by adhering to the directions of the court in earlier rounds of litigations over norms governing valuation, and also the advisory issued by the National Medical Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-declines-to-interfere-with-new-norms-for-theory-paper-assessment/article38162416.ece

Private hospitals have been directed to reserve beds for COVID-19 treatment by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta who chaired a virtual meeting with Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) and Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) on Thursday. This comes a day after the State Government issued an order mandating that all private hospitals and nursing homes reserve 30% beds under all categories for COVID-19 patients. This will mean that around 10,000 to 12,000 beds will be available in private hospitals in Bengaluru. The civic body has already put in place tele triaging teams, apart from mobile triaging teams in all wards. These teams will ascertain if the infected person needs hospitalisation. A majority of those with COVID-19 can recover under home isolation. In a release, BBMP stated that nodal officers had been directed to inspect hospitals, and collect data on the number of beds that are occupied and vacant. Helpdesks should be opened at hospitals with more than 100 beds.

Compiled data from Bengaluru Urban and BBMP will give us a realistic picture,” said a senior official in charge of vaccination. “While Bengaluru Urban has exceeded the target, BBMP is far behind. This is mainly because many people from BBMP limits came to Bengaluru Urban to avoid queues at the vaccination centres. Workers from the industrial areas of Bommasandra, Jigani and other adjoining areas were also covered by Bengaluru Urban.

Shivakumar, who hails from Davangere, owned a poultry farm, but had incurred huge losses. Facing harassment from money lenders, he came to Bengaluru and started RS Travels in Bagalagunte last year. “He offered owners huge amounts of returns and paid a rent for the taxis which they then attached to his travel agency,” said an officer.

Addressing a media conference here on Thursday, State convenor of Jagathika Lingayat Mahasabha Ravindra Shabadi and other Lingayat leaders, including Prabhuling Mahagaonkar and R.G. Shetagar, said that the event, which normally attracted lakhs of people, will be organised in compliance with the revised COVID-19 guidelines issued by the State Government. “The event, organisation of which started in 1988, has hitherto attracted lakhs of people. This time, we will, however, decide the size of the crowd to ensure compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. We strongly believe that public health is more important than any other political, religious or cultural activity,” Mr. Shabadi said. The leaders said that the Sharana Mela will see the participation of all Lingayat groups and pave the way for the unity of all Lingayats under a single umbrella to take forward the struggle for independent religion status. They said that the decision of the Basava Dharma Peetha, in the backdrop of the Supreme Court ruling, to discontinue Linga Deva as the non de plume of Basaveshwara and, instead, use the original pen name Kudalasangama Deva, is a great leap forward for the unification efforts. [Late Mathe Mahadevi, former head of the peetha, had, in her book, Vachana Deepti, replaced Kudalasangama Deva with Linga Deva as the nom de plume of Basaveshwara. The State Government banned its publication and seized the printed copies. The Supreme Court subsequently also upheld the State Government’s decision]. “The decision of Mathe Gangadevi, who succeeded Mathe Mahadevi to become the head of the Basava Dharma Peetha, to stop using Linga Deva and return to Kudalasangama Deva is a great boost for the Lingayat unification efforts. Now, all groups are ready to come under a single umbrella and fight for independent religion status,” Mr. Shabadi said. Activists Medha Patkar and C.T. Bevanur will be honoured with Basavatmaje National Award and Sharana Kayaka Ratna State Award, respectively, on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kudalasangama-to-host-sharana-mela-next-week/article38162650.ece

Shivakumar is keen on taking out a padayatra over the Mekedatu matter to prove his leadership in an internal tussle in the State Congress over leadership between him and the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Kateel said that people’s interest is not involved in the proposed padayatra. It is unfortunate that, notwithstanding COVID-19 restrictions, the Congress wants to go ahead with its plan. ‘Political interest’ The Congress has planned the padayatra fearing that it will not win the next Assembly elections in the State. The padayatra is to meet its political interest only. If the Congress is really interested in the Makedatu project, why did it kept quiet when Mr. Siddaramaiah was the Chief Minister, he asked and said that the then Congress Government did not call for any meeting to discuss the matter when it was in power. The State and Union Governments will sort out the legal issues related to the Mekedatu project and take steps for implementing it, he said. ‘Drop plan’ Mr. Kateel said that Mr. Shivakumar is only trying to prove his leadership over Mr. Siddaramaiah through the padayatra. But the Congress should drop its plan in the interest of helping prevent the spread of COVID-19 as the health of people mattered the most. All parties should join hands with the government in implementing the measures announced to contain the spread of the infection. State Governments are taking decisions on weekend curfew, lockdown and other measures based on the recommendations of their respective expert committees. The Chief Ministers, Ministers and MLAs have little role to play in it, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/padayatra-dks-trying-to-score-over-siddaramaiah/article38162817.ece

If not, the Union Government should dismiss the Congress Government in Punjab, he added. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Kateel said that the Prime Minister had to cut short his visit to Ferozepur due to the “irresponsibility” of the Punjab Government led by the Congress. The Punjab Government should have enabled zero traffic on the road travelled by Mr. Modi as he is the Prime Minister. Video clippings of the police having tea with the protestors on the road have gone viral. It reflected the status of security provided by the State Government to the Prime Minister. How can farmers protest on the road to be travelled by the Prime Minister? he asked and said that the protesters appeared to be Congress workers in the guise of farmers. The incident reflected the mentality of the Congress, Mr. Kateel said and added that the Congress is apprehensive of the popularity and personality of Mr. Modi that it (the Congress) will become irrelevant and hence, it has attempted to take on him through back door tactics. Mr. Kateel said that it was a pre-planned event by the Congress to scuttle the visit of the Prime Minister. Earlier, the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had “murdered” democracy by imposing Emergency. Later, the Congress had removed some democratically elected governments and had tried to create unrest in the country, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/punjab-cm-should-resign-kateel/article38162818.ece

Products from the Kerala Soaps stable are finding wide acceptance in States such as Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra. The quality of sandal oil procured directly from Marayur by the Forest Department is one of the key reasons for the rising popularity of the brand, according to company sources. The sandal soap, sold as a single unit of 75 gram, combined as 150 gram and 450 gram, had found favour with buyers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where traditional sandalwood fragrance was popular, they added. Kerala Soaps, which has a variety of soaps other than those based on sandal oil, had faced market constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the slowdown, which resulted in stoppage of production for a while, saw the company turning to supply of sanitisers. The company was able to produce and supply high quality sanitisers to entities such as the Kerala Medical Services Corporation, public sector undertakings, banks, cooperative societies, and residents’ associations. The demand for sanitisers from Kerala Soaps was such that the company was able to sell around 45,000 litres of the product during the year 2020-21. Company sources said one of the key achievements during the COVID-19 period was that Kerala Soaps was quickly able to produce sanitisers much required for the emergency. The popularity of Kerala Soaps products has prompted the management to seek registration for supply of products to the Canteen Stores Department of the Central Defence forces while it is already selling its products through the Central Police Canteen. The PSU soap-maker is now able to churn out around 800 to 1,000 tonnes of products a year. A shortage of containers is among the reasons why Kerala Soaps is unable to export its products. Kerala Soaps had wide acceptance in Qatar and the UAE and, at one time, it had also exported three consignments of products to China. The company had a turnover of around Rs. 14 crore last year and it was poised to do much better in the current year, added sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-soaps-spreading-its-fragrance-across-the-country/article38162725.ece

According to government criteria, engines up to 10 years old alone will be issued fresh permits. It implies that thousands of vessels that fail the test will be out of the list of those eligible for subsidised kerosene through the Public Distribution System or Matsyafed. Vessels that were granted permits in 2012 and are still in operation will be among those losing permits under the new stipulations, said Charles George of Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedhi on Thursday. The fishing community had requested the government through several representations to fix the permit period for 15 years, but the government has not responded so far, he added. Apprehension He said union members had met Fisheries Joint Secretary Asha Augustine on Thursday and conveyed their apprehension over the government move. According to him, as many as 158 vessels were issued permits in Ernakulam in 2015. Since then, over 200 had joined the fleet. Of them, only 148 have so far applied for permit renewal, which indicates that the rest may have already gone out of business, he added. Fishing vessels with outboard engines have been receiving a specific quantity of subsidised kerosene over the last three decades. The government has been slashing the quantum of subsidised kerosene supply to the fisheries sector following a World Trade Organisation recommendation that no fuel subsidy be offered to fishing vessels. A portion of subsidised kerosene distributed through Supplyco has been reserved for fishing vessels. However, the volume has been drastically reduced. While 600 litres of subsidised kerosene used to be given to an engine or a vessel per month two decades ago, the volume has been cut down to 129 litres. The volume of kerosene is not even enough to meet a day’s fuel need, claimed Mr. George. The subsidised quantum has now been further reduced to 40 to 60 litres per month, he added. Livelihood issues Meanwhile, fishers said the decision of the Fisheries department not to renew permits for boats owned by those above 60 years old would result in livelihood issues. While boats will go out of business, their owners will be totally banned from engaging in fishing operations, Mr. George said. The fishing community, in a recent memorandum to the Chief Minister, had requested him to make State agencies intervene to end black marketing of kerosene.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/boat-permit-fishers-seek-review-of-decision/article38162777.ece

He plans to enrich his vlog with daily videos for the next one-and-a-half-years that their trip is expected to last. Even the portents of a potential third wave of the pandemic failed to dissuade them. “Cycling is perhaps the safest thing to do during an epidemic. We are confident of being allowed passage even through areas under lockdown,” said Mr. Manoj, who used to work at Kerala House in Delhi. Mr. Manoj, a cycling enthusiast, wanted to pedal around the country while Mr. Reji wished to discover the country somehow. “Our ideas kind of converged and we ended up cycling,” said Mr. Reji. They have been pedalling around 70 km to 80 km a day since they started. But they may slow down considerably once they leave Kerala, as exploring the places they pass through takes precedence over setting a daily target in terms of distance to cover. “This is such a wonderful country and the majority of us die without ever getting to explore it in full. We have just one life, and we thought we would rather do it now than regret later,” said Mr. Reji.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/out-to-explore-india-on-bicycles/article38162730.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the directive on a writ petition filed by Binu Sebastian and three others from Ettumanur seeking a directive to the government not to proceed with any survey for demarcating boundaries and fixation of alignments for any railway project in the properties of the petitioners. Aspect of concern When the petition came up for hearing, the court noted that one aspect of concern was that in the government orders, the extent of land required to be acquired had already been mentioned, along with the details of the block numbers, survey numbers and villages. Obviously, therefore, the senior government pleader must explain to the court how this had been done. Officials enter premises The petitioners said officials under the special tahsildar, land acquisition, Kottayam, had entered their properties and made steps to demarcate the boundaries arbitrarily and illegally. The petitioners contended that as per Section 11 of the Railways Act, only the Central government and its instrumentalities alone were authorised to issue the notification for land acquisition, survey, measurement and valuation for any railway project. However, the State government had now issued them by disregarding the provisions of law. Directive sought The petitioners sought the quashing of the government orders and all further proceedings for survey and land acquisition. The petitioners also sought a directive to the State government and the Kerala Rail Development Corporation not to proceed with any survey until appropriate notifications were issued as contemplated in the Railways Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/how-were-orders-issued-for-land-acquisition-hc-asks-govt/article38162783.ece

In a letter to the Governor, the teachers pointed out that the university had been facing various issues owing to the absence of a regular Vice Chancellor. Since the retirement of P.K. Dharmarajan on November 29, 2021, Calicut University Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj has been holding additional charge of Sanskrit varsity Vice Chancellor. The council members said crucial decisions at the academic and administrative levels could not be taken in the absence of a regular Vice Chancellor. The entire academic, financial and administrative functions of the varsity will come to a standstill, if the annual budget is not passed as per rules, they added. Periodic reports The letter said proposals and periodic reports would have to be submitted by the university without the consent and approval of the Vice Chancellor. Only a regular Vice Chancellor can monitor this continuing process of evaluation, it said. The teachers said the post of Pro-Vice Chancellor had also been lying vacant, leading to difficulty in the conduct of exams, especially during the pandemic. Adverse impact The letter said the delay in revision of syllabus and reform of the examination system, which had to be done this year, would have an adverse impact on the assessment of the university by national ranking agencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/teachers-urge-governor-to-expedite-appointment-of-vc/article38162873.ece

Ajithkumar said, in the question-and-answer session that followed an outreach programme addressed by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Thursday. It would be much like the ro-ro trains of the Konkan Railway, he said, answering a question by C.J. George, managing director of Geojit Group. There would be a common station near Infopark for the rail project and for the Kochi metro, he added. A Water Metro terminal is located close by, furthering the cause of integration with other commuting modes. Last-mile connectivity through roads too will be readied. Commuters from Kochi will be able to reach Kottayam in 23 minutes, Thrissur in 31 minutes, and Kozhikode in 75 minutes. To a question from K.M. Unni, retired Railway official and advisor to IIT-Palakkad, on why the Indian Railway was not vested with the task of executing the SilverLine, Mr. Ajithkumar said the project would most likely get a budgetary allocation of just around Rs. 800 crore per year, which was wholly insufficient. Lisie Hospital director Father Paul Karedan said people who surrendered land for the project must be aptly compensated. To his query whether trains faster than 200 kmph could be introduced on the corridor, the K-Rail chief said that would need investment in much costlier technology. But speed could be increased to a maximum of 250 kmph. Even otherwise, the viaduct could carry thrice the passenger capacity of an express highway, he said. Much of the expected passenger patronage of over 70,000 would be passengers of the one lakh cars that used Kerala’s highways every day. Places of worship To a question by Kerala Muslim Jamaat district president V.H. Ali Darimi on whether the alignment passed through places of worship, Mr. Ajithkumar said there were just a few places of worship along the alignment. Any further change would necessitate altering of a three-km alignment, where there could be yet another place of worship. Traders who surrendered land would be given priority while renting out commercial outlets at stations, he said. Kerala Travel Mart Society secretary Jose Pradeep said amenities must be readied for tourists near stations. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve said Ernakulam would benefit the most from the project since commuters would be able to reach districts at the extreme end of the State in less than or just over two hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/silverline-will-also-be-used-to-transport-cargo-k-rail-chief/article38162737.ece

He said it was a combination of the Congress, BJP, and fundamentalist groups such as the Welfare Party and the SDPI that were opposing the project.

The incident took place at 11.30 a.m when a Sea King Charley helicopter hovered over the location as part of a training and familiarisation sortie. Eyewitness accounts suggested that the chopper remained stationary over the spot and the wind generated by the rotor blades of the chopper blew away the temporary roof of a painting workshop underneath. The workshop is reported to have suffered a loss of around Rs. 25,000. The incident created fear among the local people who ran away from the spot thinking that the chopper was going to crash. The people claimed that the same chopper had been spotted flying low in another area in the same ward earlier. The incident was immediately reported to the Kanakkari village office and the Kuravilangadu police. The police who had been initially caught unawares of the incident later confirmed that it was a naval chopper. A defence spokesperson said the chopper, which was generally deployed in humanitarian assistance and disaster-relief operations, was on its standard low-flying mode. Navy statement An official statement from the Indian Navy said that the aircraft had established a high hover at 200 ft above ground level as per the sortie profile. “It is possible that during approach to the hovering spot these buildings under construction might not have been visual to the aircrew from air at that height due to thick foliage and dense vegetation in the area. Notwithstanding, the air station is examining options of alternative approaches to the hillock keeping clear of buildings or habitation,” read the statement. The statement further elaborated that the Indian Naval aircraft based at INS Garuda conducted pilot training apart from meeting various operational commitments. “In order to train the aircrew to fly special operations, especially in the unmapped terrains during natural disaster or calamities, and to give realistic training value, an area off Ettamanur has been selected due to proximity of steep hillocks to simulate mountainous terrains clear of habitations. The sorties are undertaken routinely at that location,” it noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/low-flying-navy-chopper-creates-panic-near-ettumanur/article38162770.ece

In a significant development, the university is undertaking a joint research initiative with the Siberian Federal University in Russia to develop smart fungicide capsules to help improve yield of tapioca. The project, spearheaded by MGU Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas, involves depositing the fungicide capsules in pits dug close to the tapioca plants, which are under different stages of growth. In the preliminary phase, the research focuses on the process of developing a new farming system that will make tuber farming more profitable and minimise soil and water pollution due to fertilizers and pesticides. “The fungicides are released in a sustainable manner from the biopolymers that are environmental-friendly. Measures are also taken to improve the performance of these formulations, which have lower toxicity than conventional fungicides,” explained Mr. Thomas. Safe farming This new generation agro-preparation, according to him, will be a promising solution to safe and sustainable agriculture. The collaborative project worth Rs. 9.5 crore, which has entered its fourth year, is being funded under the Mega Grant of Russia.

A flawless field inspection is under consideration covering all the vulnerable spots within the city limits to detect safety rule violations and report them to the higher authorities for action. Many of the building owners, who were earlier held accountable for violation of fire safety norms, are yet to comply with the instructions. The building permits of such owners are likely to be suspended in the coming phase of inspections. According to official sources, they will also be liable to face legal action under the Disaster Management Act. Industrialists and traders engaged in large-scale production or sale of plastics, garments and footwear have been asked to have a close look at their internal safety measures in the wake of some of the recent fire outbreaks, causing huge losses. The rescue squads have already carried out their primary inspections in some of such sites following confidential reports on suspected violations. A senior officer attached to the fire safety wing said the negligence in reviewing the fire safety measures individually and the reluctance to renew the annual maintenance contract for fire equipment were continuing to be the major risk factors in averting fire tragedies. He said that it was pure luck that saved the lives of many from some of the recently affected buildings. According to Fire and Rescue Services officials, the soaring mercury levels have also fuelled incidents of fire, apart from individual negligence. They said that the habit of burning waste near risky areas and the attempts to cook food inside vulnerable shops were yet to witness any let-up. Apart from holding the violators accountable, the rescue squads in various fire stations will also start their work to replace the damaged fire hydrants in public places and install fresh ones in more required areas. Along with this, training sessions and mock drills to make the public aware of the practical fire fighting activities are under consideration within the limit of each station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/recurring-infernos-force-rescue-wing-to-tighten-regulations/article38162719.ece

P. Mohammed Faisal, coordinator, Ramanattukara Kinfra Knowledge Park Land Losers Action Committee, told the media on Thursday that the government had promised to give five cents and a house for those who gave up land for the project. The committee functionaries claimed that though land was acquired for the Knowledge Park 13 years ago, neither the Department of Industries nor Kinfra were able to give a specific response on the release of the compensation. Fifteen of the 140 landowners were no more. The government ordered the acquisition of 80 acres in Ramanattukara in 2008. Of this, 76.66 acres were acquired in 2010. At that time, the government paid only one-tenth of the fair value of the land. Till now, the government has not yet paid the full compensation to them. The committee functionaries said they have had a long legal battle and the Kerala High Court passed a compromise decree in 2018, based on which the government had to pay complete compensation by November that year. The government, however, approached the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a six-storey building came up at the acquired land. Though the landowners held a protest outside the building for one-and-a-half years in 2020, officials ignored it. Mr. Faisal said that during the meetings held on August 12 and August 24, 2021, in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode, government representatives offered to give the land price as decided by a lower court and 15% interest on the land price only till August 31, 2019. They agreed to the conditions when it was promised that the compensation would be released in 45 days. On September 3, Kinfra again sent them a letter saying they should also agree for a 5% reduction in land price and promised to release the money by November 30. The landowners refused the demand. On September 30, a discussion was held in the chamber of the sub-judge, Kozhikode, where the government was asked if it was willing for an out-of-court-settlement since confiscation proceedings were being initiated. The government was asked to give its response by October 15. Later, another round of talks were held on December 2 in the chamber of Minister for Industries P. Rajeeve, where Minister for Public Works P.A. Mohamed Riyas and Kinfra officials too were present. The landowners said they were willing for a 5% reduction in land price and would also give up 15% of the interest on land price from 2020 February. An agreement was reached that the Cabinet would clear the amount by December 31. The Cabinet was yet to discuss the issue, the functionaries alleged.

Since the police and other government authorities have not come forward to address the issue, more such “nomadic” children are being attracted to the banned practice. “We strongly suspect that there are elders behind such children wandering in the beach area. They have learnt all the tips and tricks to attract the sympathy of the public. An investigation to expose the invisible hands behind them is the need of the hour,” said two senior citizens who met several such children on the Lion’s Park premises. On Wednesday, as many as eight children, including those below five years of age, were found seeking alms from visitors to the beach in the name of medical treatment and others. Incidentally, policemen at the beach aid post or pink patrol squads made no attempt to check their whereabouts. Vendors on the beach said there had been a rise in the number of nomadic children in the area. A lottery vendor from South Beach said a few children were found selling balloons and toys to cover up their involvement in begging. “They seek alms from dawn to dusk. No one knows where the money goes. There are even instances where such children ignore people who offer them food,” he added. According to some beach vendors, a majority of such children are found living in insecure surroundings despite the availability of rehabilitation facilities for rough sleepers. Such children and elders should be offered livelihood support at the earliest, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-steps-yet-against-child-begging-in-kozhikode/article38162711.ece

Instead, the department will endorse the report of a five-member committee assigned to review the IIT-M report and its recommendations for further action including strengthening the complex. An interim report mentioning the technical problems in the construction had been submitted to the department last month. The committee had also sought clarification on the 2,000-page IIT-M report which stated that the pillars of the multi-storey twin tower complex were structurally weak and required immediate strengthening. The IIT-M report had also recommended the immediate closure of the twin towers on the Mavoor Road. The first tower has 10 floors and the second 11 floors including space for parking. However, the five-member committee constituted in October had not recommended its closure. But it had suggested strengthening 10 pillars and repairing minor technical faults. Also, the committee sought clarifications on some of the analysis based on the data the IIT-M team had collected on the construction of the building. Meetings held To maintain COVID-19 protocol, online meetings were held to evaluate the IIT-M report. The minutes of the final meeting were circulated among the members. The final report would be submitted to IIT-M shortly, sources said. The members of the committee were Chief Technical Examiner S. Harikumar (convener); Prof. Nirjhar Dhang, Head of the Department, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT-Kharagpur; T.M. Madhavan Pillai, Department of Civil Engineering, National Institute of Technology-Calicut; L. Beena, Chief Engineer (Buildings) Public Works Department; K.R. Bindu, College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram. The Kerala Transport Development Finance Corporation (KTDFC), which had constructed the twin tower in 2015, will be tasked to undertake the renovation works. Subsequently, the commercial space would be handed over to Mukkam-based company ALIF Builders which had secured a contract for 30 years. During the renovation period, the KSRTC terminal will remain partially closed, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/transport-dept-not-to-go-by-iit-m-report-on-ksrtc-terminal/article38162713.ece

George seeking an investigation into the cyber assault on her using the ‘Bulli Bai’ app, which targets Muslim women by putting up their images online for auction. Ms. Farzana, a native of Kannur, filed the complaint here as she was temporarily settled at Velliparambu in the city. The complainant said she would submit a copy of her grievance to the Chief Minister and the State Police Chief. Ms. Farzana recently said there were attempts on the part of some to settle the case without following the legal channel. She made it clear that she would never succumb to such attempts. Drawing the attention of the police to the defamatory campaign against her and other women by unidentified persons using social media platforms, Ms. Farzana said it had been spoiling the peace and reputation of many women like her. “The delayed legal action against the suspects is encouraging more criminals to assault women in cyberspace,” she said. In her petition, she said she had been getting abusive calls ever since her photograph was uploaded on the ‘Bulli Bai’ app.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/student-activist-files-plea-with-district-police-chief/article38162780.ece

The reservoir is constituted by three dams, Idukki arch dam, Cheruthoni dam, and Kulamavu dam, from there water is diverted to an underground power station at Moolamattom. The power generation model is depicted at the museum with a miniature of the reservoir. An entire hall is dedicated for the Idukki dam, the Periyar before the dam construction, the construction period of the dam, its commissioning, and newspaper reports on the dam in its early stage. This is not the only attraction here. The discoveries connected to the prehistoric period such as urn burials, heroic stones, tribal heritage, art, and culture, creation of Idukki district, its spices, and the early period of settlements are depicted in the other halls in a cluster of buildings. Tribal life The museum has a large area reserved for tribal life and the farm equipment unique to them. The yesteryear plantation life is depicted via the images of the first monorail in Munnar, Raj buildings, and the life of plantation workers. The museum also showcases the heritage of the district from the prehistoric era to the present day. Some of the historical evidence of the Megalithic era of Anchunadu are also placed with detail here. “From time immemorial, spices from the high range were exported and it shows the rich life there,” says Sajeev K.K., guide at the museum. There are video presentations of the tribal life and evolution of the district. The old heritage museum, which once housed dolmen, urn burials, and related discoveries, under the district panchayat was taken over by the Archaeological department to give a broad spectrum of life in Idukki.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-trip-through-the-annals-of-idukkis-history/article38162760.ece

(BEML), a profit-making mini-Ratna public sector company, in protest against the Union government move to privatise the firm turned a year on Thursday. It was on January 6 last year that hundreds of BEML employees started their agitation against the government move to disinvest 26% shares. Centre of Indian Trade Unions secretary K. Chandran Pillai inaugurated the anniversary dharna in front of BEML unit at Kanjikode, near here, in the evening. Mr. Pillai also inaugurated a candlelight protest in front of the company. CITU district president P.K. Sasi presided over the function. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Pillai said the agitation by BEML employees was a nationalist struggle as they were trying to protect a company involved in the manufacturing of vital equipment, including military equipment. By privatising a company such as BEML, the Union government was trying to jeopardise the hundreds of soldiers who guard the country on the borders. “BEML is worth more than Rs. 56,000 crore. It is being sold off for Rs. 1,800 crore. It smacks of corruption,” said Mr. Sasi. BEML had secured orders worth more than Rs. 10,000 crore through global tenders last year. Other units A company engaged in the manufacturing of heavy military vehicles, rail and metro coaches, and mining and construction vehicles, BEML has units in Bengaluru, Kolar, Mysuru, and Kanjikode. The Kanjikode unit is functioning on 375 acres of leased land given by the State government. It manufactures army vehicles, passenger railway coaches, and metro coaches. It has 350 permanent employees and 150 contract workers. It already churned out 1,500-odd heavy military trucks, 300 railway coaches and 500-odd metro bogies.

The Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) has been asked to prepare a report for formulating a policy and legislation. The move has raised eyebrows as it is a deviation from the avowed policy of the Left that discourages privatisation in the education sector. The establishment of deemed universities will also weaken the relevance of State-funded universities. The development comes against the backdrop of an application submitted by the Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kochi, an autonomous college, which has sought approval for ‘deemed-to-be’ university status. Following a “detailed consideration” of the request, the Higher Education department has issued an order that states the possibility of more autonomous colleges following suit in future. Sources say the government appears to have undertaken preliminary discussions in the matter. While such proposals are generally forwarded with an accompanying note for feasibility studies, the move to issue a government order with copies sent to the Registrars of all universities has aroused curiosity. The United Democratic Front government of 2011-16 had seriously pursued the idea of setting up private universities in the State. A KSHEC committee headed by former Mahatma Gandhi University Vice Chancellor Cyriac Thomas had also submitted a feasibility report. Recommendations Among the various recommendations, the panel had insisted that only educational agencies with at least 10 years of experience in running a private university be considered for the status. While the proposal had then been staunchly opposed by the LDF, the present KSHEC, appointed by the previous LDF government (2016-21), had scrapped the recommendations since it was felt the move will undermine the quality of higher education. According to KSHEC member secretary Rajan Varughese, an expert committee will be constituted to deliberate on the issue. The provisions of the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019 and the social realities of the State will be factored in the study. The regulations mandate at least 20 years of existence, a minimum NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council)accreditation of 3.26 CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) for three consecutive cycles, and a top-100 National Institute Ranking Framework ranking among the criteria. Those fulfilling the eligibility criteria can submit applications to the University Grants Commission after ‘intimating’ the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/deemed-varsities-in-the-offing/article38162790.ece

The adult hog deer was spotted outside its enclosure around 9 a.m. By the time reinforcements arrived, it had jumped outside the compound wall. It was then tracked to an uninhabited compound at Kanaka Nagar, zoo superintendent T.V. Anil Kumar said. Zoo veterinarian Jacob Alexander climbed onto the compound wall and shot off a tranquillizer dart. The hog deer was brought back to its enclosure and given an antidote for revival along with fluids. It was soon back on its feet. The hog deer is one of 50 at the city zoo. Mr. Anil Kumar said they had used nets to increase the height of the wall and prevent more escapes. Work on increasing the height of the zoo compound wall was under way in phases, he added.

They have been accused of barging into the houses and unleashing a wave of terror near the CRPF camp junction early Wednesday.

Ravindran, urban designer and former Chairman of the Delhi Urban Art Commission, in an email interview to The Hindu amidst the growing controversy over the Left Democratic Front government’s decision to go ahead with the multi-crore project.  Does Kerala with its high density of population and limited availability of land require a multi-crore project like the SilverLine semi high-speed rail corridor? I am aware that political swords have already been crossed on this issue. As an admirer of the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government, I do not wish to enter that debate. Yet, in my view, the SilverLine project will do more harm to the environment than the declared benefits to the State. Higher speed is equal to higher cost. The faster the speed, more capital intensive a project, less accessible the project is for ordinary people of Kerala. Problem is, do we need more speed or do we need better job opportunities and amenities for the people? Certainly not more speed! It is a prerogative of an elected government to decide what is the priority for development. But at what social, environmental, and monetary cost? From my standpoint, the environmental cost of the project is prohibitively high. In these days of climate crisis, when Kerala is far more vulnerable than other States, building climate resilience should be our primary goal. The SilverLine project flies in the face of climate crisis. A cursory glance at the project as projected in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report demonstrates how calamitous the project would be to Kerala’s vulnerability. Any linear system of movement, particularly land-based, which is least flexible to accommodate variations in land profile or even curves and deviations remains the most interventionist on land. We already have a rail and road-based movement system that runs north-south against surface water flows in Kerala, one more rail line will spell disaster. What will be the environmental impact of the project that cuts through paddy lands and runs on embankments and cuttings? Kerala’s landform has two side slopes. From the east to west, the land slopes steeply from the Western Ghats to the Arabian sea, north to south from the laterite lands of Malabar to Thiruvananthapuram. The watery landscape of backwaters is the lowest where we saw the worst floodwaters during the last few floods. Besides this, the threat of sea level rise and storm surges from the Arabian Sea are now even more severe threats. Kerala, in other words, is under assault from both sides, from the sea and the mountains by aggressive water flows. The project stays clear of the entire floodable plains of south Kerala and moves up north towards Malabar, to run parallel to the present railway line. While in its north-south journey, the SilverLine avoids the floodable lands, the EIA is silent on the new floodable lands that will result from the 292 km of embankments necessary for the rail gradient. These embankments will have variable impacts on the land and water flows and may completely alter the land west of it as well as land east of it. The EIA report, to its credit, has recognised and made detailed recommendations to mitigate the problems that may occur on the existing floodable land on the west of the line, while is completely silent on the impact the inevitable embankment will have on the eastern side of the line. Consider the fact that the embankments would run through paddy fields, bird sanctuaries, innumerable wetlands and wooded areas, rivers and river basins, all together about 101 km of land cutting and 11 km underground tunnel and so on. Let us not forget that most of the new alignment would severe the midlands from the coastlands of Kerala. It is in these midlands that the rich bio-resources of our Ayurveda tradition lie. Multiple streams run through the valleys of the undulating land in this region to create a unique biodiversity of medicinal plants, finally contributing to the river networks that traverse the State. Consider also the unpredictable alterations to local conditions that will ensue. Add to that the severe mud and debris washdown that happens from east to west. How will these accumulations of mud and debris affect the lands adjoining the embankments on the eastern side? What impact would it have on Kerala’s fragile food security and shrinking paddy fields? How many people’s livelihoods, homesteads and daily movements would be impacted? What happens to nesting and breeding grounds of animals, birds and insects? Very consequential questions that cannot be ignored. The rehabilitation of thousands of families is part of the plan. Where is the land for that rehabilitation? How many new roads, bridges and other infrastructure are required to meet these requirements? Station locations also raise many issues. In most cases, they do not coincide with the existing railway stations. All along Malabar, they run parallel to the existing line even though separate, are close to the present stations, but requires some commuting by passengers. How should Kerala address the increasing need for improved transportation efficiency while focusing on environmental protection? Overall, the environmental cost, social cost and monetary cost need reconsideration. An effective method could be in decentralised, regionally balanced plan for Kerala that relies on new technologies, which minimises the environmental cost. This could be a planned, slow and sustainable model that gradually grows qualitatively, more equitably and with least disruptions to Kerala’s increasingly vulnerable settlements. Such a plan would also address climate crisis issues softly in localised mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/silverline-will-do-more-harm-to-environment-than-declared-benefits/article38162708.ece

The opposition to the project gained steam as the Left Democratic Front government was re-elected to power, he added. Catching up In his address, Minister for Industries P. Rajeeve said Kerala needed to catch up with most other States on the basic infrastructure front. Managing director of K-Rail V.

In all, 1,500 workers employed at Sri Sathya Sai and Sri Rama Reddy drinking water schemes are agitating along with those of the Ramagiri and Kalyandurg CPW schemes. A similar strike in July last year had brought things to such a situation, which was temporarily resolved later.  Rural Water Supply (RWS) Superintending Engineer D. Venkata Ramana told The Hindu that currently, they were able to manage without a major crisis as the local protected water schemes in the villages were still functioning, but if this strike lasted long it would be difficult for the department to manage things. “While the payment of seven months is due from the contractors to the workers, the contractor has promised to release the payment for months, which might soften the workers’ stand,” the official said.  Meanwhile, the crux of the entire problem is the non-release of money by the State government to the contractors, the Municipalities and Gram Panchayats not releasing money to the RWS, and the RWS in turn not able to pay Rs. 215 crore of power bills. It has turned into a closed chain of interlinked problems, said workers’ union leader Obulesu. The State government is yet to release about Rs. 19 crore to the contractors for which bills had been raised by the RWS officials and we are expecting them soon, said the Superintending Engineer .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/1800-villages-go-without-drinking-water/article38162363.ece

Briefing the media on the State Cabinet’s decisions on Thursday, Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs J.C. Madhuswamy said some Ministers were against weekend lockdown and continuation of night curfew as positivity rates for COVID-19 have been negligible in districts. Based on the positivity rate for COVID-19 and suggestions given by experts, the government would decide on continuation of curbs, he said. Preventive measure As a preventive measure to contain the spread of COVID-19, particularly in Bengaluru, the government had imposed weekend lockdown and night curfew for two weeks. The guidelines were enforced in the interest of public health, he said. ‘It’s a BJP lockdown’ To a query, the Minister said weekend and night curfews had nothing to do with the padayatra planned by the Congress on Sunday seeking implementation of the Mekedatu drinking water project. The government would not be toppled by the padayatra, Mr. Madhuswamy said. KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar criticised the government for imposing the weekend lockdown in the State and termed it a “BJP lockdown and not COVID lockdown” aimed at “destroying the livelihood of drivers, traders, and street vendors” and “harassing common people with a lot of restrictions”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-ministers-oppose-curfew/article38162107.ece

Raghavendra Rao, son of Kothagudem MLA Vanama Venkateshwara Rao of the ruling TRS, has been booked on charges of abetment to suicide based on a complaint filed by Janardhan, brother-in-law of Ramakrishna. Mr. Janardhan also complained that he received threatening calls from some unidentified persons asking him to withdraw the complaint. In the heartrending video, 40-year-old Ramakrishna accused Mr. Raghavendra Rao of causing mental agony by asking him to send his “wife to a hotel room in Hyderabad” to get the property dispute he had with his elder sister resolved. “He spoke to me in a disgraceful manner, which no husband would like to hear. I am feeling helpless and left with no option but to take the drastic step,” he added. As the clip went viral, leaders of various parties and mass organisations staged protests in Kothagudem and Paloncha on Thursday seeking action against the accused. The CPI district council has called a bandh in Kothagudem constituency on January 7. Meanwhile, there were reports that Mr. Raghavendra Rao was detained by a police team in Hyderabad on Thursday evening for questioning. However, the Paloncha police said they had not yet arrested him and that efforts were on to track him.

Stalin told the House on Thursday. Shortlist At present, Vice-Chancellors are appointed by the Governor, in his capacity as the Chancellor of the State universities, from a shortlist of three names submitted by a search committee. Mr. Stalin’s statement came after certain remarks made by Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi. “As for the appointment of Vice-Chancellors, the Chief Minister is consulting legal experts [on amending the law]. In many States, the government holds the powers to appoint Vice-Chancellors,” Mr. Ponmudi said earlier. According to him, this was the case in Telangana. The Minister was responding to concerns over the appointment of Vice-Chancellors raised by PMK floor leader G.K. Mani (Pennagaram) during a debate on the motion of thanks to the Governor for his address to the House. In the appointment of Vice-Chancellors, “the role of the State government should be there,” Mr. Ponmudi contended, citing the case of Maharashtra which recently passed a legislation to vest more powers in the government. Citing media reports, the Minister said that in West Bengal, the State government appointed Vice-Chancellors and the Governor objected to it. This was the case in Kerala, too, he said. (Kerala is only examining the happenings in West Bengal and Maharashtra, and has not taken any decision.) “To put an end to all this, it would be better to create a situation wherein the State government could appoint the Vice-Chancellors. The Chief Minister is discussing with legal experts. A decision would be taken before the next Assembly session,” he said. Seeking the attention of BJP floor leader Nainar Nagenthran (Tirunelveli), Mr. Ponmudi said that even in Gujarat, which was ruled by Narendra Modi before he became the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister held the powers to appoint Vice-Chancellors. “Even the Prime Minister knows. So you, too, please point out,” he said.  During the Assembly session for presenting the Budget in March, we will certainly adopt a resolution unanimously [on the powers related to the appointment of Vice-Chancellors].||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tamil-nadu-may-clip-governors-powers-to-appoint-vice-chancellors/article38162411.ece

After witnessing a debacle in the recent municipal polls, Mr. Naidu is back at his home turf of Kuppam constituency on a three-day visit to soothe the ruffled feathers of his beleaguered party cadre. It may be recalled that the activists were at the receiving end in the Assembly segment which is otherwise considered the TDP’s citadel. At a road show in the town on Thursday, he sought to win back the support of the people by recalling the ‘anti-people’ policies of the incumbent government viz., rise in prices of essential commodities, One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme for houses sanctioned by the government and the high cost of petroleum products in Andhra Pradesh compared to the neighbouring States. The point that seemed to have a telling impact on the public, as the tail-end Kuppam shares border with both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Recalling the unflinching support extended by the Kuppam voters to him for over three decades, he said he would show his gratitude by ending the ‘undemocratic rule’. He also warned the government and police officials, who he alleged were party to the ruling party’s ‘ruthlessness’, that they would be paid in the same coin upon returning to power. “The derailed development in the State will be set right and we will once again be on the path to progress after 2024,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-blames-ruling-ysrcp-for-rise-in-prices-of-essentials/article38162859.ece

A study is under way to try and bring down the number of buildings that ought to be taken over (from the 9,300 envisaged) for the project. Alternatives suggested, such as increasing the speed of trains by straightening the 626 curves on the existing railway network, would not yield the desired results, since that could require more land acquisition for the project, said Mr. Vijayan at an outreach programme on the proposed rail corridor. Referring to the concerns about large-scale flooding on either side of the 530-km corridor, which is estimated to cost about Rs. 63,941 crore, he said a hydrographic survey was on to assess this, wherein high-water marks of floods and high tides during the past century would be considered. The existing railway line too is built on an embankment, he said, referring to concerns of SilverLine’s embankments causing flooding. In addition, care has been taken to stay clear of ecologically fragile areas and wildlife sanctuaries. Laying of boundary stones (which has met with stiff resistance in many places) would help assess the extent of land required and ensure that the project causes only minimal social impact, Mr. Vijayan said. Speaking of the national highways (NH), GAIL gas pipeline and Koodankulam power highway projects that were or are being executed overcoming initial opposition, Mr. Vijayan exhorted the people to ponder “if not now, when?” about SilverLine. “We may not be able to make up for lost chances,” he said. The project would complement the ongoing NH development, the coastal and hill highway projects and the Kovalam-Bekal waterway project. It will initially reduce carbon emission by 2.88 lakh tonnes, he said. Refuting allegations that MLAs were not apprised of the project’s details, Mr. Vijayan said the members were taken into confidence in the Assembly and K-Rail officials cleared their queries outside the House. The opposition to the project gained steam following the LDF government coming back to power, Mr. Vijayan said. In his address, Minister for Industries P. Rajeeve said Kerala needs to catch up with several States on the basic infrastructure front. V. Ajithkumar, managing director of K-Rail, said the project’s total cost included the cost of escalation. The proposed rail corridor would be able to carry up to 500 lorries (in the roll-in, roll-off mode) every day, while the feasibility of carrying cars in that manner is being studied, he said. Cong. workers held Four activists of the Youth Congress were arrested after they staged a protest near the venue of the event. Meanwhile, Ernakulam District Congress Committee president Mohammed Shiyas has demanded the government to ensure the rehabilitation of people evicted from Moolampilly and its neighbouring areas for the Container Road project over 15 years ago, before going ahead with foundation stone laying of the SilverLine project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-going-back-on-silverline-kerala-cm/article38162109.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:47 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Hope synod will resolve Mass issue’||The Athiroopatha Samrakshana Samithi (forum for protection of the Archdiocese of Ernakulam-Angamaly), comprising members of the community of priests of the archdiocese, said it would submit a memorandum to the Synod of Bishops of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church to either permanently exempt the archdiocese from the purview of a synodal decision in August last year on the way the Mass is celebrated or to grant a special privilege to celebrate the Mass as it is being done now. The 30th Synod of Bishops of the Syro-Malabar Church will begin here at Mount St. Thomas, Kakkanad, near Kochi, on January 7 and conclude on January 15. The samithi expressed the hope the synod would be an occasion to reconcile the differences of opinion over the way the Mass is celebrated in the archdiocese. ‘Not practical’ Senior priests Sebastian Thalian and Jose Vailikkodath of the samithi and leader of Alamaya Munnettam (a collective of lay people) Binu John said a Bishop had been consecrated in the Antiochian rite in the Kottayam archdiocese despite it being a part of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. It was thus clear that uniformity was not practical in the Syro-Malabar Church, they said. The synod ruled in August last year that the Mass should be celebrated with the celebrant (priest) facing the congregation (participants) for the first part, and then face away from the congregation for the second half. However, over the last half-a-century, the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese has been practising fully congregation-facing Mass. The synod has recommended the new way of Mass celebration without consultation or discussions, the samithi leaders said. ‘Imposition’ The decision on uniform Mass celebration was an instance of imposition from top and does not jell with Pope Francis’ ideas and was not in keeping with the spirit of the Second Vatican Council, they said. The priests and lay members also said that it was not right for Major Archbishop Cardinal George Alencherry, an accused in several civil cases, to continue as the president of the Synod of Bishops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hope-synod-will-resolve-mass-issue/article38162115.ece

A woman, identified as Neethu of Kalamassery, Ernakulam, was arrested in connection with the incident. Alarm raised The accused woman, pretending to be a nursing staff at the hospital, abducted the two-day-old baby from its mother, Aswathy, of Vandiperiyar, at 3 p.m. on the pretext of taking the infant for a medical check-up. As the baby was not returned even after 30 minutes, the mother approached the hospital authorities. On finding that none of the nurses on duty had collected her baby, the mother raised an alarm. Upon receiving an alert from the hospital authorities, a police team reached the spot and soon sealed the entire location before launching a massive search operation.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:42 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||ORI fast-tracks digitisation of 20,000 manuscripts||After moving at a sluggish pace for the last few years, the digitisation process has picked up pace at the Oriental Research Institute (ORI), considered a repository of ancient manuscripts in South India. Once digitised, the 20,000 manuscript titles (with approximately 70-100 folios each) will be made available to the scholastic community in the form of four lakh digital pages. Launched by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) in 1939, the institute was handed over in 1956 to Sri Venkateswara University after its formation, as the then TTD Executive Officer C. Anna Rao and SVU founder vice-chancellor S. Govindarajulu deemed the move fit to meet academic and research needs. The institute has been engaged in procuring and preserving manuscripts, editing, publishing and reprinting rare books, conducting national and international conferences and sending its ISSN-numbered journal to universities in India and 16 other countries. The ORI has even generated nearly 100 Ph.D.s on rare topics. The Union Government’s National Manuscripts Mission recognised the Tirupati ORI as a ‘Manuscript Resource Centre’ in 2007 and the State higher education department acknowledged it as a ‘Centre of Excellence’ in 2008. Precious collection The diverse range of manuscripts preserved here includes Vedas, Vedangas, Upanishads, Vyakarana, Jyotisha, Smriti, Puranas, philosophy, archeology, sculpture, painting, astronomy, Ayurveda, Arthasastra (administration and statecraft) and literary plays. Though the digitisation process started in 2015, it could not sustain the momentum due to a variety of reasons. The sluggish pace came to a screeching halt due to COVID-19, but picked up after its Director T. Surendra Reddy fixed a target to get the task completed in two years. Work in progress The institute was recently in the news for resisting an attempt by a private organisation, supposedly having little to do with manuscripts, to take control over such ancient repositories in libraries across the State in the name of digitisation.

Ravi Babu has said that proper implementation of rule of reservation at every level is the basic prerequisite for the empowerment of the tribal community. Accompanied by Deputy Chief Minister K. Narayanaswamy, Mr. Ravi Babu held a meeting with TTD officials to review the rule of reservation, implementation of roster system and filling up of backlog posts. TTD Joint Executive Officer Sada Bhargavi gave a presentation on the status of backlog positions and welfare measures. Mr. Babu said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had formed the ST Commission only to ensure that the tribal community got its rightful share of welfare activities. He appreciated the TTD’s decision to implement roster system in SVBC. Referring to his visit to Tirumala Sri Venkateswara temple earlier in the day, he said he had prayed for the welfare of the 32 lakh Adivasis in the State, but the Nakkala tribal community dwelling for over three generations in the Tirumala Papavinasanam forest area, eking out a living by selling sundry items to the visiting pilgrims, were badly in need of justice. With some of them having lost livelihood to road widening activities, Mr. Ravi Babu directed that the issues pertaining to the 234 families be resolved at the earliest. He also minced no words while mentioning that 80% of problems faced by the community in Chittoor district was from the forest department. At the meeting held with SVU Vice-Chancellor K. Raja Reddy and Registrar O.M. Hussain later, the Chairman was surprised to find the presence of only one out of the 12 ST faculty members on rolls. He flagged the huge vacancy in backlog posts at the varsity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/st-panel-chief-for-implementing-rule-of-reservation/article38162365.ece

Dwaraka Tirumala Rao, at a press conference here on Thursday. He said the corporation, however, would charge 50% extra bus fare in the special services as these buses would run one side empty and expressed the hope that people would understand the situation and extend their patronage to the RTC services. “There has been a steep hike in diesel rates but the APSRTC did not increase the bus ticket rates,” he said, and informed that the buses with service number starting from 9,000 series were being operated as special services. He said the corporation planned its special services well in advance for the festival from cities like Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai to various places in the State. He said reservation facility was provided for 511 special bus services from Hyderabad and 50% seats were already booked. Caution Mr. Rao requested people to exercise utmost caution while travelling by strictly following the COVID protocol. Responding to a query on inter-State agreement with the Telangana RTC, Mr. Rao said, “We believe in healthy and fair business practices.” He said instead of allowing the private bus operators to take away the benefits, there could have been ways for the two States to agree upon and improve their businesses. Citing the instance of the cargo sector in the APSRTC, he said it had been earning good revenue even while charging less than what the neighbouring States collected. “Our decisions are always based on rationality,” he reiterated. The corporation Executive Director (Administration) A. Koteswara Rao, ED (Operations) K. S. Brahmanandam and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apsrtc-plans-to-run-6970-special-buses-for-sankranti/article38162863.ece

Mr. Harichandan was virtually addressing (from Raj Bhavan) the 22nd and 23rd convocation ceremony of the Dr. NTR University of Health Sciences held at Thummalapalli Kalakshethram in the city on Thursday. He said the COVID pandemic had worked as a catalyst for educational institutions to grow and opt for online platforms with digital technologies which had been not used before. “The education sector has been fighting to survive the crisis with a different approach in facing the challenges posed by the pandemic,” Mr. Harichandan said. “The scope and demand for higher education are increasing by the day and the most important mission of higher education is the creation of intellects by providing world-class education,” he added. “Critical thinking and scientific analysis are supporting pillars for advancement in research. To encourage research the university is contemplating giving financial assistance with special emphasis on Ph.D. programmes. It has identified over 23 centres and 218 Ph.D guides among the affiliated institutions for the purpose,” he said. Congratulating the graduates, Mr. Harichandan advised them to practice yoga and meditation for overall well-being, overcoming physical and mental stress, maintaining good health and enhancing their endurance. “Connect yourself with yourself first, then with the society and then deliver what best you can. Inculcate the habit of life-long learning and success will be yours,” he said. He said the third wave of COVID pandemic had come and called upon the young doctors to contribute to the fight against the pandemic. Honorary doctorates Mr. Harichandan presented an honorary degree Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) to gastroenterologists Dr. D. Nageshwar Reddy, chairman and founder of Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Hyderabad, and Dr. C.

Dr. Palanivelu stressed the need to focus on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that had become a threat to society. He said on a par with communicable diseases NCDs were affecting society and mortality was much more due to NCDs. “Several ancient Indians pioneered medicine and the world looked at us but today we are not doing as good as we did in the past but there is a lot of potential among the younger generation,” Dr. Palanivelu said. ‘10 commandments’ Dr. Nageshwar Reddy came up with a suggestion consisting of ‘10 commandments’ to be followed by doctors. He said honesty, hard work, empathy, communication skill, constant learning, respect towards teachers and parents, respect towards colleagues and their work, learning to deal with complications and innovation and focus were to be practised and followed by every doctor. A total of 31,713 students graduated from the university in the past two years, said Registrar Dr. K. Sankar.

Going by the government’s calculations, a compensation of Rs. 7 crore should be paid as base price to the farmers who parted with their holdings under the pooling scheme. If the farmers were to be compensated according to the Land Acquisition Act of 2013, three times that amount had to be paid to them, he observed. Mr. Dinakar insisted that Amravati should be developed strictly in compliance with the CRDA Act as lands were pooled under the provisions of the said Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-leader-demands-explanation-on-monetisation-of-amaravati-lands/article38162950.ece

Palanivelu||Renowned gastroenterologist and chairman of GEM Hospital and Research Centre, Coimbatore, C. Palanivelu has said that laparoscopic surgeries have become safer than open surgeries over the years with advanced technology and trained surgeons. He said that one need not hesitate to choose laparoscopy over open surgery. Responding to a question on apprehension against laparoscopic procedures among the common people, during a brief interaction with reporters, Dr. Palanivelu, known for introducing laparoscopy for the first time in the south of India, said that laparoscopy was introduced about 30 years ago and it had been proved as a much safer procedure than open surgery. “In laparoscopy, we have the advantage of viewing the subject 10 to 25 times bigger through magnification with enhanced clarity. The most important aspect of laparoscopy is the training of the surgeons. In fact, hereafter surgeries should be done using laparoscopy if experienced and trained surgeons are available,” he said. Even in the case of cancer treatment, technology using ICG injection enabled us to see cancer cells in the tissue and removal of them had become less complicated, he added. Regarding the COVID pandemic, Dr. Palanivelu said that a booster dose was essential to fight COVID infections now and high-risk people should take it. He said that countries and States were doing very well in vaccination programmes and India showed the world a cost-effective way of immunising the population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/laparoscopic-surgeries-safer-dr-c-palanivelu/article38162948.ece

The firm is a startup initiated with the goal of providing a wide range of services to senior citizens who are living on their own. Addressing a press conference during the launch, founder and managing director of Anvayaa Kin-Care Private Limited, Prasanth Reddy, said that the technology used by the firm enables personalised services and offers services like healthcare, diagnostics, pharmacy, home maintenance, grocery, surveillance and security, local travel as well as legal assistance to the elderly. “When I was staying away from my family, I always wanted to come back to help them. But it was not possible always due to several circumstances. That prompted us to come up with this idea of launching a firm that would provide a range of services to the elderly who either have their children living abroad or in faraway cities,” Mr. Prasanth said, explaining the idea behind the setting up of Anvayaa. “Before the launch, we conducted a survey and interacted with 400 people to find out what actually the elderly persons need. We found that only 30% need healthcare services, while 70% need emotional support due to loneliness, and logistics support,” he said. “We have an ecosystem with 250 partners to fulfil every need of the elderly persons.

Refusing to let their disabilities come in the way of their love for the game, the cricketers batted, bowled and fielded with alacrity, all from their wheelchairs. A modest crowd watched in awe as the fielders raced in their wheelchairs to stop the ball, almost tilting over in their efforts to retrieve the ball. The ground is located right behind the ZP High School but with a high wall and a grill gate separating them. The ground has a separate entry gate. As the differently-abled players exhibited their skills with bat and ball, curious schoolchildren stood at the gate and watched the game unfold during the lunch break. “I was a First Class player. My spinal cord was injured in a car accident in Delhi in 2012, and I have been confined to a wheelchair ever since,” said S. Raman Subba Rao, founder general secretary of the AP Wheelchair and Disabled Cricket Association, who has been been organising wheelchair cricket matches every year since 2016. “The winners of this event will be eligible to participate in the nationals to be held in Delhi later. We are also planning to organise a Wheelchair World Cup cricket tournament in a few years,” Mr. Subba Rao said. “ In the United States, I had launched basketball and football for NRIs on behalf of TANA after being elected as its sports coordinator,” said Shashank Yarlagadda. “On coming to India, I made an online search to organise some sports activity and chanced upon Raman Subba Rao, who has been conducting wheelchair cricket matches. I learnt that all over India, there were about a dozen such associations and I wanted to start with the Telugu States first,” he said. Thursday’s match was played between Andhra and Telangana. Andhra batted first and scored 231/4 in 15 overs, while Telangana managed to score 99/6 in 15 overs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-show-of-passion-at-wheelchair-cricket-cup/article38162964.ece

Narasimha Rao said that the government had failed to address the plight of the chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and demanded that compensation be paid to the 4 lakh ryots whose crop had been damaged by the invasive thrips last year. At a press conference here on Thursday, he said that he had written a letter to the Chief Minister to pay the compensation immediately, as each of the farmers had invested to the tune of Rs. 1 lakh per acre. The State government had discontinued the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme and this deprived the farmers of the insurance cover. Moreover, since the State government had introduced a free insurance scheme, paying compensation was now an obligation for it, he said. Disaster management was the primary responsibility of the State and, as per Article 246 of the Constitution, ‘Agriculture including agricultural eduction and research, protection of crop against pest and prevention of plant diseases,’ is a State subject, he said. According to him, A.P. and Telangana together contribute to about 60% of the chilli crop in the country, which had an export earning potential of about Rs. 8,000 crore. Last year, about 80% of the crop was lost and under the State government’s Rythu Bharosa scheme, it was the responsibility of the State to compensate the farmers. Railway zone On the newly created South Coast Railway Zone with Visakhapatnam as the headquarters, he said he had taken up this matter with the authorities concerned, including the Railway Minister. “It is under progress and soon things will move on a faster pace and it will become operational,” he said. Mr. Narasimha Rao took exception to the comments made by a Minister on the garbage charge issue. “How can a Minister, who is an elected representative, say that if people do not abide by the new garbage collection tax, he would ask the civic body to dump garbage in front of their houses. This shows the intellect level of the elected representatives of the YSR Congress Party,” he said. Ring nets On the recent clash between two fishermen communities on the ring net issue, MLC P.V.N. Madhav alleged that because of the apathy of the State and district authorities, the peaceful fabric of the city was torn apart. He also said that the authorities concerned should compensate the fishermen, whose boats had been destroyed in the clash. On the privatisation of the Visakhapatnam steel plant, Mr. Madhav said that steps were being initiated to see that no one suffered in the deal. He lashed out at the State government for not settling the 22A issue. “This is a major issue and people are suffering as they cannot sell or even mortgage their property, notified under 22A,” he said. Former MLA Vishnu Kumar Raju said that despite the increase in drowning deaths at the beaches in the city, the authorities, including the Tourism Minister, had shown no concern. He criticised the State government for keeping on hold the inauguration of the Venkateswara temple at Rushikonda, built by the TTD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-govt-failed-to-compensate-chilli-farmers-says-gvl/article38162867.ece

Demanding that the State government renew the Vidya volunteer system, the tribals staged agitations in Paderu, Pedabayalu, Koyyuru, Ananthagiri and Araku mandals. Several protesters were detained by police for obstructing APSRTC buses at Paderu early in the morning. Some protesters also formed a human chain near the ITDA office at Paderu and stopped private vehicles. According to a member of the Andhra Pradesh Girijan Sangam (APGS), Appala Narasayya, they were seeking renewal of the vidya volunteer system, a hike in mess charges and increased scholarship amounts for tribal students keeping in view the rise in prices of essential commodities. The government should also provide 100% reservation for tribals in employment and education in the Agency areas, he added. After much delay, three months’ salary was credited to the volunteers last month, but our demand is to renew their posts, Mr. Appala Narasayya said, adding that ITDA officials have renewed posts of vidya volunteers in Srikakulam and West Godavari districts, but due to negligence of officials in ITDA Paderu, the posts were not renewed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tribals-demand-renewal-of-vidya-volunteer-posts/article38162956.ece

At a press meeting on Thursday, Mr. Murthy alleged that local YSRCP leaders had occupied lands in Survey numbers 271, 272, 273 and 255 at Sabbavaram. He alleged that even lands involved in legal disputes were being occupied and illegal constructions being done on them. He alleged that nine acres of land in Survey no. 271 and six acres in S.

Enhancing the wages by just 14.29% (fitment as suggested by the Committee of Secretaries) would impose an additional burden of Rs. 7,137 crore on the exchequer per annum, he said. Mr. Jagan advised the employees not to compare with their counterparts in Telangana. The employees might feel their arguments would gain strength if compared to Telangana. But, the ground realities were something different. The per capita income (PCI) of Telangana was Rs. 2,37,632, while it was Rs. 1,70,215 in A.P. “We have lost Hyderabad after bifurcation. Revenues of Telangana were going up while A.P. revenues are going down. These are facts.” he said. “We are talking about pay revision, but Omicron is spreading fast. We don’t know what impact it will have and how it will affect our revenues. Are we in a position to make a decision (on pay hike) and go ahead?,” he said, adding, “You (employees) should cut down your expectations a bit. At the same time, I am asking the officials to move their scale up a bit.

A ropeway would be developed across the Sharavati. The estimated cost of the construction of new facilities would be Rs. 116 crore, Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs J.C. Madhuswamy said. Located in the midst of dense forest areas in Shivamogga district, the Jog Falls, over a period of time, has emerged as one of the most favoured monsoon tourist destinations. Nearly 10 lakh tourists visit during the rainy season. The Jog Management Authority (JMA) too has been constituted to develop tourism. ULBs A sum of Rs. 3,885 crore has been given administrative approval for implementation of the Nagarothana scheme in 302 Urban Local Bodies. Under the scheme, infrastructure would be developed in city corporations, city municipal councils, town municipal councils, and town panchayats. A sum of Rs. 40 crore, Rs. 30 crore, Rs. 10 crore, and Rs. 5 crore would be given to city corporations, city municipal councils, town municipal councils, and town panchayats, respectively, during 2020-21 — 2024-25. The Cabinet approved the Jal Jeevan Mission project for ensuring piped water supply to all residents of the State and enabling the Government to borrow Rs. 1,167 crore from the World Bank. The total cost of the project is Rs. 9,152 crore. The State and Union Government would bear 45% of the cost each and 10% would be borne by local bodies. Lands The Cabinet sanctioned lands for various organisations. It sanctioned 22.36 acres to Sri Adichunchanagiri Mutt at Kabballi village in Hirisave hobli of Channarayapatna in Hassan district; five acres to Parivarthana Samaj of Bagalkote district; 0.25 acre at Seva Prerana Trust in Moodabidri in Dakshina Kannada; fives acres to Sri Siddalingeshwara Vidya Abhivridhi Trust, Hiremath, Vijayapura; and 4732.8 sq m to Sri Siddalingeshwara Samithi Trust at first phase, ‘C’ Block, J.P.

Director of Public Health (DPH) Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao said that cases might fall again by the middle of February. COVID cases started to surge in the State in the last two days. However, restrictions on movement seem to be unlikely. There have been mixed views among people about this move. The DPH said, “The Health department has advised the government to not impose any new restrictions. Along with COVID, we are worried about the livelihood of people.” When asked about why the government was reluctant to impose restrictions, and why were political parties allowed to conduct rallies when other States were imposing curbs, Dr. Srinivasa Rao said that they take action as per the guidelines issued by the Government of India. “The guidelines say that restrictions have to be imposed when the positivity is more than 10%, and when admissions go up to more than 40%. And that too decentralised restrictions,” he said at a press conference held in Hyderabad on Thursday. The current positivity rate in Telangana State is around 3.5%. When asked if they were waiting for the cases to explode, the senior Health official said that the Health department was taking all precautions and he was not the person concerned to answer this question. Political leaders were requested to cancel all kinds of programmes such as cadre meetings, public meetings and rallies for at least the next four weeks. He added that it was the responsibility of people to take all precautions against COVID spread. “Mask up, avoid unnecessary gatherings, maintain physical distancing, vaccinate and take other precautions,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-peak-in-telangana-by-january-end-says-dph/article38162669.ece

Now, we are seriously considering monitoring the demand chain as well,” Commissioner of Police C.V. Anand said on Thursday. Announcing the arrest of seven members of three inter-State ‘Class A’ drugs peddling gangs, he said that police were liberal, keeping in mind careers of the drug abusers, who were mostly youngsters. “But, now we have tightened all screws and would pursue them,” he said. With traction in demand for psychotropic substances, the police would be on hot pursuit of the users. Giving teeth to Section 27 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, which lays down the punishment for consumption of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance, the city police chief said that they will start booking cases against hardcore drug abusers. The Commissioner’s Task Force (North and West) teams led by Officer on Special Duty P. Radha Kishan Rao busted the inter-State gangs and seized 98 grams of cocaine, 45 grams of MDMA, 27 Ecstasy pills and 17 LSD blots, all worth Rs. 16 lakh in the grey market. In the first case, two persons — Imran Babu Shaik (27) and Noor Mohammed Khan (29), both residents of Mumbai, were apprehended when they were trying to peddle cocaine. The Task Force (north zone) team inspector K Nageswar Rao seized 83 grams of coke, two mobile phones and Rs. 30,000 cash, from their possession. According to Mr. Anand, Imran Babu was the deputy of one Tony, a Mumbai-based Nigerian drug peddler, who is still at large. “ To a question, the CP said they are already in touch with their counterparts in Mumbai and several useful inputs have been gathered in connection with the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/police-to-focus-on-drugs-demand/article38162680.ece

Revanth Reddy was appointed Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief, breaking his vow not to enter it again. After competing for the top post and disappointed at being denied, Mr. Venkata Reddy announced that he would stay away from Gandhi Bhavan but work in his constituency to strengthen the party. In fact, there were rumours of he leaving the party that was vehemently denied by him stating that he would remain a Congressman forever. On his first entry almost after six months, Mr. Venkata Reddy said any differences among the leaders will be settled within the party fora while dismissing his earlier vow. His visit comes in the wake of senior leader and Sangareddy legislator T. Jayaprakash Reddy stepping up his attack on Mr. Revanth Reddy, accusing him of taking unilateral decisions and ignoring the party seniors. Has the ‘cold war’ with Mr. Revanth Reddy ended was the question on everyone’s lips with the sudden and surprise visit? The discussion at Gandhi Bhavan among the party leaders was whether Mr. Venkata Reddy buried his differences with the new chief after announcing that he would never enter Gandhi Bhavan when Revanth Reddy was made the new PCC Chief. ‘Friendly fight’ A senior leader recalled that he was seen along with Mr. Revanth Reddy at a joint press confernce in New Delhi recently questioning the ‘friendly fight’ of the TRS and the BJP over the paddy crisis. “He is a seasoned leader and understands the dynamics of politics well,” a leader close to him revealed how his anger has diminished over some months. Followers of Mr. Revanth Reddy heave a sigh of relief saying his visit has poured water on the heat generated by Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy, who has been constantly targeting Mr. Revanth Reddy in recent times. “This is a good sign when we need to send a strong message that party leaders would work cohesively to take on the TRS and the BJP that have been grabbing the headlines relegating the Congress to the background.” Mr. Venkata Reddy is the senior most among the present legislators and parliamentarians in the Telangana Congress - being a four-time MLA and also serving as a Minister in the combined Andhra Pradesh. He was elected as a Parliament member in 2019 polls. He takes the credit for forcing the Congress high command to understand the gravity of the Telangana sentiment after resigning from the Cabinet in 2011 and sitting on a fast for nine days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/komatireddy-patches-up-with-revanth/article38162694.ece

Srinivasa Rao. He said that the variant was now in the community. However, he was not clear whether community transmission has begun. “When cases are surging, something is happening,” said Dr. Srinivasa Rao at a press conference in the city on Thursday. He did not elaborate on what is that ‘something’. The daily caseload on Tuesday and Wednesday were 1,052 and 1,520, respectively. However, only 10 and zero Omicron cases were detected on the two days. Stating that 70% were Omicron cases, the senior Health official said that the variant does not matter any more. No airport screening? “It cannot be stopped by testing 300-500 people at airports. According to our estimates, more than 70% cases are Omicron cases. We need not know whether it is Delta, Gamma or Omicron variant, as testing and treatment are the same. We cannot conduct genome sequencing on everybody. There is no need for it. We have to know if someone has COVID or not,” he said. Also, the daily media bulletin mentioning Omicron cases was exempted from Thursday. He said that people with Omicron variant are recovering in five days. “Around 90% of them are asymptomatic. And the remaining 10% have mild fever, discomfort in throat, cough, head and body aches,” the DPH added. People with even mild symptoms were urged to undergo tests at the nearest health centre. Asymptomatic people were asked not to get admitted to hospitals as COVID patients who need hospital care should not be deprived of beds. Private hospitals were told not to give certain medicines like monoclonal antibodies to patients if it was not necessary, and to use discretion in treating patients. They were asked to follow treatment protocol implemented at government hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/omicron-behind-surge/article38162671.ece

Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Parveen pointed out that poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar suggested in a tweet that 18-year-old Shweta Singh, one of the accused in the case, be shown compassion and be forgiven.  Ms. Parveen said that she was against this suggestion, and added that “such a counselling should be done only in jail”.  “I am angry with Javed sahab. He does not represent us. Putting up our photos and ‘auctioning’ us off is a cyber crime. Irrespective of whether the accused is an adult or minor, they should be punished according to the law. To say that they should be treated with love is fine, but counselling should be done in jail,” she said. Ms. Parveen, who is an activist and engaged in philanthropy, said that there were many people who have lost their parents, “but that does not drive them to commit crimes”.  She expressed concern that the arrest of the four accused in the case could be ‘just one layer’, and that there could be several cohorts. She hoped that law enforcement agencies would investigate the matter thoroughly. “These people are technologically empowered. It should be investigated whether there are bigger players behind this,” she added.

In a series of press conferences addressed by senior Congress leaders, including Member of Parliament Komatireddy Venkata Reddy, Congress Legislature Party leader Bhatti Vikramarka and Madhu Yaskhi Goud, the leaders said it was heart-wrenching to see the selfie video of Ramakrishna, who ended his life along with his wife and two young daughters. Viral video In the video being circulated on social media, Mr. Ramakrishna accused Mr. Raghavender of demanding that Ramakrishna bring his wife along to settle the family issue in which the MLA’s son has no locus standi. “No man would like to hear such words about his wife from a third person. I’m a common man and I can’t fight against such powerful people. Feeling humiliated I am committing suicide along with my family,” he said in the video. TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy, in a statement, asked whether Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was blind to such serious developments in the State. He said IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao, who tweets on all issues, has not even condemned the suicide leave alone promising action against the accused. Mr. Reddy demanded a judicial inquiry or probe by a senior IPS officer into the incident and also fast track court to complete the trial. He said Ramakrishna’s video clearly exposed how the ruling TRS party leaders were harassing common people to the extent that they are preferring death over humiliation. “People are helpless under TRS regime with some of them going to the extent of taking their own lives to protect their dignity and honour,” he said. Alleging that the lenience of the Chief Minister on taking action against the TRS leaders involved in crimes, he said they were fearlessly resorting to murders, kidnapping, rapes and extortion. He recalled the brutal murder of a lawyer couple Gattu Vaman Rao and Nagamani in Manthani in broad daylight, and involvement of TRS leaders in it. “They are getting emboldened by CM’s inefficiency to take action.” Mr. Bhatti said the police has not taken any action against Raghavender in the seven similar pending complaints against him. People have lost confidence in Telangana police as they have turned into the TRS cadre and this was a dangerous sign for society. He demanded that the Chief Minister call for an all party meeting on the deteriorating law and order situation in the State.  Ramakrishna’s video clearly exposed how the TRS leaders are harassing common people to the extent that they are preferring death over humiliation. A.

Mr. Singh along with party national general secretary Tarun Chugh and a host of other party leaders visited the camp office of BJP State president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay here on Thursday afternoon. Addressing mediapersons, Mr. Singh alleged that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) regime was hell bent on unleashing repression against the BJP functionaries for fighting for the cause of the aggrieved employees and teachers affected by the controversial GO 317. “Having realised the growing resentment against their dictatorial regime and unable to digest the TRS’s defeat in Huzurabad byelection, the persons at the helm in the TRS dispensation have been resorting to vengeful acts,” he charged, saying the countdown of the TRS “tyrannical” regime’s fall has begun. “Undeterred by the foisting of false cases, the BJP rank and file in the State will spearhead the fight against the autocratic and family rule in the State to its decisive end,” he said.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 05:35 IST,||Seasonal fluctuations in oriental darters’ movements being monitored||In a conservation effort to monitor seasonal fluctuations in birds' movements, the ringing of oriental darters has been taken up in the world-famous Bharatpur bird sanctuary (officially Keoladeo National Park) here after a gap of 22 years. The ringing of darters, or snakebirds, with colourful bands will help ascertain their habit of reporting back at the nests used earlier by them. Oriental darters have been classified as “near-threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Research scholar Neha Imtiyaz from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has ringed 10 darters at the bird sanctuary with the plan to study their preferences for particular aquatic habitats and identify their movements with the help of general public.  As a water bird of tropical South Asia, oriental darter, taxonomically named as Anhinga melanogaster , has a long and slender neck which looks like a snake when it swims and dives into water to catch a fish. Its sharp and long beak is helpful in puncturing the fish which it brings out of water to toss it up in air and swallow it, a scene photographers wait for hours to catch.  The darter hunts for fish while its body is submerged in water. The availability of fish in the same size for a longer period causes the bird to stay at one lake. Besides swimming in the lakes, it is often found perched on a rock or a tree branch for drying its wettable feathers.  The ringing and banding of birds, conducted earlier by the Bombay Natural History Society, was stopped in the sanctuary after it was upgraded and named as the Keoladeo National Park (KNP). Park’s Director Mohit Gupta told The Hindu that the birds had been tagged after 22 years and the exercise would make no adverse impact on the habitat’s ecology in any manner.  Mr. Gupta said the ringing was taken up earlier mostly on the migratory birds to find out their routes of flight, breeding zones and stopover sites. “The Forest Department has allowed the banding after we recommended it. The outcome of the research study on darters will be useful for the KNP management as well,” he said. Ms. Imtiyaz, undertaking research on the ecology and breeding biology of oriental darters in AMU’s Department of Wildlife Sciences, obtained plastic rings from the U.S. in bright yellow, green, blue and red colours and applied them over the thin legs of the birds. After capture, it was a matter of minutes to fix the rings and release the darters back into the nature. Abundant water An abundant quantity of water available during winter in the 290-sq-km park has facilitated good breeding of darters. Ms. Imtiyaz, who estimated that over 200 oriental darters were present in the KNP at present, said the near-total absence of darters and their nests in the water bodies around the sanctuary indicated that the national park had emerged as a “safe breeding habitat” for the bird species. Since no earlier record of the behaviour and movement of darters is available with the environmental experts, Ms. Imtiyaz’s study is the first of its kind on the near-threatened species of birds. The research scholar has called upon the bird lovers in the region to spot the darters with the coloured rings and inform her of their global positioning system (GPS) coordinates. This will involve common people in the efforts for darter conservation. The Bharatapur bird sanctuary was the first bird banding site where the overseas experts had demonstrated scientific ways of tackling birds at a conference on monitoring avian productivity and survivorship (MAPS) in 1969.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/seasonal-fluctuations-in-darters-movements-being-monitored/article38162560.ece

K. Stalin told the House on Thursday. At present, Vice-Chancellors are appointed by the Governor, in his capacity as the Chancellor of the State universities, from a shortlist of three names submitted by a search committee. Mr. Stalin’s statement came after certain remarks made by Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi. “As for the appointment of Vice-Chancellors, the Chief Minister is consulting legal experts [on amending the law]. In many States, the government holds the powers to appoint Vice-Chancellors,” Mr. Ponmudi said earlier. According to him, this was the case in Telangana. The Minister was responding to concerns over the appointment of Vice-Chancellors raised by PMK floor leader G.K. Mani (Pennagaram) during a debate on the motion of thanks to the Governor for his address to the House. In the appointment of Vice-Chancellors, “the role of the State government should be there,” Mr. Ponmudi contended, citing the case of Maharashtra which recently passed a legislation to vest more powers in the government. Citing media reports, the Minister said that in West Bengal, the State government appointed Vice-Chancellors and the Governor objected to it. This was the case in Kerala, too, he said. (Kerala is only examining the happenings in West Bengal and Maharashtra, and has not taken any decision.) “To put an end to all this, it would be better to create a situation wherein the State government could appoint the Vice-Chancellors. The Chief Minister is discussing with legal experts. A decision would be taken before the next Assembly session,” he said. Seeking the attention of BJP floor leader Nainar Nagenthran (Tirunelveli), Mr. Ponmudi said that even in Gujarat, which was ruled by Narendra Modi before he became the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister held the powers to appoint Vice-Chancellors. “Even the Prime Minister knows. So you, too, please point out,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/tn-may-clip-governors-powers-to-appoint-v-cs/article38162563.ece

Gurugram Police spokesperson Subhash Boken said the case was registered based on the complaint as received and the veracity of the allegations would be examined during the course of the investigation. “It is a legal process. Both parties would be asked to join the investigation to ascertain the facts of the complaint,” said Mr. Boken. Mufti Mohammad Saleem Qasmi, president, Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind, Gurugram, who has been named in the FIR, in a written application to the police on Thursday, said he had not issued any statement to the press or in the public domain saying that a mosque would be built in Sector 40. ‘Police assurance’ “I called on senior police officers and objected to the registration of an FIR without any preliminary investigation based on a media report. The officers assured me that they would look into the matter,” said Mr. Qasmi. Complainant Dinesh Bharti, founder, Bharat Mata Vahini, had given a complaint to the police referring to media reports that the accused had plans to build mosque on a government land. Following the complaint, a case had been registered against Mr. Adeeb and the two others on charges of provoking with an intent to cause rioting. “I was alerted by media reports about their plans to build a mosque on government land. So I gave a complaint to the police. However, there is no unauthorised construction on the two sites so far,” said Mr. Bharti, who too faces criminal charges for allegedly disrupting namaz in the open. He, however, claimed that a local resident had seen members of the minority community assemble at one of the sites at night. Maulana Abdul Hasim Kasmi, who has also been booked in the case, denied having issued any statement to the media regarding building of a mosque. “The police should have verified media reports and the complaint before hurrying up with the registration of the case. I have not issued any statement to the press,” said Mr. Kasmi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/fir-based-on-unsubstantiated-media-reports-gurugram-cleric/article38162557.ece

CM halves tube well electricity rates||In what appears to be a step taken to tackle the Samajwadi Party’s promise of providing 300 units of free electricity to domestic households and free irrigation, the BJP government on Thursday announced a 50% rebate in electricity rates for farmers and urban users who own private tube wells. The decision would benefit 13 lakh consumers, the State government said. The electricity rates would be halved for metered, unmetered and energy-efficient pumps in rural areas and metered tube wells in urban areas, the BJP government said. With the U.P. Assembly elections due to be announced anytime soon, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s decision comes on the heels of his opponent Akhilesh Yadav recently declaring that if the Samajwadi Party is voted to power, it would not only provide 300 units of free electricity to domestic households but also free electricity for irrigation to farmers. The decision to cut electricity rates for tube well users would bring an estimated additional burden of Rs. 1,000 crore per year on the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited, a government spokesperson said. The government would issue grants to the UPPCL for this financial burden. As per the decision, in rural areas the metered connection rate would fall from Rs. 2 per unit to Rs. 1 while the fixed charge would drop from Rs. 70 to Rs. 35. For unmetered connections, the fixed charge would be reduced to Rs. 85 from Rs. 170.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/eye-on-polls-up-cm-halves-tube-well-electricity-rates/article38162578.ece

The government has however hinted at tightening restrictions. The State government clarified that it has no plans of bringing restrictions on inter-district travel, neither it plans to impose a lockdown.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Tope said the State government had no plans of imposing a lockdown. “There is no plans of lockdown as of now. All we are talking about now is to tighten restrictions. But even that will happen only after the meeting and approval from the Chief Minister. We have only discussed about weekend lockdown and night curfew. But there is no decision of imposing it,” he said. The government, however, accepted that apart from citizens, a number of police personnel and medical professionals are being infected with COVID-19, which could affect health operations. “We had done this in the previous wave as well and we are doing it again. We have asked all police personnel above 55 years to work from home,” said Mr. Dilip Walse-Patil.

Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders’ Association, said the Delhi government should have consulted them prior to “implementing the restrictions”. ‘No assistance’ “Each shop will end up operating only for 10 days in a month. The crowd management is for the authorities to take care of, but there are more people gathering around a limited number of shops because of the odd-even regulation. There has been no assistance from the civic bodies,” said Mr. Bhargava. Agreed Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). “The ongoing restrictions will affect trade activities to a large extent,” he said. Mr. Khandelwal said CAIT had written to the government, calling the odd-even formula “extremely irrelevant” and suggesting that the markets be divided into zones along with a time slot allotted to each of them. “There has been no response to the letter.” The presence of illegal street vendors also draws huge crowds because the civic bodies have not assigned them hawking zones, he said. Another concern for the traders is how they would run their businesses if migrant workers leave for their hometowns in the event of a complete lockdown. Migrant workers’ woes “They have families to feed as well. How will they survive if there is no business? Everyone is aware of the problems they had to face during the previous waves,” said D.N. Rajpal, secretary of the Lajpat Nagar Traders Association. He said nearly 60% of the business has already been lost in the short span of the restrictions in the city. About the issue of illegal hawkers, South Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Mukesh Suryan said the civic body has received a list of hawking zones that will be “implemented soon”. “The problem is those migrant workers who left the city previously came back with more people to join their hawking activities. The police can stop them but fail to do so,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/odd-even-formula-ineffective-in-reducing-crowds-traders/article38162544.ece

The species diversity of birds in the same period has come down to 13 from 28.

Compared with last year, the number of bird species has fallen but the population has increased from 90 to 132. “This rise in the number is due to an increase in the number of fish in the lake. But the water quality has been degrading over the years,” said T.K. Roy, AWC Delhi State coordinator. He said about 20 years ago, the lake used to be a natural wetland habitat. “Later it was converted into an artificial and concretised lake for entertainment activities, so it lost its natural habitat and aquatic biodiversity,” WI said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sanjay-lake-losing-birds-to-pollution/article38162550.ece

A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and C.T. Ravikumar held that the High court order was “without jurisdiction and hence, it is ab initio void. Accordingly, it is set aside.” Mr. Bandyopadhyay came into the limelight when he did not attend a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kolkata in the wake of cyclone Yaas. He was issued a show-cause notice under the Disaster Management Act. He, however, resigned from service, but was subject to disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Centre. The retired civil servant had approached the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) in Kolkata against these proceedings. Following which, the CAT’s Principal Bench in Delhi transferred the case to the capital. The Calcutta High Court had intervened to set aside the transfer of the case, but not before making stinging remarks like the modus operandi of the Union government “reeks of mala fides” and the CAT Principal Bench was “overzealous” to cater to the fiat of the government and paid “obeisance to the diktat of the Union of India”. The Union had appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court to entertain Mr. Bandyopadhyay’s case when it was already transferred to Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-order-against-transfer-of-alapan-case-set-aside/article38162573.ece

Judge P.V. Sapkal of the Judicial Magistrate First Class court in Junnar taluk directed the Junnar police to investigate the matter and submit a report under Section 202 of CrPC before February 7. The court was hearing a private criminal case filed by one Madan Kurhe in July 2021. ‘Bid to exploit’ In his complaint, filed through advocate Asim Sarode, Mr. Kurhe had alleged that Patanjali Ayurved had been falsely claiming to cure COVID-19 with Coronil during the pandemic with a view to exploit the health crisis commercially. The complaint said: “It is a classic case to make everyone realise that no one is above the law and has to use the freedom of expression with restrictions and responsibilities.” The complainant has alleged offences under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating and dishonest delivery), 270 (act to spread dangerous disease), 504 (peace-breaching insult) and 34 (criminal act by several for common intention) of the IPC read with Sections 3,4 and 5 of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954. This is not the first time that a complaint has been lodged against Mr. Ramdev and Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. for making such claims. In June 2021, a first information report (FIR) was lodged by the Jaipur Police against Ramedev and four others, including Balkrishna, for allegedly conspiring to sell Coronil with the apparently misleading claim that it helped cure COVID-19 following some clinical trials. ‘Approval not taken’ The FIR said the claim had been made without securing approval from the Union AYUSH Ministry. The complaint stated that the accused had put the lives of common people at risk, and neither the Centre nor the Rajasthan government had been informed of Coronil’s clinical trials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/court-orders-probe-into-coronil-claims/article38162561.ece

The Centre has amended sections of the J&K Security Group Act-2000 and limited the SSG protection to only the current Chief Minister and his family. The previous clauses had extended SSG cover to all former Chief Ministers and their family members. Officials said based on inputs from intelligence agencies and the recommendations made in July last year, Additional Director General of Police, Security wing, has decided that “ex-CMs of J&K shall be provided security by J&K police’s security wing under ‘Z’ category with additional escorts as per necessity and assessment of the security wing”. According to an official communique, a Close Protection Team (CPT) will be provided by “suitably augmenting the security wing with trained officials, if required”. The J&K’s SSG will no longer be headed by a director of the rank of Inspector General of Police, but “an officer below the rank of Superintendent of Police”. These decisions were taken by the Security Review Coordination Committee, a group that oversees the threat perception of important leaders in J&K. The government move will take away the present elite layer of security from former Chief Ministers, including National Conference's Omar Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party's (PDP) Mehbooba Mufti. Their security will now be on the lines of what other protected politicians of J&K enjoy. It will also thin out ex-CMs’ security cover when they travel outside J&K. ‘Contempt for dissent’ “The move shows the present regime’s contempt for dissent in the country. The downgrading of security of ex-CMs took place when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party made a major issue out of a security lapse in Punjab. In Kashmir, politicians have been targets in the past and it sees violence on a daily basis. But the government goes ahead with downgrading the security of Ms. Mufti. It’s a political move,” PDP spokesman Suhail Bukhari said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/centre-withdraws-ssg-cover-to-former-jk-chief-ministers/article38162565.ece

President Xi Jinping has also not travelled out of China for close to two years, since a visit to Myanmar in mid-January 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to attend the Winter Olympics in Beijing which start on February 4. While the dates of the Pakistani Prime Minister’s visit haven’t been confirmed, an official in charge of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project said this week Mr. Khan will visit early next month.  Khalid Mansoor, Special Assistant to Pakistan’s Prime Minister on CPEC, said while unveiling a report on China-Pakistan economic cooperation that Mr. Khan wanted to “remove all bottlenecks for investors” ahead of the visit early next month, the Express Tribune newspaper in Islamabad reported.  The Chinese side had reportedly previously expressed concern about several slow-moving projects under CPEC. Mr. Khan had ordered “the removal of 37 regulations to ensure on-window operation for foreign investors”, the report said, adding that he would be “personally taking briefings on progress on CPEC projects every 15 days”. Safety of Chinese personnel has been another concern for Beijing. In July, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi travelled to China for talks with his counterpart Wang Yi for a strategic dialogue, which took place days after the death of 13 people, including nine Chinese workers, in a bus blast near the Dasu hydropower project. Mr. Wang told Mr. Qureshi then that President Xi Jinping had “put forward clear requests” to bring the perpetrators to justice. Mr. Wang also called on the Pakistani side “to further improve security protection for Chinese nationals, institutions and projects in Pakistan”, an issue that is expected to be discussed when Mr. Khan visits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/imran-khan-to-visit-china-seek-investments/article38162051.ece

Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she was “highly disappointed” that the officials attended a party on Monday night, one of whose attendees later tested positive for COVID-19. The SAR on Friday will begin implementing a raft of measures, including a 6 p.m. curfew for dining establishments and the closure of bars and gyms, after health officials said there were concerns of local transmission after months of no local COVID-19 cases. The recent local cases were traced to two members of the airline Cathay Pacific’s air crew who had violated isolation protocols. Hong Kong reported 38 new cases on Thursday, of which 5 were local cases, and the SAR currently has 348 active cases, the highest in a year. Among the 10 officials at Monday’s event was Secretary for Home Affairs Caspar Tsui, who Ms. Lam said has been sent to the government’s central quarantine facility in Penny’s Bay for isolation after having been identified as a close contact. Ms. Lam on Thursday announced that the authorities were taking a hard stand on the officials. Some of those in attendance at the party were top officials of the SAR government, including the police commissioner, head of the financial services authority and head of the anti-corruption agency. “Principal officials or other senior officials of the SAR government have to perform their respective duties in observing the rules promulgated by the Food and Health Bureau, and also watch their own behaviour,” Ms. Lam was quoted as saying by public broadcaster RTHK. “They should not be engaged in activities which will carry risks and create more work for the CHP [Centre for Health Protection] and make things more complicated.”  The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported that the party had “sparked fears of a COVID-19 cluster emerging embarrassingly within the establishment,” just as Hong Kong has called on the public to adhere to new restrictions.  Hong Kong has also banned flights for two weeks from eight countries. The measures are part of its “Zero COVID” approach to keep cases at zero through mass testing and quarantine, as well as continued restrictions on air travel and mandatary 21 days quarantine for most international arrivals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hk-minister-attends-party-sent-to-quarantine/article38162050.ece

Korea ‘tests’ hypersonic missile||North Korea has successfully tested a hypersonic missile, state media reported on Thursday, in the first major weapons test by the nuclear-armed nation this year. This was the second reported test of what Pyongyang claimed were hypersonic gliding missiles, as it pursues the sophisticated technology despite international sanctions and condemnation. Hypersonic missiles move far faster and are more agile than standard ones, making them much harder for missile defence systems — on which the U.S. is spending billions — to intercept. The missile fired on Wednesday carried a “hypersonic gliding warhead” that “precisely hit a target 700 km away”, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. The warhead also demonstrated a “new” capability, moving 120 km laterally after it detached from the launcher to strike the target, it added. “The successive successes in the test launches in the hypersonic missile sector have strategic significance,” KCNA said. Hypersonic missiles were listed among the “top priority” tasks for strategic weapons in North Korea’s five-year plan, and it announced its first test — of the Hwasong-8 — in September last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/n-korea-tests-hypersonic-missile/article38162053.ece

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 00:00 IST,||Is it right to increase the age of marriage of women to 21?||In the recent session of Parliament, the government introduced the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, to raise the age of marriage for women from 18 years to 21 years. After Opposition MPs demanded greater scrutiny of the Bill, it was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports. The government says the proposed law will ensure equal chance for women in higher education and access to jobs and help improve maternal mortality rate and nutrition levels. In a conversation moderated by Jagriti Chandra , Mary E. John and Noorjehan Safia Niaz discuss whether the Bill is welcome. Edited excerpts: Do you welcome the move to raise the age of marriage for women to 21 years in order to make it equal to the age of marriage for men? Mary E. John:The minimum age of marriage could well be the same as the age of majority, which is 18 years. If the question of equality is so critical, the age of marriage for boys should also be 18 years. But we really need to put focus on what should be the minimum age, not the right age. When I look at the government’s pronouncements, the talk is about the right age for marriage. There has almost never been a reference to a minimum age. The law should prescribe a minimum age and I think 18 years is as good as any. It should continue to be a legal presumption, and there is no reason, therefore, to raise it to 21 years. Noorjehan Safia Niaz:The main concern of this law is not so much about equality but to raise the age of marriage for women to 21 years. The law shows the way to society, right? When [the] 18 years [rule] also came in, there was some resentment to that. Whenever a law which is a little ahead of its time comes in, there will be some people who won’t like it. But the job of the law is also to show where we are moving as a society. If you look at urban metro cities, where girls are getting educated, that is one section of society that has moved ahead. And that section of society also needs certain protection by the law. But the issue here is of effective implementation of the law. Unless that improves, we are going to have problems of whether the age of marriage for girls is 18 years or 21 years. Some Muslim MPs in Parliament have called the Bill an attack on personal laws because it proposes that it will override the personal laws of Muslims, Parsis, Hindus and Christians. It also says that some personal laws will be amended, though the Muslim Personal Law is not one of them. Do you then not see this as an attempt to encroach on religious laws? NSN:If you have to really use the word ‘encroachment’ for personal laws, I would say that has been happening for the Muslim community for a long time, even before Independence. The British government brought the Shariat Application Act way back in 1937, and two years later, we had the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, which codified the divorce law and gave the right to Muslim women for divorce. Then came the 1986 Act [Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act]. Because we don’t have fully codified laws, we have had piecemeal legislation. In the 1986 Act, which came after the Shah Bano case, Parliament intervened on the demand of these very religious groups who don’t want parliamentary intervention now. The groups asked Parliament to override the Supreme Court judgment, which was in favour of Shah Bano. And then we have the triple talaq legislation where again Muslim women demanded an intervention by the state to end this practice. Look at the Hindu Marriage Act, which was codified in 1955. It includes the Sikhs and the Buddhists, who are religious minorities. So, the state recognises that each community is to be governed by their personal laws and if there are problems with the personal laws, then it steps in. The state has to be there to listen to grievances. The state has to play its role whether you are a majority or a minority. So, I don’t think this is encroachment. And if there’s a progressive law in the country, why should I be deprived of it just because I am a Muslim woman? There are laws for the Hindu community, which includes Sikhs, Buddhists and the Jains who are otherwise a religious minority. All aspects of the personal law such as marriage, divorce and custody are already codified, i.e. passed by Parliament. Christians are governed by their own personal law, and so are the Parsis. But because of the kind of politics that played out at the time of Partition, and the communalisation and the violence that Muslims  faced as a minority, the issue of family law reform always took a back seat. The process of codification of laws began in 1937 [for Muslims], and had Partition not happened, I’m sure Muslims would have had a codified law probably earlier than the Hindu community. But after India gained Independence, there was absolutely no movement towards codifying the Muslim family law till Shah Bano went to court demanding maintenance. Then, too, the legislation went against the Supreme Court judgment. So, Muslim women were again deprived of the provisions of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Of course, later on, with the Danial Latifi judgment, the damage that that law caused was subverted. But the fact remains that this law [1986 Act] was an attempt to get Muslim women out of the ambit of all legislative protections and constitutional safeguards. And till date, we don’t have a codified family law. We are in the 75th year of Independence and Muslims [constitute] 15% of the population of this country. But Muslims are deprived of the legal security which everybody else has. Our tragedy is that even 18 years as the year of marriage for girls is not fully implemented in the Muslim community. There have been contradictory High Court judgments: while some have held that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act applies to the Muslim community, others have held that it does not. The Shariat law, which is again not codified, says the age of marriage is puberty or age 15. So, where is the protection even for the 18 years of marriage that everybody else has had for so many years? And that is why we are insisting that within this current Bill, a special mention has to be made that the Muslim community will also come under its ambit. Even if tomorrow 21 years is not implemented and even if the law is as it exists today, it should be made applicable to Muslims. To that extent, an amendment is necessary. MEJ:Noorjehan has raised very important points about the sharp differences post-Partition which have been the subject of considerable debate in the women’s movement. Let us, therefore, take on board that it is not the same kind of question [for Muslim women]. But I just want to point out that if you look at the data on underage marriage, there is no difference between Hindus and Muslims. There are similar proportions of 26.6% in the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-2016) data. If anything, there’s a slightly better picture on the part of the Muslims compared to the Hindus. So, the popular conception that Muslims are always backward compared to Hindus is not true here. As far as our underage marriage data goes, the pattern is much the same. NSN:The Muslim community may be better on some of the parameters that we are discussing but the question is here of legal parity. Why are Muslims not on par with the rest of the citizens? If 18 is the age of marriage for the entire country, why should Muslim women be left behind? If polygamy is not allowed and if Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code governs Christians and Parsis, why should it be not applicable to Muslims as well? How long are Muslim women going to be suffering this, because we have been told time and again that our minority status is in danger. We have the provision of codifying our personal law to bring it on par with the society we are living in, and bring the best of provisions of the Quran. But if we don’t reform, the state will step in. The part of the community [that resists reform] will allow the state to step in. The Bill says that it aims to reduce maternal mortality rates, improve nutrition indicators and ensure access to education and jobs for women. Will a law help achieve these goals? MEJ:The claims that are being made that the nutritional status of the mother and child and maternal mortality rates will improve with the increase in the age of marriage simply do not hold up. If you look at higher ages at marriage, you will look at better data sets because higher ages at marriage correspond with better-off people with better health indicators. People who are wealthier marry at later ages. However, if you control for all these factors, and only concentrate on the factor of age, then you find that age plays the least significant role in any of these indicators. Anaemia is not affected by age at marriage and it is the cause for our terrible maternal mortality rates. Similarly, a poorly nourished woman does not become better nourished because she’s being married off three years later. And sex ratio is particularly off because States with the worst sex ratio, such as Punjab and Haryana, have higher-than-average ages at marriage. So, there is a lot of confusion here and the so-called scientific basis that is being put out by the government does not hold up. NSN:The law is necessary, but it’s not sufficient. If the commercialisation of education continues, how are the poor, especially women and girls, going to access education? If our districts, villages and smaller towns don’t have health facilities, how are women going to access various schemes and programmes? So, these need to simultaneously get addressed. Many have concerns over the manner in which the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, is implemented and used mostly to criminalise young adults who elope to marry against the wishes of their parents, and have inter-faith or inter-caste marriages. NSN:I understand there are issues. There are going to be problems. Any law when it comes into being does not play out equally for different sections of society. We are a huge country. We have different economic strata, different religions and caste compositions. And maybe that is where the courts come in and judges decide. MEJ:Existing studies show that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act is not being used to stop communities from holding underage marriages. It is being used by parents of a girl who is in a so-called elopement or love marriage that they are opposed to. So, please imagine what will happen tomorrow if the age is raised to 21. These women are not children. By the laws of the land, they are young adults who will find themselves at cross purposes with this new law whereby other adults will be able to render their relationships null and void and leave them in a complete legal limbo if not in a criminalised situation. In Nepal where the age of marriage was recently raised to 20 for both men and women, there are large numbers of young women in shelter homes simply because they’re in this legal limbo. Is this the kind of future we want the law to create for us?  Young adults will find themselves at cross purposes with this new law whereby other adults will be able to render their relationships null and void and leave them in a complete legal limbo. Mary E.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:32 IST,||The politics of a Minimum Support Price||A new election season is around. Five States (Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa and Punjab) will elect new Assemblies and Chief Ministers in the coming weeks. Parties are wooing voters with dazzling new promises. The Aam Aadmi Party leader, Arvind Kejriwal, is offering Rs. 1,000 a month to all adult women (above age 18); the Shiromani Akali Dal’s offer is Rs. 2,000 for poor women, which is matched by the Congress, in Punjab. The Samajwadi Party is promising 300 units of free electricity in Uttar Pradesh, and the Centre has extended its free foodgrain programme (the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, or PMGKAY), across the country, until March 2022. More such measures and promises can be expected as campaigning picks up. Campaigns are made of pageantry around big projects and enumeration of welfare schemes. This emphasis on redistribution corresponds with a de-emphasis on job creation in political rhetoric, the promises of which still exist but only as feeble addendums. There is a synchronous celebration of ‘job creators,’ often juxtaposed with ‘job seekers,’ by governments that subtly absolve themselves. If you cannot find a job, why not create a few? A new constituency In fact, the current wave of competitive welfarism disconnects Indian politics from the middle class that believed in, and cheerfully ushered in, a majoritarianism-market compact. A section of them may be frustrated over stunted material progress as they were during the last years of the United Progressive Alliance government. But politics is now being litigated lower down in the social and economic ladder by those who are desperate to get by. The slew of welfare schemes, which often includes a few hundred rupees in cash doles, creates a massive political constituency. Politics seems less about aspiration and more about desperation. It is easy to blame individual leaders or natural disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic for this knot. The mismanagement and the incompetence of individual leaders may aggravate it, but the fundamental puzzle is the friction between the dictates of democratic politics and market-driven development. The divergence between the principles of market economy and imperatives of a democratic society is the core dilemma of liberalism. The entrenched liberal notion that market and democracy are integral to each other is being questioned by leaders of both. For instance, in the United States, popular leader Bernie Sanders calls himself a ‘democratic socialist’, while Peter Thiel, one of its reigning capitalist moguls, fears that democracy will stall human progress and derail order. The trajectory of technological and economic progress is making this divergence increasingly stark. A conflict arises  More than the question of inequality, the conflict between the political and economic orders arises out of the shrinking ability of the latter to fulfil the basic aspirations of the masses through market mechanisms. The interests of the consumer and the investor conflicts with those of the citizen and the labour, Robert Reich points out in Supercapitalism . A politician facing the electorate has to create and protect jobs and build public amenities; incentives for job creation, if at all, are indirect and distant for the investor, who is ever looking for reducing the workforce or moving work to cheaper places and workers. Politicians are trying to restrict the mobility of capital through measures such as global minimum tax, etc. Capitalism, meanwhile, is trying to escape the planet itself, and in the interim, to free itself from state authority through technological routes such as cryptocurrencies.  ‘Jobless growth’ is accepted As the composition of the economy shifts in favour of activities that require little labour, the same amount of growth creates fewer jobs. More than a decade ago, ‘jobless growth’ had become a talking point in Indian political debates. Nobody talks about it today — not because the problem has been resolved but because everyone has accepted it as the normal. The downward trickle has become feeble. Politicians respond to this reality. For instance, Mr. Kejriwal told a gathering in Uttarakhand on Monday that he would create lakhs of jobs once in power, but it could take time. “…in the interim, we will pay Rs. 5,000 to every unemployed person.” A universal basic income is an idea that is now being discussed globally. Barons such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates support a universal basic income for the entire population in the days to come. Welfarism, redistribution This is turning the ‘there is no free lunch’ bombast (which politicians and business leaders mouthed in unison in the early 1990s) on its head. Subsidies were then rolled back, and people were asked to compete for sustenance and success. Pushed to the wall, they revolted and voted out government after government. Welfarism returned, and how. Not only that, the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act — a rural employment scheme that provides 100 days of employment/jobs a year at a minimum wage to anyone who asks for it — survived, and grew by four times between 2014 and now. It was ridiculed as a monument to the failure of the predecessor regime but today, it is the lifeline of the current regime, alongside add-ons such as free cooking gas and cash incentives to farmers. Welfarism is secular — all parties, from the Bharatiya Janata Party to the CPI(M); and all leaders, from Pinarayi Vijayan (Kerala) to Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal) to Prime Minister Narendra Modi are looking for new opportunities for compassion signalling. In Kerala, the free ration kit, last Onam, came with a sweet and vermicelli among its items. In other places, free laptops, bicycles and smartphones seem to be a part of the welfare mix. Redistribution has become critical for the survival of democratic politics everywhere — the United States or India. Smarter politicians know that men do not live by bread alone. So, several State governments in India now offer free pilgrimages! Far from outraging over the Haj subsidy, voters now have a catalogue of free pilgrimages to choose from, suitable for a range of beliefs and superstitions. A politician’s success is figuring out the minimum price to be paid to garner sufficient voter support to hold on to power, and the fundamentals of the social and the economic order intact. The threshold is not very high. Two-thirds of voters voted in India and the U.S. in their latest elections; 37% voted for the current regime in India; in the U.S., the regime has the support of more than half, which is more due to the country’s two-party system than its popularity. Political stability in democratic societies is contingent on the continuing confidence of the threshold population in the system. More generosity now Welfare schemes have created significant development outcomes in the long and short term, as experience from many Indian States over the decades shows. They were seen as the deepening of democracy. When welfare is weaponised to mute substantive political questions, its impact on democracy is less reassuring. The current generation of welfare schemes do not come as a right of citizens but as the generosity of the individual leader. Similarly, while promotion of entrepreneurship by the government is laudable, turning it into a call to the people to create jobs rather than seek them, redefines aspiration as an individual burden and responsibility. Facilitating a bargain between wealth accumulators and welfare seekers appears to have become the primary function of politics. But it is unclear whether this will remain an infinitely sustainable lubricant that mitigates the fundamental friction, and whether the state might fall back on coercion. For now, there will be free lunches, and suppers for a song. Or a vote. varghese.g@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-politics-of-a-minimum-support-price/article38162039.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:32 IST,||Extinguishing the tobacco industry’s main narrative||Tobacco is a product that kills more than 13 lakh Indians every year. The annual economic burden from tobacco use is estimated to be Rs. 177,340 crore which is more than 1% of India’s GDP. About 27 crore people above the age of 15 years and 8.5% of school-going children in the age group 13-15 years use tobacco in some form in India. There is no doubt that tobacco use is highly detrimental to public health. We have to find the ways and the means to reduce the demand for tobacco among existing as well as aspiring users. Impact of tax A large body of literature shows price and tax measures to be one of the most cost-effective measures to reduce demand for tobacco products. When tobacco products become more expensive, people either quit using them or use them less, and it incentivises many to not initiate the habit. Because it hurts both revenue and profits, the tobacco industry, globally, is always devising tactics and narratives that will pre-empt any kind of tax increases on tobacco products. The narrative of “increasing illicit trade” is something the tobacco industry has historically used to pre-empt potential tax increases on tobacco products in most countries around the world. The story is no different in India. The tobacco industry, led by ITC Limited, has maintained that the illegal cigarette trade accounts for as much as 25% of the cigarette market in India. In a recent report by the Tobacco Institute of India, a representative body of the cigarette industry, it was said that the illicit cigarette volume in India has grown by 44% from 2011 to 2019 while adding that high and increasing tax rates provide a profitable opportunity for tax evasion and encourage growth in illegal trade. Estimates by two studies In the interest of regulating tobacco use and protecting public health, it is important to examine whether there is any truth in these industry claims. When one takes a deeper look, however, it is easy to see that neither the estimates nor the methods used to derive them are backed by any transparent studies. On the other hand, there are two studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals in recent years that estimate the percentage of illicit cigarettes in the Indian market using widely accepted best practice methodology to estimate the same. The first study (https://bit.ly/3G3mzwq) published in 2018 which used a survey of empty cigarette packs collected from retail outlets across different cities in India estimated that illicit cigarettes constitute 2.7% of the market. The second study (https://bit.ly/3ETV33i) published in 2020 used tax-gap analysis to estimate that the percentage of illicit cigarettes was 5.1% in 2009-10 and 6.6% in 2016-17. Both these studies used transparent and replicable methods and their estimates of the illicit market were nowhere near the 25% figure that the tobacco industry in India has been using to influence the public discourse on tobacco taxation. The economic burden from tobacco use in India has increased by 22% in real terms over the period 2011 to 2017. There has been a 3% real decline in Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues from tobacco products in the past two financial years. On the other hand, the annual reports of ITC show their profits after tax in real terms have increased, on average, 3% every year for the past 10 years. One must also note that despite all the business diversification ITC has undertaken over the years, close to 85% of its profits still come from the cigarette business alone. Exaggerating both the scale and the extent of illicit trade has been a means the tobacco industry has used historically to advocate against tobacco tax increases. However, it is to be noted that taxes and prices are not the key determinants of illicit trade. There is sufficient evidence in the literature on illicit trade in cigarettes that shows tax increases only have a minimal impact, if at all, on illicit trade. There are several countries where tobacco taxes are quite high and yet have low levels of illicit trade, while there are also countries with high levels of illicit trade despite having relatively low tax rates. Several factors such as the quality of tax administration, the strength of the regulatory framework, government commitment to control illicit trade, the strength of governance, social acceptance, and the presence of informal distribution networks are known to play a larger role in determining the scale and the extent of an illicit market. WHO protocol The estimated percentage of the illicit market for cigarettes in India is far lower than most countries out there and well below the world average at 11.2% as estimated in a recent study (https://bit.ly/32SGhwI) on the illicit cigarette market across 36 countries. Eliminating all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products through a package of measures is one of the major objectives of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products under the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The Protocol provides the tools and the measures to eliminate or minimise illicit trade which includes strong governance, establishing an international track and trace system, and securing supply chains. India has already ratified the World Health Organization Protocol and it should now show leadership in implementing these measures to effectively address even the relatively lower levels of illicit trade. India had no significant tax increases on any of the tobacco products for the past four years since the introduction of GST in 2017 because of which tobacco products have become more affordable as shown in recent studies. There is no scientific or public health rationale not to increase tax on tobacco products for unfounded fear of increasing illicit trade. Rijo M.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:32 IST,||Glimpses into ‘forbidden’ worlds||Last week, a story of a prison maintained in a 17th century serai (inn) built during the regime of Adil Shahi took me to Vijayapura (Bijapur), about 550 km away from Bengaluru. As I was entering the historical monument where the Central Jail is located, an instruction given by a late jailor more than two decades ago came back to me in a flash. “Never make eye contact with a prisoner or you will end up in a conversation with him. And do not offer anything out of sympathy,” he had said. Though my exposure to crime reporting is limited, some assignments have taken me to prisons in the past. That was one such. It was on a chilly winter morning in 1999 that I had been marked for an event in the Bengaluru Central Prison (now converted to Freedom Park) in the heart of the city. As a cub reporter, I was excited to enter the prison precincts to get a glimpse of what life confined within the four walls looked like. As reporters were let in after a thorough check at the security gates, most reporters walked towards the area earmarked for the function. A couple of us — mostly first-timers — strayed towards the barracks. While we were walking along, a prisoner called out asking for a cigarette. Hawk-eyed, he had spotted a cigarette pack in my pocket. Without a thought, I offered one. In seconds, jail staff were rushing towards me. They not only snatched the cigarette pack, but also took me to the jail superintendent. Furious at my act, but also considerate about my inexperience, he gave me a pep talk. I was later told that the prisoner was the notorious Swami Shraddhananda, who was later convicted for the murder of Shakereh Namazi that had shaken Bengaluru back then. Years later, there was another brush — this time with a high-profile prisoner lodged at Hindalga Central Jail in Belagavi from where he called me in May 2013 fearing for his life. He introduced himself as Mohammed Fahad. Even as I jogged my memory, he said he had met me in Mysuru where I had worked earlier. It did not take me much time to realise he was the alleged terrorist of Al-Badr, who had been arrested on charges of plotting terror attacks in Mysuru. A Pakistani national, he felt his life was in danger as other prisoners had been speaking of avenging the killing of Sarabjit Singh at a jail in Lahore, which had kept emotions high in the country. He had called to seek help for protection and convey his regards to his mother who lived in Karachi. After much deliberation at the office, we decided to write a story. My colleague Afshan Yasmeen, who traced his mother, and I wrote a story that led to his transfer to another jail. But the story met with an angry response from the Prisons Department. They were upset that we had received a call from a prisoner. A few months later, I was trying to contact the then Home Minister for his reaction to a story. He did not carry his personal phone and he would speak from the phone belonging to his gunman. The reaction he gave was brief, but after the story appeared, the Minister was upset that he could not convey what he wanted to say. After I pointed out the lack of access to him, he told me that he had stopped using his personal phone after a dreaded gangster lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara had dialled him seeking help for his release. Even today this former Minister is known to not use his personal phone. As reporters we have the opportunity to meet different kinds of people and cover events that provide us wide-ranging experiences. But glimpses into “forbidden” worlds like these leave us wondering about what lies beyond our reach. sharath.srivatsa@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/glimpses-into-forbidden-worlds/article38162044.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:31 IST,||No room for complacency||India recorded its first death caused by Omicron in a fully vaccinated person in Rajasthan on the last day of 2021. The 73-year-old man, with co-morbidities, had tested positive on December 15. Preliminary evidence from South Africa and the U.K. suggests that unlike the Delta variant, a majority of people with Omicron, particularly in the fully vaccinated, exhibit only mild disease; hospitalisation is relatively less among the vaccinated. A huge percentage of the population in India was infected when the Delta variant raged last year. Studies from other countries have shown that such people might enjoy the same level or even better protection from severe disease than fully vaccinated people. Hybrid immunity achieved through full vaccination in people who have been previously infected offers the highest level of protection against severe disease, as several studies outside India show. With vaccination picking up speed after the second wave peaked in India, a significant percentage of the fully vaccinated might possess hybrid immunity. Even a single dose of an mRNA vaccine in previously infected people has been found to induce a high level of hybrid immunity. If vaccination coverage with at least a single dose has already crossed 90% in those above 18 years, the rollout of vaccines for adolescents will widen the protective net. But immaterial of the protection conferred, it is too early to draw any conclusions about Omicron’s virulence. For instance, in the U.S., the first Omicron-related death was in an unvaccinated person who was previously infected. The time lag between infection and hospitalisation should be another reason why it is too early to pronounce any verdict on the virulence of the variant in India. Vulnerable populations run a risk of suffering from severe disease despite their vaccination status. The unprecedented speed at which Omicron is spreading in countries that have high levels of testing, the number of people a single infected person can spread the virus to, and a doubling time of less than three days are a loud warning that things can go out of control soon. Mild symptoms notwithstanding, its higher transmissibility can pose a severe threat to health-care settings as a high number of infections within a short time could lead to more people needing hospital care. Overwhelmed hospitals can make it harder to provide much-needed care, leading to mounting deaths. The situation can become even more challenging when health-care settings suffer from staff shortage caused by increasing infections among health-care workers — as seen in many hospitals across India. India should learn from the hard lessons of the second wave, strictly adhere to COVID-appropriate behaviour and increase vaccination coverage. Getting misled by the mild nature of the disease and throwing caution to the wind will be a dangerous gamble.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/no-room-for-complacency/article38162034.ece

The World No.1 and a three-time defending Australian Open champion, also a vaccine sceptic, had secured a medical exemption from the Victorian State government and Tennis Australia — the sport’s national governing body — to circumvent a mandatory vaccination requirement to play at the season’s opening Major. But in a stunning turnaround, the Serb was stopped at the border control after ABF, which operates under the Australian government, deemed the evidence supporting his medical exemption as insufficient, sparking a diplomatic row. Faced with the prospect of deportation, Djokovic has now mounted a legal challenge, the fate of which will be known by Monday. Shorn of all the drama, this month could have been momentous for the 20-time Major winner as he is on the cusp of overtaking Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most Grand Slam men’s singles titles. Melbourne is his favourite hunting ground, having won an Open Era-record nine titles there. Instead, it could end in ignominy for one of the game’s bona fide greats. This is a saga from which no one party emerges with credit. In the past, Djokovic has disapproved of vaccine mandates for travel and play and has asked for everyone’s personal choice to be respected. But in a public health crisis, the exercise of free will comes with responsibilities and reasonable restrictions, a fact Djokovic has been unmindful of all along. In the present case, the least Djokovic could have done is to explain the nature of the exemption he sought, and got. The Australian public, of which over 90% of the over-16 population is fully vaccinated, was understandably furious, for it has endured some of the harshest lockdowns, missed birthdays, marriages and funerals of loved ones to limit the death toll to among the lowest anywhere in the world — around 2,300, as on Thursday. That said, for two independent medical boards, one formed by Tennis Australia and the other by Victoria, to approve a medical exemption that cannot pass muster with its own federal authorities raises considerable doubt. For Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to take a hard-line stance on Djokovic’s participation, a day after leaving the decision in the hands of the State government, indicated that he was aware which way the political wind was blowing. The centre-right government has seen its popularity slump in recent months, as it has struggled to halt the unending cycle of rising cases and lockdowns. It will be sad if Djokovic becomes a political football, whether or not he pushed the envelope.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/exception-and-exemption/article38162035.ece

Banks had implemented 83% of the total requests (76% for public sector banks and 86% for private banks) received under COVID 2.0, leading to an overall restructuring of Rs. 1.2 trillion of loans till September 30, 2021, Mr. Gupta observed. As the restructuring requests could be implemented till December 31, 2021, incremental restructuring could increase by 15-20 basis points from the current levels, Mr. Gupta opined. Restructuring demand “The third wave could revive the demand for the restructuring of loans, including loans which were already restructured,” he said. “In such a case, visibility on the performance of the restructured loan book, which was earlier expected in FY2023, may now be expected in FY2024 as the moratorium on the existing restructured loans could be extended,” Mr. Gupta added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/banks-asset-quality-at-risk-from-covid-19-third-wave-says-icra/article38162007.ece

India’s tariffs had to be compared with those of competing countries such as China, Mexico, Thailand and Vietnam, according to the report, which includes a detailed study of 120 tariff lines of electronics priority products in India and these four key competing investment destinations. These imports constitute 80% of the cost of mobile phones —India’s largest product out of the $75-billion electronics sector. “India’s tariffs have to be compared with that of competing countries. Tariff increase has an adverse effect on cost, prices, output, exports and imports.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:47 IST,||Gutsy Elgar steers South Africa home||Dean Elgar takes us to the heart of Test match cricket where guts and resilience take centre-stage. An old-fashioned warrior in the modern era, the left-hander Elgar was Captain Courageous, undefeated on 96, guiding his team to a series-levelling seven-wicket win. He built partnerships along the way as South Africa chased down 240 with plenty to spare on day four of the second Freedom Test at the Wanderers on Thursday. The series level at 1-1, the teams travel to Cape Town for a high-voltage decider beginning January 11. Fittingly, Elgar stuck the winning blow flicking R. Ashwin past the ropes. Delayed start Persistent rain meant play could get underway only at 3.45 p.m. For South Africa, much hinged on Elgar. The heavy roller was used by the host which enabled the pitch to firm up for an hour or so before the cracks became a factor again. But the cloudy weather worked in South Africa’s favour. You also need bright sunshine for the cracks to really open up. Elgar held firm, defending the good deliveries, leaving ones outside off, getting beaten from time to time and working the ball around craftily. The lanky Rassie van der Dussen gave Elgar good support. He has an interesting technique. He stands tall, has a high back-lift, but as the bowler is about to release, van der Dussen crouches. But then, he does not have a pronounced trigger movement which is good. He stroked off either foot. Jasprit Bumrah has had success bowling round the wicket to Elgar and he, once again, employed that angle. Elgar countered him with a straight blade. And when Ashwin flighted - the off-spinner was brought in to remove the southpaw - Elgar drove him past wide mid-on to reach a combative half-century. K.L. Rahul, attacking in his methods, did not keep a fielder between third-man and deep point. The bait was thrown at the batsmen. The action was engrossing. Bumrah got a delivery to kick at van der Dussen, who survived fortuitously. The batsman responded by off-driving the next delivery. He then went on to his front foot for a glorious cover-drive. Mohammed Shami replaced Ashwin and it was surprising why the in-form Shardul Thakur, who hit the cracks consistently. was not yet brought in. When Shami strayed in line, van der Dussen flicked him to the fence. And when Shami pitched short, he was pulled past the ropes. When Shardul came on, the busy van der Dussen sliced him through the cordon but the next ball was a brutish delivery that struck the batsman on the gloves. Once again the tall van der Dussen, airborne as he punched Thakur off the back-foot through covers, fought back. Shami finally ended van der Dussen’s tenure (40) with a length ball that moved away to find the edge. Costly drop The third wicket pair had added a crucial 82 runs. The action continued to be gripping. Elgar in a rare movement of aggressive intent, slashed Shami dangerously over the slip cordon. At the other end, Shardul could not latch on to a caught and bowled chance when Temba Bavuma, on zero, uppishly drove a full-length delivery. Meanwhile South Africa whittled down the target. Elgar on-drove and steered Shami for boundaries. And Bavuma, twice, crisply cover-drove Bumrah past the ropes. The captain-vice-captain duo hurt India. Elgar pulled Mohammed Siraj and dabbed the seamer past the fence. India did not have an answer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gutsy-elgar-steers-south-africa-home/article38162316.ece

As she was getting ready for another season, the 28-year-old Ankita was forced to take time off, following a positive COVID-19 test on her return from Paris. “I am looking forward to the season, starting with the Australian Open. I will have a different perspective now. It will definitely help me’’, said Ankita who could not get into the chartered flight to Melbourne in Dubai as planned, by the end of December. “I have learnt that you can’t plan all the time. At times, something completely different happens, throwing all plans in disarray’’, said Ankita, after successfully negotiating the compulsory rest, which brought her brother and mother to the Capital from Pune, to lend her support. Of course, there was no dearth of support, both physical, medical or moral, as the Sports Authority of India (SAI), her employer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and the medical teams swung into action to leave a lasting impression on Ankita. It was an unscheduled Christmas vacation for her, and she made the best of it with a lot of reading, watching television, apart from recapturing her painting skill, with the kit presented by her doubles partner Rosalie van der Hoek. Favourite tournament “It is my favourite tournament and my favourite place’’, acknowledged Ankita, about the Australian Open in Melbourne. The good start last season had given “a lot of highlights to look back, in my career’’. Ankita won her first doubles title at the $250,000 WTA level She was also thrilled to play doubles main draw in all the four Grand Slams. “I beat the former World No.5 Sara Errani in Mexico. I had returned to India from Australia, and quickly travelled to Mexico. It was a long travel. It was high altitude and the balls were flying. I didn’t have enough practice. In such a situation, to beat such a player was very satisfying. “ Coach Hemant (Bendre) sir said that he was proud of me. He rarely praises and it was very special’’, recalled Ankita. It has been a refreshing change from her “robotic routine’’, even though it left Ankita anxious for some time. “I am keen to get back on court’’, signed off Ankita.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ankita-all-set-for-australian-open/article38162380.ece

As part of this renovation works, the iconic Madras Cricket Club premises is also gearing up for a new chapter in the club’s history while retaining a connection with its past. Redevelopment The MCC was established in 1846 and recently celebrated its 175th anniversary. As it steps into its 176th year, it will have a new clubhouse as part of the redevelopment but the red coloured heritage buildings will stand as the last link between the past and the present. Karthik Rajashekar, honorary secretary of the MCC is excited about the development.  Speaking to The Hindu , Karthik said, “The old clubhouse was recently demolished and the reconstruction work is likely to start next month. Last year the club got a new state-of-the-art sports complex with two new squash courts, a gym, swimming pool and a cricket turf above the gym.  “The makeover will get the club ready for the next generation.” Whenever any international cricket match is played at the Chepauk stadium, the familiar image is of the club’s name board and the clock below. “The famous clock and the name board will be retained and we have ensured that the old aesthetics are preserved,” added Karthik. Supports other sports The club has not only remained the home of cricket but also actively supported other sports like tennis, badminton, hockey, snooker, squash and swimming. It also has some of the biggest sporting stars from across the country as members. Karthik added, “The club has also been nurturing sporting talent across various disciplines and actively involved in promoting general well-being and fitness, which we will continue to do so.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mac-stadium-to-sport-a-new-look-soon/article38162378.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:43 IST,||Khawaja comes back to haunt England||Usman Khawaja returned to haunt England with a stylish century — four years after plundering a big Ashes hundred at the same ground — as Australia took a firm grip of the fourth Test here on Thursday. Unflappable The Pakistan-born Khawaja, playing his first Test since the 2019 Ashes series in England in place of the COVID-isolated Travis Head, was at his unflappable best in compiling 137 off 260 balls to put Australia in charge after a declaration at 416 for eight. Nathan Lyon smoked Stuart Broad for six over mid-wicket to prompt captain Pat Cummins to end the innings and give Australia’s pace attack five overs at the weary Englishmen, who had toiled for 134 overs in the field. Mitchell Starc was 34 not out at the declaration, then England just about survived unscathed to the close at 13 without loss, with Haseeb Hameed and Zak Crawley both on two. But Crawley enjoyed a massive reprieve before he had scored when he was caught by David Warner at slip, only for Starc to be no-balled for over-stepping. Khawaja, dropped by England captain Joe Root on 28, made the most of his recall and was finally dismissed late in the day, giving Broad his fifth wicket. Khawaja looked set to be there at the end but an inside edge off Broad cannoned onto his stumps. He left the field to a rousing reception. “It’s special scoring my first Test hundred as a father. I was trying to look for my wife and daughter in the stands,” Khawaja said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/khawaja-comes-back-to-haunt-england/article38162016.ece

The red and golds have remained winless in the last 13 matches (including the last four matches it played in the previous season) and its interim coach Renedy Singh will have to find the right motivation that could help the side end the prolonged state of underperformance. Renedy, who has been with the side as an assistant coach since it started the ISL journey, will have to devise a good plan to keep Mumbai City FC’s famed attack in check. “I was really happy with the way the boys fought and defended in the last game [against BFC]. The only question now is when we get the ball, can we play with a little bit more confidence and that is what we all are working on right now,” Renedy said before the match. Break the drought Mumbai City, which has been nudged to the second spot by Hyderabad FC, will be desperate to get back the win that has been eluding it in the last three rounds. “We are looking at it in the context of the nine games as opposed to the last three we played. Across the nine games, we have played some good football,” Mumbai coach Des Buckingham said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bottom-placed-sceb-faces-mcfc/article38162821.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:48 IST,||Consistency the key to developing a pace pack, says Philander||Vernon Philander had this unique ability to bowl in a straight line and get the ball to seam both ways from an off-stump line.  In a conversation with The Hindu here on Wednesday, Philander, who finished with 224 wickets from 64 Tests, said “The most important thing is to execute your plans when your team needs it.”  Philander, extremely accurate, said he achieved his control with limitless practice. “I would like to perfect my skills away from the game, come fully prepared and showcase it during the match.” Particularly dangerous with the new ball, often making inroads, Philander was a handly lower-order batter as well. He said, “I could move it away across them but my most dangerous ball was the one that came into the left-hander.” And he formed a potent combination with Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. “We were a perfect combination. Steyn could swing the ball both ways at high speeds, I could seam it around and Morkel was a handful with his steepling bounce.” Philander revealed, “Importantly, we understood each other’s roles, had that understanding and communication.” Dale Steyn was the paceman he admired the most and Michael Clarke the most difficult batter he bowled at. About the present crop of South African pacers, Philander said, “We could not see Anrich Nortje in this series. He can bowl at speeds close to 150kmph, and be hostile. Had he played, we could have had a completely different series.” Philander said, “The attack is still inexperienced. Rabada has played most games. Jansen is tall, gets bounce and is slippery. He bowls a good bouncer. But you need consistency in selection for a pack to develop.” Queried about the Indian pace attack, Philander observed, “Shami’s seam position is so good. He is skiddy too and wins a lot of leg-before appeals. With a unique action, Bumrah can rough up batters with his speed and bounce. And he has a great yorker.” Philander said, “There is no weak link in this Indian attack. Siraj is good and I was very impressed with the skill and attitude shown by Shardul in this Test.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/consistency-the-key-to-developing-a-pace-pack/article38162318.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:48 IST,||SA always tough to beat at home: Dravid||Rahul Dravid’s visage couldn’t quite mask the feeling of disappointment. But then the batting legend is always sporting and gave credit to South Africa for pulling off a seven-wicket win in the second Test here on Thursday. “They are always a tough team to beat at home. If you see the first Test, there were many close moments as well. We bowled well and crucially K.L. Rahul made a hundred,” the India coach said. Dravid said it was important in these conditions for at least one batter to consolidate on the start and make a big score. “Rahul made a century in the first Test and we won. Elgar remained 96 not out here and South Africa won.” The India coach added, “Had we got 60 to 70 runs more in the first innings, it would have made a big difference. That is why we want the batters to build on starts.” Dravid had words of praise for Hanuma Vihari. “He batted well in both innings. In the first, he got a nasty ball. In the second, he batted beautifully.” About Vihari’s injury — he took a nasty blow while fielding at short-leg on day four — Dravid said, “I don’t know about the extent of the injury yet.” Dravid pointed out that the injury to Mohammed Siraj in the first innings hurt the side. “He bravely came back, put his body on the line and bowled but was not the same bowler.” The India coach added, “Siraj has not fully recovered from his injury. His fitness will be monitored going into the third Test.” On skipper Virat Kohli’s fitness, Dravid said, “The reports I am hearing about him are good. He is making good progress. He had a few runs around the ground, had a few throwdowns.” Dravid said, “We knew 240 was difficult to defend but believed it was a competitive score. We’ve got to seize the key moments in the game.”  We know Rishabh is a positive player and he plays in a particular manner which has gotten him success. Yeah, of course, we will have a level of conversations with him, it is just about the timing of that shot Dravidon Pant’s rash shot||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sa-always-tough-to-beat-at-home-dravid/article38162320.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:48 IST,||Djokovic denied entry into Australia||Tennis World No. 1 Novak Djokovic fought against deportation from Australia on Thursday after the government revoked his visa for failing to meet COVID-19 vaccine-entry requirements. At detention facility The vaccine-sceptic Serb was stopped by border officials on arrival in Australia late on Wednesday and denied entry into the country. He is currently being held at an immigration detention facility here and faces deportation. Djokovic had flown into the city’s Tullamarine Airport expecting to defend his Australian Open crown, and to bid for an unprecedented 21st Grand Slam title. He had claimed on Instagram that he had obtained an exemption to play in the tournament, which begins on January 17, without being vaccinated. But instead of a conquering champion’s return, Djokovic never made it past border control. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Djokovic had failed to provide officials with evidence of double vaccination or an adequate medical exemption. “Rules are rules and there are no special cases,” Morrison said. Australian border officials questioned the star and revoked his visa citing a failure to “provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements”. Djokovic’s lawyers are now arguing in court, hoping to prevent his deportation. News that Djokovic had received an exemption to arrive in Australia without being vaccinated was met by public outcry. But the Serb’s treatment on arrival prompted fury among his fans and a fiercely worded diplomatic rebuke from Serbia’s president. All participants at the first Grand Slam of 2022 must be vaccinated or have a medical exemption, which is granted only after assessment by two panels of independent experts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-denied-entry-into-australia/article38162323.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:48 IST,||Jemimah and Shikha miss out||Jemimah Rodrigues and Shikha Pandey were the notable omissions in the Indian squad announced on Thursday for the Women’s One-Day International World Cup to be held in New Zealand from March 4 to April 3. Batter Jemimah and seaming all-rounder Shikha last played an ODI on India’s tour of England in July. Jemimah had forced her way back into the T20 side after her splendid run in the inaugural Hundred in England, and had done fairly well on her return in the recent series in Australia, but that didn’t prove enough to win the flight ticket for New Zealand. The selectors have rewarded the seam-bowling trio of Pooja Vastrakar, Renuka Singh and Meghna Singh for their fine show Down Under. Jhulan Goswami will spearhead the seam attack under the captaincy of Mithali Raj. Two players that have not yet made their ODI debut — batter Sabbhineni Meghana from Andhra and seaming all-rounder Simran Bahadur from Delhi — have been named stand-bys, along with veteran left-arm spinner Ekta Bisht. The three are also included in India’s team for the one-off T20I against New Zealand; Harmanpreet Kaur will lead that team. The T20I will be played at Napier on February 9. It will be followed by a five-match ODI series, from February 11 to 24.  The squad for World Cup and New Zealand ODI series: Mithali Raj (Capt.), Harmanpreet Kaur (Vice-Capt.), Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Yastika Bhatia, Deepti Sharma, Richa Ghosh (wk), Sneh Rana, Jhulan Goswami, Pooja Vastrakar, Meghna Singh, Renuka Singh, Taniya Bhatia (wk), Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Poonam Yadav. Stand-bys: Ekta Bisht, Sabbhineni Meghana and Simran Bahadur.   For the T20I: Harmanpreet (Capt.), Smriti (Vice-Capt.), Shafali, Yastika, Deepti, Richa (wk), Sneh, Pooja, Meghna, Renuka, Taniya(wk), Rajeshwari, Poonam, Ekta, Sabbhineni and Simran.   India’s schedule: March 6: vs Pakistan; March 10: vs New Zealand; March 12: vs West Indies; March 16: vs England; March 19: vs Australia; March 22: vs Bangladesh; March 27: vs South Africa.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:43 IST,||Harmeet Desai claims second successive zonal crown||Harmeet Desai was initially flummoxed a bit by Manush Shah’s game. An aggressive player on both flanks, Manush, struggling with stomach issues the previous night and having his movements restricted, played an unusual game employing more spin and trying to slow down the game and attack occasionally. However, Harmeet decoded Manush’s tactics just in time to clinch his second straight zonal title with a 4-3 (1-9, 11-8, 8-11, 7-11, 6-11, 11-6, 11-5) win over his Gujarat mate in the men’s final of the UTT National-ranking Central Zone table tennis tournament here on Thursday. Diya Chitale’s game is a viewer’s delight. The 18-year-old doesn’t defend and largely attacks irrespective of any situation. Playing against an equally attacking paddler in Reeth Rishya, Diya out-hit her senior opponent 4-3 (7-11, 11-7, 8-11, 12-10, 7-11, 12-11, 11-8) to bag her maiden women’s title of the season, after two previous semifinal appearances. Explaining the strategy he used, Harmeet said: “He (Manush) played a different game, blocking a lot which is not his usual game. But after the first two sets, I opened him up and that worked.” Diya was excited. “It is a great confidence-booster to end the ranking season on a high,” she said.  The results: Men: Final: Harmeet Desai (PSPB) bt Manush Shah (Guj) 11-9, 11-8, 8-11, 7-11, 6-11, 11-6, 11-5; Semifinals: Manush bt Ronit Bhanja (AAI) 11-9, 11-5, 11-8, 5-11, 12-10; Harmeet bt FRS Snehit (TS) 8-11, 11-8, 11-8, 11-7, 11-8.   Women: Final: Diya Chitale (Mah) bt Reeth Rishya (PSPB) 7-11, 11-7, 8-11, 12-10, 7-11, 12-11, 11-8; Semifinals: Diya bt Sreeja Akula (RBI) 8-11, 11-8, 8-11, 10-12, 11-7, 11-3, 11-4; Reeth bt Lakshita Narang (Del) 11-6, 11-7, 9-11, 10-12, 11-7, 11-3.   Youth U-19 Final: Boys: Ankur Bhattacharjee (Ben) bt R. Deepit Patil (Mah) 11-5, 3-11, 11-5, 12-10, 4-11, 11-9.

The third event of Asian Tour’s 2022 schedule, the tournament will be held from March 24 to 27 at the Delhi Golf Club course. DGC’s last Asian Tour event was the Panasonic Open in November 2019. Possible field Though the Delhi Golf Club President Manjit Singh was understandably non-committal about the entry-related details, considering these were still early days, he did mention a possible field of 132 players, provided the rising third wave relented. A strong field of Indians is obviously expected in the given circumstances. However, relevant Travel Advisories are likely to play a role in how the regulars from the Asian Tour respond to this first-time event on the Tour. This will also be the richest prize-money event, outside the joint-sanctioned events on the European Tour and Asian Tour, seen in over 25 years at the DGC. It matches the prize-fund offered in the 1995 Gadgil Western event. Coincidentally, the winner of that event, Gaurav Ghei, along with two-time Indian Open champion Ali Sher, was present at the announcement. This will also be the first dollar-event on the Gary Player-redesigned course, following the changes made in 2019. Gary Player, winner of nine major titles, sent a video message and shared his joy at the announcement of a Tour event on the renovated course. Asian Tour’s Commissioner and CEO Cho Minn Thant also shared a video message expressing his delight at the new event on the Tour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/asian-tour-makes-a-return-to-india/article38162374.ece

Valskis had a successful stint with Chennaiyin in the 2019-20 season when he scored 15 goals and won the golden boot award to help the side finish as runner-up. However, for the 2020-21 season, he moved to Jamshedpur FC along with the then CFC manager Owen Coyle and did well scoring eight goals. This year, however, he has played only six matches for JFC with just two goals to show for before he decided to return to CFC. Excited and happy Commenting on the transfer, Valskis said, “I am excited and happy. The people around the club — players, the management staff have given me a warm welcome. I feel comfortable and ready to go and make something special this season.” Valskis also revealed he was not comfortable at JFC, “They knew I was not happy with the performance and style of the team, but still kept me in the summer. In the end, we managed to find a solution in January and I am happy to be back with Chennaiyin.” After nine matches, the two-time champion is fifth on the points table with 14 points and has struggled to score goals and a lot rests on the Lithuanian striker to provide the attacking firepower. Sharing his assessment of CFC’s season so far, Valskis said, “They are compact in defence. I think what I can help in this style is to be more clinical in attack in the final third and be more patient to find the best solution in the last pass.” Creating chances He added, “The team is playing well and creating chances. When you don’t create chances is when there are problems. We have a good group of players and I believe we can do something special. We just have to be patient.”  I feel very comfortable and ready to go and make something special this season — Valskis||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/valskis-returns-to-chennaiyin-fold/article38162431.ece

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:52 IST,||COVID-19 hit Bundesliga set to resume||While Bundesliga players enjoyed their winter break, the coronavirus took none. The German league will resume in a depleted state on Friday, when defending champion Bayern Munich will struggle to field a competitive starting line-up against Borussia Monchengladbach — a team that trounced Bayern 5-0 when they last met in the German Cup in October. But Gladbach will be depleted, too. Joe Scally, Mamadou Doucoure, Denis Zakaria and Keanan Bennetts were all in quarantine this week after testing positive for COVID-19. Bayern had nine players as well as assistant coach Dino Toppmoller in quarantine this week because of coronavirus infections. With Bouna Sarr and Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting away at the African Cup, Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann only had 12 outfield players for Friday’s game, as well as goalkeepers Sven Ulreich und Christian Fruchtl. Of those 12, Leon Goretzka, Niklas Sule and Serge Gnabry had injury concerns. Under new rules agreed to by the clubs at the start of the pandemic, the German soccer league can approve a request to call off a Bundesliga game if one of the teams has fewer than 15 available players, including at least one goalkeeper. Despite the coronavirus outbreak, Bayern leads the Bundesliga by nine points at the halfway stage and is favoured to wrap up a record-extending 10th consecutive title. Nagelsmann called up 16-year-olds Arijon Ibrahimovic and Paul Wanner to help cover the absences. If either make their debut against Gladbach, they will take over from Jamal Musiala as the club’s youngest player to appear in the Bundesliga.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/covid-19-hit-bundesliga-set-to-resume/article38162371.ece

In the fourth minute, V. Suhair’s pass after a run in the midfield found Deshorn Brown, who beat his marker Peter Hartley first and then the JFC ’keeper Pawan Kumar. Jordan Murray made amends for a miss in the first half, heading home in the 44th minute off a Greg Stewart free kick. JFC doubled its lead in the 56th when Boris Singh, after getting the ball from a Provat Lakra deflection off a Murray cross, left the Highlanders’ defence completely exposed. Brown dribbled past Pawan to make it 2-2 in the first minute of stoppage time when Pandita, the super sub, who had come in for Murray, received the ball from fellow substitute Alex Lima to net the winner. JFC is third in the table with 16 points from 10 games, level with leader HFC and MCFC (nine matches). NEUFC remained second from bottom with eight points from 10 matches.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:42 IST,||African Cup wears open look||Africa’s showpiece Cup of Nations kicks off in Cameroon on Sunday against a backdrop of controversy over player call-ups, the tournament’s timing, the host nation’s readiness and the possibility of widespread COVID-19 infections. Yet what is not clear is who is likely to be crowned the continental champion after the final on Feb. 6, as a multitude of prospective winners make it likely that the tournament will maintain its tradition for rarely delivering on the form book. Algeria goes into the tournament with a lengthy unbeaten run, including the triumph at the last edition in Egypt in 2019. Led by Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez, they have been rarely stretched over the last 24 months but the rigours of tournament competition, plus the tough conditions in Cameroon, will provide a severe examination. Not up to the mark Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia are the other North African countries who are perennial contenders but have disappointed in recent editions. Morocco, in particular, has gone into recent tournaments heavily fancied but has proved unable to live up to its billing. West African giants Ghana, Ivory Coast and Nigeria are all past winners with high hopes, but have not been convincing of late. Nigeria fired its coach Gernot Rohr last month, unhappy with their form despite the fact it has won its World Cup qualifying group. Hosts Cameroon has been even less convincing, but a home win over the Ivorians in the World Cup qualifiers in November was a massive morale boost and has now placed a burden of expectation on their shoulders. That leaves Senegal as the team with the best credentials. It was the runner-up in 2019 and has strengthened the squad since, persuading several French-born players with Senegalese roots to join their side. Liverpool’s Sadio Mane could play a key role in helping the country to its first Cup of Nations triumph. All contenders will be hoping to avoid any outbreaks of COVID-19, which might impact on their chances. Impact of pandemic Preparations for most countries, over the last fortnight, have been hit by players returning positive tests and having to go into quarantine. Squad sizes have been increased from 23 to 28 to allow for the potential impact of the novel coronavirus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/african-cup-wears-an-open-look/article38162370.ece

He said later about taking all those painful blows on the body while batting on a spicy pitch, “Some may call me stupid, others may call me brave. But when I play for my country, I put my body on the line. Nothing else matters.” Elgar rated this innings among the three of his best knocks. “I don’t play for accolades, I don’t play for personal milestones, I always play for the team,” he said. The South African said he had always wanted to lead from the front. “Right from my school days, I wanted to do that. It makes it easier for the others to follow in your footsteps. “This is a young side. For many of them, it is their first Test victory. They know the significance of the occasion. I want to celebrate with them,” he said. Terming it a team effort, Elgar said, “We bowled very well and if you look at the chase, apart from my knock, there were many valuable contributions.” About Kagiso Rabada’s red hot spell on day three that opened up the game, he said, “I had a word with KG. He’s our most experienced bowler. I wanted the best from him.” This Elgar is tough as nails.  This is a young side. For many of them, it is their first Test victory||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/elgar-hails-team-effort/article38162321.ece

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:46 IST,||For the love of a dram||If you are Indian, you probably associate whisky with uncles, duty-free shopping and boisterous wedding dinners.  India’s most popular alcohol, whisky, was seen as a bar staple for older Indian men for decades. According to market research platform Statista, the average consumption of whisky per capita in India stands at 2.6 litres. However, not all whiskies are created equal. There are single malts, blended whiskies, corn-based, rye whisky, and the rise of the Indian single malt, led by Amrut, Paul John, Rampur and more recently Kamet that has in recent years won hearts and awards across the globe. As a younger and more diverse Indian drinking population samples the spirit, it is undergoing a drastic image makeover led by trendy whisky clubs around the country. At the Dram Club in Mumbai, women who enjoy their malts are at the heart of the events. “For us, the co-founder, Swati Sharma, being a woman probably broke barriers” says Vinayak Singh, co-founder of the club that began in March 2019. The group launched an app in 2021, with aggregated information on a cornucopia of whiskies — from expressions of a brand, to city-wise price lists, personalised recommendations and ultimately a delivery platform for single malts and whiskies, to generate revenue. With over 3,500 subscribers, the Dram Club offers free membership, with a fee ranging from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 5,500 per event, based on the type of spirit, food and event location. Vinayak relishes the opportunity to conduct blind tastings: “Our members discovered they preferred Paul John to some Scottish staples. We also enjoy Kamet and Blue Label’s Ghost and Rare, a limited edition blend from Johnny Walker,” he says. Pooja Vir, who attends these events, concurs with Singh. “I began enjoying whisky during my time in London. When I moved back to India in 2017, I started a club called the whisky Ladies of Mumbai, but two years ago switched to The Dram Club. The events offer an avenue to sample really expensive bottles before investing in them.” The Single Malt Amateur Club (SMAC) in Bengaluru has the distinction of working with Amrut and John Distilleries in India, to bring out exclusive bottles for club members, the Amrut Amaze and Cask No.6028 respectively. Offering free membership and a fee per event, the club was started in 2011, and now has over 4,000 members. “The landscape of whisky appreciation has changed dramatically in the past three years, as evidenced by an uptick in our membership by about 30% since 2019, with members primarily in the 32-plus age group,” says founder Hemanth Rao. As SMAC partners with Indian single malts to provide members with exclusive offerings, Hemanth says the provenance of quality malts from India has helped push the popularity of whiskies. “Amrut and Paul John have moved the needle and now there is a turn inwards as Indians embrace new malts.”  Explaining how they kept members engaged through the pandemic, he adds, “while we couldn’t replicate the joie de vivre of a live event, we did sessions on peripheral subjects like the perfect glassware for single malts, whisky auctions, industry trends etc.”  Now Hemanth is introducing members to their own blending experiments in custom American white oak ageing barrels, in three- and five-litre capacities, ranging from Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 17,000 and one can even choose from ex-rum or ex-port barrels that lend the blends a fruity character on the nose and palate. “Today Indians want to experiment, and they enjoy their whiskies very differently from their parent’s generation,” says Nikhil Agarwal, who curates experiences at All Things Nice, a luxury wine and spirits consulting agency. While most events are hosted in Mumbai, Agarwal, who conducts a course in the Fundamentals of Scotch Whisky in association with the Edinburgh Whisky Academy, has taken his love and learning of the spirit to Singapore and Hong Kong as well. All Things Nice has even paired whisky with poetry, music and art at events. In Kolkata, The Calcutta Malt and Spirits Club, has grown from a cosy 20-member club in 2010, that originally met at the Tata Steel Room within the premises of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, to a club that has now added over two score to the fold, and meets at restaurants across the city. Subhasis Ganguli, one of the founding members, says, “We are a not-for-profit group. I lead the tasting with some history of the single malts — the region, age, character, cask style and flavour profiles.” He adds that members pick up different age expressions of brands like Inchmurrin, Tomatin or spirits from the Speyside in Scotland when they travel, or from the Whisky Exchange in London. The highlight of the club’s dossier of experiences was a ‘smoke-based’ tasting. Smoky malts accompanied tandoori fare: the salty unctuousness of bacon complimented the Caol Ila. Lamb shanks went well with the 14-year Lagavulin, and Oban’s light touch married well with briny notes from smoked fish. Julieann Fernandes, master blender at South Africa- based Distell Group says, “whisky is beginning to find favour with millennial drinkers in India. More experiential activation is helping with driving traction amongst this younger generation as well — pop up events, bar takeovers, tastings, and DIY cocktail sessions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/for-the-love-of-a-dram/article38162299.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:43 IST,||Supervillain tales||“After Minnal Murali ’s premiere, someone in the audience walked up to me and asked, ‘Can I hug you?’” Guru Somasundaram says, breaking into a laugh. Life has changed overnight for him after the film dropped recently on Netflix, with his performance being widely appreciated.   There is a child-like joy in Guru as he talks about the film. “I generally don’t watch my movies. In fact, I rarely check the monitor after giving a shot. But when I started working on Minnal Murali , I felt it was going to be special. I watched it with the whole team before the premiere and I was shocked. It was as if I had been struck by lightning, just like my character in the movie,” he laughs.  The film, set in a village called Kurukkammoola, revolves around two men — Jaison (Tovino) and Shibu (Guru), who are struck by lightning on the same night. Both gain superpowers and circumstances pit them against each other. Unrequited love and society’s indifference to his plight make Shibu an embittered man. In Basil’s words, Shibu is the “second hero” and not the villain. Changing phase  Basil and his team met Guru in 2019 to discuss the project. “He narrated the full script, playing the background music on his phone! I didn’t expect that I would get to do so much; I was prepared for the physical and emotional transformation of the character. Things went on to another level once I started shooting,” says Guru, who made his debut with Thiagarajan Kumararaja’s cult Tamil film, Aaranya Kaandam .  The first step to becoming Shibu, says Guru, was learning Malayalam. He took lessons from YouTube and can now read and write the language. “I believe that it is important for an actor to learn the language to portray the emotion. It was also about establishing a bond with every one on the set. Knowing the language helped my performance,” he says.  He also watched Malayalam movies to pick up the language. “I saw many movies of Sreenivasan sir, such as Nadodikattu, Angane Oru Avadhikalathu, Akkare Akkare Akkare… One movie I watched multiple times was Njan Prakashan . It had simple dialogues,” says Guru, who has also acted in critically-acclaimed Tamil films Jigarthanda (2014), Joker (2016) and Jai Bhim (2021).  Guru believes he owes it all to his decade-long association with Chennai-based Koothu-P-Pattarai, a prominent contemporary Tamil theatre group. “I grew up in Madurai, and watched a lot of movies in my childhood. Becoming an actor was the last thing on my mind during my growing-up years because I was shy. I took up a job after finishing my studies. However, after a point, I felt lost. Once I joined Koothu-P-Pattarai, I fell in love with theatre.” Theatre gave him the confidence to improvise. “It is like blowing a balloon to its maximum capacity. You have to ensure that it doesn’t burst, though. Similarly, I improvise without changing the crux of the scene." Coming up  Guru is elated that he is acting in Mohanlal’s directorial debut, Barroz in February. His upcoming Malayalam release is Abhilash S Kumar’s Chattambi , along with Sreenath Bhasi and Chemban Vinod.  His dream is to do a full-length comedy role. “Many people have told me that I remind them of Nagesh sir. He was a fabulous character artiste even though we have seen him more in comedies," he adds. Does he have a favourite villain-actor? “Raghuvaran sir. I believe that a villain has to have some honesty about him,” he says, adding, “A Brazilian theatre artiste once observed that heroes in our films usually remain good and villains are always bad. According to him, there should be a mix of good and bad in the characters. Raghuvaran sir’s villain roles have that blend. I like to play such characters.”  I believe that it is important for an actor to learn the language to portray the emotion. Knowing Malayalam helped my performance Guru Somasundaram||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/supervillain-tales/article38162273.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:44 IST,||Bringing back the melody||Earlier this year, Ravi G started a musical series on Instagram titled Home Jam , in which he presented covers of many underrated 90s Tamil film songs. One of those — a cover of ‘Porkalam’ from Tenali — attracted the attention of many, most notably music composer Anirudh who commented: ‘Thank you for this. From RaviG Fan club president.’   Spurred by Ravi's work, the composer soon called him for a recording. That number, a melody titled ‘Naan Pizhai' ( Kaathuvaakula Rendu Kadhal ), is the latest talk of the town, clocking more than three million views within a couple of days of its release and trending on music charts.  “The response has been unimaginable,” says Ravi, who has crooned along with Shashaa Tirupati, “What’s most heartening is that it is a melody, which itself is a difficult proposition for composers to churn out in this age of fast-paced peppy numbers. The opportunity to explore such melodies in the film music space is scarce. The first time I listened to the track version, I had goosebumps. That it has clicked with audiences is great news for musicians.” Starring Vijay Sethupathi and Nayanthara, the song is written by the film’s director Vignesh Shivan.  Thirty-three-year-old Ravi got his first film break through a 2015 Anirudh composition in Ajith-starrer Vedalam, and subsequently worked with Sean Roldan as a music producer. His recent songs include ‘Boomikkku’ from GV Prakash’s Jail .   Ravi hails from a musical family; his uncle plays the mridangam while his grandfather is a Carnatic vocalist. He picked up the mridangam when he was barely four, and slowly got interested in vocals. “At home, there were a lot of music classes to students, and I'd pick up things just listening to those lessons.” When he was 15, he learnt the keyboard and went on to play in various live shows and music productions. Currently busy with producing contemporary devotional and fusion music outings, Ravi’s work was also recently showcased in the Perumal and Providence project, a production that gave a modern twist to Carnatic kritis .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bringing-back-the-melody/article38162275.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:44 IST,||Season’s on the wing||The Malabar whistling thrush, a song bird of the Western Ghats, whistling a melodious tune perched on a tree is a familiar sight in Valparai near Coimbatore. Forested areas are aflutter with high-pitched sounds of the wispy little greenish warbler that goes sti-ti-ti-ti-ti-si... and the guttural teekteek of the Indian blue robin. “Instead of stepping out as a group, school students in and around Valparai will identify and record every bird they hear and see at their homes during the upcoming Pongal Bird Count,” says K Selvaganesh, a school teacher in Valparai who actively takes part in birding every year.  The Pongal Bird Count (PBC) that happens from January 14 to 17 is an annual bird monitoring programme where people across Tamil Nadu observe birds for a minimum of 15 minutes and upload the sightings on an online platform (ebird). The event is coordinated by the Tamil Birders Network and Bird Count India. Over the Pongal weekend, Coimbatore Nature Society (CNS) plans to survey as many as 30 wetlands in Coimbatore. In Tamil Nadu, PBC, the Asian Waterfowl Census (AWC) that starts on January 1, and the Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC) that begins during the second week of February are some of the big birding events. “These events are observed around the world and citizens are encouraged to go birding. These serve as massive data generation activities for scientists interested in studying bird populations,” says PB Balaji of CNS. This year, CNS takes part in the activity as part of both AWC (which they have been associated with since 2014) and PBC. “These exercises are done in a synchronised manner across different wetlands involving a number of bird watchers. This gives us a fair indication of the status of the wetlands. Last year, AWC data revealed that the migratory bird population is in sharp decline in the recent years. The PBC’s objective is to engage birdwatchers across Tamil Nadu who would be free during the Pongal weekend,” explains Balaji P Jeganathan, a bird enthusiast who is part of Tamil Birders Network, draws a parallel to the holiday tradition of the annual Christmas Bird Count in the US, where birders start counting birds in the neighbourhood. “It’s Kerala’s annual Onam Bird Count that encouraged us to go birding during Pongal. We want to promote the culture of birding as a family activity,” explains Selvaganesh. Birds in your backyard The Pongal Bird Count that started in 2015 has seen a steady increase in number of participants over the years. Last year, 400 people from Tamil Nadu took part. “Instead of staying glued to gadgets, this is a great way to connect with Nature. Many know of birds that come from Africa and Australia but are not aware of birds in their own backyard,” adds Jeganathan. One can catch a glimpse of migratory birds like the brown shrike that come from Japan and the blue-tailed bee eater from Europe and Russia, as well as birds like Indian pita, paradise flycatcher, grey wagtails, and ashy drongos that come from central and northern India and the Himalayas. And, the resident ones like the endemic Nilgiris flowerpecker, and black and orange flycatcher, to name a few. Besides a snapshot of birds that frequent an area during that particular time of the year, the data also helps study abundance and distribution of birds in one’s locality. Health of wetlands Birding enthusiasts in Puducherry hope that the rarely spotted baillon’s crake, a small water bird from Europe and other birds of prey like the pied harrier and peregrine falcon keep their date during the PBC. They plan to cover 50 lakes (of the total 86 lakes in Puducherry) in four days. “We club it with the AWS and visit as many wetlands as possible where we also assess the health of wetlands and the threat they face from plastic waste, encroachment, poaching, and pollution,” says Surendhran Boobalan of Sutrusoozhal Kalvi Kazhagam in Puducherry. Besides migratory birds like garganeys, ducks, northern shovellers, godwits and terns, they also observe urban birds like house sparrows, house crows and mynahs. This year, a total of 38 district co-ordinators in Tamil Nadu, and two in Karaikal and Puducherry will guide beginners in bird watching while sticking to COVID-19 safety precautions. Adds Selvaganesh, “A healthy bird population always indicates a thriving biodiversity and a healthy environment.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/seasons-on-the-wing/article38162284.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:45 IST,||A bitter-sweet tale of growing up||A sea of emotions engulf viewers as film director Shyamaprasad evocatively adapts Anees Salim’s novel The Small-Town Sea for the big screen as Kasiminte Kadal (Kasim’s Sea). Kasim’s loneliness tugs at the heart even as his child-like joys evokes nostalgia.   Reputed for his ability to capture the dynamics of interpersonal relationships on screen, Shyamaprasad transcreates literary worlds to the screen without losing the essence of the work. He wanted to adapt The Small-Town Sea as a movie as soon as he read the book, which is about love, loss and longing as seen through the eyes of a teenager. Anees agreed to the adaptation of his novel for a film. But for some minor clarifications the director wanted from the author, the director was given a free hand in writing the screenplay.  In a director’s note about the film, Shyamaprasad states: “To me, Kasim’s tale is a bittersweet one — of growing up, dealing with bereavement, getting lost and finding one’s way back home. I wanted the film to be a simple narrative of hidden joys and tender sadness....Though our stories might not always save us, most of us sit under their shade, looking at the sea, listening to its roar, which is sometimes sweet and music to us, waiting for its next inevitable swell.”  The director says the book’s protagonist reminded him of Satyajit Ray’s Appu in Pather Pachali and his travails but in a different setting. As Kasim’s father Salim uproots the family to spend his last days in Varkala, Kasim (Tashi Shamdat) discovers new joys and friends even though he hankers for their previous life in Kochi.  Adapting a literary work “As soon as a literary work is taken up for a film adaptation, it becomes the director’s perspective. In this case, I have given a name to the nameless protagonist of the book and also set it in the beachside town of Varkala, although the author has not named the place anywhere in his book. Kasim is only 11 years in the film,” says Shyam.  As Shyamaprasad was shooting in sync sound, he decided to cast local residents to get the dialect right. But for Harish Uthaman, who plays Salim, most of the other characters, including Kasim’s friend Bilal (enacted by Niranjan), who won the Kerala State Film Award for the best child actor, were cast after extensive auditions. “We held workshops for people to familiarise themselves with the camera and sync sound. Casting director Saji Thulasidas, an alumnus of the School of Drama, is from Varkala and helped us in finding the right people.”  Finding the location that resembled the one in the book proved to be difficult and the heavy rain had eroded the cliff on which some of the shooting had been done. “It proved to be a blessing in disguise. During the erosion, one of the smaller cliffs had crumbled in the middle and we depicted that as the entrance to the ‘secret beach’ in the book,” says Shyamaprasad.  Like his previous film Oru Njayarazhcha , Shyamaprasad has composed the background score of Kasiminte Kadal .   Produced by TS Jayakumar and Gireesh Uthaman along with co-producers Manoj Narayan (also the cinematographer) and Shyamaprasad, Kasiminte Kadal is also an ode to the joys and difficulties of growing up in a small town where everyone knows each other and has an opinion about someone else’s life.  Sea of emotions  How far is Kasiminte Kadal from Ore Kadal (2007)? “Not very far. It is the same sea where the waves can be calm or tempestuous. It can also symbolise the mind, always in motion, moving with the swell and ebb of our lives.”  Surprisingly, this film, rooted in the culture of Kerala, was left out of the International Film Festival of Kerala. The director feels that stories that do not have an overt political statement to make on contemporary subjects or is not laced with humour are losing their space in cinemas. “Movies on existentialism and the simple joys of life don’t seem to be valued. We must understand that some of Indian cinema’s classics that have stood the test of time did not always have a loud, obvious political theme. Instead, they showed vignettes of life in India which also made political statements.” He feel that cinema, as a medium of art, must reflect the joys and sorrows of life, in addition to protests and political statements.  The director is currently working on the post production of a film based on littérateur MT Vasudevan Nair’s short story Kazhcha , starring Parvathy Thiruvothu and Kalamandalam Saraswathi, MT’s wife. ‘Kazhcha’ will be a part of a 10-part featurettes directed by reputed directors in Malayalam cinema, like Santosh Sivan, Jayaraj, Priyadarsan and Lijo Jose Pellissery for Netflix.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:46 IST,||An abundance of time, lost||Alvin Presley has been making music in English, Tamil and Hindi for years. His first in 2022, is the latter, for reasons that had nothing to do with conscious decision. “Sometimes, it’s the words that come to me; at other times it’s the melody. I never decide in advance that I have to write a song in Tamil or Hindi or any particular language,” says the Chennai-based musician in a conversation about ‘Dil Ke Dairon Pe’, the first of his Hindi numbers to release. A blend of lilting melody and pensive lyrics, the pop number is a message from Alvin to himself: a reminder to take a moment to pause and re-orient. He elaborates, “I was in a very weird mental state when I wrote this; the whole year had me fatigued. These words reflect how far I was buried in my thoughts, and it tells me to pause and stabilise. Like many other people, 2021 was a tough year for me. Everybody wanted to do something different; I wanted to do something big too. Then I got COVID, and my plans had to change. I was trying to keep up, but never stopped to take stock of everything I had gone through.”  This is what the song keeps insisting on, with the refrain of “ ruk ja zara ”, as an alternative to the harried panic that many are going through in an attempt to make up for the months and years lost either because of lockdown, COVID or debilitating personal losses.  For all its emphasis on slowing down, the number is one of Alvin’s quickest compositions. “Unlike the other Hindi songs that I play at my gigs, this one was the product of less than 10 days: writing, composition, recording and release,” he says. And despite a number of older, oft-performed songs waiting in the wings, this one took precedence in getting released. This was not because of the message it holds, but for a purely practical reason: “When people line up my discography according to the time of release, I want them to have a flow. I don’t want it to sound haphazard. I felt that this track would make for a smoother transition after my previous releases.  The songs that I will be coming up with next will be more of alternative rock and an indie-pop mixture, different from the electronic-pop mixture I was creating with [previous album] Fall Today ,” says Alvin.  Multiple releases are in the offing this year, says Alvin, adding that he wants to experiment more with genres as well as with music platforms. He gives the example of the website he has collaborated with for his current release. “Audius is a comparatively new platform. They pay the artists better, and they also pay in a cryptocurrency called audio coins. This is an exclusively Audius-first release to start with, and will be available on Spotify, YouTube and all other platforms next week,” he signs off.  The songs that I will be coming up with next will be more of alternative rock and an indie-pop mixture, different from the electronic-pop so far Alvin Presley||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-abundance-of-time-lost/article38162301.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:46 IST,||Pedalling for a better world||At a time when the Indian coasts are battling a tidal wave of plastic pollution, two cyclists from Maharashtra are on a mission to highlight the ill-effects of single-use plastic and its impact on marine life. Naval veteran Milind Tamble, 56, and 49-year old Shriram Kondhawekar are cycling along the Indian coastline covering a distance of about 6,179 kilometres as part of their Indian Coastal Cycling Expedition. The ‘Pedalbums’, as they call themselves, started the first leg of their journey from Mumbai last year in February. The journey had to be halted in Goa due to the second wave of the pandemic. Milind and Shriram resumed their expedition from Goa on November 14 last year with an aim to complete the remaining three legs of the journey cycling through Kanyakumari, Visakhapatnam, Kolkata and Gujarat before culminating their expedition in Mumbai. “While travelling through the beaches, we came face-to-face with the extent of plastic pollution plaguing our coastline. The beaches are mostly polluted with single-use plastics. Pollution was more remarkable on beaches around urban and semi urban areas, while the coasts along the rural areas had negligible amount of single-use plastics,” says Milind. The cyclists are travelling with minimal single-use plastics. “We are carrying the little plastic generated along our tour till we find a designated recycling facility. Even today my bag contains used biscuit wrappers and likes which I will carry with me till I can dispose it off responsibly,” says Milind. The cyclists’ expedition has been formally recognised by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports under the Fit India Movement. The duo is cycling with the Fuji Touring and Marin Four Corners bikes. Diet matters “These cycles are made for cycle touring and are capable of carrying heavy loads of the touring setup. Also the frame geometry makes it easy to attach panniers and frame bags on the cycle,” explains Milind. Sharing their diet routine during the expedition, he says they are following a high protein and carbohydrate intake. “Our regular food includes a good portion of idli, poha, paneer, bananas and eggs,” says Shriram. Fitness routine Their fitness preparation was taken care of by fitness firm called Fittr, who is also their fitness sponsor. “They analysed our body structure and dietary habits and gave us a six months strength training and endurance building exercises. They also took care of dietary requirements and made customized diet plans during the six months of training ,” says Milind. The cyclists have been meeting several cycling groups who welcomed them in the cities, hosted them for dinners and showed them around. Talking about the toughest parts of the expedition, Milind says, “The Southern coast from Kanyakumari was one of the most challenging ones. It is not because of the terrain, but the humid and hot climate that was extremely energy sapping. Being physically fit and mentally strong are equally important during long-distance cycling. Determination is all what matters,” he says. What has been the biggest takeaway from the expedition? “ One doesn’t need much to live,” says Milind.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:47 IST,||On the sugar trail||KKN Nallasamy has had white sugar with his tea for only three months in his lifetime.  The 72-year-old farmer prefers using country sugar, made right beside his sugarcane fields at Kavindapadi village in Erode district, 98 kilometres from Coimbatore. “A terrible drought struck us some 20 years ago and our crops failed,” he recalls. “I could not make naatu sakkarai (country sugar) and hence had to buy white sugar. But after three months I stopped using it,” he pauses, chuckling about how it did not feel or taste quite right.   Kavindapadi is a major supplier of country sugar in the State. Sugarcane fields are spread out across the village — the strapping purple stalks are fed well by the Lower Bhavani Canal. “Our country sugar is used to sweeten panchamirtham at the Palani Murugan temple,” says KKN Eswaramoorthy, Nallasamy’s son. The 45-year-old manages 12 acres of the crop, and also makes and sells country sugar.  “Kavindapadi’s population is around 10,000, of which around 2,000 of us are involved in farming,” he says. The village has two major white sugar mills in the vicinity; ironic in a place known for country sugar. “Several farmers sell their sugarcane to the mills, while some sell their crop to commercial jaggery units in the region,” explains Eswaramoorthy, just as his mother walks by to offer us tea — with country sugar.  The sugar adds a mellow nutty flavour to the tea, something that Eswaramoorthy swears by. “It has grown in popularity over the last decade or so, which is why I decided to market it on Facebook,” he explains. The page Sugarcane Jaggery Powder, that he started in 2015, is a direct link between the farmer and consumer. “If I sell through the agent in my village, the product will change three hands before reaching the consumer, and I end up making very less,” he says. And so he started his own brand, the first in his village to do so. “Traditionally, pongal was made with naatu sakkarai ,” says Eswaramoorthy. “Jaggery is the same, made into balls,” he adds. Somewhere along the way, jaggery, probably owing to its shape — there is also ‘achchu vellam’, shaped into small rectangles — gained in popularity.  “Over the years, commercial units started adding white sugar while making jaggery, and people ended up getting used to what is an unnatural sweeter version,” he explains. A soothing concoction Around a kilometre from his farm, M Maranayakkar is overseeing work on his field. It is a cloudless day, and the sun beats down on us. S Sengottayan and his team of eight are churning out a batch of 90 kilograms of country sugar. The 67-year-old owns a wooden cane crusher, and works for farmers in the region. Once hired, he, along with his team, sets up a clay stove by the land-owner’s field, harvests sugarcane and churns it into sandy brown country sugar. “Five hundred litres of juice will yield around 100 kilograms of sugar,” explains Sengottayan, walking over to a gigantic skillet made of mild steel — it can hold 1,000 litres — where sugarcane juice simmers, giving off sweet-smelling fumes. The juice simmers for two hours; 500 grams of baking soda and 100 grams of calcium carbonate are added at various intervals; 50ml of coconut oil is drizzled in just before it is taken off the fire. Sengottayan gives the shimmery concoction a mix with a mammoth ladle. “Careful now,” his wife Sellammal signals us a warning. “A drop of that can drive a hole into the skin.” But she casually walks around it, sending several ripples glide through the liquid — that has now reached the consistency of honey — with another ladle. The juice has reduced to half its volume. Suddenly, there is a commotion among them — it is time. They gather by the vessel: four of them tip it into a similar skillet. In one quick move, the semi-solid beauty slides into the waiting container. Sengottayan quickly mixes it with a wooden implement. The golden, gooey substance changes colour right before our eyes. “This will turn powdery in 30 minutes,” Sellammal tells us.  Sengottayan scrapes a tiny bit off the ladle and offers it for us to taste: he calls it javvu mittai (sticky candy). It sticks to our fingers as we pull it apart to eat it. The mittai is intoxicating — imagine the sweetness of a hundred sugarcanes condensed into a sticky concentrate that melts in the mouth. “Nice, isn’t it?” chuckles Sengottayan. “I get to eat this every day.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-the-sugar-trail/article38162308.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:44 IST,||Vidharth on his 20-year film career, playing a villain in ‘Anbarivu’, and more||It has been 20 years since Vidharth first appeared on the big screen in a blink-and-miss role in Minnale . Ten years since his breakthrough film, Mynaa . Despite the film’s commercial success and the appreciation he got, Vidharth’s career graph did not see a dramatic upward curve.  “I know I am not a star today,” he says, reflecting upon his journey, “But I never wanted to become one.”  That is because Vidharth always wanted to be an actor .   Cinema, for him, was a childhood fascination. His maternal grandfather had appeared in small roles in P Neelakantan’s Or Iravu (written by CN Annadurai) and Krishnan-Panju’s famous Parasakthi (written by M Karunanidhi) in which Sivaji Ganesan made his debut. He wanted Vidharth to be in the films too. When he liked a character in a film, he would address Vidharth by the character’s name. Vidharth, by now, was a constant presence in his school plays.   In the late ‘90s, he came to Chennai to be in films and Minnale happened within a few years.  “I was happy. But I knew that I did not come to Chennai to do just this. I felt I did not have the talent to be in films. I told myself, ‘Either you leave films or get trained and be a proper actor.’ That’s how I joined Koothu-P-Pattarai.” The popular Chennai acting school taught him about movies and life. “I have seen some phenomenal actors there. For example, there is a senior actor called Murugan. He would not even be the protagonist of the play but whenever he was on stage, he was a star. But the next morning, you would see him in a tea shop, almost inconspicuous. That’s when I learnt that more than talent, it is about the opportunities you get and what you do with them.” Stardom, Vidharth says, is fleeting. “Despite being in films, I have never felt like a star. My only desire is to be a part of good films.” Upcoming projects  After the success of Mynaa , Vidharth kept signing films. But one flop followed another. At one point, he asked himself what kind of films he wanted to do. The result of that reflection was M Manikandan’s Kuttrame Thandanai , in which he plays a man suffering from tunnel vision. “Though it did not make a lot of money, it earned me great respect. I would split my career into before and after Kuttrame Thandanai .”   Vidharth has eight films lined up for release. First up among them will be Anbarivu, which will stream on Disney+Hotstar from today. Starring ‘Hip Hop Tamizha’ Adhi, Vidharth plays the antagonist.  “I was not keen on playing a villain in a commercial film. But Pon Parthiban, the dialogue writer of the film, told me the character was written for me. After the narration, I told him, ‘I would not have chosen myself for this role if I was the writer.’ He saw something in me that I did not.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/vidharth-on-his-20-year-film-career-playing-a-villain-in-anbarivu-and-more/article38162276.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:46 IST,||Learning to fly||Kalou’s circus classes are adventurous. But finding her school is an adventure in itself. Eluciole Circus, started by Kalou in 2012, is a circus school tucked away in Auroville. Google Maps is not your ally here. After a point, cars too protest as the wooded lanes get narrower, until they can be manoeuvred only on foot. A 10-metre high dome peeps from a canopy of trees. Inside, students aged five and above, stretch before they end up looking like malleable metal figurines. Some touch their nose to their knees, while others suspend themselves from thick cloths and cascade like a waterfall. Each session is about two hours long. Before the pandemic hit, schools from Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai would visit this centre to experience the basics of circus. The circus school teaches acro yoga, juggling, hula hoop, acrobatics and aerial acts such as trapeze and tightrope walking. “These acts help develop the muscles and the practitioner learns how to use these muscles. The body becomes supple, flexible and the body’s endurance and capacity to adapt are tested,” explains Kalou who moved to Auroville from France in 1998. Kalou found herself drawn to adrenaline-pumping acts like fire dancing. At 25, she joined a professional circus company and travelled the world performing fire dance, an act she perfected over 15 years. “At the age of 46 I started performing aerial acrobatics. I am 55 now,” she smiles, doing an effortless split as she levitates mid air with the support of a cloth. In her initial years in India, she taught fire performances.Performing these art forms filled Kalou with joy. “That’s why I started my circus school: to help people irrespective of age to discover all possibilities of understanding themselves and their bodies at a deeper level.” For details write to eluciolecircus@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/learning-to-fly/article38162300.ece

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 05:31 IST,||Bringing back the melody||Earlier this year, Ravi G. started a musical series on Instagram titled Home Jam , in which he presented covers of many underrated 90s Tamil film songs.   One of those — a cover of ‘Porkalam’ from Tenali — attracted the attention of many, most notably music composer Anirudh who commented: ‘Thank you for this. From RaviG Fan club president.’   Spurred by Ravi’s work, the composer soon called him for a recording. That number, a melody titled ‘Naan Pizhai’( Kaathuvaakula Rendu Kadhal ), is the latest talk of the town, clocking more than three million views within a couple of days of its release and trending on music charts.  “The response has been unimaginable,” says Ravi, who has crooned along with Shashaa Tirupati. “What’s most heartening is that it is a melody, which itself is a difficult proposition for composers to churn out in this age of fast-paced peppy numbers. The opportunity to explore such melodies in the film music space is scarce. The first time I listened to the track version, I had goosebumps. That it has clicked with audiences is great news for musicians.” Starring Vijay Sethupathi and Nayanthara, the song is written by the film’s director, Vignesh Shivan.  Thirty-three-year-old Ravi got his break through a 2015 Anirudh composition in Ajith-starrer Vedalam, and subsequently worked with Sean Roldan as a music producer. His recent songs include ‘ Boomikkku ’ from G.V. Prakash’s Jail .  Ravi hails from a musical family; his uncle plays the mridangam, while his grandfather is a Carnatic vocalist. He picked up the mridangam when he was barely four, and slowly got interested in vocals. “At home, there were a lot of music classes to students, and I’d pick up things just listening to those lessons,” he says.  When he was 15, he learnt the keyboard and went on to play in various live shows and music productions. Currently busy with producing contemporary devotional and fusion music outings, Ravi’s work was also recently showcased in the Perumal and Providence project, a production that gave a modern twist to Carnatic kritis .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bringing-back-the-melody/article38162746.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 05:30 IST,||Supervillain tales||“After Minnal Murali ’s premiere, someone in the audience walked up to me and asked, ‘Can I hug you?’” Guru Somasundaram says, breaking into a laugh. Life has changed overnight for him after the film dropped recently on Netflix, with his performance being widely appreciated.   There is a child-like joy in Guru as he talks about the film. “I generally don’t watch my movies. In fact, I rarely check the monitor after giving a shot. But when I started working on Minnal Murali , I felt it was going to be special. I watched it with the whole team before the premiere and I was shocked. It was as if I had been struck by lightning, just like my character in the movie,” the actor laughs.  The film, set in a village called Kurukkanmoola, revolves around Jaison (Tovino Thomas) and Shibu (Guru), who are struck by lightning on the same night. Both gain superpowers and circumstances pit them against each other. Unrequited love and society’s indifference to his plight make Shibu an embittered man. In director Basil Joseph’s words, Shibu is the “second hero” and not the villain. Changing phase  Basil and his team met Guru in 2019 to discuss the project. “He narrated the full script, playing the background music on his phone! I didn’t expect that I would get to do so much; I was prepared for the physical and emotional transformation of the character. Things went on to another level once I started shooting,” says Guru, who made his debut with Thiagarajan Kumararaja’s cult Tamil film, Aaranya Kaandam .  The first step to becoming Shibu, says Guru, was learning Malayalam. He took lessons from YouTube and can now read and write the language. “I believe that it is important for an actor to learn the language to portray the emotion. It was also about establishing a bond with everyone on the set. Knowing the language helped my performance,” the actor says.  He also watched Malayalam movies to pick up the language. “I saw many movies of Sreenivasan sir, such as Nadodikattu, Angane Oru Avadhikalathu, Akkare Akkare Akkare… One movie I watched multiple times was Njan Prakashan . It had simple dialogues,” says Guru, who has also acted in critically-acclaimed Tamil films Jigarthanda (2014), Joker (2016) and Jai Bhim (2021).  Guru believes he owes it all to his decade-long association with Chennai-based Koothu-P-Pattarai, a prominent contemporary Tamil theatre group. “I grew up in Madurai, and watched a lot of movies in my childhood. Becoming an actor was the last thing on my mind during my growing-up years because I was shy. I took up a job after finishing my studies. However, after a point, I felt lost. Once I joined Koothu-P-Pattarai, I fell in love with theatre.” Theatre gave him the confidence to improvise. “It is like blowing a balloon to its maximum capacity. You have to ensure that it doesn’t burst, though. Similarly, I improvise without changing the crux of the scene.” Coming up  Guru is elated that he is acting in Mohanlal’s directorial debut, Barroz, in February. His upcoming Malayalam release is Abhilash S Kumar’s Chattambi , along with Sreenath Bhasi and Chemban Vinod.  His dream is to do a full-length comedy role. “Many people have told me that I remind them of Nagesh sir. He was a fabulous character artiste even though we have seen him more in comedies,” Guru adds. Does he have a favourite villain-actor? “Raghuvaran sir. I believe that a villain has to have some honesty about him,” he says, adding, “a Brazilian theatre artiste once observed that heroes in our films usually remain good and villains are always bad. According to him, there should be a mix of good and bad in the characters. Raghuvaran sir’s villain roles have that blend. I like to play such characters.”  I believe that it is important for an actor to learn the language to portray the emotion. Knowing Malayalam helped my performance Guru Somasundaram||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/supervillain-tales/article38162836.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 05:31 IST,||A bittersweet tale of growing up||A sea of emotions engulfs viewers as film director Shyamaprasad evocatively adapts Anees Salim’s novel The Small-Town Sea for the big screen as Kasiminte Kadal (Kasim’s Sea). Kasim’s loneliness tugs at the heart even as his child-like joys evoke nostalgia.   Reputed for his ability to capture the dynamics of interpersonal relationships on screen, Shyamaprasad transcreates literary worlds to the screen without losing the essence of the work. He wanted to adapt The Small-Town Sea as a movie as soon as he read the book, which is about love, loss and longing as seen through the eyes of a teenager. Anees agreed to the adaptation of his novel for a film. But for some minor clarifications the director wanted from the author, Shyamaprasad was given a free hand in writing the screenplay.  In a director’s note about the film, Shyamaprasad states: “To me, Kasim’s tale is a bittersweet one — of growing up, dealing with bereavement, getting lost and finding one’s way back home. I wanted the film to be a simple narrative of hidden joys and tender sadness... Though our stories might not always save us, most of us sit under their shade, looking at the sea, listening to its roar, which is sometimes sweet and music to us, waiting for its next inevitable swell.”  The director says the book’s protagonist reminded him of Satyajit Ray’s Appu in Pather Panchali and his travails but in a different setting.  As Kasim’s father Salim uproots the family to spend his last days in Varkala, Kasim (Tashi Shamdat) discovers new joys and friends even though he hankers for their previous life in Kochi. Adapting a literary work “As soon as a literary work is taken up for a film adaptation, it becomes the director’s perspective. In this case, I have given a name to the nameless protagonist of the book and also set it in the beachside town of Varkala, although the author has not named the place anywhere in his book. Kasim is only 11 years in the film,” he says.  As Shyamaprasad was shooting in sync sound, he decided to cast local residents to get the dialect right. But for Harish Uthaman, who plays Salim, most of the other characters, including Kasim’s friend Bilal (enacted by Niranjan), who won the Kerala State Film Award for the best child actor, were cast after extensive auditions. “We held workshops for people to familiarise themselves with the camera and sync sound. Casting director Saji Thulasidas, an alumnus of the School of Drama, is from Varkala and helped us in finding the right people,” the director says.  Finding the location that resembled the one in the book proved to be difficult and the heavy rain had eroded the cliff on which some of the shooting had been done. “It proved to be a blessing in disguise. During the erosion, one of the smaller cliffs had crumbled in the middle and we depicted that as the entrance to the ‘secret beach’ in the book,” says Shyamaprasad.  Like his previous film Oru Njayarazhcha , Shyamaprasad has composed the background score of Kasiminte Kadal .   Produced by T.S. Jayakumar and Gireesh Uthaman along with co-producers Manoj Narayan (also the cinematographer) and Shyamaprasad, Kasiminte Kadal is also an ode to the joys and difficulties of growing up in a small town where everyone knows each other and has an opinion about someone else’s life.  Sea of emotions  How far is Kasiminte Kadal from Ore Kadal (2007)? “Not very far. It is the same sea where the waves can be calm or tempestuous. It can also symbolise the mind, always in motion, moving with the swell and ebb of our lives.”  Surprisingly, this film, rooted in the culture of Kerala, was left out of the International Film Festival of Kerala. The director feels that stories that do not have an overt political statement to make on contemporary subjects or is not laced with humour are losing their space in cinemas. “Movies on existentialism and the simple joys of life don’t seem to be valued. We must understand that some of Indian cinema’s classics that have stood the test of time did not always have a loud, obvious political theme. Instead, they showed vignettes of life in India which also made political statements.” He feel that cinema, as a medium of art, must reflect the joys and sorrows of life, in addition to protests and political statements.  The director is currently working on the post production of a film based on littérateur M.T. Vasudevan Nair’s short story Kazhcha , starring Parvathy Thiruvothu and Kalamandalam Saraswathi, M.T.’s wife. Kazhcha will be a part of a 10-part featurettes directed by reputed directors in Malayalam cinema — Santosh Sivan, Jayaraj, Priyadarsan and Lijo Jose Pellissery — for Netflix.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:50 IST,||Travelling through time||Story so far: Sukracharya tells Meghnath about wormholes and how they were used to communicate with ethereal beings.   Meghnath has shot down 27 fruits with his agni astra and lined them all up. He is deep in thought, wondering why Brahma laughed when he saw King Kakudmi.  He sees Sukracharya watching. Meghnath: Guru, please tell me why Brahma laughed when he learnt that Kakudmi and his daughter had been waiting for 27 minutes.  Sukracharya: They waited 27 minutes in Brahmaloka. Actually, 27 Chatur Yugas had passed. Which means 116,640,000 years.  Meghnath: A yuga is 4,320,000 years. So that’s 27x4,320,000. But the average lifespan of a human is only 70 to 80 years.  Sukracharya: Brahmaloka is designed in such a way that it moves at speed of light. For people there, it is normal.  Meghnath: How is that possible?  Sukracharya: Like Einstein’s explanation of Special Relativity.  Experiment time Sukracharya takes Meghnath to one of the glass-enclosed chariots. He also takes a bowl of water and a bee with him. He orders the charioteer to drive the horses as fast as he can. Sukracharya: Now look outside. What do you see? And how do you feel inside the chariot?  Meghnath: Things seem to be moving fast outside but, inside, it feels normal.  Sukracharya: The bowl of water, the bee, you and I are all moving at the speed of the chariot but feel as if we are standing still.  After few rounds, Sukracharya drops Meghanth at one spot and again makes the chariot move fast. After few rounds, he gets down. Sukracharya: Now after I dropped you, you observed the chariot. What did you see?  Meghnath: The chariot was travelling at a very high speed.  Sukracharya: So you observed the movement from two perspectives. Think of the chariot as Brahmaloka. Standing outside it is like being on Earth. This relative motion happens throughout the universe.  Meghnath: Got it. Brahmaloka moves at the speed of light, like the chariot at high speed. For people inside, it is still. For people from Earth, one minute in Brahmaloka is equal to 27 minutes.  Sukracharya: Exactly. So what will Kakudmi find if he returns to Earth?  Meghanth: Several yugas have passed, the Earth will be different. He won’t find his country or his people.  Sukrachraya: That is why Brahma laughed.  Meghanth: But Brahma is a god. Can’t he take Kakudmi back in time?  Sukrachraya: Humans can only go to the future by travelling fast. We can’t go back to the past. Brahma had a better solution.  Meghnath: Even after he lost his kingdom?  Sukracharya: The Bhagavata Purana mentions that Vishnu’s incarnation marries Revathi in Treta Yuga.  Meghnath: Basically Revathi time travelled to the future to marry an incarnation of God.  Sukracharya: Yes, and the same can happen now. To avoid these issues, we can pass information as audio and images using electro-magnetic waves. What other explanation can you give for your dreams, Meghnath?  Meghnath: This is really exciting, Guru. Please teach me to travel at the speed of light and pass/get information.  Sukracharya: Of course, Prince of Lanka. That’s why your father brought you here. But, first, you need to learn about electromagnetic waves and antenna.  Sukracharya leaves Meghanth trying to relate his dreams with science. The author is the founder and CEO of Vaayusastra Aerospace, an IIT-Madras incubated ed-tech startup that offers Air Science workshopsfor children between five and 14 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/travelling-through-time/article38163007.ece
07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:49 IST,||The joy of giving||It was New Year’s Eve. People were celebrating with their friends and families. On the corner of a street, an old man was trying to fend off the bitter cold. The air was frosty, and the old fellow was shivering in his tattered shirt and trousers. His bare feet were numb. One child who noticed him, asked, “Don’t you feel cold?” “Yes,” said the old man, shivering. “Then, why aren’t you wearing any warm clothes?” asked the child innocently. “People are enjoying the celebrations and nobody has noticed me,” he said, dejectedly. Help at hand The boy ran upto his father at a distance and whispered something. The father then spoke to the people around him and pointed to the old man. The little boy came running up to him and said, “They say that they don’t have any warm clothes to spare.” A sarcastic smile swam briefly across the man’s face, as he glanced at the overdressed group of people who had every inch of their skin covered by overcoats, sweaters, gloves and mufflers. He then buried his head in his knees and curled up his body as his only defence against the cold. Suddenly, he felt a warm hand upon his shoulder and lifted his head to see a group of children surrounding him. “We are wearing many sweaters and coats and we will share some with you,” one assured the old man. Hope lit the man’s eyes but faded soon. “But how will I wear clothes of your size?” he murmured. One child came forward, removed his coat and placed it on the old man’s back. Others followed suit and, soon, he was covered in coats of various sizes. Some handed over their gloves and socks for his hands and feet. Theold man was moved to tears and he embraced them. Slowly, he put his shaking hand into his pocket and held out his clenched fist. “What are you hiding from us?” one child asked curiously. The old man opened his fist. Something white and sparkly lit up his palm. “These are sparkles of happiness. They multiply when you spread them,” said the old man, as he showered the kids with bright sparkling light. It was so bright that the children were forced to close their eyes. When they opened them again, the old man had disappeared. And the street echoed with shouts of “Happy New Year”.  “We are wearing many sweaters and coats and we will share some with you.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/the-joy-of-giving/article38163003.ece

Topics covered included important sources of protein, history of peanut butter, vegan protein, fun facts, the process of making peanut butter and how to include protein in a regular diet. All this was split into 12 topics over as many weeks. This information was accompanied by a fun activity that children had to solve and submit to be crowned the Kissan Protein Champ at the end of the series.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 06:50 IST,||A horrific night||I am Rohan. Raunak, Suraj and Rita are my close friends. While in college, we loved sharing horror stories with each other. Halloween was coming up, so we decided to do something scary. We planned to go to a forest that was believed to be haunted and stay there for a couple of nights. I drove to the forest and pitched two tents. Raunak and Suraj stayed in one and Rita and I stayed in another. At night, we heard a voice but ignored it. When we woke up, we could not find Raunak. We looked for him all day and, by evening, we found his shoe outside a cave. Suraj went inside the cave to look for him, while Rita and I waited outside. It was late in the night, and there was still no sign of either of them. We were worried. Suddenly, we saw a tall figure walk out of the cave. There was no face and the legs were twisted. We quickly hid behind a tree. Rita stepped on something and a secret door opened up on the ground. We went inside and found an underground graveyard. Slowly, the spirits of the dead woke up one by one. They started chasing us. So, we ran out through the secret door. The spirits and the strange figure continued to chase us. We hid inside a scary old tree house, from where we could see the graveyard. We saw zombies coming out of the graveyard and running around! I heard some knocking on the door. I got very scared and closed my eyes. When I slowly opened my eyes, I saw my mother looking at me, saying, “Wake up, Rohan!

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:43 IST,||Art as transformation||While inaugurating Kalakshetra Foundation’s ‘Kala Samprekshana - The Art of Seeing Art’, veteran dancer and MP Sonal Mansingh analysed the concept, talking about appropriateness, steadiness and focus, when the artiste transcends physicality and connects with the inner self. She quoted the examples of Balasaraswati and ballerina Margot Fonteyn, both of whom held audiences spellbound despite their ageing bodies.  The conference was set around the idea of performing art that transforms a spectator into a sahrudaya , using technique and creativity to evoke rasa. There were presentations by artistes and researchers.  Musicologist Radha Bhaskar brought out the beauty of Carnatic ragas while artist Meenakshi Madan spoke about the revival of the Chithrakathi paintings of Maharashtra. There was a short session by Kalakshetra alumnus Manasi Bhatkhande, who shared insights from her award-winning thesis, ‘Rasas in Malavikagnimitram’, which goes into the details of Kalidasa’s first dramatic work, re-imagined as a dance drama, scene by scene, with ragas, lighting, and costumes. Historicity is an important component of classical arts, and there are many manuals and treatises in India about the arts that date back to the pre-Christian era. Researcher Rajshree Vasudevan made a presentation on this, where she drew parallels between ancient Greek and Indian art.  The research on the Natya Shastra by Padma Subrahmanyam and Gayatri Kannan, ‘Vrittis and Pravrittis’ was presented through interesting clippings. The Natya Shastra mentions four styles of presentation or vrittis — Bharathi Vritti (verbal virtuosity), Sattvati Vritti (emotions and abhinaya), Aarabhatti Vritti (energy), and Kaisiki Vritti (grace). Further, Bharata Varsha was divided into four geographical zones or Pravrittis. Interestingly, modern Bharatanayam exhibits all the vrittis .  Focus on Sangam poetry  Professor Raghuraman spoke about Tamil Sangam literature and its focus on landscapes as the triggers of human emotions. Tamil literature is thus divided into genres based on mountain, forest, cultivated land, desert and seashore. Incidentally, Sangam poetry dealt exclusively with human emotions, not with gods, and according to Professor Raghuraman, the oldest surviving text, Tolkappiyam , dated around 700 B.C., reveals the existence of the performing arts then. There is a structured way in which an artiste explain a situation: Mudalpporul refers to landscape, time zones, seasons, etc; Karupporul describes birds and animals and Uripporul, the emotions.   In Kerala, the Balarama Bharatham was written by Karthika Tirunal, containing an expanded vocabulary of angika abhinaya (movement of limbs). Mohiniyattam expert Kalamandalam Rachita Ravi explained the contents briefly, contrasting this text with the Natya Shastra and Abhinaya Darpana.  Classical Kathak can be traced to courtesans and the influence of the Mughal court. It moved from temples to courts and then the stage. Kathak’s fluid style can be attributed to the architecture of local temples, especially their rounded domes. Kumudini Lakhia, through her disciples, introduced viewers to the dance form’s nuances, such as the thaat (standing pose), amaad (entry), tukda (a piece composed of bols), etc.  Kalakshetra faculty member K. Nirmala Nagarajan invited veteran dancer Professor A. Janardhanan on stage. Nirmala chose to depict shringara rasa, using the visualisation of Rama and Sita in the forest from Rukmini Devi’s production, Paduka Pattabhishekam. Janardhanan, Kalakshetra’s first Rama, trained by Rukmini Devi, enacted the scene with senior Kalakshetra teacher Shaly Vijayan.  Alumnus G. Narendra returned to the Kalakshetra stage with a memorable Hanuman varnam (Ritigowla, Adi) written by Professor Raghuraman and tuned by K. Hariprasad. With sparkling theermanams, highlighted by Mahalakshmi Kameshwaran on the nattuvangam and Ramesh Babu on the mridangam, and warm sancharis, he underlined his place in the world of dance. Binu Venugopal (vocal) and Kalaiarasan (violin) provided beautiful music. The finale was a lively performance by students of Bharata Kalanjali for Mysore Vasudevachar’s compositions, conceptualised by alumni artistes Shanta and V.P. Dhananjayan.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:43 IST,||Brilliantly crafted||In his virtual flute concert as part of ‘Yours Truly Margazhi’, organised by the Federation of City Sabhas, Shashank displayed a perfect bond between form and content. In the very first song ‘Neekela Dayaradhu’ in Sarasangi (Khanda Chapu), his poise and energy were palpable. Ramaswami Sivan, the composer, whose mudra is Guhadaasa, says, ‘O, Sri Rama of Saketapura, why don’t you show mercy on me?’ Neat gamakas brought out the essence of the raga, which is the 27th in the Melakarta scheme. There are not many kritis in Sarasangi, but there are popular ones in its janya ragas, Kamalamanohari and Nalinakanti. In the swaraprastara, Shashank displayed his grip over laya, with a sense of proportion. In the insightful alapana of Dharmavati, his focus was on melody. He played Mysore Vasudevachar’s ‘Bhajana seya rada’, in praise of Rama displaying a perfectly sruti-aligned swaraprastara. A vibrant ‘Sadha mathim’ in Gambhiravani came up next, the only Tyagaraja kriti in this raga. Kamboji seems to be the flavour of the season and Shashank offered a Ragam Tanam Pallavi in it. He began the raga elucidation on an almost 4 ft long flute with a deeper base, giving the raga greater depth. For the 100-minute concert, he used a combination of five flutes, which gave the range of five octaves. A 3 ft long flute was the main instrument, whose tone is one octave lower than the normal flute. In this, the gamakas blend much better and the tone is more soothing on the ear. Clarity of notes Coming back to the RTP, in the tanam and later in the swaras, the flautist showed his expertise in the flutter tongue technique, without compromising on the clarity of notes. The pallavi started after three-and-half beats in khanda triputa tala tisra nadai, and Shashank’s playing revealed his percussive knowledge. His presentation of the swaraprastara and the rich tonal quality of the flute in the lower registers during raga phrases highlighted his craftsmanship. On the violin, R. Raghul was a great asset, standing up to every challenge, whether the alapana, tanam or swaraprastara. On the mridangam, Anantha R. Krishnan’s performance throughout the concert and during the thani in Sankeerna nadai was brilliant. Gowrishankar was on the tambura. Shashank wound up a concert, marked by impressive technique and style, with two Sindhubhairavi kritis, ‘Vishveswara darusan’ (Swati Tirunal), and ‘Chandrasekhara esa’ (Anai Vaidyanatha Iyer).

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:43 IST,||Notes and narrative||Ashwath Narayanan’s concert titled ‘Vivaram’ (details) was a pleasant musical experience that also included interesting trivia about the compositions. But his intros were crisp, and it did not become a pedantic lec-dem. He spoke about how Tyagaraja composed five to six songs on Tulasi before he presented ‘Tulasi dala mulache’ in Mayamalavagowla as the opening kriti.Niraval at ‘Saraseeruha punnaga’ and swaras centered on panchamam added lustre.  Muthuswami Dikshitar’s ‘Annapoorne visalakshi’, the young vocalist explained, is a song in praise of the deity at Kuzhikkarai, a small town near Tiruvarur, and not the one in Kashi. Refering to the charanam of the kriti that has a mention of payasam, Ashwath pointed out that it is offered to the goddess even today.  The third piece turned out to be a very interesting one, a composition by Dr. S Ramanathan in raga Gopriya, a derivative of Rishabapriya. The raga’s unique feature is that it does not allow for any tonic shift because of the equidistant notes in the absence of panchamam. Ashwath demonstrated the raga before presenting the kriti ‘Na moravina rada’ with an intricately laced chittaswara by the composer. A classic pada varnam in raga Yadukulakamboji by Swati Tirunal came next. ‘Sami ninne nammithira’ was the composition. Ashwath spoke of learning this varnam from senior Bharatanatyam dancer Leela Samson, and presented it with élan. It was performed by Rukmani Devi for her maiden performance in 1935. Shiva kriti Talking about Muthuswami Dikshitar composing the kriti ‘Ardhanareeswaram’ in Kumudakriya, Ashwath said that it may be because kumudam is a bisexual flower that has both stamen and pistil, just as the Ardhanareeswara concept embraces both male and female. Ashwath presented a majestic tanam in Thodi without the raga treatise and sang Maharaja Kumara Ettendra’s ‘Gajavadana sammodita’ with its masterly chittaswaram. The singer spoke of how its speciality is the note ‘gandharam’ embedded in 18 different styles. The grandeur of the composition was elevated by the vocalist’s prowess and his extensive niraval and swaras at ‘Vaag vilasa karthikeya’.  When Silappadigaram was written there were five pentatonic ragas including Hindolam, Suddha Saveri, Mohanam, etc. The song ‘Vadavarayai maththakki’, popularised by M.S. Subbulakshmi, was set in Suddha Saveri during the Sangam era with the five stanzas in different pentatonic ragas. Later, S.V. Venkatraman set the verses to tune differently, later popularised by MS. Ashwath presented this ragamalika.  The concert ended with Bharati’s ‘Oozhi koothu’ set in Mohanam by the poet himself. B. Ananthakrishnan on the violin, Delhi Sairam on the mridangam, and K.V. Gopalakrishnan on the kanjira shared perfect camaraderie throughout the concert, with Sairam and Gopalakrishnan exchanging sharp patterns in the tani.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:43 IST,||A bright flow of ideas||Listening to Vishnudev K.S. at two concerts has reinforced the impression that he is among an emerging bunch of young musicians who try to raise the bar with each performance. A majority of the kritis he sang in his 70-minute performance at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan had brisk kalpanaswaras. A similar streak could be seen in his recital for Charsur on the theme, ‘Sarvam Vishnu mayam’. The common feature in both concerts were the brisk starts and the exploring of innovative ideas. In his concert at Bhavan, he began with a refreshing ‘Saketha nikethana’ by Tyagaraja in Kannada with madhyamakala swaras at the pallavi lines set to Rupaka tala. He chose to present a brief Simhendramadhyamam alapana with abundant brigas in the kriti ‘Ninne nammithinayya’ by Mysore Vasudevachar. He displayed remarkable ease at rendering interesting patterns in the swarakalpanas, in both slow and fast speeds. Tyagaraja's ‘Makelara vicharamu’ in Ravichandrika was quick and precise, and an expansive Saveri kriti ‘Devi pavane’, one of Swati Tirunal’s Navaratri compositions, followed. Skipping the niraval, he swarmed the kalpanaswaras in ragamalika, with seven ragas in keezh kalam and nine ragas in the fast-paced section for each avarthanam. L. Ramakrishnan on the violin came up with a competent response. The percussion accompanists, Delhi Sairam (mridangam) and S. Krishna (ghatam), kept up with the spirit of the vocalist. At Charsur, the theme gave Vishnudev scope to render some beautiful compositions. The Ata tala varnam in Sankarabharanam, ‘Chalamela’, with a tinge of the Western scale in the last swara was a sparky start. His picturisation of Lathangi in a layered structure and the twirls in the niraval at ‘Alarmel mangai manala’ in Papanasam Sivan's ‘Venkata ramana’ were a treat for the ears. The alapana for a raga like Jayantasena is a tightrope walk and Vishnudev handled it carefully, devoid of any trace of Karaharapriya. But the over-rapid swaraprastaras in this kriti and in the subsequent ‘Paridanamicchithe’ (Bilahari, Patnam Subramania Iyer) warned of the need for restraint. Breezy Hamirkalyani When Hamirkalyani, the main raga, flowed in bright and breezy with its emotive contents intact, it furthered the anticipation of the listeners. Vishnudev did not disappoint with his beautiful version of Subbaraya Sastri’s ‘Venkata shaila vihara’, a wordy composition, stringing the sangatis well with the lyrics at the phrase ‘Manimaya mantapa’ and during the niraval in the charanam line ‘Vintinine ni varaguna’. Dhrupad-style phrases in the manodharma segment stood out. The harmonious dialogue between the singer and the violinist (Vittal Rangan) was perceptible in the swarakalpana of this kriti as well as in the Jayantasena kriti earlier.  The synergetic percussion team — Patri Satish Kumar on the mridangam and Anirudh Athreya on the kanjira — blended well with the flow of ideas of the singer and the violinist. In their tani avartanam that lasted for close to 10 minutes, they exhibited their prowess in the interesting pattern of koraippus .  After the thani, Vishnudev presented Periyazhwar’s pasuram ‘Manickam katti’ in ragamalika with Nilambari, Khamas and Surutti, returning to Nilambari after each quatrain with agility. Three more Hindustani ragas followed. While ‘Sri Madhava’ in Behag was sterile, ‘Harigun Gaavat’, a Meera bhajan set to tune in raga Dipali by master-musician Thanjavur S. Kalyanaraman brought out the beauty of both madhyamams used in succession. It was thoughtful of the singer to conclude his concert in line with the theme, with the word ‘Vishnu’ from Panchapakesa Shastri’s ‘Sapasyat kausalya’ in Jhonpuri.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:43 IST,||An old classic revived||Kuchelopakyanam , the dance drama choreographed by Rukmini Devi Arundale, was one of the group presentations performed at the annual art festival of Kalakshetra. Revived 49 years after its premiere in 1972, the thematic production was presented under the guidance of dance guru Prof. A. Janardanan. One wondered how a four-decade-old production will strike a chord with a new generation.  The answer lies in the fact that when core elements such as script, lyric, music, lights, sets and costumes rest on a strong foundation of classicism, it possibly has timeless appeal. Kuchelopakyanam is the famous story of an impoverished Kuchela and Lord Krishna, his childhood friend. Faced with dire poverty, Kuchela’s wife persuades him to visit Krishna and seek his help.  The various episodes that form the outline of the story, including Kuchela setting out to meet Krishna, Krishna enjoying the handful of beaten rice brought by his friend, Kuchela returning home without asking any favour but finding his return great wealth bestowed on his family, played out well. . Composed by Maharaja Swati Tirunal and adapted for dance under the guidance of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, the thematic production was a delightful mix of Carnatic ragas chosen with sensitivity to suit each dance sequence. K.P. Rakesh, who played Kuchela, breathed life into the character, right from consistently holding the stance and sthayi bhava of the impoverished friend to expressing varied emotions with refinement. Good team work The interplay between the dancers in their varied formations, the graceful entries and exits, the colour-coordinated costumes, and the overall sense of balance and proportion in the spatial composition of every scene were aesthetic. In the narrative, which focuses primarily on the meeting of two friends and their emotions, Rukmini Devi has incorporated the group dancing sequences in a judicious manner, without making them look like fillers.  A frame used as a prop to demarcate physical space was initially used as an entry point to Dwaraka and later, as a seating space for Kuchela to look at the glorious buildings and lakes and the daily activities of the people. The detailed depiction of the upacharas associated with welcoming a guest, reminiscences of their childhood days, a group of girls discussing his good fortune, enhanced the narrative flow. The costumes and props were aesthetic but the tulasi mala wrapped around Kuchela’s head drew attention to the wig used instead of camouflaging it.  Haripadman as Krishna, Janet as Rukmini, Pavithra as Kshukshama, Sanjitlal and Sreenath as Brahmins, and Saikrishnan as merchant played their roles with conviction. Malavika, Anagha, Athena, Swathi and Krishna were the sakhis. The music was by Girish Madhu on nattuvangam, K. Hariprasad on vocals, K.P. Anilkumar on mridangam, M.V. Sreenivas on violin, Sashidhar on flute, Anantha Narayanan on veena, and Kumari Krishnendu on tambura. The lighting was by Venkatesh.

07 January 2022||January 07 2022 03:43 IST,||Unusual abhinaya piece||Alarmel Valli’s style has a whimsical charm, enhanced by lilting music and quick rhythmic patterns. Her dance reflects the joy of performance and also the hard work. At the Music Academy Digital Dance Festival 2022, Alarmel appeared in pink and gold for the opening ode to Lakshmi, Saraswati and Durga, tuned by Prema Ramamurthy and S. Rajeswari in a melodious mix of ragas in talamalika. The piece was interspersed with delightful, brief swara passages, which had a touch of solemnity. Alarmel presented a Sankarabaranam padavarnam, a Tamil adaptation of the Telugu ‘Samikki sari evvare’ (Adi). Interestingly, she found spaces to fill in with melody and rhythm. In the sahitya portion of the pallavi, revealing the identity of the nayaka, she danced to a nadai-bedam flute interlude, revelling in nature’s bounty. Steeped in devotion The jathis had a good mix of geometry and lasya, lines and curves, although one found them a bit long. In the tradition of bhakti-shringara pieces, Alarmel turned devotional in the anupallavi, admiring the procession of Rajagopala. From the charanam however, the varnam was about Kama and his love-darts enhancing the shringara rasa. The musicians were immersive — one could hear the chirping of the birds (J.B. Sruthi Sagar on the flute) during the last charana swara. Vasudha Ravi’s melody was enriched by one more instrumentalist, K.P. Nandini (violin), adding to the richness of the orchestration. Handling the rhythmic nuances with involved precision were C.K. Vasudevan (nattuvangam) and Shaktivel Muruganandam (mridangam). The lighting was by Murugan Krishnan and costumes by D.S. Aiyyelu. Alarmel’s choice for abhinaya was an unusual but rather topical ‘Pushpa Vilapam’ (Jandhyala Papayya Sastri, tuned in ragamalika, talamalika), where a devotee is torn between plucking flowers for worship or letting the ‘sentient’ flowers be. The flowers accuse the man of cruelty, when he plucks the tender buds and pierces them with a needle to thread them into garlands or boils them to make perfume when they willingly scent the air and feed the bees. It was built into a poignant narrative by the dancer, who then finished with an energetic Abhogi (Adi) Nritta Lahari.
