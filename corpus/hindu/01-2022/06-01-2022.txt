The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) termed it “a major lapse in the security of PM”. It sought a detailed report from the State government and asked it to fix responsibility for the lapse and take strict action. Home Minister Amit Shah tweeted: “Such dereliction of security procedure in the Prime Minister’s visit is totally unacceptable and accountability will be fixed.” Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi dismissed that there was any security lapse. He said there was no threat at all to the Prime Minister’s security, even as he expressed ‘regret’ over the episode. “We respect our Prime Minister.” The incident took place as there was a sudden change in the Prime Minister’s itinerary. “The Prime Minister was to travel by helicopter and not by road. We were informed by the Prime Minister’s Office that he would be travelling by helicopter. It was at the spot that a decision to travel by road was taken by their [Central] agencies and officers. On the way, there were some agitators, who suddenly blocked the road with tractor-trolleys. There was no plan of Prime Minister to go on this road. The agitators are yet to be identified. Also, Prime Minister’s motorcade was stopped at a safe distance from the agitators. There was no attack or any danger to the Prime Minister or any security lapse. However, if there’s any lapse we will probe the matter,” Mr. Channi said. ‘Don’t indulge in politics’ “As elections are near, these agitations happen every day. Even I have been facing them. It’s a democratic system, people come on roads to air their concerns. The agitators were on the roads last night and our officers persuaded them to leave after talking to them. Farmers were peacefully protesting on Delhi borders for a year. Farmers have their demands and today, if some people were peacefully protesting here, then it should not be seen as a threat to the Prime Minister’s security. I am not going to use bullet or ‘lathis’ on the people of Punjab. I appeal to all, especially the BJP to not indulge in politics on the issue,” he said.

06 January 2022||BHUBANESWAR,||10.74 lakh birds flock to Chilika Lake||Chilika Lake, the largest brackish water lake and wintering ground of birds in the Indian subcontinent, saw a million birds, including the uncommon Mongolian gull, visiting the waterbody this year. As per the Water Bird Status Survey-2022 conducted in the Chilika, 10,74,173 water birds (107 species) and 37,953 individuals (76 wetland dependent species) were counted in the entire lagoon. Last year, the count in the Chilika was over 12 lakh. Members who were part of the census also reported sighting the Mongolian gull. The census was undertaken jointly on Tuesday by the Odisha State Wildlife Organisation, the Chilika Development Authority (CDA) and the Bombay Natural History Society. A total of 106 personnel, including bird experts from government- and non-government organisations, were deployed. The lagoon was divided strategically into 21 segments for the census. A total of 3,58,889 birds (97 species) were counted in Nalabana Bird Sanctuary — a decrease by 65,899 from the previous year. The decrease is attributed to high water level and presence of water in cultivated fields in adjoining areas. Water birds love to flock to large mudflats. “Among the three pintail species of ducks, the northern pintail (1,72,285), gadwall (1,53,985), Eurasian wigeon (1,50,843) accounted for over one lakh in this year’s count,” the report said. However, the population of gadwall and Eurasian wigeon was less than that of the previous year. There was a marginal decrease in the number of species such as the northern shoveler, tufted duck and red crested pochard. An increase in the population of the northern pintail, common coot and common pochard was noticed. ‘Highest in last decade’ “The increase in numbers for the greater flamingo at Nalabana mudflat indicates that the restoration at Nalabana is effective. This year’s greater flamingo count was the highest in the last decade. It is largely due to appropriate management of mudflats,” a CDA official said. Overall, the local resident species such as purple swamp-hen, purple heron, Indian moorhen, and jacanas were found in higher numbers. Chilika Lake hosts birds migrating from thousands of miles away from the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, Aral Sea, remote parts of Russia, Mongolia, Central and Southeast Asia, Ladakh and the Himalayas. The winged guests find the vast mud-field and abundant fish stock suitable to congregate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/1074-lakh-birds-flock-to-chilika-lake/article38141311.ece

Moreover, there is a need to ensure that people from Bengaluru do not go to their hometowns as there is a weekend curfew. If they go to their hometowns, they will be at a risk of passing on the virus to their relatives,” he said. Hospital bed reservation Keeping in mind the spike in cases, the State Government has issued an order directing private hospitals and private medical college hospitals to immediately reserve and keep ready 30% beds across all categories.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:35 IST,||Govt. says Rs. 8 lakh EWS income cap ‘best way forward’||The Centre, in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, backed its committee’s recommendation to retain the Rs. 8-lakh annual income criterion to identify the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society as the “best way forward” and urged the court to let NEET counselling continue. Appearing before a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and A.S. Bopanna, the government said it would not let anything come in the way of Other Backward Classes (OBC) and “poorest of the poor” getting the benefits of reservation. “We, as a government, will not accept any position whereby OBC or EWS is deprived of something that is legitimately due to them,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted. The government, meanwhile, said the NEET admission process could not wait for the conclusion of “lengthy arguments” in court. The court was hearing the case urgently following the Centre’s repeated oral requests on January 3 and 4 to list the case as NEET counselling was in limbo. On Wednesday, Mr. Mehta said the government’s statement in court on November 25 to put NEET counselling on hold while reviewing the EWS criterion had “never anticipated” the current situation. Resident doctors had clashed with the police amid protests in the Capital after the counselling was suspended. “Graduate and postgraduate counselling are stuck. We feel their [doctors’] issue is genuine. We need to respond to the bona fide request of doctors... There is a justified request from resident doctors to continue with the counselling... Society cannot go into lengthy arguments with the situation now... Let us proceed with the counselling,” Mr. Mehta conveyed a sense of urgency. But senior advocate Arvind Datar, for a petitioner, questioned the government’s plea to allow NEET counselling process to resume. “By counselling, does he [Mr. Mehta] mean the government will conclude NEET medical admissions on the basis of Rs. 8 lakh limit,” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-says-rs-8-lakh-ews-income-cap-best-way-forward/article38141154.ece

The administration has achieved 41% success in vaccinating children aged between 15 and 18.

The case has been listed for hearing on Thursday. The examination is scheduled to be held on January 7-9 and 15-16. In a statement, the UPSC said its decision to hold the examination as per the original schedule was taken “after carefully reviewing the situation prevailing due to the COVID-19 pandemic” and “keeping in view the restrictions and curbs being imposed by the governments to contain the disease”. It urged State governments to make public transport operational and to ensure that no inconvenience is caused to candidates and examination functionaries in their movement, especially those coming from containment or micro-containment zones. Plea hearing today On the eve of the first examination, the Delhi HC will hear a postponement plea filed by a bunch of candidates who have cleared the preliminary examination. They said they were forced to approach the court as they not only run the “imminent risk of getting infected, but also are at a risk of losing out on their valuable attempt, which for some candidates is also a last attempt to give the examinations”. The plea said the UPSC was maintaining the schedule in complete disregard of their legal and fundamental rights despite strict advisories including weekend curfews, night curfews, and shutdowns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/civil-services-main-exam-on-schedule-tomorrow/article38141304.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy. Mr. Jagan held a meeting with the officials concerned on Wednesday to discuss the matter. The meeting, however, was inconclusive. The Chief Minister is scheduled to meet them again on Thursday. Later, he is likely to meet the leaders of employees’ associations. A clarity on the PRC and fitment would emerge thereafter. The employees associations have been demanding that the fitment should not be less than the interim relief (IR) of 27% which is being extended now. They also wanted the government to see that the fitment was on a par with the Telangana State employees. The associations, during talks recently, had put forth various proposals, including 55%, 60% and 65%, employees say. The talks with the employees associations in the last week of December failed with the employees taking a firm stand that they would not accept 14.29%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/prc-cm-may-hold-talks-with-employees/article38141149.ece

Sudhakaran’s comment that party workers would uproot the markers placed by the government to demarcate the alignment of the proposed project, the Chief Minister said in Kumily on Wednesday that the project would be implemented even if opposed by vested interests. Inaugurating the valedictory function of the CPI(M) Idukki district conference, he said the UDF government had stopped national highway (NH) development works when some groups opposed it. But the LDF government completed NH development and the GAIL pipeline project with the support of the people.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:35 IST,||Pandemic shadow on plans for Republic Day programme||The growing shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic has put a question mark over the expected visits by several foreign dignitaries in January. Omicron and other recently identified variants are posing a challenge to international diplomatic travel that had eased somewhat over the past few months after the deadly second wave last year. The evolving COVID-19 situation in Gujarat is posing a threat to the Vibrant Gujarat Summit to be held between January 10 and 12. The three-day summit is expected to be attended by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, along with a delegation that will include the Governors of the Russian Far East. Prime Minister of Nepal Sher Bahadur Deuba is also expected to participate in the event, which is scheduled to draw high-level business and political participation from at least 27 countries that will include Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Qatar, Israel, Australia, Japan and Sri Lanka. The landmark event of India’s diplomatic calendar will be on January 26 when all the Presidents of the Central Asian Republics will arrive to attend the celebrations around Republic Day. The coming festivities are expected to take some evolving pandemic-related factors into consideration. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has tested positive for COVID-19 and Health Minister Satyendar Jain announced that Delhi is likely to register 10,000 infections on Wednesday. The daily positivity rate has reached 10%. In view of this, a diplomatic source expressed alarm over the “geometric increase” in the number of cases. Kazakhstan crisis Apart from that, Kazakhstan’s capital Almaty was placed under a state of emergency on Wednesday as a political crisis broke out over gas pricing. The crisis exploded at a time when the country put 16,468 persons under treatment for COVID-19. The Government of Kazakhstan has imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement, and entry and exit from Almaty has been restricted. Kazakhstan reported more than 400 cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday. The political crisis has escalated with widespread protests and unrest in Almaty. January was also expected to mark the 30th anniversary of establishment of bilateral ties between India and Israel with high-level visits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pandemic-shadow-on-plans-for-republic-day-pageantry/article38141060.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:36 IST,||BJP, Congress lock horns over security breach||A political slugfest broke out on Wednesday between the BJP and the Congress after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s motorcade, in a major security breach, got stranded on a flyover, 30 km from Hussainiwala in Punjab, as a group of protesting farmers blocked his route. Union Home Minister Amit Shah termed the incident a “Congress-made trailer” of how the party “thinks and functions”. He accused the party of colluding in the security breach. The Congress, through its general secretary, Randeep Singh Surjewala, in turn, accused the BJP of resorting to “unprecedented political drama” because of its “inability” to bring crowds to a political rally that was meant to be addressed by the Prime Minister. Union Minister Smriti Irani hit out at the Punjab government and the Congress, saying, “We know the Congress hates Prime Minister Modi, but today, they tried to harm the Prime Minister of India. Such is the breakdown of law and order in Punjab that the DGP claims he is incapable of providing support to the PMO and security detail.” ‘No security breach’ The Congress asserted that there was no security breach of Mr. Modi’s motorcade. Mr. Surjewala said, “Don’t bring down the prestige of the Prime Minister's Office [PMO] by dragging it into politics. Sensing defeat in Assembly polls, don’t try to use this in Uttar Pradesh.” Addressing a virtual press conference, Mr. Surjewala claimed that 10,000 security personnel were deployed at the Ferozepur rally venue, where the Prime Minister was to land by chopper, and the decision to travel to Hussainiwala by road was a last-minute one. SPG blamed There was no prior information from the PMO about any alternative travel route and the Special Protection Group, primarily responsible for the Prime Minister’s security, should not have allowed Mr. Modi to proceed until everything was clear, he said. He claimed that the BJP also knew that the Kisan Sangharsh Mazdoor Committee (KMSC) was opposing Mr. Modi’s visit and Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had two rounds of negotiations with them. “What should the police have done? Should the farmers have been shot dead,” he asked. “They are not terrorists, Naxalites and Maoists.” While he disapproved of a tweet from Youth Congress chief B.V. Srinivas, who said ‘Modi ji, how’s Josh!” on a social media platform, Mr. Surjewala criticised Ms. Irani for her “ill-tempered” remarks against the Congress. Different note The Aam Aadmi Party, considered the main challenger to the Congress in Punjab Assembly polls, struck a different note and made a caution on the security breach. “Any lapse in security of the Prime Minister is unacceptable. Whatever our differences may be, every State government must provide highest level of security for the Prime Minister,” tweeted the party’s Punjab in-charge Raghav Chadha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-congress-lock-horns-over-security-breach/article38141075.ece

Lav Agarwal, Joint secretary, Union Health Ministry, said the death of a person with co-morbidities had been reported from Rajasthan, and this was “technically” a Omicron-related death. The 73-year-old man, who was found infected with Omicron through genome sequencing, had tested negative for the infection twice. He died in a Udaipur hospital on December 31 due to post-COVID pneumonia coupled with co-morbidities — diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypothyroidism. He tested positive on December 15 and had been in hospital since then. At the weekly press conference, the Ministry indicated that the surge in COVID-19 cases was a matter of concern. Mr. Agarwal said India had reported a 6.3 times surge in the number of new cases in the past eight days. The case positivity had risen from 0.79% on December 29 to 5.03% on January 5. He added that 65.9% of the adult population had been fully vaccinated so far. “Currently, 28 districts are reporting more than 10% weekly positivity and 43 districts are reporting a weekly positivity between 5% and 10%. While there has been a sharp surge in cases across countries, hospitalisation has remained relatively lower as compared with the earlier surges,” he added. Indian Council of Medical Research chief Dr. Balram Bhargava said Omicron was now the predominant strain circulating in cities and all mass gatherings should be avoided. He also cautioned that the anti-viral drug, Molnupiravir, was not part of the national taskforce treatment protocol. “We are still looking into the drug,” he said.

The Ministry issued the revised guidelines for home isolation applicable to those who have been clinically assessed and assigned as mild /asymptomatic cases. It added that those suffering from immunocompromised status (HIV, transplant recipients, cancer therapy etc.) are not recommended for home isolation and shall be allowed home isolation only after proper evaluation by the treating medical officers. In another important revision, the Ministry noted that patients under home isolation would stand discharged and end isolation after at least seven days — from the existing 10 to 14 days — have passed from testing positive and no fever for three successive days and they shall continue wearing masks. “There is no need for retesting after the home isolation period is over. Asymptomatic contacts of infected individuals need not undergo test,” it stated. For the caregiver, the Ministry observed that this should ideally be someone who has completed the vaccination schedule and should be available to provide care on 24 x7 basis. “A communication link between the caregiver and a medical officer is a prerequisite for the entire duration of home isolation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/home-isolation-period-shortened/article38141092.ece

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:35 IST,||Pune police take ‘godman’ into custody||The Pune police on Wednesday took custody of controversial godman Kalicharan Maharaj from Raipur in connection with an alleged inflammatory speech case registered against him and five others last month. An official from the city’s Khadak police station where the case against the godman was lodged, said the Pune police took his custody from their Chhattisgarh counterparts and that he was brought to Pune following a transit remand granted by a Raipur court.  The godman had reportedly made inflammatory speeches designed to hurt the sentiments of minority communities during a “ Shivpratap Din ” programme held in Pune on December 19. The event was organised by the “ Samasta Hindu Aghadi ” — a fringe rightwing group headed by radical Hindutva leader Milind Ekbote — to mark the killing of the Adilshahi General Afzal Khan by the Maratha warrior King Shivaji in 1659 C.E.  As per the FIR later lodged at the Khadak police station on December 28, the godman, along with others including Mr. Ekbote, had allegedly delivered inflammatory speeches with an intention to hurt the religious sentiments of Muslims and Christians and to create a communal rift. Those booked include Nandakishor Ekbote, Mohanrao Shete, Dipak Nagpure and Captain Digendra Kumar, a Kargil war hero who retired from the Army in 2005 and was a speaker at the event. This is not the first time that either Kalicharan Maharaj or Mr. Ekbote has courted controversy. Mr. Ekbote, along with another Hindutva leader Sambhaji Bhide, was the prime accused in the violent clashes which marred the bicentenary celebrations of the battle of Bhima-Koregaon, on January 1, 2018 which had left one person dead besides aggravating social tensions across Maharashtra. Kalicharan Maharaj, too, has been booked in a case in Chhattisgarh for his alleged derogatory remarks against Mahatma Gandhi during an event in Raipur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pune-police-take-godman-into-custody/article38141053.ece

Expressing concern over growing bloodshed, he said the violence was a result of the lingering conflict. A joint team of the police, the Army’s 55 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) and the CRPF’s 182 Battalion trapped the three militants in a pre-dawn operation in Chandgam village of Pulwama. The police have identified two of the militants as Mir Owais from Pulwama’s Ashmander area and Talha Yasir, a Pakistani national. “Regarding the third terrorist, the recoveries made from the site of encounter indicate him to be a foreigner. His identification is being ascertained,” the police said. According to the police, Yasir was a mastermind in the preparation of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (IEDs). “Two M-4 carbines and one AK series rifle were recovered from the site of the encounter,” the police said. Vijay Kumar, IGP, described the operation “a big success”. Eight militants have been killed in the first five days of this year in back-to-back operations which includes a JeM “commander”. “As the year 2022 begins, each day since its beginning, precious lives of young boys are being lost in encounters, which is extremely sad.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:16 IST,||Matua community leaders upset with West Bengal BJP||From the individual defections after the 2021 Assembly election debacle, the West Bengal unit of the BJP at the start of 2022 is grappling with the discontent of leaders from the Matua community. Earlier this week, Union Minister and Bangaon MP Shantanu Thakur quit a number of WhatsApp groups of the State BJP, triggering speculation of rift among the party. “I am getting this feeling that those who are at the helm of affairs of the West Bengal BJP do not require me or the support of the Matua community,” Mr. Thakur said. The leaders of the Matua community, including Mr. Thakur who heads the Matua Mahasangha, have been demanding representation of leaders from the community in the committees of the State BJP. After taking over as the State BJP president, Sukanta Majumdar set up new committees at the State and district level. On Tuesday, four MLAs from the Matua community from North 24 Parganas and Nadia held a meeting at the Bongaon residence of Mr. Thakur. “We want to hold on to our vote bank…We are for the good of the BJP so that we can do well in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,” Ashok Kirtania , BJP MLA from Bongaon Uttar, said after the meeting. The Matua MLAs said there demands include changes in the BJP organisation in the Matua-dominated areas. The BJP central leadership has also reached out to Mr. Thakur, who was assigned the portfolio of the Minister of State for Ports, Shipping and Waterways in the reshuffle of the Union Council of Ministers last year. BJP president J.P. Nadda made a phone call to Mr. Thakur and wanted to know the reason for the differences. Wooed by the PM During the 2021 Assembly polls, the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made a lot of efforts to win the support of the community. On March 27, 2021, the day when the first phase of polling was held in West Bengal, the Prime Minister was visiting a temple at Orakandi in Bangladesh and paid obeisance to Harichand Thakur, the founder of the Matua sect. During the run-up for the Assembly polls, BJP leadership raised the issues of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, and promised citizenship to Matuas who constituted one-fifth of the State’s Scheduled Caste population. It was because of the aggressive wooing of the Matua vote bank that the BJP, which could not do well in south Bengal, won about five seats in areas with high population of the voters from the community. Political observers say unlike the past defections, the development on this occasion is a matter of a serious concern. Mr. Majumdar had described these developments as “internal issue of the party” and expressed hope that these will be sorted out with “discussions within the party”. The TMC leadership has not spared the opportunity to fish in the troubled waters. Party leader and Minister Jyotipriya Mullick said Matua leaders are welcome to join the TMC and be part of the State’s development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/matua-community-leaders-upset-with-west-bengal-bjp/article38141419.ece

While Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi continues to establish himself as an assertive leader, Mr. Sidhu has been relentlessly bashing the government on various issues, mainly those surrounding the ‘non-delivery of justice’ in the 2015 sacrilege incidents and the drugs menace. Also, as Mr. Sidhu continues to rake up various issues in an attempt to get the Sikh (panthic) votes, there is an increasing feeling in the political and party circles that ‘over-focusing’ on Sikh issues may result in the party losing substantial support of the Hindu vote bank. Party insiders feel that after it indicated that the coming polls will be fought under ‘collective leadership’, Mr. Sidhu has sharpened his attack on the government as a ‘pressure’ tactic aimed at the announcement of Chief Minister. A party worker said that if the chief of party would continue to rant publicly against his own government, then how will a party worker take a stand for his government’s work on the ground and fight the Opposition parties. Notably, irked over Mr. Sidhu’s repeated attacks on the government, national coordinator of All India Congress Committee and spokesperson of Punjab Congress Pritpal Singh Baliawal recently quit the party, expressing his inability “to defend the nonsense, anti-party, anti-government remarks” of Mr. Sidhu. As the chaos in the party refuses to show any sign of settling down, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Technical Education Minister Rana Gurjit Singh have publicly aired their differences over the “utterances” of Mr. Sidhu against the government. Sources said that a section of party leaders were pressing for the removal of Mr. Sidhu from his post before it was “too late” in the run-up to Assembly polls. Amarinder’s resignation With polls a few months away, the Congress has been struggling to set its house in order in Punjab even after the Congress ‘high command’ cornered Captain Amarinder Singh (retd.) into resigning from the post of Chief Minister amid his power tussle with Mr. Sidhu. Former State Congress chief and party’s chairman of the 2022 Assembly election campaign committee Sunil Jakhar said there was no doubt that repeated anti-government statements on public platforms would lower the morale of the party members – be it workers or leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sidhus-rebuke-makes-congress-anxious/article38141072.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:36 IST,||One more youth arrested in app case||The Mumbai Police on Wednesday said that so far three people had been arrested in connection with the ‘Bulli Bai’ app, which targeted Muslim women by putting up their photos online for auction. Addressing a press conference, Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale also expressed displeasure over comments made on the ongoing investigation by authorities outside Maharashtra. “Generally, we don’t speak on cases outside our State. It is better not to issue a statement if one has no detailed information about the case,” he said, adding that the comments had been unnecessary. Mayank Rawal (21) was arrested by the Mumbai Police from Uttarakhand in the early hours of Wednesday in the case. Shweta Singh (19) was arrested on Tuesday from the same State, while engineering student Vishal Kumar Jha (21) was held from Bengaluru on Monday. The police suspect that more people are likely to be involved in the matter. Probing the source Mr. Nagrale, when asked about similar complaints, said that the force will take cognisance of the matter, irrespective of which community is affected. He did not comment on the investigation by the Delhi Police in the ‘Sulli Deals’ case and whether the present probe had connections to the one carried out by the Delhi Police. Mr. Nagrale maintained that the Mumbai Police’s investigation was barely three days old and it would not be possible to connect the two cases at the moment. Mr. Nagrale said that the police were also probing why some of the Twitter handles which promoted the app used Sikh-sounding names. Some of these handles had names such as “Khalsa Supremacist”, “Jatinder Singh Bhullar”, “Harpal” and “Sage”, he said. “The probe is on and anyone involved in the crime directly or indirectly will be arrested and prosecuted. As the investigation is of a sensitive nature, we will not be able to share more details,” he said, assuring that the cyber cell will go to the root of the matter. Too early to say “As per the status of the handle [linked to the app], it says Bulli Bai is a community-driven open source app by the Khalsa Sikh force. So why this is there — that is part of our investigation. It is too early to say exactly what was the aim of the entire exercise,” he added. The Mumbai Police registered a first information report (FIR) after receiving a complaint about the app on January 2, following which investigators started a technical analysis of the app and the related Twitter handle, Mr. Nagrale said. This Twitter handle, bearing the same name as the app, had been created to promote the app’s website on social media. “During the technical analysis, we collected information on the followers of the app and launched a hunt for the accused,” he said, adding that Bengaluru-based Vishal Kumar Jha was one of the five followers of the handle. “If any person wanted to share information about the case, he or she could contact the Mumbai Cyber Police. The police will find out who was the mastermind, what was the motive, whether the arrested accused were paid, and who paid them,” Mr. Nagrale said in his statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/one-more-youth-arrested-in-app-case/article38141076.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:35 IST,||‘Asthana made police chief in public interest’||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has informed the Supreme Court that Indian Police Service officer Rakesh Asthana was granted extension of service and appointed Delhi Police Commissioner as a “special case of public interest” taking into consideration riots, crimes and “certain untoward and extremely challenging public order problems” with “international implications” witnessed in the capital. “Rakesh Asthana, IPS, has been granted extension of service and has been appointed the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, initially for a period of one year beyond the date of superannuation on July 31, 2021 or until further orders, whichever is earlier, in relaxation of 16(1) of the AIS (DCRB) Rules, 1958 as a special case in public interest,” the Ministry said in an affidavit. The government dismissed the petition filed by Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), challenging the appointment as an “abuse of process of law and manifestly an outcome of some personal vendetta against the incumbent Police Commissioner”. The MHA has argued that eight Delhi Police Commissioners had been appointed by the same procedure without any complaints from the petitioner. The competent authority felt it necessary to have an experienced police officer like Mr. Asthana to head the Delhi force to “effectively negotiate and handle the peculiar policing needs, the law and order situation in the National Capital of GNCT of Delhi”, the MHA said. Mr. Asthana, who is also a respondent in the case, in a separate affidavit, said the petitions were filed in the court following a scathing social media campaign to malign his reputation. He echoed the government’s version that the petitioner harboured a personal vendetta against him. He maintained that the petitioner was indulging in “selective criticism”. On Wednesday, a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud adjourned the case to January 11.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/asthana-made-police-chief-in-public-interest/article38141058.ece

The Bench comprising Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and A.J. Shastri made the directive to Vishal Vyas, a local journalist who runs Samna Bharstachar Ka, against which contempt of court proceedings was initiated in 2014.  On Monday, Mr. Vyas appeared as a party in person and addressed the court in the Gujarati language. However, the Chief Justice remarked that English would be the language in the court and Mr. Vyas should speak in that language. The Chief Justice even offered him the help of an interpreter or even a lawyer if needed. He also suggested to get the help of the Gujarat State Legal Services Authority if Mr. Vyas could not afford a lawyer for himself. The contemnor continued speaking in Gujarati and insisted on it. His insistence of speaking only in Gujarati prompted the Bench to remark that it was not acceptable, and refused to accept his submissions. In the High Court, there is a rule that even if any party who does not hire a lawyer and appears in person, he has to speak and argue in English only. The Bench also underlined that the Article 348 of the Constitution mandates that the language of the High Court would be English.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/english-is-the-language-of-court-says-gujarat-hc/article38141061.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:36 IST,||Sri Lanka court releases 13 T.N. fishermen||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin wrote to the Centre seeking the early release of the fishermen, while pointing to an “alarming frequency” of Sri Lanka arresting Indian fishermen. The year 2021 proved a particularly tragic year for Tamil Nadu fishermen. Five fishermen were found dead after they went fishing in the Palk Strait for a meagre daily wage. Fishermen’s associations accused the Sri Lankan Navy of attacking them, an allegation that Sri Lankan authorities deny. Further, Sri Lankan arrested 231 Indian fishermen in 2021, the highest number of arrests [of Indian fishermen] made by the Navy in a year, since 2017. The Palk Bay fisheries conflict affecting fisherfolk of Tamil Nadu and northern Sri Lanka remains a contentious bilateral issue, after many failed attempts by India and Sri Lanka to resolve it in the last decade. War-affected northern Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen have repeatedly asked their counterparts in Tamil Nadu to stop using the bottom-trawling fishing method, banned in Sri Lanka and considered destructive the world over. Tamil Nadu fishermen are yet to agree to the demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sri-lanka-court-releases-13-tn-fishermen/article38141068.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:36 IST,||PM’s convoy caught in Punjab protest||The incident took place as there was a sudden change in the Prime Minister’s travel programme. “The Prime Minister was to travel by helicopter and not by road. We were informed by the Prime Minister’s Office that he would be travelling by helicopter. It was at the spot that a decision to travel by road was taken by their [Central] agencies and officers. On the way, there were some agitators, who suddenly blocked the road with tractor-trolleys. The agitators are yet to be identified. Also, the PM’s motorcade was stopped at a safe distance from the agitators and our officers requested that it would be better to take an alternative route. There was no danger to the PM or any security lapse. However, if there was any lapse, we will probe the matter,” Mr. Channi said. “As elections are near, these agitations happen every day. Even I have been facing them. It’s a democratic system, people come on roads to air their concerns. The agitators were on the roads last night and our officers persuaded them to leave after talking to them. Farmers were peacefully protesting on Delhi borders for a year. Farmers have their demands and today, if some people were peacefully protesting here, then it should not be seen as a threat to the Prime Minister’s security. I am not going to use bullet or ‘lathis’ on the people of Punjab. I appeal to all, especially the BJP to not indulge in politics on the issue. We have every respect for our Prime Minister,” Mr. Channi added. According to an MHA statement, Mr. Modi landed at Bathinda in the morning from where he was to go to the National Martyrs Memorial by helicopter. “Due to rain and poor visibility, PM waited for about 20 minutes for the weather to clear out. When the weather didn’t improve, he proceeded to travel by road after confirmation of necessary security arrangements by the DGP, Punjab,” it said. “Around 30 km away from the National Martyrs Memorial, when the PM’s convoy reached a flyover, it was found that the road was blocked by some protesters. The PM was stuck on the flyover for 15-20 minutes. This was a major lapse in the security of PM,” the MHA said. “After this lapse, it was decided to head back to Bathinda airport,” it stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pms-convoy-caught-in-punjab-protest/article38141069.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:36 IST,||Govt. says Rs. 8 lakh cap ‘best way forward’||“Graduate and postgraduate counselling are stuck. We feel their [doctors’] issue is genuine. We need to respond to the bona fide request of doctors... There is a justified request from resident doctors to continue with the counselling... Society cannot go into lengthy arguments with the situation now... Let us proceed with the counselling,” Mr. Mehta conveyed a sense of urgency. But senior advocate Arvind Datar, for a petitioner, questioned the government’s plea to allow NEET counselling process to resume. “By counselling, does he [Mr. Mehta] mean the government will conclude NEET medical admissions on the basis of Rs. 8 lakh limit,” he asked. The government committee report showed that no exercise was undertaken before the Rs. 8 lakh threshold was fixed to identify EWS. “There was no application of mind... And now they are trying to justify the Rs. 8 lakh limit,” he stated. The cloud of doubt about the Rs. 8 lakh limit has led to a serious situation. “The entire counselling has been stopped,” he observed. The case started in the top court with several NEET aspirants challenging a July 29, 2021 notification of the Centre announcing 27% quota to OBCs and 10% reservation to EWS in the All India Quota (AIQ) for NEET. The hearings, however. took an unexpected turn in October-November last year when the court itself started questioning the very basis of the income criterion of Rs. 8 lakh to determine EWS, asking whether the figure came out of “thin air” or was even an automatic adoption of the OBC criteria. ‘Grossly unfair’ Senior advocate Shyam Divan, for another petitioner, said the July 29 notification came five months after the NEET admission process commenced in March. “The government cannot change the rules of the game after game has begun. This is grossly unfair,” he submitted. He also questioned the OBC quota in AIQ. The court adjourned the hearing to Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-says-rs-8-lakh-cap-best-way-forward/article38141070.ece

Sources said a decision will soon be taken by Pradesh Congress Committees (PCCs) in other poll-bound States such as Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur after assessing the COVID-19 situation.  Though All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for U.P. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra cited the surge in COVID-19 cases for postponing large gatherings, the decision to call off the marathons for girls under the banner Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon [I’m a girl, I can also fight] may have been prompted by the stampede-like scare in Bareilly on Tuesday morning in which three girls were injured.  Following this, the marathon events at Azamgarh, Varanasi, Ghaziabad and Aligarh have been cancelled.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:37 IST,||Traditional vaccines just as effective, says scientist||Vaccines like Biological E’s Corbevax and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin that are made by traditional methods are “just as effective” as the latest mRNA technology-based vaccines, says U.S. scientist and vaccine developer Dr. Peter Hotez. He announced last week that his research teams would transfer production technology to companies in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Botswana free of patents. According to Dr. Hotez, who is the dean of Houston-based Baylor College of Medicine’s Tropical Medicines School and chair at Texas Children’s Hospital, the traditional “protein subunit vaccines” and “live inactivated vaccines” are cheaper and simpler to produce at the scale required for low- and middle-income countries. New technology  “We never really saw the advantage of mRNA, at least for a global health vaccine… because it’s a brand new technology and it’s going to take years to figure out how you scale it up to make nine billion doses for Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America,” Dr. Hotez told The Hindu in an interview, where he called the new vaccines “shiny new toys”.  Science policy makers, particularly in the U.S., were “too focused” on speed and innovation and not on ensuring universal vaccination, he noted. In particular, he said the method developed by him and Dr. Maria Elena Bottazzi through the same “yeast fermentation expression technology” used to make the Recombinant Hepatitis-B vaccine first approved in the 1980s, was also safe for children, and less likely to cause vaccine hesitancy among parents, as it has been used for decades. Focus on quantity Given that even after three or four doses, mRNA vaccines were not effective in stopping COVID-19 variants such as Omicron, it was necessary to “balance the portfolio” by focusing on quantity of vaccines rather than the newest technology, Dr. Hotez observed. Traditional vaccines such as a virion (entire virus particle) and subunit ones (pathogen fragment) contain inactivated parts of the virus that enter the body as antigens and trigger an immune response. mRNA or DNA vaccines contain modified genes that use the body’s cells to make the immune-triggering antigen. “Delta arose out of an unvaccinated population in India in 2021. Then Omicron arose out of an unvaccinated population in southern Africa later in the year, and as long as we refuse to vaccinate the world’s low- and middle-income countries, Mother Nature will continue to deliver horrible new variants of concern,” Dr. Hotez stated. At present the world “just needs vaccines that work”.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:36 IST,||Hallmarks of bhakti||Bhakti is derived from the root ‘Bhaj,’ and primarily manifests as adoration, and loving, selfless service to God. What is the reason for bhakti? Krishna states that many pray to Him for various reasons. Some may seek His help to fulfil their desires and ambitions in life. Or some others want relief from the distress and dangers they have to face in life. He grants the wishes of all those who seek Him since they are His devotees, though each one’s purpose of bhakti may differ. He knows that in due course, people will develop faith in God and gradually also realise the value of the highest Purushartha liberation and seek His feet for this purpose. In a discourse, Sri B. Damodhara Dikshitar drew attention to how the Narayaneeyam showcases the instances of many devout souls whose bhakti has no motive, not even salvation, and who only wish to remain in selfless devotional service to the Lord at all times. The composer Narayana Bhattatiri is a poet and philosopher who rightly points out that Brahman, who is difficult to attain, is available in the form of the deity in the temple in Guruvayur and can be experienced and realised by all. At the outset he hails the deity as the embodiment of the highest truth and reality. He states that humanity is fortunate to experience such a manifestation of Divinity that even the Upanishads struggle to describe for want of suitable comparisons. The fact that sugar is sweet is accepted but how is one to describe sweetness? It is for each one to get into the spiritual experience of devotion that establishes a rapport with God. Bhakti is a means to know God but once it takes root, the single-minded aim to serve God alone dominates. There is no other motive or expectation other than selfless service since such a devotee does not care for even mukti.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hallmarks-of-bhakti/article38141080.ece

The petition filed by advocate Abha Singh argued that the September 24, 2021, order of a single judge Bench of the HC was a “death blow” to freedom of speech and expression enshrined in Article 19. The petition said right to free speech can be curbed only if it interferes with the administration of justice. Any injunction on the right of the people to know facts is an encroachment on their right to information. “In matters of women empowerment, public discourse plays a crucial role in shaping the nature of legal entitlements that are delivered to women,” the petition argued. It said the order may have a “ripple effect” and deter survivors from approaching courts as well as setting a dangerous precedent for trial cases. “The same will legitimise undue protection to sexual offenders.” The guidelines were formed by Justice G.S.

Mr. Wankhede was loaned to NCB in September 2020 in the middle of a row over the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput to probe the alleged drug angle in the case. He kept receiving extensions to serve the NCB. His controversial conduct in the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan was pointed out by Mr. Malik, which further led to a series of exposés and allegations against the officer. ‘Bar license’ In his complaint letter dated December 15, 2021, Mr. Malik has said Mr. Wankhede, an IRS officer, holds a permit room/ bar license in his name from October 29, 1997, till date, and he is operating a hotel and a bar named Sadguru Hotel in the Vashi area of Navi Mumbai. “Is a Central government servant eligible to hold and operate a permit room and a bar license in his name?” he asked. The complaint says the license was first approved on October 29, 1997, when Mr. Wankhede was a minor. ‘False representation’ The letter says: “He has [been] declaring his property as an inheritance received on the demise of his mother Mrs Zahida Dyandeo Wankhede who expired on 16/04/2015. It is clear from the fact that the declaration made by Mr. Wankhede regarding mode of acquiring the property is clearly a false representation to hide true facts.” Based on the complaint filed by Mr. Malik, the DGV asked him last week to confirm whether the complaint had been sent by him. On January 3, Mr. Malik replied to Vinod Kumar Agrawal, Additional Commissioner, DGV, that it was indeed he who had sent the complaint for necessary action.

Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh issued an order to this effect in the wake of surge in the new COVID-19 cases from around 700 three days ago to nearly 1,500 on Tuesday. The GCC has instructed managements of all the halls to ensure adherence to the COVID-19 guidelines as stipulated by the State government. Information about the booking of the halls can be conveyed through an online link:http://covid19. chennaicorporation. gov.in/covid/marriage_hall/. The order said that although the guidelines issued by the State government on October 20 stated that only a maximum of 100 guests can attend weddings, there were reports of the norm being violated in many cases. The order was issued as under the Disaster Management Act. Any refusal to comply with the norms would attract penal provisions of the Section 51 of the Act, the order said. Enforcement drive Meanwhile, the Greater Chennai police booked over 10,000 people for not wearing masks in public places in violation of COVID-19 safety protocol and collected a fine of over Rs. 20 lakh since Sunday. Commissioner of Police Shankar Jiwal had constituted “special mask enforcement” teams comprising police inspectors and policemen. The teams stopped those not wearing the masks in public places and fined them. A senior police officer said: “These special teams conducted an intensive drive across the city since Sunday and booked 10,321 cases until Tuesday against persons who failed to wear masks. Fine totalling Rs. 20,64,200 was collected from them.” “As many as 41 cases were booked for violation of COVID-19 “lockdown” restrictions and seven more cases were booked for not maintaining physical distancing norms. As many as 371 vehicles were seized,” the official said. This intensive drive would continue across the city, the officer added.

NDRF funds for flood relief, T.N. urges Centre||The Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday urged the Centre to release funds totalling about Rs. 6,230 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund immediately to ameliorate the effects of damage caused by the recent heavy rain and flooding.  During his customary address to the State Legislative Assembly session in Kalaivanar Arangam that commenced with the singing of the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu , Governor R.N. Ravi said extensive damage to roads, bridges, waterbodies and crops was reported during the northeast monsoon. The government has submitted detailed memoranda seeking funds to the tune of Rs. 6,230 crore to undertake relief and restoration work.  “We urge that funds from National Disaster Response Fund be released immediately, in order to ameliorate the effects of damage caused by the floods,” the Governor said. Under the direct supervision of the Chief Minister, there was timely release of surplus water from dams and reservoirs as a precautionary measure, he said and added: “It is praiseworthy that the Chief Minister led from the front, personally visiting the affected districts and ensuring that immediate relief was provided to the affected people.” Noting that though Tamil Nadu was endowed with rich mineral resources, the State government did not realise adequate revenues from mining, the Governor said: “In fact, revenues from mining have stagnated over the last decade.” In order to carry out mining in an ecologically sustainable manner and mobilise revenue for the government, a ‘Natural Resources Management Plan’ would be formulated, he said. The Tamil Nadu government also urged the GST Council and the Union Finance Ministry to continue the GST compensation at least till June 30, 2024, contending that the State’s revenues were yet to recover from the pandemic. Tax collection Since the introduction of GST, the State was not able to realise the high growth of tax collections that it had witnessed during the VAT regime, he said. “The COVID pandemic has further exacerbated this problem. The State’s revenues are yet to recover and it would adversely impact the State finances if the compensation is not extended for at least two more years,” he said, reading out from a prepared speech. A detailed action plan titled ‘Towards One Trillion Dollar Economy’ would be prepared to ensure that the State government’s vision of ‘One Trillion Dollar Economy’ by 2030 is realised, he said. The State government also strongly urged the Centre to take immediate steps to release 68 fishermen and 75 fishing boats belonging to Tamil Nadu presently in Sri Lankan custody (A Sri Lankan court released 13 fishermen on Wednesday). To safeguard fishermen from natural calamities, the State government plans to establish transponders in all mechanised boats in the State to provide a seamless communication system, he said. ‘NEET unnecessary’ Mr. Ravi, who read out from a prepared speech, said entrance exams created an unequal platform by being inherently discriminatory against rural students. “Hence, this government is of the firm view that entrance exams like NEET are unnecessary for student admissions to professional courses and will continue to reiterate this position."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/release-rs-6230-cr-ndrf-funds-for-flood-relief-tn-urges-centre/article38141257.ece

Ravi said in the Assembly on Wednesday. Commending the leadership of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, he requested people to continue their co-operation with the government. “In order to prevent the spread of this variant, the government has strengthened testing and checking protocols at international airports.” Based on the experience gained during the second wave of the pandemic, Tamil Nadu established facilities for genome sequencing, one of the first States to do so, Mr. Ravi said. The government was augmenting RT-PCR testing facilities, installing oxygen plants and increasing the number of ICU beds. He congratulated the Chief Minister on “galvanising the entire government machinery and effectively managing the second wave of the pandemic” by ramping up health infrastructure, ensuring availability of oxygen and essential drugs and speeding up the vaccination drive. The government’s strategy for “successfully containing the second wave without significantly affecting people’s livelihood and economy has served as a model for the entire nation”, the Governor said. Rapid vaccination When the government assumed office, the vaccination coverage had been low, with only 8.09% of the eligible population having been administered the first dose and 2.84% the second dose. “In just seven months, due to the concerted efforts of this government, the vaccination coverage has been increased to 86.95% for the first dose and 60.71% for the second dose, with a total of 8.55 crore doses having been administered.” The Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund had so far received Rs. 543 crore in donations, and Rs. 541.64 crore had been spent on measures to tackle the pandemic. In line with the policy announced by the Prime Minister on December 25 last year, the State expanded the vaccination programme to children aged 15-18, and it would provide a precaution dose to front-line and health workers and vulnerable sections aged above 60, he said. The government was providing Rs. 25 lakh ex gratia each to the families of front-line workers who lost their lives to COVID-19 and Rs. 5 lakh each to children who lost their parents to the disease. Further, it ordered Rs. 50,000 ex gratia each from the State Disaster Response Fund to the kin of the COVID-19 victims, he said. So far, relief had been given to 27,432 families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-fully-ready-to-handle-omicron-governor/article38141259.ece

Director of Public Health T.S. Selvavinayagam pointed out in a circular that the cases had been increasing throughout Tamil Nadu since December 29. The number of fresh cases went up to 2,731 on January 4 from 619 on December 28. The surge also drove up the number of active cases. Experience from the U.S., the U.K. and France suggested that the number of active cases during peak period might be three to four times that of the previous peak. A big challenge The surge could strain the health infrastructure, if not managed systematically, Dr. Selvavinayagam said. All Deputy Directors of Health Services were told to convert one upgraded primary health centre in each block into an interim COVID-19 care centre. Patients with mild and moderate infection should be admitted there. Proper partition should be established between persons with suspected symptoms and confirmed cases. All antenatal clinic and delivery services should be shifted to the nearest primary health centres, according to the circular.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/upgrade-phcs-as-covid-19-care-centres/article38141249.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:27 IST,TAMIL NADU||DMK govt. has let down 35 lakh jewel loanees: EPS||Leader of the Opposition and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday accused the DMK government of having “let down” about 35 lakh people who had taken jewel loans from cooperative institutions. Clarifying that his party walked out of the Assembly during the Governor’s address as a mark of protest, Mr. Palaniswami told journalists at Kalaivanar Arangam, the venue of the Assembly, that even during the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the DMK chief and then Leader of the Opposition, M.K. Stalin, gave the electors an “enticing promise” of waiver of loans taken from the cooperative banks and the nationalised banks against jewels of up to five sovereigns. In its manifesto for the 2021 Assembly election, the DMK repeated the promise. But several conditions were imposed, and out of 48 lakh loanees, around 35 lakhs were rendered ineligible now. “Had the party mentioned in its manifesto that it would implement the scheme subject to certain conditions, the 35 lakh persons would not have been cheated,” he contended. Expressing sadness over the police becoming a “puppet” of the ruling party, the former Chief Minister alleged AIADMK volunteers were being detained unlawfully. False cases were filed against former Ministers and office-bearers, including those from the party’s information technology wing. Criticising the government for having allowed law and order to deteriorate, he blamed it for not tackling the flooding in Chennai effectively. Pointing out that the AIADMK government provided Rs. 2,500 in cash support and other gifts to the ration card-holders for the 2021 Pongal festival, Mr. Palaniswami faulted the government for not making a similar announcement. To a question on the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test, he reiterated his party’s opposition to it. In a statement, Mr. Panneerselvam came down heavily on the DMK government on the issue of vaccination, arguing that it had “suppressed” the facts, in the Governor’s address, about the circumstances surrounding the status of the drive when his party was in power. When the drive rolled out on January 16, 2021, the AIADMK government was left with only three-and-a-half months before the Assembly election, and the model code was in force for over two months. Besides, the DMK and its allies had undertaken a “mischievous campaign” against vaccination and there was reluctance among people to get themselves vaccinated. Likewise, it was “ridiculous” to portray the payment of compensation of Rs. 50,000 each to the legal heirs of the COVID-19 victims as an “achievement” because this was done at the instance of the Supreme Court. The compensation of Rs. 6,038 per hectare for rain-affected farmers for purchase of inputs to facilitate re-plantation remained a mere “announcement”. The address was silent on Kerala’s withdrawal of permission to cut trees at the site of the Mullaperiyar dam and on Katchatheevu, an islet in the Palk Bay region, which became part of Sri Lanka following the bilateral treaties in the 1970s. Besides, the early release of the seven convicts in the the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the reversion to the monthly billing cycle for power consumption, waiver of educational loans, the provision of additional quantity of sugar and ‘urad’ dal at fair price shops and the launch of a scheme to give Rs. 1,000 each to women had not been covered in the address, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-govt-has-let-down-35-lakh-jewel-loanees-eps/article38141253.ece

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:26 IST,TAMIL NADU||High Court dismisses appeal challenging order against acquisition of Veda Nilayam||The Madras High Court on Wednesday dismissed writ appeals preferred by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and former Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam against a single judge’s order quashing the State acquisition of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s Poes Garden residence Veda Nilayam to convert it into a memorial. A Division Bench of Justices Paresh Upadhyay and Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup concurred with Justice N. Seshasayee that there were procedural irregularities in the proceedings initiated during the AIADMK regime for acquiring the bungalow under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. No substantial ground The Bench also agreed with senior counsel AR.L. Sundaresan and Satish Parasaran, representing Jayalalithaa’s nephew J. Deepak and niece J. Deepa, that the appellants before the court had not raised any substantial ground to explain how the findings of the single judge, with respect to procedural irregularities, were contrary to record. Pointing out that Mr. Deepak and Ms. Deepa had been declared as the legal heirs of Jayalalithaa by another Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran (since retired) and Abdul Quddhose, the Bench led by Justice Upadhyay said the objections raised by the siblings to the acquisition proceedings were not considered properly by the State. “The State did not even accept the status of the writ petitioners (before the single judge) to be the owners of the said property... For the above reasons, we are in agreement with the finding recorded in the impugned (under challenge) judgment that the acquisition in question was procedurally illegal and we confirm the said part of the judgement,” the Bench wrote. Authoring the verdict, Justice Upadhyay also held that there was no public purpose, as envisaged under the 2013 Act, behind the acquisition of the private property by the State. He also pointed out that the present writ appeals had been filed by third parties who were not at all represented before the single judge. Though AIADMK claimed that there was no occasion for it to get impleaded in the proceedings before the single judge because then the State government was pursuing the matter earnestly, the Bench wrote: “This stand indicates that at the relevant time, AIADMK misconstrued itself as ‘appropriate Government’ which it was not.” Since the State had now decided to accept the single judge’s verdict and handed over the keys of the bungalow to the legal heirs, the Division Bench held that the government could not be forced by the court to pursue the acquisition proceedings. “According to us, it would be neither legal nor proper to give any such direction,” it concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmks-appeal-in-veda-nilayam-case-dismissed-by-high-court/article38141312.ece

Baalu on Wednesday demanded the resignation of Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi for not forwarding the Bill seeking exemption from NEET for undergraduate medical course admission for Presidential assent. Talking to reporters in New Delhi after an all-party MPs’ delegation was “denied appointment” to meet Home Minister Amit Shah for the second time in a week, Mr. Baalu said the Governor had not sent the Bill even three months after it was adopted in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly. “The Chief Minister himself met the Governor to request him to send the Bill to the Home Minister so that it could be placed before the President. It [not forwarding the Bill] is against the Constitution. The Governor who took oath in the name of the Constitution had buried it fathom deep,” Mr. Baalu charged. Reiterating that the Governor was responsible for the stalemate, Mr. Baalu said even though the Tamil Nadu delegation was given an appointment on December 29, it was cancelled at the last minute and the subsequent efforts to meet the Home Minister failed to materialise. ‘Unable to meet Shah’ “He is not meeting us even after a letter from the President’s office informed us that our request had been forwarded to Mr. Shah. We were told Mr. Shah would take action on our request. We expected an invitation from Mr. Shah for a meeting. But it has not happened. It is highly condemnable,” Mr. Baalu said. He said while the Governor had failed to forward the resolution, Mr. Shah’s action suggested that he was in agreement with Governor. Mr. Baalu felt political reasons could be behind Mr. Shah’s refusal to meet him and other MPs from State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tr-baalu-demands-resignation-of-tn-governor/article38141251.ece

Ravi informed the Assembly on Wednesday. He said the government would take stringent measures to prevent the sale of drugs near educational institutions. During his address, he said a massive exercise at the grassroots had been undertaken to bring dropouts back to school. “Using a GPS-enabled mobile application and with 80,000 surveyors drawn from various departments, 1,73,792 children have been identified and enrolled in age-appropriate classes.”  The government, he said, was “promoting” the dual language policy by bringing together a passion for mother tongue Tamil and proficiency in the global language English, spreading the values of inclusive growth through social justice and developing a scientific temper and an entrepreneurial spirit for the holistic development of the young generation. Through the ‘ Engum Tamizh Edhilum Tamizh ’ scheme, the usage of Tamil language would be popularised at all government institutions, private schools, shops and commercial establishments. “Guidelines will be framed under the Tamil Nadu Official Language Act, 1956, to implement this scheme. In order to encourage students of Tamil medium, 100 textbooks in various subjects of professional courses are being translated into Tamil.”  The mission-mode programme, ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’, was initiated to close the learning losses among students of Classes I-VIII because of the lack of access to structured education during the lockdown. It was successfully implemented in 12 districts on a pilot basis, and was being extended to the entire State, he said. The government would set up smart classrooms at all 24,345 government primary schools, augment infrastructure to accommodate more students and create high-tech computer, science and language laboratories at all 6,992 middle, high and higher secondary schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/173-lakh-dropouts-brought-back-to-school/article38141264.ece

Under open access, industrial users and commercial buildings are allowed to buy cheaper power directly from private generators, without depending on the State utility. The aim is to increase competitiveness and efficiency in the power sector, and the loss of revenue to Tangedco on account of open access is compensated with the levy of a cross-subsidy surcharge and an additional surcharge. The solar open access installations in India stood at 307 MW in the third quarter of 2021, up from 166 MW in the comparable period the previous year. Uttar Pradesh was the top State, accounting for 35% of the installations, followed by Tamil Nadu with 31%, Maharashtra 11%, Gujarat 10%, and Karnataka 7%, Mercom said. These States accounted for 96% of the total installations. Tamil Nadu showed significant growth, thanks to the State’s favourable regulatory framework and tariff structure. The State houses many large industries with a huge power demand, Mercom said. According to Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission, the State levies an additional surcharge of Rs. 0.70 a unit and a cross-subsidy surcharge of Rs. 1.67 a unit on open access consumers, and the rates are lesser than those charged by Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Tamil Nadu surpassed Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Andra Pradesh to become the second largest State with cumulative open access solar installations. Tamil Nadu has 541 MW of open access solar projects, 9% of the total installed capacity, 4800 MW, as in September last. However, Mercom said Tamil Nadu had a conducive policy, but getting approval was extremely tough.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/solar-open-access-installations-381-jump-in-third-quarter-of-2021/article38141560.ece

Sameeran said at a press meet on Wednesday. ‘Wear mask’ “The number of new COVID-19 cases that was 70-100 a day until recently is on the increase. Today, 250 persons have reported positive. Therefore, it becomes important that people wear mask, observe physical distancing and follow all other safety guidelines.” As of Wednesday, there were around 1,000 active COVID-19 cases in the district.

Raja M. Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters’ Association, told presspersons in Tiruppur on Wednesday that in the last one year, cotton yarn prices have shot up 80 %. The yarn prices were increased by Rs. 30 a kg this week. “It is not just the high prices but the uncertainty that is affecting the exporters as they cannot negotiate higher prices for orders already booked and are under execution,” he said. Production peaks at garment exporting units between November and March every financial year and the high input cost at this period is a neck breaker. “We need to safeguard the sustenance of this industry. The government should intervene at this juncture as this (garment industry) is also a labour-intensive industry,” he said. Cotton and yarn prices have been increased to abnormal levels and the effect of this hike will trigger a disastrous effect on Tiruppur knitwear garment exporting sector. It will have a cascading effect on all stakeholders of knitwear garment exporting units, including banks and cotton producing farmers. Mr. Shanmugham said he is trying to meet the Union Textile Minister to explain the challenges that the exporters and garment manufacturers are facing and to seek the right strategy to control cotton prices. The government should remove the import duty on cotton as it is one of the factors leading to high cotton prices. Currently, international cotton prices are softening. The Union Textile Secretary has called for a meeting with all stakeholders on Thursday and Mr. Shanmugham said he will highlight the distressing situation of the Tirupur garment exporting units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruppur-garment-exporters-to-go-on-strike-on-jan-17-and-18/article38141278.ece

Sachin Mohan Ahir, chairman of Save NTC movement, told presspersons here on Wednesday the mills had remained closed since last year following the lockdown to control COVID-19 spread. This had affected over 20,000 workers of the mills across the country and their family members. The workers were paid just 50 % of their basic wages and DA. As many as 23 trade unions have joined hands to demand the Central government to reopen the mills. “The workers are willing to work. Funds are available. But, the Central Government does not want to run the mills,” he alleged. The Ministry of Textiles is not disclosing its plans. There are about 600 acres of land sitting idle with the mills. These can be monetised to plough in resources to revive the mills. He said the trade unions would hoist black flags at NTC offices on January 26, after the hoisting of national flag. The workers will stage a demonstration in Kerala next month. They will organise protests in Ahmedabad, too, and will not relent till the mills are re-opened and labourers get work. Coimbatore MP P.R.

But the State government have decided to outsource all the work and the Municipal Administration Department have issued an order dated October 2, 2021. “We want all the government orders that permit outsourcing to be cancelled”, they said. The members urged the local bodies not to reduce their wages than the minimum wage fixed by the district administration regularly. They also wanted jobs of all the temporary workers, including contract and daily wagers, to be regularised at the earliest.

Doctors said the liver cancer was detected at an early stage. The treatment, microwave ablation of the tumor, uses microwave energy (same energy used in microwave oven) to destroy the cancer. It was delivered through a needle inserted into the tumor. The entire duration of the treatment was 30 minutes and the patient was discharged in two days. The procedure was done by a team of doctors including Liver Transplant Surgeon Madhusudhanan, Interventional Radiologist John Robert, Medical Gastroenterologists Rajesh Prabhu and Praveen Kumar. Health Challenge According a statement issued by Apollo Hospital, liver cancer remains a global health challenge. The incidence of liver cancer is increasing worldwide. It is estimated that by 2025, more than one million individuals will be affected by liver cancer annually and that 1-5% of patients with cirrhosis develop liver cancer annually. Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus cause most of the liver cancers globally. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus is becoming the fastest growing cause of liver cancer. Routine surveillance of cirrhosis patients by doing radiological imaging and blood tests can identify liver cancer at an early stage. If liver cancer is identified at an early stage and treated, there is potential for cure. Whereas if it is identified at a later stage, the patient will succumb to the cancer within a year, the statement issued by the hospital said.

The court had passed a series of orders directing that the funds for reconstruction of the houses be sanctioned at the earliest and reconstruction should begin by December 31, 2021. The court had also sought a report on temporary accommodation for the 25 families. However, Madurai Collector S. Aneesh Sekhar sought a modification of the orders. In his petition, the Collector said the 25 beneficiaries had availed the benefit under the government housing scheme i 1988. Once a house was completed and handed over to the beneficiaries, further renovation and reconstruction of the houses were under the purview of the individuals. The government supports people below the poverty line through various schemes. A beneficiary once benefited under a particular scheme cannot avail the same benefit again. The government has to take into consideration the people below the poverty line who are eligible under the scheme, but have not availed the benefit. There are various rules and regulations prescribed specifically under government schemes for reconstruction and renovation works. There are also specific rules for identification and selection of beneficiaries. Although the petitioners have stated that their houses are in a dilapidated condition, there is no scheme or fund allotment available at present to commence construction activities, the Collector said.

Health officials said the boy had travelled to Chennai where he underwent medical check-up at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital last week. He tested positive for the virus thereafter. Subsequently, his sample was analysed at the State Public Health Laboratory’s genome sequencing facility in Chennai when the S-gene dropout was detected. It was sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, which made the confirmation. He is being treated at the Chennai GH, with six members of his family whose sample results are awaited.  "We have also collected 45 more samples from the district for testing on Omicron. We will get the results in a day or two," T. Manivannan, Deputy Director (DD) Health Services, Ranipet, told The Hindu . Among the 45 samples, 15 samples were of the staff at the INS Rajali, the Indian Naval air station, 16 were of the staff of Regional Training Centre (CISF), and eight belonged to policemen from the special crime team.

Stalin will lay foundation stone on January 11 for the country’s first ever International Furniture Park, which is coming up on the outskirts of this town on 1,150 acres on an outlay of Rs. 1,000 crore. While attracting investments to the tune of Rs. 4,500 crore, the upcoming park is expected to ensure employment to 3.50 lakh persons. Thoothukudi, the country’s third largest timber importer, imports logs from Mayanmar, Australia, New Zealand and the African countries via VOC Port and sends the imported timber by road to the sawmills in various destinations. Since the well-connected coastal town of Thoothukudi is attracting industrial investments, the State Government has proposed to establish the Furniture Park on 1,150 acre in the SIPCOT Industrial Complex by using the imported logs apart from the timbers from various parts of Tamil Nadu. A good number of domestic and the foreign companies involved in this business are keen to have their units here. The proposed industrial complex will house a maximum of 100 furniture manufacturing units. “Besides the manufacturing units, the complex will have a training centre to impart skills to 5,000 persons a year on furniture making, marketing, exporting etc. A quality control centre will be established to certify the calibre of the wooden products being manufactured here. Apart from a few conference halls with most-modern communication facilities, hotels and restaurants will be created on this premises,” said the officials of SIPCOT Industrial Complex.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/foundation-stone-for-furniture-park-to-be-laid/article38141335.ece

Except for a few, most of the roads in residential colonies, lanes and by-lanes in the city suffered extensive damage due to the extended spell of North East monsoon from October to November. The poor condition of many roads including Rockins Road, Benwells Road, Madurai Road, West Boulevard Road and East Boulevard Road is giving a back-breaking experience to the motorists. Operation of vehicles, particularly heavy, was said to have caused deep erosion of roads in different parts of the city. Big craters and deep potholes that have sprung up on main roads are troubling the users particularly two-wheeler riders and car drivers. To make the badly hit roads motorable, the Tiruchi Corporation had carried out patch works about two weeks ago and has promised to relay the roads, wherever it was needed. It listed out several roads and sanctioned Rs. 47 crore for road works. But the residents complain that patchworks were carried out only on select roads and several roads remain unattended. Many complain that patchworks at various places are improper and were adding to the woes of the commuters. Moreover, they complain that the road works was going on at a slow pace. They point out that arterial roads such as Bharathidasan Road, Rockins Road, Benwells Road and the roads around the Central Bus Stand were among the roads that are require immediate attention. “The Rockins Road is one of the busiest roads in the city. It is a main connecting road between the Central Bus Stand and the Railway junction: Hundreds of cars, two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws and buses ply every day. But the road is in bad condition for the last three months. It is a nightmarish experience for vehicle users,” said T. Saravanan, an auto driver, who uses the road regularly.  Corporation Commissioner P. M. N. Mujibur Rahuman told The Hindu that a work order had already been issued to relay the roads in various parts of the city at an estimate of Rs. 47 crore.  Except for the areas, where underground drainage works were on, the relaying works had been started. In addition to it, Rs. 27 crore had been earmarked for the road development works in the second phase. Similarly, another Rs. 43 crore had been allotted for taking up road rehabilitation works. A tender had been called for the project and the process would be over within 15 days. Mr. Rahuman said that the road works would be expedited. Officials have been asked to list out the arterial roads that required immediate attention. If the UGD works were over, they would be relaid with immediate effect, he added.

Cultivation of paddy moved to top gear in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Thoothukudi districts during the ‘pisanam’ paddy season (between November and February) after the north-east monsoon jacked up water storage level in all 11 dams – Papanasam, Servalar, Manimuthar, Kodumudiyar, Vadakku Pachchaiyar and Nambiyar, all in Tirunelveli district, and Gadana, Ramanadhi, Karuppanadhi, Adavinainar and Gundar dams in Tenkasi district – to the maximum storage level. In Kanniyakumari district, Petchipaarai and Perunchaani dams, the major reservoirs of the district, are overflowing. More importantly, all systemised and rain-fed tanks have more than 75% water even as the irrigation wells have water sufficient water with phenomenal recharge of groundwater. As these reservoirs are brimming with water since last week of November, the jubilant farmers had moved the paddy cultivation to top gear. Subsequently, the area of cultivation increased and easily surpassed the target set by the Department of Agriculture, which should have anticipated the increased area of cultivation and consequent demand for more fertilizer. In Tirunelveli alone, paddy has been raised on 43,000 hectares against the target of 35,000 hectares. Against the actual requirement of 13,000 tonnes, the district has received only 8,000 tonnes of urea. The miserable failure on the part of Chennai-based topbrass of the Department of Agriculture in getting the increased quantity of urea from the manufacturers threatens the farmers. Since the supply is so small and the demand is huge, the agriculturists have to buy urea, costing Rs. 266.50 a bag at the inflated price of Rs. 300 to 400. “Moreover, the farmers are being forced buy other products of the urea manufacturers though these products are not used for paddy cultivation. It’s atrocious and daylight robbery,” said farmer Peratchi Selvam of Kallur. When Tirunelveli received 1,800 tonnes of urea a couple of days ago, it was sent to the cooperative societies and private sellers of Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Thoothukudi districts. On getting information about the arrival of fresh stocks, farmers were seen waiting in front of the shops since 5 a.m. even though the shops were opened after 8.30 a.m. Since the arrival was less and the demand was huge, the sellers had to seek police protection and only one bag was sold to each farmer waiting in the queue. Similar situation prevail in all parts of Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Kanniyakumari districts. “I received the allotment of 450 bags of urea on Monday for which more than 600 farmers were waiting in front of my shop. Along with the 450 bags of urea I received from IFFCO, the company had sent 6 boxes of nano urea and growth-promoting bio-fertilizer extracted from seaweed for which I had not put the indent. So, I’m being compelled to sell it to the farmers though it was not required by the farmers,” said a fertilizer dealer. Officials attached to the Department of Agriculture here are in a spicy situation as they cannot give any assurance to the paddy growers about the arrival of urea with short supply from manufacturers continues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-upset-over-acute-shortage-of-urea/article38141644.ece

The incident occurred in the area a few days ago, and police have registered a case. Residents said that there had been myths surrounding the idol, located in Kil Nadugani, that it had been made and placed by prospectors who arrived in the area looking for gold in the hillocks in the region. “There were also reports that gold excavated from the hills was buried underneath the idol,” said a local Adivasi resident from Pandalur. A few days ago, a group of men are believed to have vandalised the sculpture in their efforts to find the gold which they believed was hidden underneath the statue. Local residents, who noticed that the carving had been destroyed, informed the police, who registered a case and are investigating. Police officials said that they did not think that the group who damaged the idol had managed to find anything valuable, but added that they were continuing their investigations into the incident. Despite a recent crackdown on illegal mining in Devala and Pandalur, local residents said that the practice continues, with the lack of jobs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic leading to educated youth also trying their luck in the illegal mines. Equipment, including high-pressure water pumps and machinery are being used to hack away at the hillocks by residents trying to strike it rich at the mines, police sources revealed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/idol-vandalised-near-gudalur/article38141280.ece

This will be the third time the design of the flyover will be changed. As per the existing design, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) needs to acquire seven private properties of a total of 500 sq.m towards Sheshadripuram railway underpass. However, property owners have questioned the acquisition in the High Court. “We were unable to convince the owners, so we decided to drop acquisition of these properties. It will help us save Rs. 40 crore and finish the project early by making small changes in the design. We will submit our plan in the High Court when the case comes up for hearing,” said Lokesh, chief engineer, projects, BBMP. The BBMP’s decision to change plans so late has come under severe criticism. “This essentially shows there is an absolute lack of planning. How can they start a project before securing the land? This is not the first time plans have been changed. Hennur flyover and Byappanahalli flyover had similar trajectories,” said V. Ravichandar, former member of the BBMP Restructuring Committee. The civic body has built a skeleton of the down ramp towards the Sheshadripuram railway underpass with a gradient of 5.5. However, as per the new design, this will be extended. The down ramp will start much earlier with the gradient increasing to 6.6, which is the maximum gradient allowed as per Indian Road Congress guidelines, Mr. Lokesh said. Ashish Verma, convener, IISc. Sustainable Transportation Lab, said increase in the gradient within the IRC guidelines was not an issue. “But care needs to be taken to ensure no design flaws creep in. When the gradient increases it may affect the visibility for vehicles, if there is a sharp turn or other design flaws are factored in,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-opts-for-design-change-of-flyover-for-the-third-time/article38141192.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:12 IST,KARNATAKA||Rejig of BJP State unit, Cabinet on the cards?||The Bharatiya Janata Party seems to be all set for a rejig of both the State Cabinet and the party unit. Close on the heels of poor performance by the party in the Legislative Council and urban local bodies polls, the high command is keen on “redoing” the party and Government’s image amidst challenges posed by a resurgent Opposition, party sources said. Speculations are rife in the party that the high command will effect a Cabinet reshuffle to give “dynamism” to the Government. “The high command has been keen on dropping many old faces making room for new and young ones. However, they couldn’t implement this fully when B.S. Yediyurappa was replaced as Chief Minister since they did not want ganging up of seniors to pose a challenge. They will likely do that purge now,” said a senior strategist of the party. “If not a reshuffle, at least the four vacant slots in the Cabinet will be filled with new young faces who will likely be first-time Ministers,” he added. However, despite the recent clarification by the State executive of the party, speculations of a leadership change refuse to die down. The change of the State unit chief has been in the pipeline ever since the change of leadership was effected in July 2021 and will likely be made shortly, party sources said. Nalin Kumar Kateel has maintained a low profile and did not actively lead the party’s campaign in either of the recently concluded polls. Arvind Limbavali, a prominent Scheduled Caste leader, was tipped off to be the State unit chief when he was not inducted into the Ministry in July last year. While he continues to be one of the frontrunners for the post, the name of BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi, a Vokkaliga leader, is also doing the rounds. “It is in this context of competition to become the next Vokkaliga face of the party, that probably Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan sought to burnish his credentials by contesting DK brothers on their turf,” a senior Vokkaliga MLA from Bengaluru said. ‘Chintan Baithak’ Meanwhile, the ‘Chintan Baithak’ scheduled to be held at Nandi Hills on January 8-9 and attended by Union Home Minister Amit Shah was expected to be the platform for some of these key decisions. However, the third wave of the pandemic has now forced the party to postpone the event, said N. Ravikumar, general secretary, BJP Karnataka. “We are yet to reschedule the event. The baithak was to take stock of the political situation in the State in the run up to the Assembly polls,” he said.  If not a reshuffle, at least the four vacant slots in the Cabinet will be filled with new young faces who will likely be first-time Ministers.Senior strategist in BJP||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rejig-of-bjp-state-unit-cabinet-on-the-cards/article38141218.ece

Prakash, Principal, Maharani Arts, Commerce and Management, said many students were disappointed that they had to revert to online classes. “The students' academics has been affected over the past two years. Physical classes are going on well after students have completed their vaccination and they are able to grasp concepts easily. Students say that if colleges are closed now, it would affect the continuity in academics,” he said. An assistant professor of a government college said that it was “unscientific” that schools and colleges have to be closed, but malls, restaurants, theatres and pubs are open. A second year degree college student said that the lecturers were struggling to complete the syllabus on time. “The odd semester is supposed to be completed by February-end. But if we switch to online classes, our lecturers will not be able to complete the syllabus,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lecturers-principals-want-colleges-to-remain-open/article38141200.ece

The Congress under the leadership of its president D.K. Shivakumar has decided to lead the march to Bengaluru, demanding that the BJP Government implement the Mekedatu project, a balancing reservoir in the Cavuery basin, to bring water to quench the thirst of residents of Bengaluru. However, with the steep rise in COVID-19 cases in the last few days, the Government has imposed weekend curfew (from 10 p.m. on Friday to 5 a.m. on Monday) for two weeks and banned all rallies, demonstrations and large gatherings of all groups and organisations, for two weeks. While the Government maintained that COVID-19 guidelines and weekend curfew are enforced in public interest and not targeted at any particular organisation, the KPCC chief termed it as “BJP lockdown and not COVID lockdown” aimed at “destroying the livelihood of drivers, traders and street vendors” and “harassing people through restrictions”. Speaking to a private TV channel, Mr. Shivakumar said: “It’s a BJP COVID. There is no Corona here. The BJP duplicated the numbers to avoid our walk for water. The BJP had conducted many yatras earlier. All (COVID) numbers are bogus and false.” Meanwhile, the Congress on Wednesday said the party would take out a “walk for water”. Mr. Shivakumar has been holding a series of meetings with party leaders and legislators to make the 10-day padayatra a grand success. The party would adhere to the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour during the padayatra, he said. The party has ordered one lakh masks and sought deployment of 100 doctors from the KPCC doctors’ cell and 10 mobile ambulances, he said. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said: “We will protest to expose the conspiracy of the BJP Government. The order was issued to scuttle the padayatra”. The project will provide water to 2.5 crore people in the State, he said. Mr. Siddaramaiah trained the guns on BJP leaders, alleging that they were against the project and were supporting their Tamil Nadu unit BJP president K. Annamalai who has been opposing it tooth and nail. The Congress would implement the project if voted to power, the former Chief Minister said. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the pandemic will not spread based on party lines. The Government was committed to implementing the Mekedatu project. The Congress, which had forgotten the project when it was in power, has been playing “vote bank politics now”. The Congress is a divided house. The one-upmanship of Mr. Shivakumar is on display,” he said. A couple of times, Mr. Bommai called on Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and submitted a memorandum urging the Centre to grant all clearances for the project. The Tamil Nadu Government has passed a resolution urging the Centre not to provide clearances to Karnataka for Mekedatu dam without the permission of the downstream States as per the Supreme Court’s judgment. The matter is pending before the Supreme Court. The padayatra will culminate with a public meeting in Bengaluru on January 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mekedatu-congress-to-go-ahead-with-padayatra-despite-weekend-curfew/article38141214.ece

After the junction has been improved to ease vehicular movement, the BBMP is going to take up beautification work. According to a senior official, it will have two traffic islands where statues of Buddha, Angulimala, and a few animals will be installed. A few statues have already been placed at the junction and work is likely to be taken up soon. The beautification work is being taken up by the civic body’s Horticulture Department at a cost of Rs. 60 lakh. The traffic islands will be landscaped, where hardy plants such as Raphis palm, Chinese palm, shrubs, and shaded grass will be used. “The plants chosen are hardy, indoor varieties that can thrive in shade as there will be no direct sunlight below the flyover,” the official explained. He added that though the work had been approved over a year ago, it was put on the back-burner in the wake of the pandemic. The department is also drawing up plans to take up similar projects in other junctions, either through Corporate Social Responsibility or with special funds. Over a year ago, the BBMP announced its plans to overhaul 35 busy junctions at an estimated cost of Rs. 100 crore. So far, it has improved K.R. Circle, Nayandahalli junction, and Windsor Square. While Nayandahalli junction has an installation of the Mysuru Dasara Dibba, K.R. Circle has been developed with engineering as the theme. Windsor Square was developed on the theme of ‘Make in India’. Officials said that Basaveshwara Circle will be developed highlighting the 12th Century social reformer and the Chalukya dynasty at an estimated Rs. 4 crore. “The detailed project report for the remaining junctions is being prepared, and is likely to be ready in two months,” an official in the Road Infrastructure Department said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/love-and-surrender-at-anand-rao-circle/article38141191.ece

However, the rapid increase in cases is not commensurate with the number of hospitalisations. This positive aspect is being attributed to not just the weakened virulence of the COVID-19 virus, but also the wide vaccination coverage of the eligible population. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that experts had opined that 95% of those who contract the virus can recover under home isolation, without the need for any major clinical intervention. According to BBMP’s COVID-19 War Room reports, the number of hospitalisations (since January 1 to 5) increased from 52 to 91. There are a total of 1,926 beds (general, High Dependency Units, Intensive Care Units, ICU- ventilator) in four government medical colleges, 16 government hospitals, and two operational COVID-19 Care Centres (managed by the BBMP). As on Wednesday, there were 1,835 beds available in these medical facilities. Mr. Gupta claimed that there were around 300 persons with COVID-19 who were admitted in private hospitals. “Among those hospitalised, we have found that 90% are admitted in general beds, which means they do not require serious medical interventions,” he said, and added that the civic body would operationalise more CCCs to isolate those who are unable to be under home isolation for various reasons. He also said that BBMP had also activated physical triaging at the ward level. “We are also keeping a close watch on the cases and the number of beds will be increased, if needed,” he said.  BBMP’s Chief Health Officer Balasundar told The Hindu that the civic body had drawn up an escalation matrix, which had been shared with the different zonal commissioners. The escalation matrix helps the zones take appropriate action in terms of opening more CCCs, increasing testing and managing the staff pattern in either the CCCs, primary health centres, and war rooms. “This was done as part of the risk analysis management plan,” he said.  The civic chief also pointed out that to flatten the curve, citizens must mandatorily wear masks and avoid mingling. “Masking up cuts transmission of the virus, while vaccination prevents any complications in terms of clinical presentation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hospitalisation-still-low-no-shortage-of-beds-bbmp/article38141194.ece

Nineteen members from the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular), who either did not contest or lost in the elections held in December, retired on Wednesday. Six members, including Social Welfare Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary whose term also ended, have been re-elected. With one-third of the members retiring, elections were held to 25 seats from 20 Local Authorities’ constituencies following which the composition of the Upper House changed.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:12 IST,KARNATAKA||KLR Act should not be used as tool to aggrandise undeserving persons, says High Court||A beneficial legislation like the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 should not be allowed to be used as a tool for aggrandising undeserving persons by showing them as tenants in respect of the lands, the High Court of Karnataka has said. “The Land Reforms Act, 1961 is undoubtedly a beneficial legislation. It is important to remember that this piece of legislation is meant to preserve, protect and also confer benefits on persons who are able to clearly establish the factum of agrarian relationship as tenant in respect of the land. Such a legislation should not be allowed to be used as a tool for aggrandising undeserving persons...,” the court observed. A Division Bench comprising Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar and Justice P. Krishna Bhat made these observations while quashing conferment of occupancy right granted by Udupi land tribunal in 2003 in respect of a land, measuring 7½ cents (about 3,267 sq ft), in favour of a person, who was working as a cook in Admar Mutt, Udupi. Setting aside the 2011 order of a single judge and the 2003 order, the Division Bench said that the tribunal had failed to hold proper enquiry to find out whether the ‘land’ and applicant ‘tenant’ come within the purview of the KLR Act. Noticing that the mutt had given him a residential premises with appurtenant land for his accommodation as he was a servant in the mutt, the Bench said that the property, falling in the urban area within the limits of Udupi town municipality, cannot be a ‘land’ within the meaning of Section 2A(18) of the KLR Act. Pointing out that the cook was a tenant of the house let out to him by mutt and not tenant of agricultural land as per the provisions of the KLR Act, the Bench, quoting a judgment of 1975 of the High Court, has said that in undivided district of Dakshina Kannada of which Udupi was part, it is common for urban house properties to have few fruit bearing trees around the premises. In any case, in about 3,267 sq ft of land no agricultural activity can be carried out, the Bench observed while stating that mere existence of a few fruit bearing trees in a compound of a house would not make the land in question agricultural land in the undivided Dakshina Kannada district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/klr-act-should-not-be-used-as-tool-to-aggrandise-undeserving-persons-says-high-court/article38141211.ece

So, we have cancelled the show,” said M. Jagadish, Deputy Director, Lalbagh. This is the fourth successive flower show to be cancelled due to the pandemic. Flower shows to mark Independence Day 2020, Republic Day 2021, and Independence Day 2021 were cancelled. During the plague and World War I and II, flower shows were disrupted. However, it is unlikely they were not held almost three years in a row, sources in the Horticulture Department said. However, unlike the previous shows that were cancelled well in advance, the department had made all preparations for the flower show this time, given that the cases were low till recently. Preparations begin at least four months before the show when plants are grown to time the flowering with the show. “This year, with the cases being very low consistently, we thought we could finally do the show in January and began preparations in earnest. The death of actor Puneeth Rajkumar pushed us to make matinee idols Dr. Rajkumar and Puneeth Rajkumar the theme of the flower show. But, the advent of the third wave disrupted our plans,” Mr. Jagadish said. Bannerghatta closed Authorities of Bannerghatta Biological Park have also announced that the park will remain closed for visitors during the two weekends. “However, the park will remain open on January 11 (Tuesday),” the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/flower-show-cancelled-for-fourth-time-in-a-row/article38141184.ece

The court also said that the process of inspection, assessing mental health and providing treatment to the mentally ill inmates should be done within a period of one month. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, passed the order while disposing of a PIL petition, filed in 2010 by the High Court Legal Services Committee (HCLSC) on the living conditions of inmates and poor facilities provided in the centre following death of more than 15 inmates during 2010. During the hearing, the counsel for the HCLSC has said that the facilities like quality of food, etc is good in the centre at present but the issue of providing treatment of mentally ill inmates has to be addressed as it was later found that several of the inmates were mentally ill. Following this submission, the Bench disposed of the petition as the purpose for which it was filed has been served.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/inspect-rehabilitation-centre-for-beggars-hc/article38141197.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:10 IST,KARNATAKA||Koppal Toy Cluster to be operational in March||The Koppal Toy Cluster (KTC), the first such infrastructure in the country, will be operational in March 2022, said Aravind Melligeri, chairman and CEO of Aequs. KTC is being set up by Aequs Infra, a group company of Belagavi-based Aequs Pvt. Ltd. Six toy and toy-component makers have signed MoUs with Aequs Infra while another three players, including Viscon Polymers, manufacturer and exporter of custom rubber moulded products, have started construction of their production facilities at KTC.  Mr. Melligeri told The Hindu: “At least three manufacturing units are expected to be operational by March 2022. Several other marquee toys brands have shown interest in setting up their manufacturing facilities at Koppal.”  KTC that is coming up on a spread of over 400 acres of land will comprise the entire value chain of capabilities ranging from toy making, production of packaging, tool making, paint making, developing electronics and other accessories. The cluster is also estimated to attract an investment of over Rs. 4,000 crore and create over 25,000 direct jobs (mostly for women in North Karnataka) and over a lakh indirect jobs. At completion, the cluster will house over 100 large and small manufacturing units in SEZ and domestic tariff area (DTA) for exports and domestic markets, respectively. KTC would also feature an incubation centre for toy manufacturing and ancillary activities, said Aequs. According to Mr. Melligeri, segmentation of the toy industry is interesting and types of toys include plush toys, electronic toys, games and puzzles, construction and building toys, dolls, sports, outdoor play toys, infant/pre-school toys, and activity toys. Educational toys are a sizable part of this market. “What we have noticed is that toys are increasingly becoming electronic in nature and are more curiosity-driven. Physical toys are finding it difficult to compete with gadgets, and the most popular toys today are related to popular cultures like movies and TV shows. However, the biggest markets for toys remain remote-controlled cars,ride-on toys, and electronic toy vehicles (battery-operated cars and cycles),” he elaborated. The Indian toy industry is highly fragmented, with an estimated 4,000 units of various sizes operating. “The organised sector accounts for only 10% of this,” said Sharad Kapoor, general secretary, The Toy Association of India. But the potential for their growth was good with a high demand for toys in India driven by the large base of young population, rising disposable income, changing spending patterns, and shift from traditional toys to innovative, intelligent electronic toys, Mr. Melligeri argued. By end of 2021, the global toy market is estimated to be about $80-100 billion. However, India accounts for a minuscule share of this in the region of $1.5 billion. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 12.2% between 2021 and 2026, according to industry estimates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/koppal-toy-cluster-to-be-operational-in-march/article38141205.ece

In a statement, which was also shared with the media, I.S. Prasad, president, FKCCI, said that the State Government should avoid succumbing to the temptation to announce a lockdown or impose other harsher curbs due to the rising caseload in Karnataka. “Many experts have stated that even in the event of a third wave and a surge in the Omicron variant, the main deterrent to control the situation is a stricter enforcement of masking, maintaining social distance, regular hand-washing and hygiene, rather than a lockdown or any other stringent curbs that will impact industry and trade,” he cautioned. “Last year, some estimates showed that the lockdown-induced losses incurred by industry and trade in Karnataka was nearly Rs. 75,000 crore and the revenue loss to the State around Rs. 10,000 crore per month. This should be borne in mind before taking any decision,” he suggested. He also pointed out that while there cannot be a rational trade-off between lives and livelihood, a lockdown cannot be the answer and the economy should not be sacrificed at the altar of public opinion. FKCCI will also impress on its members and industry, trade and services in the State to take all precautions prescribed and scrupulously follow all the SOP announced by the Government from time to time, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lockdown-not-advisable-after-last-years-experience-fkcci/article38141198.ece

The participants cleared the municipal waste, drew rangoli and spread awareness on the importance of maintaining cleanliness among the public. Tarikere TMC has been among the few urban local bodies with a good track record in maintaining cleanliness. It bagged the third rank in the 2021 Swacha Sarvekshana Survey among the TMCs in the State. And, it stood 17th among town municipal councils in the south zone in the national-level ranking. “We want to improve our position this year by addressing garbage-vulnerable points in the town. Hence, we launched this initiative with the help of voluntary organisations”, said Tahira Tasmin, environmental engineer of the council. The council had identified 37 spots where the public dump garbage. Among them, four were selected for cleaning on Tuesday. The council allotted such spots located in wards 11, 17, 4 and 21 to the voluntary organisations. Members of Tarikere taluk units of Innerwheel Club, Mamata Mahila Samaja, Kanaka Mahila Samaja and Ishwariya Brahmakumari Sangha joined hands with the council. “Besides the volunteers from private organisations, elected representatives of the council and workers cleaned up the blackspots and drew rangoli. Once the places known for dumping waste are cleaned up and made attractive with drawings, people do not throw dirt there. We want to extend this activity to all blackspots in the town”, said Mahanthesh, Chief Officer of the council. Council president T.M.Ranganath, vice-president Yashodamma and standing committee president Dadapeer took part in the activity. The town generates around 16 tonnes of municipal waste every day. The council has an integrated waste management site on the town outskirts. The municipal waste is collected by council vehicles and processed at the landfill site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/garbage-goes-out-rangoli-comes-in/article38141506.ece

He was speaking at the first pre-event of “TechBharat 3.0” organised jointly by Laghu Udyog Bharati-Karnataka and IMS Foundation with the theme, “Transforming India’s FoodTech, AgriTech and Agronomic Landscape” in Belagavi on Wednesday. “We need good solutions to scale up the agriculture sector so that the farming community benefits out of technology-related solutions in logistics, soil testing, waste management, storing, processes, pesticide management and disease mitigation”, he said while emphasising the need for supporting the farming community with technological aids to upscale them economically and yield-wise. The Minister said that for enhanced growth of the ecosystem, it is quite essential that focus is on infrastructure development, market access, ecosystem engagement and talent development. “We are creating industries which will allow our youth who pass out at the district level, get jobs and work in their own native places,” he said. Mr. Ashwath Narayan said that the government has already identified several tier 2 and tier 3 cities and industries willing to set up shop in the places will be provided incentives. Necessary handholding by way of providing the requisite infrastructure support will also be done, he said. The Minister said that the government has also crafted policies to support strategic policy interventions in this regard.

Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Mines and Coal Pralhad Joshi made the announcement through a press release from New Delhi on Wednesday. He has thanked Union Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the decision. Mr. Joshi has said that the FTC will further boost development of the region and particularly of Hubballi, which, he said, was emerging as second capital of the State. “The Union Government is setting up six Flying Training Centres across the country to produce more pilots and the decision to include Hubballi among them is of great significance as there are no flying schools in the region,” he has said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/flying-training-centre-to-come-up-in-hubballi/article38141373.ece

Following the incident, the police took three students into custody immediately. However, they were later released after being questioned, police sources said. The incident occurred when Vice-Chancellor P. Ishwara Bhat was returning from the protest site, even as students started raising slogans seeking his resignation. As the police were trying to escort Prof. Bhat to his office, one among the protestors threw ink at the Vice-Chancellor. The ink also fell on some police personnel. Immediately, the police took three students into custody for questioning. The indefinite protest by the law students, particularly those of the even semester students, has been on on the university campus for close to a month now and on Wednesday, a protest march and dharna was planned as part of intensifying the agitation. The protesting students are seeking promotion to the next respective semesters as per a High Court of Karnataka order issued last month, ruling in favour of promoting three-year LL.B students. However, KSLU went ahead with holding examinations for five-year LL.B students protesting against which the students have continued their agitation. The law students are also demanding that KSLU withdraw its appeal against the High Court order and promote all even semester students of both three-year and five-year LL.B courses. Students organisations, NSUI and ABVP, and others have extended support to the agitation by the law students. The issue was also raised during the Winter Session of the State Legislature in Belagavi. However, two orders have been passed recently by the Dharwad Bench and Principal Bench of the High Court of Karnataka on the issue, with one ordering for promotion of three-year LL.B students to the next semester and the other dismissing the petition of the five-year LL.B students. When the issue was raised on the floor of the House, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Madhuswamy defended the KSLU decision to hold offline examinations. The law students have repeatedly clarified that they are not against holding examinations. They had also earlier clarified that they were ready for any other mode of examination suggested by the Bar Council of India, other than offline examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-students-taken-into-custody-after-ink-is-thrown-at-kslu-v-c/article38141203.ece

Deve Gowda said that the people of the country were upset with the Narendra Modi-led BJP government and asserted that a “Third Front” will soon be formed at the national level to give a new direction to the country’s politics. Addressing presspersons in Kalaburagi on Wednesday, Mr. Gowda said that all efforts are under way to stitch an alternative political front by uniting regional parties against the BJP ahead of the 2024 general elections. All India Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will play a key role in forging ties with other regional parties. With the BJP’s performance slipping and the Congress losing the zeal to fight against the BJP, there is an opportunity for another coalition in 2024, where the regional parties could play a key role, just as it did in 1996, Mr. Gowda said. Lashing out at the BJP for having become a “one-man show” of Mr. Modi, he alleged that the democracy has slowly turned into a dictatorship in the BJP rule. Mr. Gowda, continuing his tirade against former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, held him responsible for the collapse of the Congress-JD(S) coalition in the State and accused him of being the sole reason for the BJP coming to power. Replying to a question, Mr. Gowda said that the JD(S) has chalked out various programmes to strengthen the party from the grassroot level by undertaking a State-wide tour. “We want to come to power on our own strength in 2023 Assembly elections. The people are expecting non-BJP and non-Congress government and we are requesting them to give JD(S) a chance. The party has a five-point programmeto benefit the people,” Mr. Gowda added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/third-front-will-soon-be-formed-at-national-level-says-deve-gowda/article38141378.ece

Mallikarjun Kharge said that before imposing a lockdown, the State Government should announce a special package for migrant workers and labourers. With the State Government announcing lockdowns and night curfews in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases, migrant workers could once again be staring at loss of wages, Mr. Kharge said and added that lakhs of migrant workers and construction labourers went back home after lockdowns were announced in 2020 and 2021 and their life is yet to return to to normal. Speaking to presspersons in Kalaburagi on Wednesday, Mr. Kharge said that the Government should understand the enormity of the lockdown that had affected manufacturing activities. During the first wave of the pandemic, lockdown restrictions on the movement of goods and people severely impacted industries and workforce capacity bringing nearly all manufacturing activity to a standstill. Accusing the Narendra Modi-led Centre of underreporting COVID-19 deaths, Mr. Kharge said: “There are around 5,86,000 villages in the country and even if we assume two deaths in each village, the toll would cross 11 lakh only in rural areas. The figures will increase if we add the urban ares” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/announce-package-for-labourers-kharge/article38141376.ece

In a media note, Mr. Khuba condemned the act of the Congress Government in Punjab which, he said, prevented Mr. Modi from reaching the programme for laying the foundation stones to some important development projects by “throwing the Prime Minister’s security protocol to the wind”. Mr. Khuba also condemned Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who termed the development as a “common incident”, saying that the statement was “irresponsible”. “You [Mr. Channi] are ineligible to be the Chief Minister of a State as you have failed to provide proper security to the Prime Minister. Neither you nor your Congress Government has any base in Punjab... It is shameful that the Congress which often claims to be having great respect for the Constitution does not have common sense to provide security cover to the Prime Minister,” Mr. Khuba said, appealing to the people to condemn the Punjab Government and teach a lesson to the Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/khuba-blames-cong-govt-for-pms-security-breach/article38141370.ece

Formed by the Seetha, Koodlu Tirtha waterfalls, also called Seetha Nadi waterfalls, is located inside Someshwara Wildlife Division of the Forest Department. Though located inside dense forests, the waterfalls has been attracting a good number of visitors every day. During weekends and holidays, the number swells. Forest Department personnel manning the trekking entry point at the base of the waterfalls said that during weekends more than 200 tourists have been visiting and during weekdays it up to 100 after the lockdown was completely lifted. On Sunday last, there was a large crowd as Koodlu Tirtha also has religious significance and the day was observed as Ellu Amavasye. One can reach the trekking base by driving or walking on a narrow and winding road for about 12 km from Koodlu Tirtha Cross between Hebri and Someshwara near Seethanadi on National Highway 169A (Malpe-Tirthahalli). While portions of the strictly single-lane road have seen concrete/ bitumen topping, a portion of the road is under reconstruction. As such, visitors, at present, have to take a little detour to reach the base. Visitors after checking in at the forest check-post and paying an entry fee (Rs. 100 for adults and Rs. 50 for children), may start the trek through the thick evergreen forest where the Sun’s rays struggle to pierce through the foliage. Visitors have to cross the Seetha a couple of hundred metres thereafter from where the ascend begins. At many steep locations, the Forest Department has built steps. It is about a 3 km from the trekking base to the waterfalls and an ascent of about 500 metres. The Seetha plunges directly into the pond formed at the base of the waterfalls from a height of about 300 ft. As the pond is bereft of strong currents or depth, one can venture into it and enjoy some pristine unpolluted water. At the trekking base, the Forest Department has provided changing rooms, restrooms and a large parking area. While personnel caution tourists not to litter either the path or the waters, retired bank officer from Tirthahalli D.G. Manjunath said that the entire area is kept clean due to the department’s initiative. Visiting hours is between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/verdant-koodlu-tirtha-beckons-tourists/article38141716.ece

V. Rajendra. Speaking at a public consultation meeting on getting the certification to the beach, the Deputy Commissioner said that January 7 will be the last date for submitting the bids. The beach will be developed to one k.m. distance as per the standards fixed. The certification will help to draw international tourists to the beach and it will be on the global map of clean beaches, he said adding that “it is an ambitious project of Dakshina Kannada administration.” The Deputy Commissioner said that the local people will have to be taken into confidence before taking up the project. As it is a Union Government funded project the district administration has little say in changing the scope of the project as per the local needs. Y.K. Dinesh Kumar, Regional Director, Coastal Regulatory Zone, Mangaluru said that the Union Government will sanction up to Rs. 8 crore to develop the beach. The State Government gave its approval to develop the beach to get the certification on August 23, 2021. The bidder will have to develop and maintain the beach for 18 months. Later it should be handed over to the beach management committee. According to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change a ‘Blue Flag’ beach is an eco-tourism model to provide tourists clean and hygienic bathing water, facilities/amenities, safe and healthy environment and sustainable development of the area. The certification is awarded by the Denmark-based agency based on 33 stringent criteria in four major heads that is environmental education and information, bathing water quality, environment management and conservation and safety and services in the beaches. It is one of the world’s most recognised voluntary eco-labels. It is awarded to beaches, marinas and sustainable boating tourism operators. The Blue Flag beaches have grey water treatment plants, solid waste management plants, disabled-friendly equipment to enable them to enter seawater, seating arrangements, clean drinking water, washroom, changing room, bathing facility, disabled-friendly and general toilets, parking facilities, solar power plant, solar lighting, and the like. The Kasarakod (Uttara Kannada) and Padubidri (Udupi) beaches in the State got the Blue Flag in 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bids-invited-to-develop-tannirbavi-beach-for-blue-flag-tag-dc/article38141726.ece

Speaking at a public consultation meeting called by the district administration to develop the Tannirbavi beach to get the Blue Flag certification from the Denmark-based non-profit Foundation for Environmental Education, he said that there is no point in maintaining uniformity in the beaches developed under the Blue Flag tag. Each beach should be developed by maintaining its uniqueness and local needs and not by adopting common standards, he said. The Government is wasting the tax payers’ money by investing on changing the landscape of the beaches in the name of getting the certification, he said. Mr. Baikampady said that the fishermen’s activity should not be disturbed while developing the beach. The locals should not be harassed, he said. Referring to the agency which developed the Padubidri beach in Udupi district for getting the Blue Flag tag he said that it removed the local vegetation for making the beach look clean. But the local vegetation played a pivotal role in preserving the beach and its ecology. “Tourists are not allowed to walk on the lawn developed in Padubidri. Then why should tourists visit the beaches if they are not allowed to walk on the beach,” he questioned. Mr. Baikampady questioned the district administration holding the public consultation after calling bids to develop the beach. The public hearing should have been conducted first, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/blue-flag-certification-process-is-a-scam/article38141724.ece

Delivering the valedictory address at the State-level Yuvajanothsava or State Youth Festival at Adichunchanagiri in Mandya district, Mr. Bommai recalled the days when the country was drawing up several programmes to control the population. However, the gradual increase in the population of young people has helped convert the burden into an asset. Presently, people in the age group of 18 to 40 years comprised 40 per cent of the country’s population. “Youth power is a big asset for the country. Whichever country possesses youth power also has a good future.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi has identified the importance of youth power and has conceived of a lot of programmes to use the same for building the country, Mr. Bommai said. He emphasised the importance of discipline and aim for youth to succeed in life. Life should also have an aim. When there is discipline among the youth, they can easily achieve their goals, the Chief Minister said before adding that the youth can build their character by having an aim and discipline in life. Mr. Bommai also sought to draw a distinction between politicians and statesmen. “A politician has an eye on the next elections. But, a statesman has an eye on the next generation. What the country needs today is statesmen, who can think about tomorrow’s administration”, he said before claiming that the “short-sightedness” among the politicians was responsible for the confusion in the society. The country needs farsighted leadership that can guide the youth to realise the dream of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy. He said the State had already adopted 75 youth for training in sports at the 75th Independence Day celebration on August 15. The youth will be trained for about four years so that they can participate in the next Olympics.He expressed confidence that the youths will come back with medals from the Olympics and become the pride of people of Karnataka. The Chief Minister, who expressed his commitment to the development of sports in the State, also promised to make a special allocation for sports in the coming Budget. Mr. Bommai, who had earlier laid the foundation stone for Adichunchanagiri Centre for Science in the premises, assured the Adichunchanagiri Mutt of all the assistance required from the government for setting up an international level centre for robotics, artificial intelligence and other advanced fields of technology.

About 30 devotees had tested positive on their return from the pilgrimage about three days ago. Following this, the Health Department started collecting details about the pilgrims who had returned to various parts of the district and testing them for controlling the spread amidst the growing threat of a third wave. “All inter-State travelers are being tested. We are collecting their details through our network of ASHA workers, health workers, PDOs and revenue staff. If anybody tests positive, such persons are shifted to COVID-19 Care Centres in the respective taluks. Those testing negative are told to be in isolation for seven days and are tested again on the seventh day,” said Mandya District Health Officer Dhananjay. The clusters of COVID-19 reported in Srirangapatna and K.R. Pet have put the health authorities on their toes with the health workers keeping a close tab on the inter-State rreturnees, especially those who were on pilgrimage to Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the last few days. No fresh cases No fresh cases among the returnees have been reported. Dr. Dhananjay said health workers are sensitising people in villages who usually go on pilgrimage at this time of the year about the growing threat of the third wave with rising number of cases. It is now risky to venture out for sight-seeing, holidays and so on unless it is very essential. It is riskier to travel in groups to destinations that have a high density of tourists or pilgrims. Infected Meanwhile, all 17 students of a school and a teacher in Makovahalli in K.R. Pet taluk have been shifted to the COVID-19 Care Centre and only a few students are said to have mild symptoms. Reports awaited Dr. Dhananjay said the school has 148 students and 100 were tested till Tuesday. The remaining students and their primary contacts, including the parents and family members, were tested on Wednesday and the reports are awaited. The DHO said 50,000 youth in the 15-18 age group have been vaccinated in the last three days. “We are doing our best to vaccinate the identified population with the first dose in the earliest possible time and safeguard them from the virus.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mandya-more-inter-state-returnees-tested-over-clusters/article38141498.ece

MUDA Chairman H.V.Rajeev said illegal construction had come up on the disputed land and the issue landed in court which ruled in the favour of the urban development authority. Consequent to the court ruling, the MUDA officials launched an operation and demolished the structures that were built on the land. There were five properties in all and each measured 50 x 80 ft and are located in Vijayanagar 4th stage Ist phase close to Hinkal. The value of the properties reclaimed by the MUDA has been pegged at Rs. 25 crore. This is in continuation of a series of such operations launched by the MUDA in recent weeks. Mr. Rajeev said there were issues related to compensation at the time of land acquisition and they are pending before the court. The hearing in some of the cases has been completed and the operation to reclaim the land was being taken up as and when the court ruling came in MUDA’s favour, said Mr. Rajeev.

But such facilities were far from the reach of tribal children in many a remote hamlet like Kadamabakkad. The hamlet of the Kattunayakkan tribe, a particularly vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) inside the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS), is located nearly 6 km away from the nearest town of Kallur. However, residents of the hamlet are a happy lot, as they too have been able to avail such a facility thanks to timely intervention by a group of forest officials. As many as 60 members, including 24 students of Standard 1 to 10, of 26 families are living in the forest enclosure. Though the authorities had provided a television set and dish antenna for studies of the children, they could not use it owing to the absence of a study room, said S. Ranjith Kumar, Assistant Wildlife Warden, WWS. “When residents of the hamlet raised their fair demand before the Eco Development committee [EDC], we decided to erect a makeshift shed for the purpose,” he added. Meanwhile, Junior Chamber International, Kozhikode Chapter, expressed willingness to construct a building for the purpose, and it materialised through the Kadambakkad EDC as per the Forest Rights Act. “When the building was opened a few days ago, we provided furniture worth Rs. 75 lakh to the study centre,” Mr. Ranjith Kumar said. “The services of section forest officers and beat forest officers are being provided to the children as facilitators to help them in their studies,” Warden S. Narendra Babu said. As many as six children passed the SSLC examination last year, Mr. Babu said, adding that the services would continue, and coaching for PSC tests will begin this week. A library too will be set up, he informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/forest-officials-turn-catalysts-for-tribal-childrens-education/article38141393.ece

The work that was scheduled to be completed by December 2021 was postponed by three months due to the rains that lasted till the first week of December. Track doubling through Kottayam will reduce travel time by approximately 10 minutes, railway sources said. The construction wing of Railways has set March 2024 as the deadline to complete track doubling in the 69-km Ernakulam-Ambalappuzha and also in the 86.50-km Thiruvananthapuram-Kanyakumari stretches. Once complete, the entire Kanyakumari-Mangaluru stretch will get double track. Kerala got a budget grant of Rs. 871 crore, an increase of 134%, for the 2021-22 fiscal, from which Railways handed over requisite funds to the State government to acquire land to double the three congested corridors. The Ernakulam-Ambalappuzha track could be doubled by March 2024 if the government handed over the entire land by May this year, sources said. The three reaches in the corridor are Ernakulam-Kumbalam (7.7 km), Kumbalam-Thuravur (15.59 km), and Thuravur-Ambalappuzha (45.9 km). Long bridges The stretch has many long bridges, while earth for the track work must come from neighbouring districts such as Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, and Ernakulam. Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden had petitioned Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnav, demanding that the Railway Board sanction the ‘detailed estimates’ for the track doubling work on the Ernakulam-Ambalappuzha stretch since it was a pre-requisite to distribute compensation to landowners. The Railways had deposited with the State government the funds to acquire land in Kerala for doubling track on the Thiruvananthapuram-Kanyakumari stretch, following which the government promised to hand over land in 2022. The stretch that passes through landslide-prone areas will have as many as five tunnels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rail-corridor-to-get-double-track-by-march/article38141406.ece

The project will be rolled out in Pallippuram, Kuzhupilly, Edavanakkad, Nayarambalam, Njarakkal, Elamkunnapuzha panchayats and Kumbalam, Kumbalanghi, Palluruthy, and Chellanam falling within the Kochi Corporation limits. It will be implemented in association with the Fisheries department. The Kerala State Literacy Mission (KSLM) has decided to implement such a project realising that illiteracy remains yet to be fully wiped out among the really marginalised sections along the coastal areas. “We will shortly undertake a survey for identifying not just the illiterate but also those who may have undergone our literacy programme in the past but were unable to continue thereafter. Both the illiterate and those who dropped out after acquiring basic literacy will be supported to appear for the fourth standard equivalency programme,” said Deepa James, district coordinator. A uniform survey will be carried out across the coastal areas of the State using a common methodology approved by KSLM. The district literacy mission is also gearing up to roll out the third phase of Navachethana, the literacy programme for scheduled caste communities, alongside. “We are planning to introduce the programme in a scheduled caste colony in a selected ward each in ten more panchayats. The selection of instructors from among the educated in the scheduled caste communities is one of the highlights of the programme,” said Ms. James. A colony each in Malayattoor, Manjapra, Vazhakkulam, Choornikkara, Okkal, Mudakuzha, Ezhikkara, Chennamangalam, Pindimana and Keerampara panchayats has been selected for the programme. The district panchayat selected the ten panchayats, while the local body concerned selected the colony. “So far, we have imparted literacy classes to 345 schedule caste members from 20 colonies in as many panchayats in the last two phases. The selection of colonies for the latest phase is under way with the help of ward members,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/literacy-mission-to-roll-out-programme-along-coastal-areas/article38141691.ece

As per official estimates, the current number of tests remains in the range of 7,000 to 8,000 daily. In the peak of the second wave, the corresponding figure was in the range between 20,000 and 25,000. Senior officials of the health department said that they were facing serious manpower shortage to scale up daily tests. With the focus shifting to the handling of non-COVID cases, the process of holding random tests had declined considerably over the past few months, they said. The health wing pointed out the lack of cooperation among the public in undertaking random tests. Many were reluctant to undergo random tests claiming that they had no symptoms. Initiatives by the health department and local bodies to scale up random tests have also come down over the past three months. Local bodies have shifted their focus to other administrative and routine works since November. 47 Omicron cases On whether contact tracing is still on, the health authorities admitted that it is now being done only in cases related to the Omicron variant. It is impossible to continue contact tracing at the scale done in the time of the second wave, they said. The district had reported 47 cases of the Omicron variant since December 1, 2021. All these persons had come from international destinations, including high-risk nations. The health department has also come across instances where people having symptoms continue to remain under home isolation without carrying out tests to confirm it. People without co-morbidities remain in quarantine for the mandatory period. Such cases will not come under the radar of the authorities. An infected person in a family may undergo a test to confirm the disease. But the chances of the family members, who develop symptoms, carrying out tests were remote, according to the health authorities. 1,081 test positive As many as 1,081 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Ernakulam on Wednesday. The number of persons who got infected through local contact was 1, 057. The source of infection was not confirmed in 12 cases, according to an official communication. The test positivity rate was 9.17%. Active caseload A total of 1,091 persons were placed under home isolation on Wednesday. The total number of persons under home isolation is 9, 729.

Since the drive was launched in September 2019, 32 persons have been arrested on detention orders issued by the District Collector on the recommendation of the District Police Chief, Ernakulam Rural, under Section 3 (1), and 40 were exiled from the revenue district limits on the orders issued by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) under Section 15 of KAAPA. While action is pending with the District Collector on nine reports, another six is pending with the IGP. The Ernakulam Rural police perhaps top the list in terms of invocation of KAAPA. “The invocation of KAAPA has been very effective in bringing down goonda activities considerably. One of our teams is constantly monitoring the activities of known goondas and rowdies and also history-sheeters and those on bail for potential violation of bail conditions in which case we move for the cancellation of their bails without wasting time. We have invoked KAAPA at least once against all those figuring in the goonda list,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). The number of reports submitted to the Collector seeking detention has risen progressively from 15 to 22, and 26 between 2019 and 2021 though in the case of reports seeking restraining orders the number has come down from a high of 32 in 2019 to 7 and 22 in the two subsequent years. But this had more to do with the realisation that detention has more deterrent effect than exiling in bringing down criminal activities and turning gangs dormant. There have also been instances in which persons exiled under Section 15 were booked under Section 3 and arrested after they were found to have violated the restraining order and entered the revenue district limits. The Station House Officer concerned proposes the invocation of KAAPA through the DySP concerned who then forwards it to the DPC who is the sponsoring authority. He in turn forwards it to either the Collector or the IGP depending on the sections invoked. KAAPA is resorted to on exhausting the other legal measures to restrain goonda activities threatening the law-and-order situation and the peace and tranquillity of the public. For instance, SHOs may invoke Section 107 or 110 of CrPC and approach the Revenue Divisional Officer, who is also the sub divisional magistrate, who may ask the accused to execute a bond undertaking not to indulge in criminal activities. On violation of the bond provisions, the police may arrest the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crackdown-with-kaapa-effective-in-tackling-crimes-say-rural-police/article38141688.ece

Unlike the usual trend of water hyacinths decaying by October, the aquatic plant is still seen rampant in the backwaters now, following extended monsoon and release of water from dams. Normally, water hyacinths dominate the water bodies during the July-August period in tandem with the monsoon run-off water and begin to decay as salinity levels in the backwaterswaters increase. The plant emerges as a threat mostly to cage aquaculture as it considerably reduces water flow in fish cages installed in the backwaters. Reduced water flow results in reduction in oxygen levels, leading to fish kill. This is a troubling situation for the fish farmers, who depend heavily on cage farms as their livelihood means, said Shinoj Subramanian, head of the KVK. Water hyacinth also acts as a breeding ground for parasites and other hazardous organisms that spread diseases among fish, he said. In order to tackle the issue, the KVK, functioning under the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), has launched an awareness campaign on the bad effects of water hyacinth on fish production and the method to remove them from the water bodies. In line with the campaign and as part of Swatchtha Pakhwada, a massive cleaning drive was conducted at Ezhikkara in Paravur taluk of Ernakulam district, by engaging young fish farmers to remove the water plants from an area of two acres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-hyacinth-poses-threat-to-cage-fish-farming/article38141693.ece

There have been more than 6,586 incidents leading to death by drowning during the period, indicating that such incidents often account for multiple casualties. The data was shared by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the Assembly last year in response to a question by Kochi MLA K.J. Maxy. Most casualties were reported in 2019 when 1,287 persons were killed in 1,270 incidents. In 2017, 1,248 lives were lost in 1,218 incidents. In 2018, drowning claimed 1,213 lives in 1,188 incidents. In 2020, as many as 1,067 lives were lost in 1,051 incidents and 1,025 lives in 996 incidents in 2016. Last year accounted for 870 lives in 863 incidents till October 14. During this period, 479 people were rescued, with the year 2021 accounting for the most number of persons rescued at 144. Reasons Unfamiliarity with waterbodies and venturing into the waters without knowing how to swim were among the primary reasons cited for the casualties. Precautionary measures such as putting up warning signs, enhanced patrolling in beach areas and dissemination of information through police aid posts at tourist hotspots, however, seem to have had little impact in bringing down accidents. “Lack of awareness, negligence, entering waters in an inebriated state and even suicidal acts account for the increasing instances of drowning. Sometimes, a group of people venture into the waters though only a few among them know swimming,” said T.B. Ramakrishnan, station officer, Gandhi Nagar fire and rescue station, Ernakulam. Mr. Ramakrishnan bemoaned how efforts to impart swimming lessons to school students were met with a lukewarm response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drowning-claims-6710-lives-in-the-state-in-past-five-years/article38141477.ece

In an affidavit filed on Wednesday, the State government said revised orders had been issued for the acquisition of 1,221 ha of land in various villages for the project on December 31, 2021. In fact, an order had been issued on August 18, 2021 for conducting a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) study and for constituting an expert group to evaluate the report. The order to proceed with land acquisition as per Section 8(2) of the LARR Act (Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act) would be issued only after getting the final approval from the Railway Board. The policy stand of the government was that it was a public project of high importance, beneficial to the State and should be implemented in public interest, the government said. The affidavit was filed by Chief Secretary V.P. Joy in response to a contempt of court case, allegedly for violating the assurance given by the State government in court that it would not carry out the land acquisition proceedings. The contempt petition was filed by M.T. Thomas from Kottayam and others. Tenders for EIA The government said that tenders were invited for carrying out the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study or field work and preparation of a Comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (CEIA) report and an Environment Management Plan (EMP). The social impact study shall include the extent of land, houses, settlements and other common properties likely to be affected by the acquisition. The demarcation would enable the general public and social impact assessment units to identify the land proposed for the acquisition. A detailed survey could be done only after publication of the preliminary notification for the land acquisition.

The government has constituted a State Hydrogen Mission and announced plans to buy 10 hydrogen-fuel buses, marking a shift from traditional fuel to sustainable alternatives. It is learnt that the Vyttila Mobility Hub will host a major hydrogen dispensing station. Hydrogen dispensed from the hub will serve both water transport vessels linked to the Kochi Metro Rail project and public transport vehicles. The TCC, founded in 1951 with registered office and factory at Eloor in Udyogamandal, near Kochi, is a chlor-alkali unit with hydrogen as by-product. Hydrogen from the TCC has been identified as the cheapest to meet the need for hydrogen fuel cell buses. Purification Hydrogen from the TCC is of 99.6% purity. But the automotive sector requires hydrogen of 99.9% purity, which can be supplied to the hydrogen mission for the transport sector. The TCC is in the midst of establishing infrastructure both for purification of hydrogen and to store and dispense it. Bids have been called for establishing the infrastructure that includes bottling and dispensing facilities, company sources said. The TCC produces around 4.5 tonnes of hydrogen a day and the production is expected to go up to six tonnes a day from next month. The demand from the hydrogen mission is 350 kg per day. The TCC is already using hydrogen as fuel for its boilers. The savings are financial as well as in terms of a drastic cut in environmental pollution. Hydrogen is a zero emission fuel. The TCC, which invested Rs. 60 crore from its own reserves to fund new facilities, has sought government aid to establish infrastructure for hydrogen purification, bottling, and dispensing. The company, with around 450 employees, has made a remarkable turnaround from losses with a turnover of Rs. 260 crore last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tcc-set-to-become-a-major-supplier-of-hydrogen-fuel/article38141475.ece

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali made the observation while issuing notice to the Registrar and board members on an appeal filed against a single judge’s verdict dismissing their writ petition challenging the board of studies reconstitution. The appeal was filed by Vijayakumar and Shino P. Jose, members of the academic council of management studies at the university. According to them, the notification issued on August 11, 2021, reconstituting the board of studies at the university was illegal. In fact, many among them were not teachers, even in the broader sense of the term. The members appointed included not only corporate heads but teachers of self-financing colleges too. Besides, the Syndicate had no authority to appointment members of the board of studies. The appellants contended that Chapter XIII of Statute IV of the Kannur University First Statute prescribed nomination of chairman and members of the board of studies only by the Chancellor. They also contended that teachers at government and aided colleges alone could be nominated, and unaided and private college teachers could not be treated as teachers. Teachers at self-financing educational institutions, though such institutions are affiliated to the university, were outside the purview of the definition of ‘teacher’ of the university. The court posted the appeal for further hearing on January17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-critical-of-board-of-studies-reconstitution-at-kannur-varsity/article38141391.ece

Zoning regulations governing establishment of residential, commercial and industrial enclaves too put a limit on acquiring land in urban areas. Though the government approved the establishment of private industrial parks on the lines of those operating under government agencies such as the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Kinfra) and the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) in the Industrial and Commerce Policy, 2017, the proposal has remained on paper because of a lack of clarity on the present limit on the maximum extent of land that can be acquired by a private entity. The lack of clarity has held up industrial park projects in the State, said M. Khalid, president of the Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA). Government order However, Industries Minister P. Rajeeve said at a meeting with industrialists here on Saturday that the government was considering the suggestions to reduce the minimum and maximum landholding limits for floating private parks. Department sources said they expected a government order soon. The industry is of the opinion that the minimum landholding limit can be 10 acres, while there should be no limit on the maximum area that can be acquired for a private park. A clarification from the government on the limit on landholding can help entities such as Pathanamthitta Industrial Promotion Council Pvt. Ltd. to establish what could be the State’s first private industrial park. Morly Joseph, president of the KSSIA Ernakulam unit, said those backing the SPV (special purpose vehicle) has identified 25 acres for the project. However, the maximum limit rule has prevented the project from taking off. The SPV was formed in 2021. Mr. Joseph said establishing industrial parks on a small extent of land would not be feasible, considering the cost of infrastructure building. Government entities such as Kinfra have set up industrial parks on a large extent of land, boosting the feasibility of infrastructure building. The Pathanamthitta SPV has been formed under the aegis of the KSSIA Pathanamthitta unit and the Central Travancore Chamber of Commerce.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-mulls-cutting-minimum-area-limit-for-industrial-parks/article38141466.ece

The breeding season of these birds is coming on. The Malabar Pied Hornbill is a monogamous bird and the flock must have been there either in pairs or to form them, he says. They nest in hollows of tall trees. The Athirappilly forest is home to the Great Indian Hornbill, the Common Grey Hornbill, and the Malabar Grey Hornbill besides the Malabar Pied Hornbill. “The Malabar Pied Hornbill is endemic to low elevation riparian forests. In the early 2000s, we noticed a decline in their nesting and embarked on a mission to monitor and conserve hornbills. That we are able to sight them during the nesting and fruiting season now indicates a growth in their population,” says K.H. Amitha Bachan, an academic and founder member of the Western Ghats Hornbill Foundation. “There were reports of their sighting from the Palakkad gap too, which has a similar ecosystem,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/party-of-hornbills-sighted-at-athirappilly/article38141632.ece

Nair Award, instituted by the Kerala State Productivity Council. “The company won the second best productivity performance award in the group four category, which includes companies with a turnover of less than Rs. 50 crore. This year, 22 companies were shortlisted in the preliminary round for the award,” said the company officials at a press meet here on Wednesday. The detailed performance report was reviewed by a panel of experts chaired by the FACT chairman to select the institutions eligible for the award. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve handed over the award to company chairman Vayoli Mohammad Master and MD P. Sathish Kumar at a function held at Kalamassery. Crisis in 2016 Established in 1937, Kerala Ceramics Limited was in severe crisis in early 2016 due to heavy losses and shortage of raw material. “After the new governing body took measures to reduce losses, increase production and extend marketing, the company recorded profit in the 2018-19 fiscal. Production increased by 201.53% and turnover by 233.19%,” they said. The company’s plant that manufactures spray dried kaolin for paper coating was the first of its kind in India. However, for more than 40 years the plant did not undergo periodic upgrades leading to a dip in production and quality. With the plant renovation in 2018, the company was able to increase production from 150 tonnes a month in 2016 to 1,220 tonnes. Reducing fuel costs Apart from this, technological changes such as thermal insulation and automatic power factor control were adopted to reduce fuel costs. The master plan prepared by the company in line with the government policy includes diversification of products, manufacturing of value-added products and manufacturing of by-products.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/laurel-comes-psus-way-after-turnaround/article38141452.ece

Opening the pilot launch of Neo Cradle, a scheme for newborns, in Kozhikode district through online mode on Wednesday, she said the Centre was likely to take a favourable stand. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has held discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue. The Minister said Neo Cradle was aimed at linking primary, secondary and tertiary-level healthcare institutions to ensure treatment for bodily changes in newborns. Efforts will be taken to detect changes such as drop in body temperature and glucose and oxygen levels on time. They could turn out to be severe health issues. Such babies will be referred to hospitals with modern facilities in well-equipped ambulances. Connectivity between hospitals and transportation of patients will be the highlights of the scheme. Training programmes for healthcare workers were held. Since the medical college hospital in Kozhikode is depended by people from other districts, benefits of the scheme are expected to reach them as well, the Minister said. She added that the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, would be converted into a model medical college hospital. The scheme is being implemented by the Kozhikode district administration, Health department, and the National Health Mission in association with the Indian Academy of Pediatrics and the National Neonatal Forum. Ms. George said the milk bank scheme to provide stored breast milk to newborns was going well at the Kozhikode medical college hospital. She pointed out that the infant mortality rate in Kerala was five per 1,000 live births now, which was on par with developed countries. The government is making efforts to bring it down further. A campaign will be launched in all Assembly constituencies to detect lifestyle diseases and reduce their incidence among those aged below 30. In the first year, it will be held in one grama panchayat. A data registry of cancer patients too will be prepared, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-expecting-central-nod-for-aiims-at-balussery-minister/article38141402.ece

Whether the contentious Thiruvananthapuram-Kasaragod semi-high-speed rail project, SilverLine, will be implemented or not, many believe that Mr. Vijayan’s calibre as an effective administrator will be tested in the coming years. Unlike his previous tenure, Mr. Vijayan wants to implement things down for posterity. The execution of the Rs. 63,940-lakh-crore SilverLine project will be the legacy of the second Pinarayi Vijayan Cabinet, party sources said. Perhaps no other Chief Minister has undertaken so much stake in a State-level project. The Kerala Rail Development Corporation (K-Rail) has been set up as a joint venture company between the State government and the Ministry of Railways for implementing the project. The quick creation of a special deputy collector office and 11 special tahsildar land acquisition offices and sanction for acquisition of land in villages in all districts signals that the government means business. His unveiling of a package during the maiden outreach programme, Janasamaksham, an interaction with social and cultural leaders in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday, indicates that he is game for a head-on with political parties, especially the Congress which has trained political weapons on the project. Changing attitudes However, party sources said that Mr. Vijayan would have to stem the tide arising from a complex web of factors. He knows that the middle class of Kerala is embracing the ‘bourgeois-liberal’ tendencies when it comes to futuristic needs. The sources said the Chief Minister was likely to call an all-party meeting to spell out the objectives of the project. The belligerent Congress may find the going tough if the Indian Union Muslim League leadership backs the project. Besides, the sources said that Mr. Vijayan faced no opposition from the Left Democratic Front though some isolated naysayers had found space in the media. Centre’s support likely Getting clearance from the Centre may not be a Herculean task when the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government has been initiating such mega projects, including in States where the party is in power, and flaunting them time and again. Besides, the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, which would get a slice of the credit, may not want to be targeted as anti-development in Kerala. Despite its initial hue and cry against the project, the BJP State unit will have to force itself into silence or play a diplomatic role in the future — outwardly opposing but generally welcoming the project. Before going full speed ahead, however, the government will have to come clean on the viability of the project, financial commitment, funding agencies and environment impact.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/k-rail-a-litmus-test-for-pinarayis-administrative-acumen/article38141471.ece

According to healthcare workers of the Kozhikode Corporation stationed at the vaccination camp at Tagore Centenary Hall, some workers were seeking their first dose and many others the second dose. They were mainly from Odisha, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Assam. The documents downloaded from Co-WIN portal said they had got the vaccine from their native places a day or two before. The labourers were left wondering how it was possible to go to their villages, get the jab, and return to Kerala in such a short time. They said they had not gone home at all in recent days. Registration for vaccination is possible only throughwww.cowin.gov.in. Since data on the portal showed their status as “vaccinated”, they were not given injection. Health officials pointed out that it was risky to keep them unvaccinated at a time when the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 was spreading.

It was on January 6 last year that hundreds of BEML employees launched an agitation against the government move. CITU national secretary K. Chandran Pillai will inaugurate the 365th day’s agitation in front of BEML unit at Kanjikode on Thursday afternoon. A. Prabhakaran, MLA; CITU district president P.K. Sasi; INTUC district president Chingannur Manoj; AITUC district secretary Muralidharan Nair; CITU district secretary M. Hamsa; AITUC State secretary Vijayan Kunisseri; and BEML Action Council convener S.B. Raju will address the protesters. The Union government had started the move to privatise BEML way back in 2016. But the opposition from political parties and the employees forced the government to abandon the move. However, the second Modi government is going ahead with the plans to disinvest 26% of the shares at a time when BEML is making good profits. Global tenders Last year, BEML secured orders worth more than Rs. 10,000 crore through global tenders. A company engaged in the manufacturing of heavy military vehicles, rail and metro coaches, and mining and construction vehicles, BEML has four units across the country, in Bangalore, Kolar, Mysore and Kanjikode. The Kanjikode unit is functioning on 375 acres of leased land given by the State government. It manufactures army vehicles, passenger railway coaches, and metro coaches.

The commission said the consent of a person could not be made a requisite for obtaining the certificate. If either the man or wife in a case of marital dispute was refused the certificate of the other despite asking for it for the education or other needs of their child, a copy of the document should be made available on a legal application. Acting on a petition from a Nedumangad native, the single bench of member K. Nazeer directed the General Education Principal Secretary and the Director of General Education to issue orders to ensure that schools in the State followed its direction. They should issue guidelines on the issue of certificates for requirements of children. The petitioner had said that her husband and she were living separately owing to marital problems. Her son had secured admission to a college where he would receive a fee concession on producing proof that the parents had studied till Class X. She had asked her husband for a copy many times but to no avail. When approached, the school headmistress said the certificate could be issued only with his consent. The headmistress told the commission that the petitioner’s husband had not applied for a certificate that he had studied in the school till Class X. There was no hurdle to issuing the certificate if he applies. The commission observed that usually certificates were issued only when people to whom those belonged applied for it. However, certificates of either parent could be needed for education-related requirements of their children. If the concerned parent refused to give it, the office concerned should issue a copy of the document on a valid application. This was necessary to ensure children’s rights in families facing marital disputes. If not, children would be denied opportunities, resulting in violation of their rights. The commission asked the Deputy Director of Education concerned to ensure that the petitioner was issued the copy of her husband’s certificate on submitting an application.  The commission says the consent of parents cannot be made a requisite for obtaining certificates||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/protect-rights-of-children-in-marital-dispute-panel/article38141455.ece

Mr. Augustine and Minister for Transport Antony Raju inspected the stretch as part of the second phase development of the canal, which forms one of the major drainage systems of the State capital. Rs. 24 crore The Public Works Department has sanctioned Rs. 24 crore for laying the concrete slabs. At present, slabs have been laid over 300 metres of the canal. To prevent garbage and silt from accumulating under the covered portion, large manholes will be constructed every 50 metres to enable cleaning using mini-excavators, the Minister said. Grills also will be installed at both ends of the covered area, he said. The Ministers also visited the Valiyathura-Thope regions which are affected by coastal erosion. Coastal stretches including Valiyathura will be included in the list of hotspots and protected by constructing seawalls or through other suitable methods, the Water Resources Minister said. Short-term solutions will be identified for protecting the houses along the coastal stretches. Coastal protection According to a study by the National Centre for Coastal Research, 60 km along the Kerala coast are in need of protection. It is estimated that the State Government intends to spend Rs. 5,400 crore for coastal protection over the next five years. The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board has sanctioned Rs. 1,500 crore in the current financial year, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/slabs-to-cover-amayizhanjan-canal/article38141739.ece

The propaganda sheet points out that the Communist Party of India (CPI ) and the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP) had echoed the concerns raised by the UDF, though belatedly. [A CPI State council meeting reportedly felt that the government should keep land acquisition in abeyance until it negated public doubts about compensation and rehabilitation of those displaced by the project.] The UDF said the KSSP had pointed out the discrepancy between K-Rail and the government estimates regarding the cost and financial viability of the scheme. Mr. Vijayan had portrayed those who opposed SilverLine as ultras. If so, the KSSP would fall in the bracket, the pamphlet said. Ideally, the State should augment the existing railway network, rectify curves and modernise the signalling system to run fast trains between Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod. It could network the four airports in the State via an affordable air link to reduce travel time. ‘Irredeemable debt’ Kerala could ill-afford K-Rail. Its economy was precarious. A Rs. 4-lakh-crore mass rapid transit system for the elite would sink the State in irredeemable debt, it said. The pamphlet also claimed that the steep railway embankment required for K-Rail would geographically divide the State asunder. The barrier would impede natural drainage and exacerbate floods and mudslips. Moreover, the government would not allow any expansion of roads or construction within a minimum 2-km radius of SilverLine. Development works in local bodies abutting the K-Rail track would grind to a halt. SilverLine would subsume large tracts of ecologically fragile wetlands, mangrove forests and paddy fields. The UDF said the K-Rail ticket rate, as per current calculations, was beyond the pale of ordinary folk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-pamphlet-highlights-disquiet-in-ruling-front/article38141479.ece

Dev, and later released her on bail in a case related to the alleged domestic abuse and abetment of suicide of her daughter-in-law Priyanka. Santha, the second accused in the case, had last week secured an anticipatory bail from the Kerala High Court, as per the conditions of which she had to appear before the investigating officer. On Wednesday morning, she appeared before the Nedumangad Deputy Superintendent of Police and was released on bail, on condition that she appear at the station as and when required and co-operate with the ongoing investigation. Her daughter-in-law Priyanka was found dead at her parents’ house in Vembayam in Vattappara police station limits in the capital on May 12 last year, just a day after her return from her husband's house in Angamaly. Though the initial case was related to unnatural death, Priyanka's brother Vishnu filed a complaint, accusing the in-laws of being responsible for her death. He had cited the fact that Priyanka had filed a domestic abuse complaint with the Vattapara police against her husband Unni Dev, a small-time actor. Her mother had also come out with accusations against him of physically assaulting Priyanka. They also produced video and photographic evidence of injuries that Priyanka had sustained allegedly due to the assaults. Dowry The family had also accused the in-laws of harassing her for money. The husband was arrested on May 25 last year, but the Police were initially unable to arrest her as she had contracted COVID-19. After that Santha had remained untraceable, until the anticipatory bail was secured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-arrest-late-actor-rajan-p-devs-wife/article38141729.ece

In the 2021 water year, the dam, after a gap of 30 years, had received 212 tmcft water. It was the second highest quantum of water received after 1980 when the quantum received was 216 tmcft. But, due to non-completion of the canal modernisation project, Andhra Pradesh could not draw its allocated quota. Andhra Pradesh has an allocation of 32.5 tmcft through the Tungabhadra High-Level Main Canal (HLC); 24 tmcft through the Low-Level Canal that flows into Kurnool district, and another 10 tmcft through the HLC as Krishna water diversion quota for KC Canal, making it 66.5 tmcft in total. Based on the actual utilisation till December 31, 2021, the 212 tmcft received was equal to the allocation made as per the KWDT Award 45 years ago.  “This is the highest abstraction in the history of the dam after 1980-81,” Irrigation Superintending Engineer Nayakanti Rajasekhar told The Hindu .  Anantapur district so far received only 23.9 tmcft through the HLC, and that included 4 tmcft from the KC Canal diversion quota. The HLC can get water only till the water level at the Tungabhardra Dam is maintained at 695 feet, while the LLC can draw from a lower level till April-end, and so far 14.86 tmcft has been drawn and the irrigation officials are confident of utilising the remaining 10 tmcft too. In 1980-81, an abstraction of 216.646 tmcft was achieved when the reservoir capacity was 117.695 tmcft, and against the present capacity of 100.855 tmcft. The HLC delivery capacity in Karnataka is 4,000 cusecs, while from AP border in Anantapur district it is 2,200 cusecs. An indent of 1,800 cusecs is given to ensure there are no breaches in the age-old lifeline of the district even for drinking water. Meanwhile, the LLC has a capacity of only 700 cusecs, and is supposed to serve 1.51 lakh acres in Kurnool district. But this year, it has been promised to cater to only 70,700 acres. The Rs. 450-crore HLC modernisation works that had begun in 2008 were pre-closed in 2019 due to inordinate delays for various reasons, and a government order bars taking up further works for the next five years. “We will, however, propose to take up the remaining modernisation works as a special case to meet the growing demand, though we are yet to prepare a DPR for that,” Mr. Rajasekhar said. Rough estimates put the expenditure at Rs. 300 crore for the remaining works to be completed on the HLC and another Rs. 70 crore to upgrade the link canal from Mopidi to Penna Ahobilam Balancing Reservoir (PABR), which has a capacity to store 11 tmcft, but is currently storing only 5 tmcft. To enhance the capacity, about 1400 acres of land needs to be acquired in the areas to be inundated under the PABR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-yet-to-draw-its-quota-of-tungabhadra-water/article38141381.ece

The medical and health department officials attributed the development to the public congregations in the last week. Despite the rising infections, COVID-appropriate behaviour was largely missing at public places all over Chittoor district, with no surveillance on public transport and gatherings. The number of infections is likely to go up in the coming weeks, after Vaikunta Ekadasi and Sankranti festivities. District Medical and Health Officer U. Sree Hari said that going by the upward projection of the COVID graph in the other States and in Chittoor district, it could be perceived that the number of infections was on the rise. “At present, we have two COVID Care Centres, one at Vishnu Nivasam in Tirupati and another at RVS College in Chittoor. An action plan to suit the emerging trend would be ready shortly after a meeting with the District Collector,” the DM&HO added. Referring to the inoculation of children aged between 15 and 18, Dr. Sree Hari said that the three-day drive was largely successful with reaching a 58% target out of 2.10 lakh. “The drive will continue till Saturday to inoculate the maximum number of the target group,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chittoor-dist-sees-sudden-spike-in-covid-infections/article38141535.ece

Crop damage was reported near the villages of Patrapalle, Siddareddipalle, and Tanjavuru. According to information, the herd enatered the border villages from Tamil Nadu forests after straying from the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary on Tuesday night and continued the havoc till the early hours of Wednesday. Despite knowing the herd’s presence in the fields, the farmers on the night vigil and others from the villages were forced to stay away from efforts to drive the pachyderms owing to thick fog conditions till 8 a.m. Acting on information, the forest watchers rushed to the spot and secured the herd into a thicket at the foot of a hillock. The farmers feared that the herd might return to the fields and sought the forest staff to continue vigil at the vulnerable exit and entry points along the forest stretch. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West) S. Ravi Shankar said the herd belonged to the Koundinya Wildlife Sanctuary. “Our field staff is constantly watching the herd movements. We have advised the farmers to abandon night vigils and avoid wearing white clothes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-tense-as-elephants-damage-crops-near-chittoor/article38141109.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy is posing a far more dangerous threat than coronavirus, TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu has alleged. Addressing the party’s Members of Parliament, MLAs, and parliamentary and Assembly in-charges on Wednesday, Mr. Naidu said the YSRCP government caused more damage to the State than the one caused by bifurcation of the State. “All systems and constitutional institutions have come under attack. The TDP leaders are being persecuted with fabricated cases and false arrests,” Mr. Naidu alleged. Post bifurcation, the residual State of Andhra Pradesh had very limited resources at its disposal, but the TDP government had raised the hopes of the people on the future of the State, Mr. Naidu said. “There was Rs. 22,000 crore deficit budget. But the TDP government had taken up welfare and developmental activities equally. Prices were under control. There were no new taxes. TIDCO houses were built for the poor,” Mr. Naidu said. “Our government had spent Rs. 64,000 crore on irrigation projects and completed 71% works on the Polavaram project. It had taken up development of Amaravati,” Mr. Naidu said, and alleged that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy failed to control prices, increased existing taxes, and imposed new taxes on garbage and toilets. “While the TDP considers society as a temple and the poor as gods, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy has been looting society and considering the poor as easy prey. Nobody is safe,” Mr. Naidu observed, and cited as examples the booking of “false cases” against party leaders K. Atchannaidu and P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagans-misrule-posing-bigger-threat-than-coronavirus-naidu/article38141556.ece

Chandrababu Naidu as they have witnessed the dark age during his term, Adviser (Public Affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy has said. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said the people had reposed their faith in Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who had risen to new heights with his good governance, taking welfare to the next level, while the TDP remained a failed party. “Mr. Naidu can only dream about coming to power. In reality, the situation in the TDP has come to such a pass that it has to change its candidate for Kuppam (now being represented by Mr. Naidu) in the next elections,” he said. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said schemes such as ‘Chandranna Kanuka’, Anna Canteen, and Ramadan Tofa had been discontinued because of corruption. He said people had faith in Mr. Jagan, who stood by his promise and credited Rs. 1.2 lakh crore into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT, leaving no scope for corruption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/people-will-not-believe-naidu-says-sajjala/article38141557.ece

Sivaji presented Dr. Haribabu a portrait of a rare photograph of Lok Nayak Jaya Prakash Narayan addressing a meeting in Vijayawada in May 1975. Dr. Haribabu, then 23 years, was sitting on the dais along with Dr. Sivaji, who was sitting just beside the chair on which JP was seated. Also seen were Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu, former Governor Satyanarayana Reddy, and others. Reminiscing about the meeting, Dr. Sivaji said, “JP had addressed a meeting at the auditorium in Montessori College in Vijayawada. We were all his ardent supporters. Dr. Haribabu was 23 years old at that time, but was very enthusiastic. Just a month after the meeting, Emergency was declared and we were all put in jail. I was jailed in Rajahmundry, while Dr. Haribabu was lodged in Visakhapatnam jail. During the court hearings, we were taken to Hyderabad.” The interesting part was that we all entered Parliament, Dr. Sivaji said. “After Satyanarayana Reddy, I was nominated to the Rajya Sabha. Mr. Venkaiah Naidu was also nominated to the Rajya Sabha. Later, he went on to become Union Minister and the Vice-President. Dr. Haribabu was elected to the Lok Sabha from Visakhapatnam. We have an association spanning four decades,” said Dr. Sivaji. Dr. Haribabu had a busy day on Wednesday and took part in the Sankranti festival at Guntur Club.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nostalgic-moment-for-haribabu/article38141554.ece

Following the incident in the university campus in Hubballi, three students were taken into custody by the police.  The protest by the students has been under way for close to a month. On January 5, a protest march and dharna were planned to intensify the agitation.  Vice-Chancellor Professor P. Ishwara Bhat was leaving the site of the protest when students started raising slogans seeking his resignation. While the police were escorting Prof. Bhat to his office, one of the protestors threw ink at the V-C, which also fell on police personnel. The police immediately took three students into custody for questioning. The protesting students are seeking promotion to the next semester on the basis of a High Court order issued in December 2021, which was in favour of promoting three-year LLB students. KSLU went ahead with examinations for five-year LLB students. This triggered the protest. The students are demanding that the KSLU withdraw its appeal against the High Court order and also promote the even semester students of both three-year and five-year LLB courses. Students organisations and others have extended support to the agitation, and the issue was also raised during the winter session of the State Assembly at Belagavi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/law-students-throw-ink-at-kslu-v-c-in-hubballi/article38141107.ece

Rama Rao has said that the comments made by BJP national president J.P. Nadda were highly objectionable. “I have lost respect for the BJP leader,” he said. “Till yesterday, I had respect for him. But, he has reduced it down to the level of State BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar. The BJP has become ‘Bakwas Jumla Party’. They are copying our schemes like Mission Bhagiratha and Rythu Bandhu and still criticising us. Is Mr. Nadda deaf to the speech made by Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat?” asked Mr. Rama Rao, while addressing a press conference at the party office on Wednesday, along with Excise Minister Srinivas Goud, Fisheries Minister T. Srinivas Yadav and others. “The BJP president alleged that there is a lot of corruption in Telangana but, while answering a question raised by TPCC president Revanth Reddy in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Shekhawat said that the Kaleshwaram project was set up by the Telangana government with its own funds and no corruption in executing it came to their notice. Now, let me know who is mad? Who should go to Erragadda?” asked KTR, adding that the “BJP government in Karnataka was termed as the most corrupt in India, and same was mentioned by Biocon head Kiran Mazumdar Shaw in her tweet”. “As there is no development in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP is seeking votes in that State in the name of ‘controlling rowdyism’. Let BJP leaders visit Mahabubnagar where reverse migration has been taking place. Workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are coming back to Telangana and we came to their rescue during the pandemic,” he said. Alleging that the NDA government at the Centre has been using ‘its partners ED and NIA’ against the Opposition, Mr. Rama Rao said that nobody in Telangana would be scared of them. “BJP has formed governments in eight States by taking MLAs from other parties,” he said. “We are an employee-friendly government and take several measures for the benefit of workers. If there are any issues, we will sort them out. The BJP leaders has nothing to do with that. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has turned the national media into ‘Modia’,” he commented, warning that the TRS would remind the Centre on the ‘unfulfilled’ promises made during bifurcation of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naddas-comments-on-cm-objectionable-ktr/article38141380.ece

Some college students walk into one of the cloth store and ask for the price of a striking red shalwar-kameez. On the steps of a shop, a few men sit around and watch a cellphone and laugh. Inside one of the stalls at the Numaish or the 81st Annual All India Exhibition, Shabir Ahmed sits with aides and tries to calculate the impact of the 10-day suspension of the shopping carnival. “I am spending Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 4,000 per day on food and room rent. Then there is the fear that the whole event will be a washout. They should at least allow people to walk in buy so that our daily expenses are met,” says Mr. Ahmed, who has been coming to the fair for the past 30 years with his exquisite handrafted pashmina shawls and embroidered items. Ahmed is from Safakadal town near Srinagar. There are dozens of businessmen like him from Kashmir, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh and other regions of the country who are now waiting with anticipation about resumption of Numaish. They are part of a business community that makes annual trip to Hyderabad’s Numaish in hope of doing good business and fat profits. But the COVID-19 pandemic, viral images of crowding on the first day of inauguration and the surge in cases forced the State to call for a 10-day temporary halt to the fair on the opening night. “On an average, we do Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 40,000 business per day. Some days it used go up to Rs. 1,00,000. Hyderabad is good for business,” says Gauhar Wani who has set up a stall for dry fruits sourced from Kashmir. “If business resumes after 10 days, we will make up for the losses,” he says praising the Telangana government for its calibrated COVID-19 protocol. While medium-sized stall holders have shelled out Rs. 1,10,000, the GST component to the exchequer is approximately Rs. 20,000. “If we are unable to do business we will have to carry back the goods. That will add to our burden. They should allow business to resume and stretch the exhibition,” says Faisal Khan, who has brought chinaware from Khurja in Uttar Pradesh to the expo. It is not just the big traders from across the country who have been impacted by the 10-day suspension of the exhibition. The lanes leading to Gate No 1 and 2 that are usually lined by balloon sellers, toy sellers, trinket hawkers and sweetmeat sellers are also deserted. “There are no takers for what we are selling. The police are asking us to close this stall,” said Vishnu, who has come from Delhi and is selling petha, popcorn and other sweets. As the exhibition remains shuttered in a limbo, missing from the scene are the sounds and sight of colourful toys, the smell of sweets and the laughter of children walking in and out with their parents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/shopkeepers-idle-away-time-at-numaish/article38141578.ece

The judge said the MP should be set free forthwith on furnishing a personal bond. After hearing the criminal petition moved as lunch motion by Mr. Sanjay, the judge also stayed the remand order issued by the Karimnagar magistrate sending the MP in judicial custody. The judge, however, said the MP and his followers should adhere to COVID-19 guidelines issued by the State government while carrying out their political activities. Mr. Sanjay, who is also BJP Telangana president, undertook ‘Jagarana Deeksha’ at the BJP office in Karimnagar protesting against GO 317 related to re-allotment of teachers to different districts. A posse of policemen arrived at the BJP office after 10 p.m., broke open the doors and shifted him to the police station along with his associates. Having issued an FIR under different sections of Indian Penal Code and provisions of Disaster Management Act and Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, the Karimnagar police filed a memo before the magistrate seeking to add Section 333 of IPC. They contended that the ACP sustained an injury on his right hand finger. This was permitted by the magistrate even as no medical certificate was presented by the police. This showed that the magistrate passed order mechanically, the judge noted. “From perusal of the remand report, it is clear that the petitioner was leading a political demonstration which is not unnatural in democracy,” Justice Ujjal Bhuyan observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-high-court-grants-bail-to-bjp-chief-bandi-sanjay/article38141102.ece

Sreedharan, former managing director of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, has said. This is because high concrete or masonry walls will have to be provided to prevent trespass of people and animals in the corridor. Fencing will not help as it can be violated easily. Providing solid walls on either side is a sure environmental disaster, as it will block natural drainage and will be an eyesore as well. Providing overbridges or underbridges every 500 m, to counter concerns that the rail corridor will divide the State, alone will not be sufficient, he said on Wednesday in response to a public interaction of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. 800 overbridges Further, about 800 rail overbridges/rail underbridges will have to be constructed in 393 km. Each will cost about Rs. 20 crore. That means a total cost of about Rs. 16,000 crore and this cost has not been included in the present estimate (of Rs. 63,940 crore). This will also entail additional land acquisition, which has not been foreseen. The extra cost of land and time for acquisition has to be reckoned. ‘Total lie’ “It was also mentioned that the detailed project report (DPR) of major projects are not made public. This is a total lie. I had prepared DPRs for at least 10 major projects and none of the DPRs was kept away from the public. Why should the State government fool the people by underestimating the cost and hiding facts,” Mr. Sreedharan asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/393-km-will-get-flooded/article38141110.ece

Briefing reporters after a leadership conclave here on Wednesday, UDF convener M.M. Hassan said that the Opposition would set up permanent protest centres in 11 districts through which the proposed semi-high-speed railway traversed. The hubs would emerge as epicentres of anti-government struggle. Mr. Hassan said Kollam, Kottayam, Kozhikode and Kannur would emerge as hotspots of the UDF’s anti-SilverLine protest. The Opposition would muster local support against the project. It would highlight the plight of families left in the lurch by the project. Uprooting markers Mr. Hassan said UDF workers would uproot SilverLine markers and resist the demarcation of the elevated railway embankment’s alignment. Mr. Hassan said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had held the Assembly in contempt by keeping the House in the dark about the environmental, economic and social impact of the project. Instead, he had chosen to unveil cherry-picked and sanitised parts of the scheme to a set of corporate yes-men. Mr. Vijayan seemed afraid to face the Opposition in the Assembly. Public meetings The UDF would hold public meetings across the State to counter the government’s pro-SilverLine propaganda. The UDF has arrayed a large group of environmentalists, climate scientists, railway experts, intellectuals, social media influencers and writers to oppose the project. Mr. Hassan pointed out that the pro-CPI(M) think tank Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP) had opposed SilverLine. Some KSSP activists would also join ranks with the UDF to counter the “quixotic” scheme. The UDF was not against an effective and speedy mass rapid transport system. However, SilverLine was no solution. It was economically and environmentally untenable. He urged the government to shed its obstinacy and abandon the project. Varsity protest The UDF would hold protest marches in front of various universities in the State on January 14 to oppose the “unlawful interference” of Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and Higher Education Minister R. Bindu in university affairs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/udf-for-special-session-to-discuss-silverline/article38141113.ece

If the administration does not tread sensitively, K-Rail markers and subsequent land acquisition could become rallying points for anti-government sentiment. Ideally, the government should clear the ambiguities regarding the economic, social and environmental impact of the project. Some CPI leaders reportedly complained that the LDF partners are in the dark about the project. Forging ahead blindly with K-Rail would not augur well for the administration. The land acquisition should go hand in hand with the disbursal of adequate compensation and rehabilitation of displaced families and businesses. The government should counter the propaganda that K-Rail would freeze road expansion and construction within a 2-km radius of the railway line. Some State council members expressed scepticism about elevating the K-Rail path on mammoth concrete structures to skirt paddies and wetlands. They said the CPI should raise the concerns in the LDF. State’s other needs Moreover, some leaders felt the government should focus on modernising public health care and investing in education and social welfare instead of implementing mega schemes. CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran reportedly told the council that demarcation of the line would follow public hearings. He pointed out that K-Rail was a top agenda on the LDF’s manifesto and the electorate had endorsed the project. Hence, the LDF could not publicly disavow the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-asks-kerala-govt-to-tread-cautiously/article38141114.ece

The two-day event is conducted under the aegis of Transdisciplinary Research Initiative Centre in Adolescent Health (TRICA), under UGC-STRIDE. In his keynote address, Ravishankar Polisetty, a Hyderabad-based cardiovascular surgeon and a doctor of naturopathic medicine, recalled the paradigm shift taken by the research ecosystem with the advent of transdisciplinary research and explained the use of mathematical models in solving real life problems. “The researchers and medical practitioners must utilise the spiritual and scientific knowledge in our Vedas to address public health challenges in the contemporary world. The three Doshas, Vata, Pita and Kapha, determine the unique levels of mental and physical status of the body and imbalance in these three creates different diseases,” he maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/use-ancient-knowledge-to-address-health-issues/article38141538.ece

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:32 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Will Centre choose to delink PM-Kisan from YSR Rythu Bharosa?||Launching a diatribe against Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for “labelling his sticker” on the Central government schemes, the BJP, at its ‘Janaagraha Sabha’ recently, particularly made a mention of the YSR Rythu Bharosa - PM Kisan scheme. With the BJP leaders pointing out that the PM Kisan (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi) scheme cannot be combined with any scheme implemented by any State / UT, the State government seems to be in a fix. Should the Centre choose to delink the scheme, the State government has to find a way out for continuing Rythu Bharosa as a stand-alone scheme from kharif next. In such a scenario, the State government has to mobilise at least Rs. 3,250 crore additionally if it is to implement the scheme on its own. Since inception of the scheme in December 2018 and up to December 7, 2021, the Central government has paid more than Rs. 8,185 crore to 54.32 lakh beneficiaries in the State. A sum of Rs. 1,036 crore was credited into the bank accounts of more than 50.58 lakh farmers as part of the YSR Rythu Bharosa - PM Kisan scheme on January 3 this year. ‘Dubious claims’ “The Jagan Mohan Reddy government is hoodwinking the farmers by putting out full page advertisements in newspapers that it is a State scheme. But people are not blind to believe such dubious claims,” says BJP State general secretary Vishnuvardhan Reddy. “The State government has no authority to combine YSR Rythu Bharosa with PM Kisan,” he says. Referring to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s reply in the Rajya Sabha, he says, “PM-Kisan, being a Central scheme, cannot be combined with any other scheme implemented by any State / UT.” ‘No truth in allegation’ However, A.P. State Agriculture Mission Vice-Chairman M.V.S. Nagi Reddy says there is no truth in the allegation that the State government is claiming entire credit. “The scheme is christened YSR Rythu Bharosa - PM Kisan. In a federal system, it is not correct to demarcate it as State and Central schemes. The ultimate objective is to see that farmers are benefited,” Mr. Nagi Reddy observes. ‘No communication yet’ When contacted, Agriculture Commissioner H. Arun Kumar says the State government has not received any communication from the Union government on delinking of Rythu Bharosa and PM-Kisan. The State government has extended a financial assistance of Rs. 18,777 crore to 2.01 crore families under the scheme. During 2019-20, an assistance of Rs. 6,534 was given to 46.79 lakh families. It was Rs. 6,567 crore during 2020-21 and Rs. 6,981 crore during 2021-22. This includes Rs. 13,500 per annum given to tenant and tribal farmers, whose number is about 1.50 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/will-centre-choose-to-delink-pm-kisan-from-ysr-rythu-bharosa/article38141156.ece

Mr. Varma had taken to the Twitter on Tuesday and posed a series of questions to Mr. Nani over the issue. Mr. Nani, in his response on Wednesday, said that “cinema is not an essential product, but theatres are public places that provide entertainment to the people.” “For the past 66 years, all State governments have been fixing the ticket prices so that the common man’s obsession for films is not taken advantage of,” the Minister said, and added that as per the Cinematography Act, the ticket prices were fixed as per the facilities provided to the consumer. “What kind of an economy is it to sell a Rs. 100 ticket for Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 2,000? What kind of a market mechanism is it? Is it demand and supply, or black marketing?” Mr. Nani questioned. “A film is not a product. It is an entertainment service. We are only trying to regulate the admission rates, but not the production of films,” Mr. Nani said. When Mr. Varma sought an audience with the Minister so that the issues related to the film fraternity could be discussed and resolved, Mr. Nani said a meeting would be arranged soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ticket-pricing-rgv-and-perni-nani-agree-to-meet/article38141545.ece

The ‘Coffee with Corporators’ programme served as a platform for ward representatives to highlight long-term civic issues plaguing various wards. Thirteen corporators from Zone I and II and residents from these areas were invited to the interactive session. While the corporators from Bheemili spoke about the lack of basic amenities in the colonies despite integrating the wards with the GVMC, corporators from Arilova complained about the rampant rise in peddling of drugs and ganja in their localities. Ward 4 corporator D. Yedukondala Rao said that residents of his ward agreed to the merger of the villages with the GVMC only after the civic body had promised to provide all amenities. “But till now, our colonies have not witnessed any development,” he alleged. “A number of roads in Chepuluppada, K. Nagarapalem and Nerelevalasa are in dire need of attention. While there is already a shortage of street lights, even the existing ones were damaged in cyclones over the years. Many areas lack proper drainage connectivity and drinking water supply,” Mr. Yedukondala Rao said. The corporator said that there is not a single park in the area despite the ward having close to 40 green spaces that can be used for the purpose. He also complained that several villages close to the coast do not have a proper burial ground. Ward 2 corporator G. Chinni Kumari Lakshmi said that the water being released from the Gosthani is barely able to meet the drinking water needs of the people in areas like Bheemili and Tagarapuvalasa during the summer. She requested the GVMC to lay pipelines quickly. She also alleged that in some cases, water which is being supplied to the residents is not treated. Ward 1 corporator A. Padma complained about the unauthorised digging of borewells by many people leading to water scarcity in the ward. She added that instead of the GVMC spending huge amounts of money by sending water tankers, the corporation could think of coming up with a permanent plan to address the issue. Ward 12 corporator A. Rohini said that use of ganja is on the rise. “This has been an issue for a long time. In some colonies, we have come to know that some people are even cultivating ganja plants at home,” Ms. Rohini said. Corporator from Ward 13, K. Sunitha, also complained about the drug menace in Arilova as well as some other pressing civic issues. Both the corporators spoke over the issues being faced by residents in the hillock areas. M. Priyanka, a corporator from Ward 6, requested the GVMC to construct a foot- overbridge near Chandrampalem for the benefit of students and pedestrians. She also complained that many people were unable to utilise welfare schemes being implemented by the State government as the applications were being delayed at ward sachivalayams. Several corporators asked GVMC Commissioner G. Lakshmisha to conduct surprise checks at Sachivalayams, alleging that the Sachivalayam staff were behaving rudely with the public. Mr. Lakshmisha said the issues raised at the session would be listed down and a timeline formed to resolve them based on the priority. Mayor G. Hari Venkata Kumari attended the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/denizens-corporators-discuss-civic-issues-over-a-cup-of-coffee/article38141749.ece

A similar clash had occurred in 2020, after which the State government had banned the use of ring nets in a distance of eight nautical miles from the coast. However, despite the ban and an order from the High Court, the fishermen from Vasavanipalem, Mangamaripeta and Yendada have reportedly been using the ring nets within the restricted area, a fishermen from Pedajalaripeta said. “With the holes in the ring nets being small and less than half an inch in diameter, marine life is affected and the quantity of fish in the sea is depleted quickly, which is why we have been urging for a ban on the use of ring nets,” said Demudu, a fisherman from Pedajalaripeta. On Tuesday, a group of fishermen with ring nets ventured into the sea for fishing in the restricted area, which led to the clash. Later, according to the fishermen from Pedajalaripeta, a police team had visited their locality at 5 a.m. and picked up five persons on charges of causing disturbance. “We do not know about their whereabouts and we demand that they be released immediately,” said a woman from Pedajalaripeta.  Speaking to The Hindu , JSP leader Kona Tata Rao said that the fishermen from Pedajalaripeta have been agitating since 2018, but authorities have not taken any concrete steps to address their concerns. In 2020, Minister for Animal Husbandry Seediri Appalaraju had promised to set up a committee headed by the Collector to enforce the ban, but it has not taken shape, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fishermen-from-pedajalaripeta-stage-blockade-a-day-after-clash/article38141758.ece

Mr. Appalaraju said that the use of ring nets is not a local issue, but an issue that is prevalent all the way from Srikakulam to Nellore. This issue can be sorted out only through constructive talks. He clarified that as per the court orders and the government ban, fishermen using ring nets can fish only outside the reserve zone of eight km from the coast. Most importantly, as per the Marine Fisheries Regulation Act, all fishermen should obtain licences to conduct fishing with specific nets. As per the order, traditional fishermen with non-motorised boats and beach landing craft will be allowed to fish in the reserve zone and all fishermen with motorised or mechanised boats will have to fish outside the reserve zone. He added that boats with ring nets should immediately obtain a licence and fix the transponders. Regarding the fixing of fishing boundaries, he urged the fishing communities to settle the boundaries by arriving at an amicable solution through talks. Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao asked the Collector and police to review the law and order situation on a daily basis for the next few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/seediri-urges-warring-groups-to-arrive-at-amicable-solution/article38141760.ece

Deputy Transport Commissioner G.C. Raja Ratnam cautioned youths to not get carried away at the sight of open roads. “Motorists seem to be under the impression that they can drive at a high speed as there are no policemen on the road to stop them. Transport officials park their ‘interceptor’ vans on the shoulder of the roads which have speed guns inside. An official sits in the van, monitoring the speeds of passing vehicles,” Mr. Raja Ratnam said. Two speed guns were used by the department to check for speeding in the district in the past year.

The resident doctors who have not gone home for over six months and who have been at the forefront fighting two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, feel that the quality of treatment would suffer if their tenure is extended any longer. Since the counselling process for PG has been delayed almost by a year, the tenure of the resident doctors has been extended by the same period. ‘One doctor doing the job of three’ “We have been at the forefront during the first and second waves of the pandemic, and now the third wave has also arrived. There is no relief for us, as the first year students are yet to come. Each one of us is doing the job of three doctors,” said Dr. Firoz, a final year PG student of Andhra Medical College. “One doctor is working for over 12 hours and taking care of almost 40 patients,” said Dr. Srilekha, another PG final year student of AMC. AMC admits around 200 students per year into various wings of post-graduate studies. For the three years of the course, there should be over 600 PG students who are resident doctors. But since the admission process has been delayed by over a year, there are only 400 resident doctors on campus. They have been bearing the brunt for the past two years, said AMC principal Dr. P.V. Sudhakar. Similar tale across the country The situation at AMC is not unique to it alone, as all teaching hospitals across the country have a similar story to share. Over 70,000 PG students are suffering the same fate due to the delay in the NEET PG counselling. While on one hand the final and second year students have been overworked for a period of around one year when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak, one batch of students had lost one full academic year due to the delay. Doctors feel that both the Union Government and the Supreme Court should have fast-tracked the decision-making process by giving priority to the health sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/medical-students-worried-over-delay-in-neet-pg-counselling/article38141759.ece

CPI(M) leaders and representatives of the Visakhapatnam Apartment Resident Welfare Association (VARWA) condemned the MLA’s alleged remarks on Wednesday. Ward 78 corporator and CPI(M) leader B.

Sahithi breathed her last while undergoing treatment at the District Headquarters Hospital in Kothagudem in the early hours of Wednesday. The incident triggered a furore as the deceased Ramakrishna, a 38-year-old former operator of MeeSeva Centre, blamed local TRS leader Vanama Raghavendra Rao (son of Kothagudem MLA Vanama Venkateshwara Rao) for his ‘extreme step’ in his note. The note also mentioned the names of Ramakrishna’s mother and his elder sister. He reportedly recorded a selfie-video on his mobile before taking his life. Police booked Raghavendra Rao and three others under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC, based on a complaint filed by a close relative of the deceased. Speaking to mediapersons in Paloncha, Assistant SP Rohith Raj said special teams have been formed to trace the accused. “We have seized Ramakrishna’s mobile in which he recorded a selfie-video narrating his financial problems,” the ASP said, adding that it was submitted to the court.

The last time over 1,500 cases were recorded was on June 15, 2021. The spike in cases has been rather sharp over the past five days. While 317 new infections were recorded last Saturday, it was 274 on Sunday, when testing is usually lower and cases fewer. From there, it surged to 482 on Monday and then more than double on Tuesday (1,052 new cases). The number of tests, however, has not increased so much. The three urban districts of the State contributed 84.5% of the new cases on Wednesday — 979 in Greater Hyderabad limits, 174 in Rangareddy and 132 in Medchal-Malkajgiri. While 42,531 samples were examined, results of 7,039 were awaited. The new cases did not cross 30 in any of the remaining districts and no infection was recorded in Adilabad or Jayashankar Bhupalapally, according to the media bulletin issued by the Director of Public Health’s office.

Doctors at government and corporate hospitals are keeping track of COVID admissions in all wards as well as out-patient consultations. Currently, the number of COVID admissions at most corporate hospitals in Hyderabad is low, the highest being around 20. However, all of them are cautious. The number of ICU, oxygen, and general beds occupied by COVID patients is an indicator to measure severity of the virus spread. Oxygen consumption is also tracked. The occupancy of ICU beds and oxygen beds across all government and private hospitals in the State has been in the same range for the past one and half months — 400 and 500, respectively. On Wednesday too, 425 ICU beds and 509 oxygen beds were filled, which indicates the occupancy rate is unchanged. Before the surge, people were worried about how Omicron would impact them. Doctors at the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) had said that though the current set of people with Omicron are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, the variant’s behaviour in people with severe conditions such as chronic kidney disease, cancer, etc. is yet to be observed. Explaining that infection with Omicron causes relatively milder symptoms and very often people brush it off as common cold, President of Apollo Group of Hospitals K. Hari Prasad stressed on the importance of getting tested. “If one is actually infected and does not know it is COVID infection due to Omicron, they tend to move around as normal people and infect scores of other people in the community,” said Dr Hari Prasad. Healthcare professionals have emphasised the need to wear masks, avoid unnecessary gatherings, maintain physical distancing, and get vaccinated against COVID as the cases are expected to rise further.  If one is infected and does not know it is due to Omicron, they tend to move around and infect scores of others in the community. K.

Despite the year clouded by the pandemic-influenced adversity, the city’s residential and office asset classes have shown resilience in their performances, the property consultancy said in its latest report. The year was the best since 2011 in terms of annual volume sales. In 2020, the number of new residential units sold in the city was 10,042, while in 2019 it totalled 16,267 units. New home launches increased 179% year-on-year to 35,736 housing units in 2021. The launches stood at 12,826 in 2020 and 13,495 in 2019. Hyderabad was the only market in the country that has not seen a single year of price decline since first half of 2013. The India Real Estate: H2 2021 report said 12,344 housing units were sold in Hyderabad during the second half, an increase of 135% year-on-year. At 48% of overall home sales, the mid segment of Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 1 crore constituted the bulk of home sales during July-December period. The report residential prices increased 5% year-on-year during the second half. West Hyderabad in terms of localities, which includes Gachibowli, Kokapet and Nallagandla, remained the favourite for home buyers accounting for 60% of the total sales during the six months. Office market wise, 2021 was a year of stabilisation for the Hyderabad office market with transaction volumes matching the previous year’s 6 million sq ft. New office completions were reported to be 4.6 million sq ft during the same period, the report said. Residential demand in the city was firmly in the ready-to-move-in properties, a trend that also saw average age of inventory in Hyderabad reduce from 11.5 quarters in H2 2020 to 7.6 quarters in H2 2021, said Samson Arthur, Senior Branch Director – Hyderabad at Knight Frank India. “Recent trends suggest an increase in demand for under-construction properties of established developers as well. While worries on overbuilding and consequent overburdening [of] the infrastructure exist due to the relaxation in FSI restrictions, sentiments in the residential market remain buoyant for the near to medium term,” he said in a release. The residential and office markets in Mumbai, the National Capital Region, Bengaluru, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad were others considered as part of the Knight Frank report. Mumbai stood first in terms of number of residential units sales during 2021 at 62,989 units, an increase of 29% compared to the previous year.

Chandrasekhar Rao rather than keep on claiming his government to be the most corrupt in the country. At a press conference here on Wednesday, TPCC working president Mahesh Kumar Goud, senior vice president Mallu Ravi and spokesperson Addanki Dayakar, asked as to what prevented the BJP from seeking an inquiry into ‘KCR’s corruption charges’ while repeatedly saying that he was corrupt to the core. “It doesn’t have the courage to arrest him as both have colluded to help each other and cover failures,” they alleged. Mr. Goud said that both the parties were acting according to a plan to show that the Congress was weak and creating a fake fight just to grab the media attention. “BJP rakes up the corruption issue of TRS whenever they prepare for elections and conveniently forgets it later. People are watching this drama,” he said. He alleged that State BJP president Bandi Sanjay’s arrest itself was hyped by the TRS government deliberately to lift the sagging image of the BJP after its failure to procure paddy in Telangana. He claimed that TRS and BJP have cheated farmers by creating a political ruckus to dilute the paddy crisis, and now resorted to similar tactics to divert the attention from issues raised by the Congress. Mr. Dayakar reminded that it was BJP that gave permission for Kaleshwaram project despite objections and ‘corruption’ involved. “If Kaleshwaram project was the ATM for KCR, how much did the BJP encash from it,” he asked. “Even after 7 years of rule, the BJP has not filed a single complaint against KCR despite being aware of the corruption in the project.” Mr. Mallu Ravi said that people were fed up with BJP’s claims on exposing KCR and taking action against him but doing nothing. “People have understood how these two parties are working together in covering up KCR’s corruption.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-doesnt-have-courage-to-arrest-kcr-says-congress/article38141615.ece

Some farmers who have been able to enter into an arrangement for procurement of the crop, some friends and relatives, are going ahead with cultivation of paddy despite the government announcing that it would not open procurement centres for paddy in the ensuing rabi season. Such farmers are taking up cultivation only when they have a proper agreement with the buyers on quantity. In case they do not get any assurance they are preferring to leave the land unplowed. Then there are many farmers who claim that their lands cannot be used for any other crops. Most farmers in Sangareddy district are small and marginal farmers who take land on lease and cultivate it in addition to their small holdings. The standard practice has been to take the land on year-long lease and not season to season and the lease ranges between Rs. 8,000 per acre to Rs. 16,000 per acre depending upon the location and availability of irrigation. Many farmers prefer to leave land fallow during a season rather than cancel the lease, as they are afraid that once they cancel lease they may not be able to get the same stretch of land on lease the next year. In view of the ongoing uncertainty some farmers are requesting land owners to come to their rescue by returning part of the lease amount, which they had already paid, as they would not be cultivating the land. “I had taken 25 acres for lease and cultivated paddy on 13 acres as first crop and remaining as rain-fed crops. As the government made it clear that it would not purchase paddy, all the land has now been left fallow,” said Sanjeeva Reddy, a farmer from Nizampur in Sadashivapet mandal.  “As the government made it clear it would not buy paddy, we have to either stop cultivating that or look at assured buyers. We cannot cultivate other crops due to various reasons, including not having an assured market for alternative crops. The only choice is not to cultivate,” Pruthvi Raj, a farmer from Sadashivapet in Sangareddy district told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ryots-prefer-crop-holiday-fields-left-fallow/article38141609.ece

Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday described adherence to COVID-19 protocols at all times as ‘dharma’, and urged putting into practice lessons from past experiences in dealing with the pandemic. In a pre-recorded video message, the Vice-President addressed the 15th Global Health Summit organised by American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI), in which he highlighted the contribution of India, Indian medical professionals, and said that physicians of Indian origin have gained a formidable reputation in their respective fields.  “We must consider it our dharma to follow COVID protocol at all times and secure ourselves and our community. We should also encourage those who are unvaccinated in our family to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest,” he said, and added that in the past two years, the pandemic had challenged healthcare systems across the country.  ‘Apply past lessons’ Mr Naidu underscored that the number of COVID cases in the states was surging and that it is imperative to “apply the lessons of the past waves of the pandemic with a sense of urgency”. He expressed happiness over Indian companies having collaborated with organisations from the United States of America to produce the Corbevax and Covovax vaccines. “This experience clearly shows India-US collaboration in healthcare can reap great benefits not only for these countries, but for the entire world,” he said. Describing India as a ‘pharmacy to the world with path breaking innovations in the pharmaceuticals industry’, Mr Naidu said that Indian contribution to global healthcare is not a new phenomenon. The country has become a medical tourism destination of the world. “Data reveals that nearly 7 lakh foreign tourists came for medical treatment in India in the year 2019 alone,” he said. Expressing deep appreciation for Indian-origin physicians, he said, “These Indian-origin physicians are a personification of our nation’s cherished civilisational value of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. They are among the most successful ambassadors of India’s value systems and propagators of our mission to ‘share and sare’ for all the people of the world, irrespective of their nationalities. We are indeed proud of them and their services.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/adherence-to-safety-protocols-at-all-times-is-dharma-venkaiah/article38141600.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao on moral grounds and asked him to take responsibility for levelling false charges against its president Bandi Sanjay Kumar, who was given bail by the High Court on Wednesday. “It is a matter of shame that the State chief of a national party in power in the Centre and several States was arrested from his office, as if he was a criminal, by the police who have become totally partisan. KCR is solely responsible for the incident. He has become the eighth Nizam and is totally intolerant,” said senior leader and national OBC president K. Laxman. At a press conference on Wednesday, he accused the CM of trying to muzzle all kinds of opposition, the media and the civil society, by misusing the official machinery and police. “The TRS has come to power due to protests by employees and students during the Separate State agitation but they are being targetted now,” he said. Once again, he charged the ruling party with throwing official COVID restrictions to the wind during their public rallies and functions, including New Year festivities, by allowing bars and wine shops to be open for more number of hours. National general secretary Tarun Chugh said that the party always had faith in the judiciary and hailed the bail given to Mr. Sanjay Kumar. “Police should understand that the country is run by the Constitution and the rule of law is supreme. We are not under any colonial rule that the TRS and Mr. Rao think they can do whatever they wish. We will continue to support the cause of the employees, unemployed youth and teachers against this brutal tyrannical rule,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-should-quit-t-bjp/article38141612.ece

Rama Rao has stressed the need for collective effort of different departments to ensure that Telangana stands at the top across the country in Ease Of Doing Business (EODB) parameters. The Minister said the State had been on top in implementing reforms and other parameters necessitated under the EPDB norms due to consistent efforts of the departments under the guidance of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. The departments should continue the trend so that the State tops in rankings from the next time. Mr. Rama Rao participated in a high level meeting of secretaries and heads of departments led by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar. Industries department officials informed the Minister that the State had completed 100% implementation of over 300 reforms and other norms prescribed under EODB. They discussed user feedback, a key component of EODB rankings, conducted by the Central government to take feedback from the industries that were availing services from different departments. Mr. Rama Rao said the business-friendly policies and proactive approach by the official machinery had resulted in attracting huge investments into the State and creation of employment opportunities. This had in turn helped the State secure top rank in the EODB rankings and the officials concerned should work together to continue the trend. He said the parameters adopted for EODB rankings provided opportunity to various departments, not just the Industries department, to strengthen their delivery mechanisms and the departments concerned should utilise the opportunity for achieving accelerated development of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-calls-for-collective-effort-to-top-eodb-list/article38141595.ece

He was received by a host of senior BJP leaders and cadres in front of the jail soon after he walked out. Union Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers Bhagwanth Khuba, among others, were present.

Delhi police sources, however, said they want to go after the big fish: the creators of the application.  “The two youths arrested (by Mumbai Police) in the ‘Bulli Bai’ case are propagators and not creators. Their role was to make the application trend on social media. They had no role in creating the application,” an officer said, adding that they have the resources to go after the propagators of ‘Sulli Deals’ in Delhi and other States but “that will widen the net to no end”. “We want to go after the source because creation of such applications needs to stop in the first place,” he said.  The sources said they are following the procedure through MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty) so that they can obtain information from California-based GitHub, the hosting platform, about the creators of ‘Sulli Deals’. “The procedure to be followed in the ‘Bulli Bai’ case is being contemplated on,” another investigator said. Among those who were ‘auctioned’ on ‘Bulli Bai’ was Fatima Nafees, the 52-year-old mother of missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed, who Delhi Police and later the Central Bureau of Investigation failed to find. The CBI had in 2018 filed a closure report in the case and declared him untraced. The investigation in the ‘Bulli Bai’ application case has been transferred from the South-East district police to the cyber cell of the Special Cell, the police said on Wednesday. Time-consuming process Explaining the delay in the ‘Sulli Deals’ probe, the police said the MLAT route is time consuming. Once the documents are prepared by the police, the prosecution vets them after which they are sent to the Delhi government’s Home Department which then sends them to the Ministry of Home Affairs for sanction. Then they are sent back to the Delhi government which further gives them to the police who present them before the court for judicial process and then forward them to the CBI. The Central agency then shares them with Interpol which sends them to the Department of Justice for necessary action through its nodal agency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sulli-deals-delhi-police-want-to-catch-the-big-fish/article38141658.ece

For the time being, the situation in Delhi is under control. In city hospitals there are plenty of beds available. For example, GTB Hospital has 650 beds set aside for COVID patients, of which only 20 are occupied. The occupancy rate is 2% to 5%,” he said. The Minister said during the second wave when there were same number of cases in the city, the occupancy rate of beds was 15%. The surge in COVID-19 cases continued on Wednesday with 10,665 new cases being reported over 24 hours — a 94.5% jump in a day — according to a Delhi government health bulletin. This is the highest new cases in more than seven months. Also, eight COVID-19-related deaths were reported in the city, which is the highest in months. At least four of the eight victims had other ailments, said officials. “Hospitals are getting some cases where patients are arriving only after their SpO2 levels drop very low and they have acute respiratory distress. People should keep monitoring themselves and not take their condition lightly thinking it is Omicron variant,” a health department official said. The number of active cases has gone up to 23,307 from 14,889 cases a day earlier. Though the number of people occupying hospital beds has increased to 782, 92.5% of 10,474 hospital beds for COVID-19 were vacant as of Wednesday, stated the bulletin. Mr. Jain said for the time being there will be no lockdown in the city. ‘No need to panic’ “During this wave, the Delhi government’s goal is that not a single life should be lost due to lack of oxygen or other basic resources. There will be no lockdown in Delhi for the time being and construction work will continue as usual. There is no need for workers to panic... Delhi has taken the most stringent steps in the country to stop corona, such as weekend curfew, shutting down colleges and schools,” the Minister said. The Delhi government has ordered to add 1,034 more COVID-19 beds in nine government hospitals and linked centres, according to an official order. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), meanwhile, has cancelled all leaves granted to government employees in a bid to ensure adequate manpower to deal with the upsurge in COVID cases in the city. Only medical leaves will be allowed, if required, according to the DDMA order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/third-wave-has-hit-us-but-situation-under-control-says-jain/article38141667.ece

The department covered more than 40 locations, including those linked to the other group which is into the real estate business. In case of the first group, which is primarily based in Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh, the department said there was tax evasion through under-reporting of perfume sales, stock manipulation, fudging of the books of account for shifting profits from “taxable” to the “tax exempt” heads, inflation of expenditure, etc. “The group makes 35% to 40% of its retail sales in cash by ‘kucha’ bills and these cash receipts are not recorded in the regular books of account, running into crores of rupees. Evidence of booking purchases from bogus parties to the extent of about Rs. 5 crore has also been unearthed,” the department said. The unaccounted income was invested in various real estate projects in Mumbai. Properties were also acquired in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it said. “It has also been detected that the group has evaded tax of Rs. 10 crore on conversion of the stock-in-trade to capital as corresponding income has not been declared. The group has not declared income amounting to Rs. 45 crore on the benefits paid to retiring partners.... the group has incorporated some offshore entities. However, such offshore entities have not been reported in their respective Income Tax returns,” said the department. It is alleged that the offshore entities are run and managed by Indian promoters. Two of them own one villa each in the UAE. “One of the offshore entities of the group from the UAE has purportedly introduced illicit share capital of over Rs. 16 crore in an Indian entity of the group, at exorbitant premium. This recipient group entity has also obtained further sum of Rs. 19 crore in the form of illicit share capital from certain Kolkata-based shell entities,” the I-T department said. One shareholder director of the shell entities admitted that he was a “dummy” director and had invested in the share capital of the group company at the instance of the group promoters, as alleged. According to the department, it found unrecorded cash transactions of about Rs. 10 crore in the case of the second group, based in Uttar Pradesh. The group was not maintaining any stock register for its inventory. During the searches, I-T sleuths seized jewellery worth over Rs. 2 crore. Several bank lockers have been placed under restraint.

Beds for isolation He said that CCCs, as per the guidelines, do not have oxygen beds and they just facilitate isolation of people who have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. The government had taken a similar step during the second wave of the pandemic. The government is currently focusing on making sure that there are enough beds for any emergency situation, an official source said. “There are predictions by different experts about the number of daily cases Delhi could see, ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 new cases per 10 lakh population. It is difficult to say which prediction is accurate,” the source said. This translates to up to 1 lakh new COVID-19 cases a day considering Delhi’s population.  On Wednesday, The Hindu had reported that IIT Kanpur has informed the Delhi government that the current wave of the pandemic would peak around January 20 in the city with 50,000 daily new cases if no restrictions are imposed.  Till now, the highest number of daily cases reported in Delhi is 28,325, recorded on April 20, 2021, during the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/govt-to-ask-dms-to-identify-buildings-for-covid-facilities/article38141669.ece

JCP (Traffic) Vivek Kishore said they started receiving complaints against buses violating traffic rules and it was observed that a number of drivers of DTC and cluster buses did not ply their vehicles in the designated lanes and also drove dangerously. “Such erring buses also indulge in a number of road accidents,” Mr. Kishore said. Teams formed On receiving the complaints, several teams were formed in the three traffic ranges — Western, Eastern and Central — and a special drive was undertaken on January 4 to prosecute the violating buses. In the Central Range, 14 buses were challaned for dangerous driving and 14 for permit violation. “In the Northern Range, 14 vehicles were challenged for dangerous driving, 2 for Supreme Court guidelines violation, 2 for permit violation and 15 for lane violation,” Mr. Kishore said. Similarly in the Western Range, 13 vehicles were challaned for dangerous driving, 11 for Supreme Court guidelines violation, 6 for permit violation and 3 for lane violation. “In total, 94 buses were prosecuted in the above three ranges during the special drive against errant buses,” the JCP said. The Supreme Court guidelines violation includes offences such as speeding, crossing the yellow line, among others, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/94-buses-fined-for-traffic-rule-violations/article38141671.ece

Russian hackers were also used by the syndicate to get access to various examination portals, said the police. DCP (Cyber Unit) K.P.S. Malhotra said the accused have been identified as Arshad Dhunna, 39, Salman Dhunna, 28, and Hemal Shah, 42, all residents of Mumbai, Kunal Goel, 39, a resident of Delhi, Mohit Sharma, 35, and Raj Teotia, 33, both residents of Karnal in Haryana. The police received a tip-off that a few syndicates were involved in unauthorised access to various competitive exams like GMAT, JEE, among others, and were charging a hefty amount for getting the candidates the desired score. During investigation, the accused were contacted and a deal for cracking GMAT exam was struck with them, the police said. The exam was registered in the name of a decoy police officer, fees was submitted and the slot for the exam was booked, the police said, adding that a token money for the deal was also deposited in the bank account asked by the accused. On December 26, the day of the exam, the accused asked the decoy candidate to download a software “Ultraviewer” to gain remote access of the candidate’s laptop. They also connected the candidate’s laptop to the solver who attempted the exam and evaded detection from the proctor and other safety measures, the police said. Mumbai-based syndicate The hacker got the access to the laptop and disguised the remote access file as a system file. The decoy candidate scored 780 out of 800, which is 97% of the total, a good enough score to get admission in top MBA colleges in the world, the police said. During technical analysis, it was found that members of the syndicate were based in Mumbai after which raids were conducted. Teotia revealed during the interrogation that he was involved in online exam hacking and solving for the last five years and had been in touch with Russian hackers too. He had also visited Russia in 2018. The accused have admitted to helping 18 candidates clear GMAT and around 500 candidates in other exams in three years, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/syndicate-involved-in-hacking-online-tests-busted/article38141661.ece

She alleged that her father had again attempted to harass and molest her while out on parole. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Manika directed the SHO of Mehrauli police station to file a report, and listed the case for hearing on February 23. The woman in her plea, filed through advocate Amit Sahni, alleged that her father had molested her first in 2012 when she was 12 years old, following which an FIR was registered but she deposed in his favour “under pressure from family members”. However, in 2017, she was molested and raped again by him after which another FIR was lodged and a court convicted him and awarded him the life sentence. He challenged his conviction in the Delhi High Court which upheld it. Tried to strangulate wife After coming out on parole on September 27 last year, he again tried to molest his daughter and even attempted to strangulate his wife with a rope when she stopped him. “The complainant feels ashamed to tell anyone about the incidents she has faced. The accused is worse than an animal in the body of a human,” the plea said. The woman, who works as a housekeeper, also said that after the incident, when she tried to lodge a complaint, the police refused to cooperate. She said she also wrote to the district DCP and the National Commission for Women but received no response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/woman-accuses-father-of-trying-to-molest-her-again/article38141662.ece

It also directed that a strict vigil be kept on the international border with Myanmar to ensure no unlawful transit or infiltration. With the State Assembly’s term due to expire on March 19, elections are scheduled for the 60 Assembly constituencies. During the virtual review meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra, political party representatives raised “concerns about use of money power, illicit liquor, narcotics drugs and intimidation to influence voters [and] requested a strict vigil on election expenses by candidates,” said an ECI statement issued after the meeting. Expressing fears of pre-poll violence, they demanded deployment of adequate security forces, and also urged that strict COVID-19 protocols be implemented. The Commission reiterated that “it has zero-tolerance for misuse of money or muscle power or partisan behaviour of State machinery vitiating free and fair elections,” the statement said, with Mr. Chandra promising strict action against erring officials, and the deployment of Expenditure Observers to ensure inducement-free elections. He also explained that the ECI’s cVIGIL App mechanism would be available to register complaints of code of conduct violations, apart from the toll free number 1950. While reviewing law and order issues, the Commission directed that depositing of licensed arms in the State be expedited. The CEC also “directed for strict vigil on the international border to ensure no unlawful transit and infiltration across borders,” said the statement. The State shares a border with Myanmar. Mr. Chandra raised concerns regarding the low vaccination rate in the State and emphasised the need for 100% vaccination of all polling staff. In order to avoid crowding at polling booths, the maximum number of electors per station has been reduced from 1,500 to 1,250. A postal ballot facility will be provided for the first time in the State, for absentee voters, including almost 42,000 people above the age of 80 years, more than 14,000 persons with disabilities, as well as those infected with or suspected to have COVID-19. According to the electoral roll published on Wednesday, the State has 20.35 lakh electors, including 38,384 first time electors who now make up 2.6% of the total, in comparison with just 0.56% during the last polls in 2017. The parties that participated via videoconferencing included the TMC, BJP, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Indian National Congress, Nationalist Congress Party, Naga People’s Front (NPF), National People's Party, and Peoples Democratic Alliance.

Everyone in Zhengzhou, which has been placed under a partial lockdown, must be tested to “thoroughly uncover infections hidden among the public”, the city’s government said in a statement on Wednesday. The city has detected 11 cases in recent days. The mass-testing order came as case numbers in the locked-down city of Xi’an fell to their lowest in weeks, with officials saying that outbreak had been “brought under control”. Xi’an’s 13 million residents have been under stay-at-home orders for the last fortnight. “Although the case number has been high for many days, the rapid rise in COVID spread at community level has been brought under control compared with the early stages of the outbreak,” said Ma Guanghui, deputy director of Shaanxi province’s health commission, at a press conference. “The epidemic is showing a downward trend.” Rigid approach China has stuck to a rigid approach of stamping out COVID cases when they appear, with tight border restrictions and targeted lockdowns since the virus first emerged in the country in 2019. But, with less than a month to go until the Winter Olympics in the capital, a series of small outbreaks across the country has put the strategy under pressure. Although the number of reported cases in China is very low compared with other nations, infections in recent weeks have reached a high not seen in the country since March 2020. China recorded 91 cases Wednesday — including 35 in Xi’an, the city’s lowest tally since mid-December. The Zhengzhou outbreak is tiny by comparison, but officials are taking no chances. State media said about 500 close contacts had been traced from the outbreak’s two symptomatic cases, linked through mahjong rooms and family gatherings. Eight residential communities were locked down.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-to-test-13-mn-people-in-zhengzhou-xian-cases-drop/article38141040.ece

Myanmar has been in chaos since a coup last year, with more than 1,400 people killed in a crackdown on dissent by security forces. Mr. Hun Sen, whose country this year holds the rotating chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc, will visit Myanmar on Friday and Saturday in an effort to defuse the crisis. But Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn warned the outlook was dire. “The political and security crisis in Myanmar is deepening, and has led to (an) economic, health and humanitarian crisis,” he said. “We feel that all the ingredients for civil war are now on the table. “There are now two governments, there are several armed forces, people are undergoing what they call the civil disobedience movement and (there is) guerrilla warfare around the country.” He was speaking at a lecture on Monday organised by Singapore-based think-tank the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. Mr. Hun Sen, one of the world’s longest-ruling strongmen, on Wednesday called for a ceasefire, saying “all relevant parties must stop violence”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-has-ingredients-for-civil-war/article38141045.ece

Sparked by a New Year energy price increase, protests swept across Kazakhstan in a rare challenge to the ex-Soviet country’s authoritarian government. After a night of unrest that saw more than 200 people detained, several thousand protesters stormed the headquarters of the Almaty city administration on Wednesday afternoon and appeared to have seized control of the building. Police fired stun grenades and tear gas at the crowd, some armed with batons and shields seized from police, but were unable to prevent them from entering the building. Local media reported that parts of the building were on fire and that protesters were targeting other government facilities. The protests are the biggest threat so far to the regime established by Kazakhstan’s founding president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stepped down in 2019 and ushered loyalist Kassym-Jomart Tokayev into the presidency. The demonstrations began over a New Year increase in prices for Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), which is widely used to fuel cars in the west of the country. The interior ministry said 95 police officers were injured, adding “groups of citizens blocked roads and blocked traffic, disrupting public order”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/group-of-protestors-storm-mayors-office-in-kazakhstan/article38141043.ece

Korea fires ballistic missile in first test in two months||North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the sea on Wednesday, the U.S. military said, its first weapons launch in about two months and a signal it isn’t interested in rejoining denuclearisation talks anytime soon and would rather focus on boosting its weapons arsenal. The launch came after North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un vowed to further strengthen his military capability — without disclosing any new policies toward the United States or South Korea — at a high-profile ruling party conference last week. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the ballistic missile launch “highlights the destabilising impact of (North Korea’s) illicit weapons program” but didn’t pose an immediate threat to U.S. territory or its allies. It said in a statement that the U.S. commitment to the defense of its allies, South Korea and Japan, remains “ironclad.” Reaction of South South Korea’s military said a suspected ballistic missile fired from North Korea’s mountainous northern Jagang province flew toward its eastern waters. Defense Minister Suh Wook said the launch is seen as part of North Korea’s military build-up, but that South Korea is analysing whether it had any political intention. In an emergency video conference, members of South Korea’s presidential national security team expressed concerns about the launch. The Japanese Defense Ministry also detected the North Korean launch. “We find it truly regrettable that North Korea has continued to fire missiles since last year,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said. China, North Korea’s most important ally, maintained an even-handed response to the launch, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin calling for dialogue and saying “all parties concerned should keep in mind the big picture (and) be cautious with their words and actions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/n-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-in-first-test-in-two-months/article38141049.ece

While most of Hong Kong’s 114 reported Omicron cases have been imported, the Special Administrative Region (SAR) is currently battling its first local spread in many months. Health authorities said on Wednesday, explaining the new restrictions, including a ban on dining in restaurants after 6 p.m. and the closure of gyms and bars, that they feared community transmission as they have not been able to entirely determine the routes of spread of the cases. Source of outbreak The source of the local outbreak was identified as two crew members of the airline Cathay Pacific, whom the authorities said had violated isolation protocols. As part of the measures, travellers and flights from eight countries have been barred for two weeks. The countries are India, U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, France, Pakistan and the Philippines. The new more transmissible variants have challenged the “zero COVID” policy in place in both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, which has been dealing with a recent spread of cases in several cities, most notably in Xian. The strategy is predicated on continued restrictions on international travel, including mandatory quarantine for all arrivals, mass testing as well as quarantining of close contacts to ensure clusters are controlled and cases are brought to zero.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-bars-flights-from-india-seven-other-countries/article38141050.ece

The development came one day after the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria said they had foiled a rocket attack on a U.S. base called “Green Village” in the eastern Deir Ezzor region. Wednesday’s attack, also in Deir Ezzor, saw at least three shells land in Al-Omar, according to the Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria. One fell on a helicopter landing pad, while the two others hit an open area, the Observatory said. The war monitor blamed the attack on pro-Iran militia groups that are active in the Deir Ezzor region which borders Iraq. It said coalition forces retaliated by striking the source of the artillery fire outside the eastern town of Al-Mayadeen which is a hub for Tehran and its Syria proxies. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The attacks targeting U.S. installations came as Tehran and its allies across the Middle East held emotional commemorations marking the second anniversary on Monday of the assassination of Iranian commander General Qassem Soleimani and his Iraqi lieutenant in a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad airport. On Tuesday, U.S.-led coalition forces shot down two armed drones targeting an air base in western Iraq, according to a coalition official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/rockets-fired-at-us-base-in-eastern-syria/article38141046.ece

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 00:00 IST,||The Chinese challenge uncovers India’s fragilities||Like Banquo’s ghost, the 1962 Sino-India war hangs like a shadow over the current state of bilateral ties between India and China. A military defeat close to six decades ago has no real bearing on the current border tensions, but is a constant reminder to Delhi, like Banquo’s ghost is to Macbeth, of its own fears and insecurities. An outcome of India’s choices since 2014, these weaknesses have been shown up by the prospect of a conflict with China, which may no longer be immediate but it does not feel as far-fetched and remote as it did just two years ago. China’s diplomatic moves Nearly 20 months after the border crisis began in Ladakh, China has pressed on with aggressive diplomatic and military gestures against India. Beijing recently renamed 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh, following the six it had done in 2017, weeks after the Dalai Lama visited Tawang. China justifies the renaming as being done on the basis of its historical, cultural and administrative jurisdiction over the area — these old names existed since ancient times which had been changed by India with its “illegal occupation”. The External Affairs Ministry said that the move by Beijing ‘does not alter’ the fact that Arunachal Pradesh — itself a Sanskritised rechristening of the North-East Frontier Agency in 1971 on being made a Union Territory – was an integral part of India. Possession is indeed nine-tenths of the law but China’s renaming drive is one prong of its plan to assert its territorial claims in disputed border areas. On January 1, 2022, Beijing’s new land border law came into force, which provides the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with full responsibility to take steps against “invasion, encroachment, infiltration, provocation” and safeguard Chinese territory. This law supports — and mutually reinforces — the construction of 628 Xiaokang border villages by China along its disputed border with India. As per available satellite imagery, at least two of these villages have been constructed on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh. These villages will come in handy for Beijing when the principle of ‘settled areas’ is invoked to resolve the border dispute in the future. It is not just Beijing but even the diplomats posted at the Chinese Embassy in Delhi who have been emboldened by India’s cautious response. Last month, Political Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy, Zhou Yongsheng wrote an angry letter to Indian Members of Parliament — including two Union Ministers, Rajeev Chandrasekhar and Ramdas Athawale — for attending a meet organised by the Tibetan government-in-exile. The letter asked them to not engage with “out-and-out separatist political group and an illegal organization”. This angry missive from an Embassy official to two Ministers has earned no reproach from the Government for the Chinese Ambassador. It did not even beget an official condemnation from the External Affairs Ministry. Submissive response The reasons for such submissiveness by the Narendra Modi government towards the Chinese are not difficult to understand. Delhi has run out of proactive options against Beijing that will force the Chinese leadership to change course on its India policy. Tibet and the Dalai Lama were often projected as a trump card but evidently are not. Beijing does not care for its declining popularity among the Indian populace. The two countries have an increasingly lopsided trade relationship driven by Indian dependency on Chinese manufacturing, a situation further worsened by the Government’s mishandling of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Delhi has little geopolitical or economic leverage over Beijing to boast of. There are no arrows left in Mr. Modi’s quiver. The best Delhi can do is to prevent any further loss of territory to China with extensive military deployment on the LAC, while hoping that Beijing, either with Moscow’s urging or otherwise, will give Mr. Modi an honourable diplomatic exit out of this crisis. If India was to give it back to the Chinese as good as it gets, Beijing may take it as an affront, further smothering Indian desire for a smooth end to the crisis. To restore the status quo ante on the LAC as of April 2020, India undertook internal balancing of its military from the Pakistan border to the China border and external rebalancing through a closer partnership with the United States in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad (Australia, India, Japan and the U.S.) has, however, remained a non-military grouping. The signing of the AUKUS (a trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the U.S.) and the humiliating American exit from Afghanistan made it crystal clear that for all the intelligence sharing and logistics support from the U.S., India will have to deal with the Chinese challenge on the border on its own. In decline since 2017, India’s economy is incapable of supporting such an endeavour. The Modi government has now placed its hopes on Moscow, which seems keen to play a mediator between India and China. Russian officials say that their offer of a Foreign Ministers meeting, if not a leaders’ summit, of the Russia-India-China grouping is on the table but Delhi first wants to see some steps from China towards resolving the border crisis. Now revealed The Chinese challenge has laid bare globally India’s political, economic and diplomatic fragilities under Mr. Modi, and this has grim portends of how challenges in future will be managed. Worried about its northern borders and the threat of a two-front collusive threat, the Modi government and the ruling party are no longer as vociferous on Pakistan. Even if viciously attacking Pakistan has been an electorally rewarding domestic agenda for Mr. Modi, he has been forced to stay away from even mentioning India’s western neighbour in any of his recent electoral speeches. With ‘development’ and ‘employment’ no longer Mr. Modi’s calling card, that vacuum is being filled by the most horrific attacks by Hindutva bigots on Christians and Muslims under the benign gaze of the Hindu majoritarian government. Because of the China factor, the U.S. is currently looking away even as India mistreats its minorities and its democracy stands diminished. That is unlikely to continue for long if India is to be the democratic counter in Asia to the rise of a one-party authoritarian state like China, one that is now keen to offer its own governance and growth model to the world. India’s difficult diplomatic and military engagement with China is going to leave it more dependent on U.S. support, rendering the Modi government more vulnerable to American pressure on ‘shared values’. A decade ago, many observers had warned that the emergence of an increasingly assertive and confident China under Xi is going to be to India’s detriment. The signs were there when PLA soldiers walked into Chumar even as Mr. Modi hosted Mr. Xi in Ahmedabad in 2014. The Doklam crisis of 2017 only lulled the Government into thinking that the worst was over. It, instead, triggered the border crisis of 2020. With the loss in the 1962 war, India lost its pre-eminent position in Asia; with this display of weakness six decades later, India is in danger of losing its dominant influence even in South Asia. India’s internal situation, from Nagaland to Kashmir, with the minorities under attack, is not going to help either. India made its choices after 2014, and the China border crisis has only shown them up. Onus on the leader With a rising China as its neighbour and a more self-centred U.S. – which is uncomfortable with India’s reliable partner, Russia — as its friend, Delhi continues to face difficult choices. Not made from a position of strength, in future too, these choices will be as much domestic as they will be in the domain of foreign policy. A collegial and deliberative model of decision-making would work best but is unlikely to be followed if the track record of the current dispensation is any indicator. Pushing a domestic narrative through a compromised media is one thing but dealing with the geopolitical realities at a difficult time is a different ball game. Put under the harsh glare, a domestically divided, economically weak and diplomatically boastful India has been found wanting in its ability to deal with future challenges. The immediate challenge, however, remains China. It cannot be wished away and must be tackled. As the Chief Minister of Gujarat, when Mr. Modi was barred from most western capitals after the 2002 riots, he frequently travelled to China. He made a show of learning from China’s remarkable and unique growth story, and applying it to the ‘Gujarat Model’ which he promised to India in 2014. After he became the Prime Minister, Mr. Modi has met Mr. Xi at least 18 times, but has not had even one telephone call since the border crisis began. As a proponent and exemplar of personality-centric diplomacy, which included two informal summits with Mr. Xi, there has been a surprising lack of any personalised move from Mr. Modi so far. Now that his generals, advisers and Ministers have failed to deliver, it is time for Mr. Modi to step up and personally resolve the crisis. He has no excuse left. Allowing things to fester will only ensure that India pays a price far higher than it can afford.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 00:00 IST,||Memories of war and peace||Recently, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. The ruling dispensation conveniently left out mentioning India’s only woman Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, and honouring her contribution. I will not delve into their pettiness. They perhaps have their reasons to ignore historical facts because they have far too little from their own past to write home about. We must never lose sight of the circumstances under which the war, which was among the shortest in the world, was fought. India won freedom for Bangladesh in just 13 days. The war began on December 3 and ended on December 16 when the Eastern Command of the Pakistan military signed the Instrument of Surrender in Dhaka. India was not an economic or a military superpower. A fighter pilot I grew up listening to the stories that my father, Rajesh Pilot, narrated about his own experiences as a fighter pilot in the war. He was posted in the eastern sector at Jorhat, Assam. In October that year, less than two months before the war broke out, he was promoted as Squadron Leader. My father and his colleagues flew a modified de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou for the bombing missions. We didn’t have enough fighter aircraft to do the job, which is why Caribou, a transport aircraft, was pressed into action. I still vividly remember stories of his mission. On December 8, five days into the war, he was leading a mission to bomb 10 crucial locations controlled by the Pakistani military. His call sign was 40 and the radar’s call sign was Good Wife. Somehow the Pakistani side learned about the imminent attack. Few minutes into the sortie, the Air Traffic Control (ATC) told him to begin the descent as opposed to the schedule decided at the pre-flight briefing. As he began the descent, he thought something was amiss. His intuition served him well because down below, the anti-aircraft guns of the Pakistani side were waiting. Inside the cockpit, with his mates tailing him in a formation, he pulled the stick with all the strength. The aircraft shot up. Just then, another message came, “40, this the original Good Wife, please maintain your height as was discussed during the briefing.” The Indian ATC deliberately did not disclose the height. On their way back to the airfield, another message crackled, this time with a distinct Punjabi twang. “40, where are you off to?” And he replied, “Don’t you worry, I’ll be back again tomorrow.” Meaning of nationalism The bonhomie, love and respect that I saw between my father and his colleagues in the Indian Air Force was unmissable. They would sit together to chat about the 1971 experiences, and ribbing and calling out each other for the slightest exaggeration in their respective roles. My father was a second-generation military man. His father was a havildar in the Indian Army and his dream was to see his son become a commissioned officer, something that he could never achieve. Though I joined politics very early on, I too craved to follow my father and grandfather. I wanted to feel the same pride, and the exhilaration of wearing that uniform. That was why I joined the Indian Territorial Army (Unit-124 Sikh) in 2012. Nationalism is not and cannot be imposed on you; it is something that you grow and live with. It is as organic as a child learning to walk. The chest-beating variety of nationalists may want you to believe otherwise. They forget that Indira Gandhi was an Indian Prime Minister, not a Congress Prime Minister. It is unfortunate that attempts are made to try and diminish her role. The past simply cannot be erased. The military leadership in 1971 was guided by political will from Delhi. It was an unparalleled symphony between the military and political leadership. Some say that the Congress does not do enough drum beating; that we fail to own our own heroes. I would say nationalism is not and should not be reduced to a competition. Above the political divide The 1971 war was not a Congress victory, it was India’s victory. It is a disservice to the country and to all the men who lost their lives in 1971 when the government of the day indulges in a shallow tug-of-war for credit. The country’s sovereignty and integrity are not up for debate; they should remain over and above the political divide. To this day, the Indian armed forces remains the most well-preserved institution because successive governments have not interfered with its working. And we must do all that we can to maintain this tradition. The Bharatiya Janata Party government was swift to take ownership of India’s air strike at Balakot in 2019, but did it accept or apologise for the intelligence failure that led to the Pulwama terror attack that year? In 1996, when Deve Gowda was in the Prime Minister’s chair, the government, knowing fully well my father’s connection to the Northeast where he had served for 15 years, roped him in to speak to the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) faction. He flew out of the country to carry out the behind-the-scenes talks. After that, Mr. Gowda met the NSCN-IM leaders on February 3, 1997, in Zurich, Switzerland. In August 1997, the NSCN-IM entered into a ceasefire agreement with the Centre, starting what became one of the longest-running peace talks in India. That is Indian politics. In winter 2001, the Naga leaders returned to India. My father was not around to see his effort bear fruit; he had passed away in a road accident in June 2000. They came to our home, paid their respects to him and candidly said that they returned to India largely because of the initiative taken under the previous government. It was a remarkable moment and left an indelible impression on me.  The current government suffers from incurable amnesia. It forgets the united front that the political leadership put up in face of the worst attack on Indian democracy when terrorists stormed Parliament just over 20 years ago, on December 13, 2001. Congress president Sonia Gandhi was the Leader of the Opposition. She told Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, “Mr. Prime Minister, this is an assault on Indian democracy. You take whatever action you deem fit. We will support you.” Ideological barriers do not come in the way of national security. Political manoeuvring in the name of national security can be detrimental for our country. Policies and priorities for national security can’t be compromised because of political advantages or disadvantages. In the short run, you may make a few gains. The jingoism may seem to provide some political dividends, but in the long run, it will harm the very edifice on which our country and its proud history was built.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:44 IST,||These islands of excellence must not be marooned||Recently, the Chief Justice of India (CJI), N.V. Ramana, made several comments concerning legal education through his addresses in various universities. He observed that the national law universities were being perceived as ‘elitist and detached from social realities’ because not enough students were joining the bar. He added that even among those who joined the bar, the trend was to practise at the levels of the Supreme Court of India and High Courts while ignoring trial advocacy. Earlier in the year, the CJI had made the comment that law graduates were ill-equipped to handle the profession and that sub-standard legal educational institutions in the country were a worrying trend. Additionally, the CJI made a remark recently that the focus on legal education should be on the practice and not theory. The CJI’s words are a welcome cause for introspection. As institutions capable of fundamentally altering the legal landscape of the country in the decades to come, such comments must not be brushed aside casually. So far, the experiment of national law universities has thrown up mixed results. While they have been celebrated as ‘islands of excellence in a ‘sea of mediocrity, as perceptible from the CJI’s remarks, they are also deemed by many to be detached from society. But this is just one of the many contradictions that national law universities face today. The first contradiction is that even though national law universities are criticised for imparting pedagogy focused on securing placements in corporates and corporate firms, it is these placements that are taken to be a significant marker in judging the success of national law universities. Another contradiction is that even though they are referred to as ‘National’ Law Universities, they are established and partially funded by State governments. National law universities, therefore, have to operate in an increasingly fluid political environment. With state funding shrinking, most national law universities are facing a serious crisis. The ‘national’ character of these universities stems from their cosmopolitan demographic profile of students and faculty. Of late, this ‘national’ profile of the national law universities has had to increasingly navigate the pressures in many States which, by virtue of being the primary patron of a national law university, are able to exert influence on several key issues such as domicile-based reservations and pay scale choices. Research-driven academics The perceived disconnect between social realities and legal education can only be bridged if the research emerging from national law universities addresses social issues and provides workable and practicable solutions. Therefore, there is a need to focus on the promotion of research-driven academics. This requires us to move beyond the rigid framework created by the Bar Council of India and the University Grants Commission, which for example, needs the faculty to undertake a minimum number of lecture hours per week, etc. There is a need to have separate faculties for teaching and research. Research-driven academics must also be promoted through institutional arrangements and schemes incentivising the same. National law universities can no longer survive as mere teaching institutions. Internal issues  The national law universities face stiff competition from upcoming private universities vis-à-vis quality faculties with exposure to best practices and these universities lose out on such faculty owing to many factors including rigid pay scales. While the hiring of faculty holding foreign degrees is not the only solution, the training of the existing faculty in traditional methods of knowledge delivery cannot be expected to satisfy the purpose for which the national law universities were created. The same results in a demand from students for better faculty, pedagogies and curricula. While the delivery of these demands differs from national law university to national law university, these issues have been at the centre of student protests in several universities.  Another reason for student protests in national law universities has been the inability of the leadership to respond to the needs of the students, faculty and staff in an adequate manner. Day-to-day problems when left unaddressed lead to avoidable confrontations. Decisions resolving the issues must be taken firmly and in a timely manner without undue delays. This problem is going to multiply as the State withdraws its funding and national law universities are left to generate their own resources. The same will require a display of ingenuity and entrepreneurship in raising adequate finances in the face of ever-increasing expenditures. It is equally important that the pedagogy must be focused on practical aspects of law, rather than just the theory. The courses must invigorate our classrooms with the experience of practitioners and arm our students with the practical understanding of the functioning of laws and the justice system. Our judges and advocates must be obligated to contribute to the classrooms. They must be encouraged to offer paid internships to students to incentivise their learning experiences. Finally, it must also be understood that the purpose of education at the graduate and postgraduate levels is fundamentally different. The focus of education at a graduate level must be practice-oriented with a focus on imparting students with the ability to learn and understand. On the other hand, the focus of pedagogy at the post-graduate level should be academic with a stress on imparting students with the ability to not only critically evaluate but also to apply the knowledge. This is crucial if we are to create well rounded and quality faculty which can contribute to the academic discourse meaningfully. For the long term Going by the National Education Policy, the shape and the content of a single discipline university is to change soon. The need, therefore, is to plan the future vision of national law universities in terms of becoming multi-universities to include subjects of crucial significance, including the awarding of degrees other than the law discipline. Also, there is a need to establish an independent regulator for legal education in India. National law universities can collaborate in a significant way to benefit each other by sharing human resources and expertise. With the exception of a few national law universities, most have a long way to go with respect to many of the points raised above. This article is not intended to be a justification or an explanation to the CJI’s comments. Instead, its purpose is to introspect over and understand the problem areas which require rectification. As mentioned earlier, national law universities have the potential to transform the legal landscape of our country. But much is still required to be done before such a potential can be realised. G.S.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:44 IST,||Hope of revitalisation||The 14th General Convention of the Nepali Congress (NC) was markedly different from the previous conventions. The NC is seen as a party that maintains the status quo, but the election results held for filling its office-bearers after five and a half years have rekindled hopes of revitalisation. Although Sher Bahadur Deuba, who heads both the party and the government, will continue as president of the NC for another term, the votes gained by Shekhar Koirala, Mr. Deuba’s competitor, are indicative of change. Dynastic politics has often tried to influence the psyche of NC party members. But this time, the votes seem to be in favour of merit and popularity rather than for the ascribed status of some leaders. The rise of a new leader The Koirala family was divided in supporting Shekhar Koirala. He is not heir apparent unlike Shashank Koirala (B.P. Koirala’s son) or Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi. It is to be noted that the credentials of the latter two are not determined only by the legacies of their fathers; they also have their own trajectory as leaders. Yet, Mr. Singh and Mr. Nidhi could not assert their leadership; on the contrary, in the second round, they did a U-turn by lending support to Mr. Deuba against whom they had stood as candidates for presidentship. Presumably, they didn’t want to see the emergence of Mr. Shekhar Koirala as party leader who is junior to them in politics and experience. Nevertheless, in politics, seniority alone does not matter; popular support, charisma, sense of direction, vision and boldness are all ingredients of leadership. The votes polled by Mr. Singh and Mr. Nidhi were too low compared to those polled by Mr. Deuba and Mr. Shekhar Koirala, who, despite being deserted by his own family members, secured over 35% of the total votes. And so, Mr. Shekhar Koirala has now emerged as a leader next to Mr. Deuba. How far he can energise the party with his vision and mobilising capacity needs to be seen, however. The results also indicate that the era of dynastic trends is over in Nepali politics. Neither Mr. Deuba nor the two general secretaries — Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma — are from dynastic backgrounds. The Left’s appeal is steadily declining as it has little direction and is torn by divisions. What remains is the empty slogan of Maoism, Leninism, and ‘nationalism’, which is a euphemism for anti-Indianism and anti-imperialism. In contrast to the various communist groups, the NC is looked upon as a reliable, moderate force for democracy. Thus, what it needs is to do is shoulder the role of democratising society and the polity by transforming itself into a reliable and dynamic democratic party. In any polity, the role of the leadership is crucial for transformation, especially since policies and programmes for transformation need to be executed by the leadership. We have seen how the builders of modern India laid the foundation of democracy. We have also seen how leaders like Donald Trump can shake the established democratic order with their authoritarian proclivities. So, Mr. Deuba and other leaders elected on the basis of their popularity should work in tandem to make the party people-centric and worthy of winning elections. Challenges over time The NC has faced many challenges over the years: it had to struggle first against the ‘Ranarchy’, then against monarchy and also for its own existence. Determined to eliminate the existence of the NC, King Mahendra declared his regime “party-less” but failed to fulfil his mission. Instead, the coup he staged against the first ever-elected NC government in 1960 proved to be fatal for his regime after decades and eventually for monarchy itself. Now the NC is facing the challenge of pseudo-communists, whose political identity is blurred and who still claim to be thoroughbred democrats. Can the NC with its new agenda of transformation stand up to the communists or will it continue as a status quo-party? The new agenda set by the Young Turks indicates a departure from the previous style of running the party. Since the NC is a mass based-party, its renewal can only be possible if it is in regular touch with the people and their concerns and aspirations. The new leaders who have been able to transcend polarisation within the party should be projected as the faces for the coming national, provincial and local elections. They can create a positive public impression as they were elected on the basis of popularity and merit. Mr. Deuba can revamp the image of the party if he prepares to set the new agenda of the party with the cooperation of young energetic leaders who are rearing to take the NC to new heights.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 00:00 IST,||A string of jolts for the Maoists||The banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) would probably like to forget 2021. It not only suffered setbacks in the Andhra-Odisha Border (AOB) region in Visakhapatnam district, which the left-wing extremists consider as their strongest fortress after the Dandakaranya region, but also received strong jolts in its self-proclaimed ‘red corridor’ region. The chief of the Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee, Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna alias R.K., died after a prolonged illness in October, six top leaders were killed by the Greyhounds in June in Koyyuru mandal in the Visakhapatnam Agency, and 26 cadres including Central Committee (CC) member Milind Teltumbde were killed during a gun battle by the C-60 force of Maharashtra in Gadchiroli. Other setbacks included the arrest of politburo and CC member Prashant Bose alias Kishan da and his wife Sheela Marandi, also a CC member, and the expulsion of another senior CC and politburo member Kobad Ghandy, for anti-party activities. But the major issue that came to the fore after the surrender of some key tribal leaders in the AOB region was the growing rift between the tribal leaders and non-tribal leaders and cadres within the Maoist set-up. Surrendering before the police, Sudheer, Naveen and Swarna, who had led many major operations for the Maoists in the AOB region, had said that though the tribal people form the major fighting force both in the AOB region and in Chhattisgarh, the leadership rests with the non-tribal people who are mainly from the upper castes and come from the plains of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Speaking to The Hindu , Sudheer had said that the tribal people are treated like “cannon fodder”. Since the time the Maoists made their way into the AOB area from Telangana in the early 1980s, the leadership has stayed with the non-tribal people despite their dependence on the tribal people for all their needs, Sudheer had said. He had also mentioned being upset when non-tribal leaders gave the order for killing four tribal people last year after branding them as police informers. At present, the movement in AOB is led by Aruna, wife of CC member Chalapathi, and Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, both of whom are non-tribal people. Despite being a woman, Aruna ill-treats women cadres, Swarna had said. Almost all the tribal leaders in the AOB region such as Kudumula Venkata Rao alias Ravi and Gemmeli Narayan Rao alias Jambri have died. Many have also surrendered. To make matters worse, recruitment in this region has reduced and so, the Maoists are busy importing cadres from Chhattisgarh, who are mainly from the Koya tribes. This is resulting in cultural differences between the people of the region and the new recruits. As there are no new recruits from the region, senior leaders who are ageing are being forced to hand over the lower and mid-level leadership to the tribal people. This is resulting in cultural differences between the various levels of leadership. This was also pointed out by Kundan Pahan, a tribal leader who had surrendered in Jharkhand, and Jambri (who was killed in action in 2017) in AOB. They had expressed displeasure at the ‘high-handedness’ and ‘non-acceptance’ of non-tribal leaders. Though this has been refuted by the Maoists, who say differentiating people along the lines of caste, ethnicity and religion is against their ethos, a document penned by the former General Secretary of the party, Muppalla Lakshmana Rao alias Ganapathi, also mentioned this issue. He had warned that non-tribal leaders must change their approach and set things right with the tribal leaders if they want the movement to stay alive. sumit.b@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-string-of-jolts-for-the-maoists/article38141039.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 00:00 IST,||Message from Mumbai||Purveyors of hate, misogyny and xenophobia have been on a boundless revelry in India, online and offline, with near total impunity and often times with support from politicians and the police. In the midst of such pervasive police apathy, the swift action by the Mumbai police in tracing and arresting three persons linked to the latest incident involving a fake online ‘auction’ of Muslim women gives hope that all is not lost. The Mumbai police action also contrasts with the inaction of the Delhi police, who come under the Union Home Ministry, and the Noida police in Uttar Pradesh, a BJP-ruled State, in a similar case last year. Whether the three arrested were indeed the creators of the app remains a question of investigation and the limited police version at the moment is that they were promoting the platform, at a minimum. The Commissioner of the Mumbai Police has said the probe is continuing and anyone involved in the crime, directly or indirectly, will be arrested and prosecuted. It is delicious irony that the Mumbai police reports to the Maharashtra government led by the Shiv Sena, long accused of xenophobic politics. The Mumbai police were also quick to act in an earlier case involving threats to cricketer Virat Kohli for standing up for his Muslim teammate. It is indeed baffling that the Delhi police, that is expected to play a critical role in securing the lives of all important functionaries of the country, threw their hands up when faced with the challenge of identifying some random imposters on social media. Such a level of incompetence or connivance is ominous. The Delhi police say they have written to GitHub, the U.S.-based platform that hosted the toxic apps. They are also seeking the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty procedure to find information about the app from the U.S., after its Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations unit took over the case. All this is being revealed after a second FIR was filed this week. Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had written to the Union IT Minister, in July and September, about several social media platforms or events that were being used to berate Muslim women. In November, the Minister replied that the Ministry was working on “identifying the gaps in current legislation to address contemporary issues of cyberspace including provisions to protect citizens, especially women, from any online harassment and cyber bullying”. While that is necessary, it cannot be an excuse to let online mobs roam free. The police must identify and arrest the original culprit, but if that process takes months on end, there have to be interim measures to enforce the rule of law. The Mumbai Police have done exactly that, in acting with the alacrity that this case deserves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/message-from-mumbai/article38141016.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:43 IST,||Third time lucky?||India’s post-COVID economic recovery remains delicately poised at the turn of the new year — the third successive year under the shadow of the pandemic. With the Union Budget for 2022-23 less than four weeks away, the latest set of numbers capturing different aspects of the economy present a mixed picture with persistent pressure points. COVID-19 restrictions are already denting India’s services exporters’ order books, even as merchandise exports have hit a record high in December. Worryingly though, imports grew even faster last month than exports, keeping the merchandise trade deficit at an elevated $22 billion, just a tad less than the record $22.9 billion in November. The eight core sectors had a disappointing November, but GST collections from that month were reasonably healthy at around Rs. 1.3-lakh crore, albeit a three-month low. GST compensation cess revenues touched a record high in November, but customs duty collections dipped to a five-month low. The Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMI) for manufacturing and services were robust for December, but have moderated from previous months even as input cost pressures remain a headache for businesses along with the prospect of the latest virus wave upending normalcy again. For the first time in four months, firms surveyed for the PMI by IHS Markit reported ‘broad-based’ job losses in manufacturing and services in December. Global headwinds are shifting after the surge of COVID cases and disruptions, even as inflationary forces have central bankers bracing for interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve this year. It will be equally challenging for North Block mandarins to conjure up an appropriate mix of relief and support measures for businesses and jobs — preferably going beyond the credit guarantees that appear to have lost traction in sanctions and disbursals in recent months. This needs to be accompanied by a fresh ramp up in health-care spending, including on COVID inoculations and booster shots, as well as maintaining the bullish stance on public capital expenditure with a demonstrably greater purpose in getting actual projects off the ground. The prospect of more disruptions looms large, even though their extent and impact on GDP may be uncertain at this point. Preparing for the worst may be a good idea, even if it is accepted that manufacturing suffered less in the second wave than during the initial lockdowns in 2020, and may likely be even better prepared to cope with the ongoing third wave. Yet, there is a risk that damage to contact-intensive services sectors that have had another topsy-turvy year with lakhs of jobs at stake, and have barely struggled back from the first two waves, could be permanently debilitating this time around, if mobility restrictions spiral in tandem with cases. More effective interventions, with a stable and clear articulation of policy direction, could have a calming effect in 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/third-time-lucky/article38141017.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:44 IST,||Two men picked up from sea||Cochin, January 5: Mystery surrounds two able-bodied men captured recently in the Arabian Sea off the Kerala coast by some fishermen. One of them was captured off Alleppey and the other off Quilon. Both men were naked, and one of them cast something into the sea before seizure, according to a source. When the fishermen questioned the strangers, they kept mum, giving the impression they were deaf and dumb. The two were handed over to the police. Strenuous interrogation by the police in Urdu, Hindi, etc., failed to elicit any clue regarding them. At last the strangers stuttered something to indicate they belonged to North India. Their physical features also looked North Indian. Officers of the Southern Naval Command in Cochin on request from the Police, proceeded to Alleppey and Quilon and tried their hand at interrogation. One of the captives just gave out what is claimed by him to be the address of a relative of his in North India. No other information became available. Inquiries are afoot to check up with the address given by one of the strangers who may also be taken to Delhi for further interrogation. Both men are stated to be growing long hair and whiskers. The manner in which they were found afloat in the sea indicates they were adepts at spending a number of days in water.

The numbers were dragged down by lower sales of passenger vehicles and two-wheelers due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, high cost of ownership and poor consumer sentiment in rural areas, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA). Total retail sales of automobiles fell to 15.58 lakh units in December from 18.56 lakh a year earlier. “The month of December is usually seen as a high-sales month where OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] continue to offer best discounts to clear the inventory due to change of year. It was, however, not the case this time around as retail sales continued to disappoint,” FADA president Vinkesh Gulati said. While sales of passenger vehicles (PV) slipped to almost 11% to 2.44 lakh units, two-wheelers fell close to 20% to 11.48 lakh. “With the semiconductor shortage continuing to play spoilsport, PV sales — in spite of huge bookings — closed in the red. Dealers, however, saw slight ease in vehicle supply thus giving some hope of improvement,” Mr. Gulati said. ‘Two-wheelers hit’ He added that in the two-wheeler segment, however, high cost of ownership, bad rural sentiment, work-from-home and the latest threat of the Omicron variant continued to impact sales. Commercial vehicles registered growth of 13.7% to 58,847 units, driven by the government’s push for infrastructure spending. Further, better freight rates and a low base helped the overall segment close with double-digit growth. Sales of three-wheelers saw a significant increase of 59.5% to 44,288 units in December 2021. Tractor sales, meanwhile, declined 10.3% to 62,250 units. With various State governments again announcing COVID restrictions and resumption of work and education from home will have a negative effect for auto retail, said Mr. Gulati “With the fear of healthcare expenses rising again, customers are shying away from closing their purchase decisions. With IIT Kanpur predicting the peak of omicron sometimes in the first week of February, FADA hence remains extremely cautious over the next 2-3 months,” he added.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) asked creditors to initiate fresh sale of Videocon, a consumer durables company manufacturing products ranging from air-conditioners to washing machines, for recovery of their unpaid Rs. 64,637.6 crore. While a majority of lenders had previously accepted Twin Star Technologies’ Rs. 2,962.02-crore offer, Bank of Maharashtra (BoM) and IFCI Ltd. dissented, saying the amount offered was close to the liquidation value of the bankrupt firm and that they cannot be paid less than the liquidation value. Following the nod of the Committee of Creditors of Videocon, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (bankruptcy court) had on June 9 last year consented to Twin Star Technologies’ takeover offer (called Resolution Plan under the bankruptcy law). That order was challenged by BoM and IFCI before NCLAT, which on Wednesday set aside the NCLT order saying provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) had not been complied with. Videocon promoter Venugopal Dhoot had also challenged the NCLT order, questioning the conduct of lenders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/nclat-junks-anil-agarwal-led-firms-takeover-of-videocon/article38140799.ece

The seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index fell from 58.1 in November to a three-month low of 55.5 in December. The rates of expansion moderated but were nevertheless ‘marked’ by historical standards, according to the survey. For the fifth straight month, the services sector witnessed an expansion in output. In Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below 50 denotes contraction. “[The year] 2021 was another bumpy year for service providers, and growth took a modest step back in December,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit. “Still, the latest readings pointed to robust increases in sales and business activity compared to the survey trend,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pmi-december-services-activity-hits-3-month-low/article38141011.ece

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:38 IST,||Tenacious Elgar raises South Africa’s hopes at the Bullring||He doesn’t make a pretty sight at the crease. Dean Elgar took blows on the body on a pitch of uneven bounce but stayed on displaying a heart larger than his frame. The tenacious southpaw, playing a skipper’s knock, was unbeaten on a blood and guts 46 and South Africa, pursuing 240, was 118 for two at stumps on the third day of the second Freedom Test at the Wanderers on Wednesday. The contest in the middle was often brutal. A nasty Bumrah short-pitched ball struck Elgar on the helmet grill. Shardul, the only bowler to target the crack consistently, got one to rear and hit Elgar on the knuckles. Elgar fought on. Brisk start South Africa began the chase briskly with Aiden Markram impressing with a string of shots the finest being a cover-drive off Mohammed Shami. Markram looked threatening but Shardul trapped him leg-before with an incoming delivery that hit the crack and kept low. Keegan Petersen batted with timing and flow, cover-driving Bumrah and pulling Mohammed Siraj but R. Ashwin, using the crease cleverly, got him with one spinning into the right-hander who went back. Earlier Hanuma Vihari — 40 not out off 84 deliveries — came up with an innings of great significance. He walked in at the fall of Ajinkya Rahane’s wicket — the total was 155 for three — and stayed put till India was dismissed for 266. Along the way, Vihari built crucial little partnerships, playing second fiddle to an aggressive Shardul and then unleashing his strokes — the drive, the pull and the cut — when the last man was at the crease. It is the solidity of his backfoot and a tight defence that makes Vihari such a combative player on these pitches. When he strikes the ball, he does so with footwork and balance. Earlier, two battle-scarred soldiers put up a stand. Cheteshwar Pujara (53) and Rahane (58) were under pressure. Pujara, shrugging away the fear of failure, adopted a new, bold approach. His was a calculated counter-attack on a seam-trap. Pujara drove, cut and pulled with the sort of fluency we have not seen from him for long. He was also more upright in his stance to counter the bounce. Rahane batted with aggression too. He is such a sweet timer when he drives. Rahane also essayed an incredible cut for a six when Marco Jansen pitched one short. Rahane’s horizontal bat shots are his ally on these pitches. When introduced, Kagiso Rabada began with a vicious short-pitched ball. He immediately signalled for a short-leg. Rahane responded by driving Rabada between point and cover. This was an engrossing Test match duel. Rabada would have got Rahane. on 43, with a lifter, but Markram, in the cordon, reacted late. Eventually, a brutish delivery of bounce and away movement from Rabada ended Rahane’s tenure. The third wicket had added an invaluable 111 runs. Rabada, bowling with venom, sent back Pujara too, bringing the ball back. Rishabh Pant, struck on the helmet grill by a lifter from Rabada, perished to a wild swipe off the next ball; between the deliveries, van der Dussen riled up Pant with chatter from short-leg. Ashwin, looked in good touch, but Ngidi got him nicking one down the leg-side, Thakur (28 off 24), produced a blaze of shots, the best being an immaculate straight-drive off Jansen. Then Vihari, ever the fighter, prolonged India’s lead.

The only change, tournament Director Prashant Sutar hinted, would be that play may be held behind closed doors against the earlier plan of allowing up to 500 fully vaccinated spectators per day.  Speaking to The Hindu , Sutar said: “Back then Omicron wasn’t this big, but the situation is getting worse now. So about allowing fans, we will take a call closer to the tournament.  “Overall, we are not that worried [about the tournament]. We have taken two dedicated floors at the hotel and we need to take care of the players’ movement between the hotel and the stadium,” he added. With rules for international arrivals changing by the day, Sutar said that they were in regular touch with the Maharashtra government. The 2021 edition of the tournament was not held because Maharashtra did not relax mandatory quarantine requirements.

Sunil Yajaman, joint-secretary of the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association, was similarly upbeat about the conduct. “Our preparations are on,” said Yajaman. “Whatever the government asks us to do regarding the protocols to be followed, we will do it. Right now, it’s too early to think of what might be.” Yajaman also played down the possibility of there being new restrictions for international travellers. “If I speak now, it will be pure speculation. But world over tournaments are happening and people are travelling. There are no more restrictions in India than say Australia.

Hyderabad, with 16 points, dislodged holder Mumbai City FC (also on 16) through a better head-to-head record. ATK Mb rose to the third spot with 15 points. In what turned out to be one of the most exciting contests of the tournament, there was a goal almost immediately after kick off. After a few exchange of passes on the right flank, Hugo Boumous ‘heeled’ the ball to Williams, who advanced a few steps before firing home a rasping left-footer that took the Hyderabad goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani by surprise. Fastest goal in ISL The match was just 12 seconds old, making it the fastest goal in ISL history. The previous record was held by Jerry Mawihmingthanga, who scored it in 23 seconds for Jamshedpur FC in 2018. Stung by the early setback, Hyderabad regrouped quickly and took the fight to ATK MB. The Kolkata giant’s citadel fell in the 18th minute after custodian Amrinder Singh floundered, allowing the ball to slip and letting Bartholomew Ogbeche find the target with a simple tap-in. This was Ogbeche’s ninth goal of the season and he continued to be the most prolific striker. ATK MB regained the lead in the 64th minute through an own goal from Asish Rai, who deflected home a header from ATK MB substitute Joni Kauko. Just when the match appeared to be headed ATK MB’s way, Hyderabad’s Javier Siverio, coming in as a late substitute, nodded home a superb assist from Akash Mishra in added time.

Ebadot had bowled Bangladesh to the brink of a famous victory by the end of the fourth day when he had figures of four for 39. He broke down the last of New Zealand’s resistance with two quick wickets as the home team was dismissed in its second innings for 169, its lowest score against Bangladesh. New Zealand trailed by 130 runs on the first innings, leaving Bangladesh to score only 40 for victory. It lost two wickets in doing so, but current captain Mominul Haque, top-scorer in the first innings, and former captain Mushfiqur Rahim were at the crease when Bangladesh reached 42 for two. End of the streak It was only Bangladesh’s sixth test win away from home and its first test win over a team ranked in the top 5: New Zealand is ranked No. 2 and Bangladesh No. 9. The result also brought to an end New Zealand’s unbeaten streak in its last 17 tests at home. Ebadot, a former volleyball player who became a test cricketer after winning a fast bowling competition, had only 11 test wickets at an average of 81 when he came into this match as Bangladesh’s third seamer. He took one for 75 in New Zealand’s first innings of 328 but came into his own in the second innings, running through the middle order on Tuesday with the wickets of Devon Conway (13), Henry Nicholls (0), Tom Blundell (0) and Will Young (69). That left New Zealand 147 for five at the start of play Wednesday, only 17 ahead of Bangladesh. The possibility of any stern resistance by New Zealand, marshalled around veteran batsman Ross Taylor who was 37 not out when play began, quickly dissolved, thanks to Ebadot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gritty-bangladesh-scripts-historic-triumph/article38141128.ece

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:34 IST,||We have confidence in our abilities: Manisa||Defender Manisa Panna from Odisha has had a tough life, losing her parents at a young age and moving away from her favourite sport before fighting her way back with help from her grandmother to represent India in the AFC women’s Asian Cup. “It has not been an easy journey by any means. I’ve even had to stop playing football in my younger days. But I couldn’t stay away from it for too long. I just wanted to do something,” Manisa told the national federation’s website. The continental tournament is scheduled to be held from January 20 to February 6 in Mahatashtra. While football has helped Manisa overcome the terrible losses in her life, she has not always had the support of her neighbours in her endeavours. “In the beginning, there was a mixed reaction from my neighbours and relatives, about me playing football. It was at this stage, that her grandmother and aunt came in to fully support her in her footballing journey. “They never discouraged me from playing football. They told me to pursue whatever avenue interested me the most, and told me that they would always have my back, no matter what.” Then, she started getting call-ups for the junior National teams — India U-17 and India U-19. She eventually broke into the senior team in 2015. “Once I started getting opportunities in the national teams, people started seeing my name in the papers, and those in our village would come and tell me that I’ve made our village proud, and that felt very good. “My grandmother is a very big inspiration. She always used to keep herself busy, just to be able to feed us three times a day. She was determined to take good care of us and ensure that we get the support to reach a certain level from where we could take care of ourselves,” the 30-year-old said. One of the highlights of Manisa’s career has been winning the 2016 SAFF championship title. “We are all preparing really hard for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup. It’s a special occasion because India will be hosting it, and the squad has a lot of belief in itself. “We have a strong group to play against. Iran are a good side, and we have played against Chinese Taipei recently in a friendly (India won 1-0), which was a tough game for us. “And then, of course, there’s China, who are one of the best in Asia. “We have confidence in our abilities. If we make the quarterfinals, we stand a chance of qualifying for the World Cup. That remains the long term goal as of now,” said Manisa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-have-confidence-in-our-abilities-manisa/article38141297.ece

It is the first time Bangladesh has won in New Zealand, and Mominul could not contain his emotion when Mushfiqur Rahim clouted a boundary off Kyle Jamieson to seal the famous victory by eight wickets. "I can't describe it. It's an unbelievable thing," Mominul, who was not out 13, said after hugging Mushfiqur and waving to the Bangladesh team and support staff. It was not only a boost for Bangladesh cricket, but it also severely dented New Zealand's hopes of retaining its world Test crown. New Zealand was only 17 runs in front at stumps on day four with five wickets remaining, but Mominul said he refused to contemplate victory until it happened. "Honestly, I couldn't sleep yesterday because of the pressure and I didn't know what will happen today," he said. "It was very important to win the Test match, everyone knows we have to improve our Test cricket, (but) we didn't focus on the result, we focused on the process," he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/its-unbelievable-says-mominul/article38141121.ece

Poland finished the round-robin stage 3-0 in Group D, also beating Georgia and Greece. Greece picked up its first victory with a 2-1 win over last-place Georgia. Later, Pablo Carreno Busta beat Filip Krajinovic 6-3, 6-4 to secure a semifinal spot for Spain and Roberto Bautista Agut completed the group-stage victory over Serbia with a 6-1, 6-4 defeat of Dusan Lajovic. Spain only needed to win one of its matches against Serbia to top Group A and set up a semifinal against Poland. Chile’s win over Norway meant Serbia needed to sweep Spain to advance.  The results: Group A: Spain bt Serbia 2-1 (Carreno Busta bt Krajinovic 6-3, 6-4; Bautista Agut bt Lajovic 6-1, 6-4; Martinez & Ramos-Vinolas lost to Cacic & Sabanov 7-6(5), 3-6, [5-10]).

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:12 IST,||Giles calls for changes after Ashes defeat||Apologising for the Ashes defeat Down Under, ECB managing director Ashley Giles has called for systematic changes in English cricket, but stressed that mass sacking is not the solution for the team’s recent struggles in Tests. England trails the ongoing five-match Ashes series 0-3. The visitors were completely outplayed in the first three games.  “I absolutely feel the responsibility of losing this Ashes series,” Giles told BBC Sport .  “We all do and we can only apologise. I know there will be a lot of emotion, a lot of anger about how we’ve lost it. But we know it’s not an easy place to come. In the last 34 years we’ve come here and won once (in 2010-11). “We’ve not done well in terms of results. In the 1990s (a similar record) was accepted as normal for England leadership and they got away with it. We set our standards much higher than that,” he added. Speculation is rife England has lost a record nine Tests in 2021 and the Ashes defeat has led to speculations regarding the future of Test skipper Joe Root and head coach Chris Silverwood, while Giles’ role is also under the scanner. But the former England spinner feels changing leadership without addressing systematic shortcomings will not help English cricket. “You can change me, we can change the head coach and change the captain, but we’re only setting up future leaders for failure. “ That’s all we do. It’s only pushing it down the road.” Giles said the ECB will be reviewing the tour. Giles blamed England’s domestic cricket set up for the country’s failure to prepare players for international assignments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/giles-calls-for-changes-after-ashes-defeat/article38141295.ece

I want to move forward from this and make sure that we start winning matches and make sure that I start performing for the team in the best manner,” Lukaku added. Earlier in the day, Tuchel said he had accepted an apology from Lukaku and the striker was available for Wednesday’s League Cup semifinal first leg against Tottenham. “He apologised and is back in training. He did not do this intentionally to create noise in front of such a big game. And it’s the very first time he has behaved like this.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lukaku-sorry-for-unhappy-comment/article38141386.ece

The 30-year-old universal feels the event would benefit the Indian side. “Every team has two foreign players. It will help the Indians as the foreign players will share their experience. We will learn a few things from them.  “The revival of the volleyball league is a good opportunity for us... All the (domestic) players who take part in the league can play for India. The lack of exposure (in terms of playing with international sides) will be compensated for in the league. We will have healthy competition with good players. Ultimately it will help the Indian team,” Vinit, who has been picked by Kolkata Thunderbolts for Rs. 8.75 lakh, told The Hindu .  Optimistic Vinit is optimistic about his PVL side. “Our team is really good and I have high hopes for my team. We have been practising well and hopefully we will do well. Our management and coaches are very supportive. They keep encouraging us. A player remains in good mental space in such an environment.” Vinit threw some light on his domestic experience. “Earlier, I used to represent Uttarakhand (as I am employed with ONGC). The team has now shifted to Guwahati. So now we play for Assam. In the last National championship, Assam won silver for the first time.” Hailing from a farmer’s family in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar, Vinit, a 2019 South Asian Games gold medallist, thinks PVL will be a hit in his native place. “Volleyball is very popular in our area, local and all-India tournaments keep happening there. There is a stadium about 20km from my home. “Whenever I go home I practise there. Other players from the area do the same. I am sure people over there will follow different teams during the league,” said Vinit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/playing-with-overseas-recruits-will-help-indians-vinit/article38141301.ece

The incident happened when Jansen bounced and Bumrah, who attempted to hook, couldn’t connect properly and the ball went to point. And Jansen, turning towards the Indian vice-captain, let loose a barrage of words. This infuriated Bumrah who charged towards Jansen, both met at mid-pitch, and the situation looked nasty. Credit to Erasmus for quickly stepping in. It was an occasion when tempers became frayed in a tense, tight game. Later, when Bumrah swatted Kagiso Rabada for a six, the cheers from the Indian dressing room were the loudest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-bumrah-jansen-showdown/article38141122.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:39 IST,||Test in the balance: Pujara||Cheteshwar Pujara said the “match was in the balance,” but was confident the Indians would pull off a series clinching win on day four. “We need to get Elgar out early,” he said Pujara, who made a stroke-filled 53 on a difficult pitch in the Indian second innings said, “I just wanted to put away the bad balls. Because on this pitch you do not know when you would receive an unplayable ball.” He added, “I was happy with the way I batted. I was even happier with my partnership with Ajinkya Rahane because it gave India runs to fight with.” On the effect of the roller on the pitch, he said, “The surface plays good for an hour after the heavy roller is used. Then the cracks start opening up again.” Asked whether there was pressure on himself and Rahane ahead of the Indian innings, he said, “All the chatter is outside. The team-management is backing us. We are working hard at our batting, following a process and the runs will come.” Pujara said “Form is temporary, class is permanent.” On skipper Virat Kohli’s fitness after a back spasm kept him out of this Test, he said, “He is getting better. I feel he will be fit soon.” On Rishabh Pant’s batting and Wednesday’s on-field skirmishes, he said, “That’s the way Pant bats. Perhaps, what shots to play and at what time, the team-management may have a chat with him.” He added, “As a unit we stay and fight together. If someone says something to us, you can be sure we will give it back to him.” Demanding pitch Justin Sammons, South Africa’s batting consultant, said the pitch was demanding, there was uneven bounce and said a lot of the home team’s hopes hinged on skipper Dean Elgar. “He can play for long periods, and when he is there, the others can bat around him. And build partnerships. So his presence is very important for us.” Sammons had words of praise for Indian bowling and said, “It was testing and relentless. The pitch too is playing tricks.” Sammons expressed the confidence that South Africa can chase down the target.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/test-in-the-balance-pujara/article38141130.ece

England has already surrendered the ongoing five-match Ashes series to Australia after losing the first three Tests. The performance has caused outrage back home with former players such as Kevin Pietersen calling for institutional changes to arrest the slide.  “I think you don’t need to look too deep into it and start changing the wheel,” Anderson told Fox Cricket .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/anderson-rejects-talk-of-big-overhaul/article38141293.ece

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:42 IST,||On a wing and a prayer||The beginning of the year for us, is the middle of migration season for a number of our winged guests, and a time of important activity for Chennai’s birding community. This is when Chennai’s birders — like others around the country — take stock of both the domestic and migrant bird populations around the city. In a regular year, the month of January would have seen three annual events — Chennai Bird Race, the Asian Waterbird Census, and the Tamil Nadu Government’s own Synchronised Bird Census — compelling birdwatchers to criss-cross the city’s wetlands, wooded areas and other hotspots in a patient, long-drawn attempt at documenting our avian population. Last year, however, the much-awaited marquee Chennai Bird Race had to be put on hold, while the other two events saw muted, focussed participation by a few long-term birders. This year, however, the Madras Naturalists Society (MNS) dares to hope for a little bit more despite a looming wave. Says G Vijay Kumar, honorary secretary, MNS, the organisation behind Madras Bird Race, “We are hopeful of holding the HSBC Chennai Bird Race this year. Though the event is usually held in January for better sightings, there is no rule as such. It is in the migration period between December and February that you have some choice when you go out in the field. You don’t have to restrict yourself to woodland birds.” There are numbers to back this statement. For instance, when the last public Chennai Bird Race was held in 2020, some 30-odd teams of participants had in total spotted 171 bird species in the city. At least four teams had spotted upwards of 100 species each, states Kumar, adding, “The ‘bird of the day was the grey wagtail sighted at Semmenchery. Other notable sightings were white wagtail, Asian pied starling and Pallas’s grasshopper warbler at Pallikaranai Marsh, and the southern grey shrike at Perumbakkam Tank.” And these are just some of the wetland birds; Chennai also has a sizeable number of woodland birds who populated its urban treetops through the year. While Chennai Bird Race — one of many separate bird races sponsored by HSBC around the country — is entirely organised by Chennai’s fraternity, the society is also a part of larger, concentrated effort to track the avian populations of bigger regions. The Asian Waterbird Census (AWC), for instance, was first held in 1987, and today covers about 26 countries along both the East-Asian Australasian Flyway, as well as a large part of the Central Asian Flyway. It is a massive citizen science effort, and depends on both amateurs and experts who put in tremendous legwork out of their own volition. In our part of the map in 2021, the State co-ordinator for AWC was KV Sudhakar, a key member of MNS. At the forefront Says Sudhakar, “The AWC is part of a concentrated effort by the Asian Wetland Bureau, and has been going on since the 1980s in Tamil Nadu. MNS member Dr V Shantaram had pioneered waterfowl censuses in Tamil Nadu, along with C Teronno from Puducherry. Tamil Nadu has always been at the forefront of such initiatives, since the State has one of the highest coverage of wetlands in the country, after Maharashtra and Gujarat.” Like last year, this year’s efforts on ground are also spearheaded by multiple researchers stationed in Salem, Tiruchi and other parts of the State, says Sudhakar. While foot soldiers across Tamil Nadu submitted a total of 150 species for review in 2021, the final figures “are still being compiled by AWC,” he states. He adds, “Earlier, the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) used to be the national coordinator but now, birders can just record their observations on eBird, which makes it easier. We had requested participants of the Pongal Bird Count to also contribute; these initiatives require coordination.” Is the effort worth it? The birders are convinced in the affirmative: their observations not only help track populations and shifting migration patterns of species across the region, but are also an excuse to feel connected to the natural world again. As Sudhakar points this out, he speedily lists out the native waterfowl of his homeland: “Pelicans, painted storks, herons, egrets. The migrants include ducks, sandpipers, and plovers. We never used to see flamingos in Chennai; they were usually spotted only in Pulicat. Only in the last few years are they beginning to be sighted here: changes like these are important to note.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-a-wing-and-a-prayer/article38140991.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:43 IST,||For the love of a dram||If you are Indian, you probably associate whisky with uncles, duty-free shopping and boisterous wedding dinners.  India’s most popular alcohol, whisky, was seen as a bar staple for older Indian men for decades. According to market research platform Statista, the average consumption of whisky per capita in India stands at 2.6 litres. However, not all whiskies are created equal. There are single malts, blended whiskies, corn-based, rye whisky, and the rise of the Indian single malt, led by Amrut, Paul John, Rampur and more recently Kamet that has in recent years won hearts and awards across the globe. As a younger and more diverse Indian drinking population samples the spirit, it is undergoing a drastic image makeover led by trendy whisky clubs around the country. At the Dram Club in Mumbai, women who enjoy their malts are at the heart of the events. “For us, the co-founder, Swati Sharma, being a woman probably broke barriers” says Vinayak Singh, co-founder of the club that began in March 2019. The group launched an app in 2021, with aggregated information on a cornucopia of whiskies — from expressions of a brand, to city-wise price lists, personalised recommendations and ultimately a delivery platform for single malts and whiskies, to generate revenue. With over 3,500 subscribers, the Dram Club offers free membership, with a fee ranging from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 5,500 per event, based on the type of spirit, food and event location. Vinayak relishes the opportunity to conduct blind tastings: “Our members discovered they preferred Paul John to some Scottish staples. We also enjoy Kamet and Blue Label’s Ghost and Rare, a limited edition blend from Johnny Walker,” he says. Pooja Vir, who attends these events, concurs with Singh. “I began enjoying whisky during my time in London. When I moved back to India in 2017, I started a club called the whisky Ladies of Mumbai, but two years ago switched to The Dram Club. The events offer an avenue to sample really expensive bottles before investing in them.” The Single Malt Amateur Club (SMAC) in Bengaluru has the distinction of working with Amrut and John Distilleries in India, to bring out exclusive bottles for club members, the Amrut Amaze and Cask No.6028 respectively. Offering free membership and a fee per event, the club was started in 2011, and now has over 4,000 members. “The landscape of whisky appreciation has changed dramatically in the past three years, as evidenced by an uptick in our membership by about 30% since 2019, with members primarily in the 32-plus age group,” says founder Hemanth Rao. As SMAC partners with Indian single malts to provide members with exclusive offerings, Hemanth says the provenance of quality malts from India has helped push the popularity of whiskies. “Amrut and Paul John have moved the needle and now there is a turn inwards as Indians embrace new malts.”  Explaining how they kept members engaged through the pandemic, he adds, “while we couldn’t replicate the joie de vivre of a live event, we did sessions on peripheral subjects like the perfect glassware for single malts, whisky auctions, industry trends etc.”  Now Hemanth is introducing members to their own blending experiments in custom American white oak ageing barrels, in three- and five-litre capacities, ranging from Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 17,000 and one can even choose from ex-rum or ex-port barrels that lend the blends a fruity character on the nose and palate. “Today Indians want to experiment, and they enjoy their whiskies very differently from their parent’s generation,” says Nikhil Agarwal, who curates experiences at All Things Nice, a luxury wine and spirits consulting agency. While most events are hosted in Mumbai, Agarwal, who conducts a course in the Fundamentals of Scotch Whisky in association with the Edinburgh Whisky Academy, has taken his love and learning of the spirit to Singapore and Hong Kong as well. All Things Nice has even paired whisky with poetry, music and art at events. In Kolkata, The Calcutta Malt and Spirits Club, has grown from a cosy 20-member club in 2010, that originally met at the Tata Steel Room within the premises of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, to a club that has now added over two score to the fold, and meets at restaurants across the city. Subhasis Ganguli, one of the founding members, says, “We are a not-for-profit group. I lead the tasting with some history of the single malts — the region, age, character, cask style and flavour profiles.” He adds that members pick up different age expressions of brands like Inchmurrin, Tomatin or spirits from the Speyside in Scotland when they travel, or from the Whisky Exchange in London. The highlight of the club’s dossier of experiences was a ‘smoke-based’ tasting. Smoky malts accompanied tandoori fare: the salty unctuousness of bacon complimented the Caol Ila. Lamb shanks went well with the 14-year Lagavulin, and Oban’s light touch married well with briny notes from smoked fish. Julieann Fernandes, master blender at South Africa- based Distell Group says, “whisky is beginning to find favour with millennial drinkers in India. More experiential activation is helping with driving traction amongst this younger generation as well — pop up events, bar takeovers, tastings, and DIY cocktail sessions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/for-the-love-of-a-dram/article38140996.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:43 IST,||On the sugar trail||KKN Nallasamy has had white sugar with his tea for only three months in his lifetime.  The 72-year-old farmer prefers using country sugar, made right beside his sugarcane fields at Kavindapadi village in Erode district, 98 kilometres from Coimbatore. “A terrible drought struck us some 20 years ago and our crops failed,” he recalls. “I could not make naatu sakkarai (country sugar) and hence had to buy white sugar. But after three months I stopped using it,” he pauses, chuckling about how it did not feel or taste quite right.   Kavindapadi is a major supplier of country sugar in the State. Sugarcane fields are spread out across the village — the strapping purple stalks are fed well by the Lower Bhavani Canal. “Our country sugar is used to sweeten panchamirtham at the Palani Murugan temple,” says KKN Eswaramoorthy, Nallasamy’s son. The 45-year-old manages 12 acres of the crop, and also makes and sells country sugar.  “Kavindapadi’s population is around 10,000, of which around 2,000 of us are involved in farming,” he says. The village has two major white sugar mills in the vicinity; ironic in a place known for country sugar. “Several farmers sell their sugarcane to the mills, while some sell their crop to commercial jaggery units in the region,” explains Eswaramoorthy, just as his mother walks by to offer us tea — with country sugar. The sugar adds a mellow nutty flavour to the tea, something that Eswaramoorthy swears by. “It has grown in popularity over the last decade or so, which is why I decided to market it on Facebook,” he explains. The page Sugarcane Jaggery Powder, that he started in 2015, is a direct link between the farmer and consumer. “If I sell through the agent in my village, the product will change three hands before reaching the consumer, and I end up making very less,” he says. And so he started his own brand, the first in his village to do so.  “Traditionally, pongal was made with naatu sakkarai ,” says Eswaramoorthy. “Jaggery is the same, made into balls,” he adds. Somewhere along the way, jaggery, probably owing to its shape — there is also ‘achchu vellam’, shaped into small rectangles — gained in popularity.  “Over the years, commercial units started adding white sugar while making jaggery, and people ended up getting used to what is an unnatural sweeter version,” he explains. A soothing concoction Around a kilometre from his farm, M Maranayakkar is overseeing work on his field. It is a cloudless day, and the sun beats down on us. S Sengottayan and his team of eight are churning out a batch of 90 kilograms of country sugar. The 67-year-old owns a wooden cane crusher, and works for farmers in the region. Once hired, he, along with his team, sets up a clay stove by the land-owner’s field, harvests sugarcane and churns it into sandy brown country sugar. “Five hundred litres of juice will yield around 100 kilograms of sugar,” explains Sengottayan, walking over to a gigantic skillet made of mild steel — it can hold 1,000 litres — where sugarcane juice simmers, giving off sweet-smelling fumes. The juice simmers for two hours; 500 grams of baking soda and 100 grams of calcium carbonate are added at various intervals; 50ml of coconut oil is drizzled in just before it is taken off the fire. Sengottayan gives the shimmery concoction a mix with a mammoth ladle. “Careful now,” his wife Sellammal signals us a warning. “A drop of that can drive a hole into the skin.” But she casually walks around it, sending several ripples glide through the liquid — that has now reached the consistency of honey — with another ladle. The juice has reduced to half its volume. Suddenly, there is a commotion among them — it is time. They gather by the vessel: four of them tip it into a similar skillet. In one quick move, the semi-solid beauty slides into the waiting container. Sengottayan quickly mixes it with a wooden implement. The golden, gooey substance changes colour right before our eyes. “This will turn powdery in 30 minutes,” Sellammal tells us.  Sengottayan scrapes a tiny bit off the ladle and offers it for us to taste: he calls it javvu mittai (sticky candy). It sticks to our fingers as we pull it apart to eat it. The mittai is intoxicating — imagine the sweetness of a hundred sugarcanes condensed into a sticky concentrate that melts in the mouth. “Nice, isn’t it?” chuckles Sengottayan. “I get to eat this every day.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-the-sugar-trail/article38141007.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:41 IST,||Supervillain tales||“After Minnal Murali ’s premiere, someone in the audience walked up to me and asked, ‘Can I hug you?’” Guru Somasundaram says, breaking into a laugh. Life has changed overnight for him after the film dropped recently on Netflix, with his performance being widely appreciated.   There is a child-like joy in Guru as he talks about the film. “I generally don’t watch my movies. In fact, I rarely check the monitor after giving a shot. But when I started working on Minnal Murali , I felt it was going to be special. I watched it with the whole team before the premiere and I was shocked. It was as if I had been struck by lightning, just like my character in the movie,” he laughs.  The film, set in a village called Kurukkammoola, revolves around two men — Jaison (Tovino) and Shibu (Guru), who are struck by lightning on the same night. Both gain superpowers and circumstances pit them against each other. Unrequited love and society’s indifference to his plight make Shibu an embittered man. In Basil’s words, Shibu is the “second hero” and not the villain. Changing phase  Basil and his team met Guru in 2019 to discuss the project. “He narrated the full script, playing the background music on his phone! I didn’t expect that I would get to do so much; I was prepared for the physical and emotional transformation of the character. Things went on to another level once I started shooting,” says Guru, who made his debut with Thiagarajan Kumararaja’s cult Tamil film, Aaranya Kaandam .  The first step to becoming Shibu, says Guru, was learning Malayalam. He took lessons from YouTube and can now read and write the language. “I believe that it is important for an actor to learn the language to portray the emotion. It was also about establishing a bond with every one on the set. Knowing the language helped my performance,” he says.  He also watched Malayalam movies to pick up the language. “I saw many movies of Sreenivasan sir, such as Nadodikattu, Angane Oru Avadhikalathu, Akkare Akkare Akkare… One movie I watched multiple times was Njan Prakashan . It had simple dialogues,” says Guru, who has also acted in critically-acclaimed Tamil films Jigarthanda (2014), Joker (2016) and Jai Bhim (2021).  Guru believes he owes it all to his decade-long association with Chennai-based Koothu-P-Pattarai, a prominent contemporary Tamil theatre group. “I grew up in Madurai, and watched a lot of movies in my childhood. Becoming an actor was the last thing on my mind during my growing-up years because I was shy. I took up a job after finishing my studies. However, after a point, I felt lost. Once I joined Koothu-P-Pattarai, I fell in love with theatre.” Theatre gave him the confidence to improvise. “It is like blowing a balloon to its maximum capacity. You have to ensure that it doesn’t burst, though. Similarly, I improvise without changing the crux of the scene." Coming up  Guru is elated that he is acting in Mohanlal’s directorial debut, Barroz in February. His upcoming Malayalam release is Abhilash S Kumar’s Chattambi , along with Sreenath Bhasi and Chemban Vinod.  His dream is to do a full-length comedy role. “Many people have told me that I remind them of Nagesh sir. He was a fabulous character artiste even though we have seen him more in comedies," he adds. Does he have a favourite villain-actor? “Raghuvaran sir. I believe that a villain has to have some honesty about him,” he says, adding, “A Brazilian theatre artiste once observed that heroes in our films usually remain good and villains are always bad. According to him, there should be a mix of good and bad in the characters. Raghuvaran sir’s villain roles have that blend. I like to play such characters.”  I believe that it is important for an actor to learn the language to portray the emotion.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:41 IST,||Bringing back the melody||Earlier this year, Ravi G started a musical series on Instagram titled Home Jam , in which he presented covers of many underrated 90s Tamil film songs. One of those — a cover of ‘Porkalam’ from Tenali — attracted the attention of many, most notably music composer Anirudh who commented: ‘Thank you for this. From RaviG Fan club president.’   Spurred by Ravi's work, the composer soon called him for a recording. That number, a melody titled ‘Naan Pizhai' ( Kaathuvaakula Rendu Kadhal ), is the latest talk of the town, clocking more than three million views within a couple of days of its release and trending on music charts.  “The response has been unimaginable,” says Ravi, who has crooned along with Shashaa Tirupati, “What’s most heartening is that it is a melody, which itself is a difficult proposition for composers to churn out in this age of fast-paced peppy numbers. The opportunity to explore such melodies in the film music space is scarce. The first time I listened to the track version, I had goosebumps. That it has clicked with audiences is great news for musicians.” Starring Vijay Sethupathi and Nayanthara, the song is written by the film’s director Vignesh Shivan.  Thirty-three-year-old Ravi got his first film break through a 2015 Anirudh composition in Ajith-starrer Vedalam, and subsequently worked with Sean Roldan as a music producer. His recent songs include ‘Boomikkku’ from GV Prakash’s Jail .   Ravi hails from a musical family; his uncle plays the mridangam while his grandfather is a Carnatic vocalist. He picked up the mridangam when he was barely four, and slowly got interested in vocals. “At home, there were a lot of music classes to students, and I'd pick up things just listening to those lessons.” When he was 15, he learnt the keyboard and went on to play in various live shows and music productions. Currently busy with producing contemporary devotional and fusion music outings, Ravi’s work was also recently showcased in the Perumal and Providence project, a production that gave a modern twist to Carnatic kritis .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bringing-back-the-melody/article38140967.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:42 IST,||Don’t drop the mic||“Whenever I write something, I love reading it aloud because I feel like I am giving life to something,” says Sripratha Murali Krishnan, a budding poet, storyteller and college student. As more open mics and slam poetry events spring up in the city, first-time and seasoned performers are ready to step out of their comfort zones. Varsha VR, co-founder of Uncalled Knacks, a Chennai-based open mic community says, “At least 57 performances were poetry [open mics] in the last eight months.” Thomas Davis of House of T, another open mic community in Chennai agrees, “It used to be four to eight poets per show. Now, a minimum of 12 to 20 poets perform for eight minutes each.” The outfit also conducted online events during the lockdowns where music and poetry were shared on Zoom. In parallel lines, Vishwas Kenkare Prakash, founder of Do WithLIT, a pan-India open mic creative adds, “At least 10 to 15 poets are eager to perform regularly in every show.” Of which, 40% to 50% are novice poets who perform for the first time. Vishwas says Chennai is a “a fantastic place” for poetry. “Spoken word poetry is growing immensely and there are easily around 60 to 70 poets in the city who regularly perform and more than 1,000 to 2,000 poets in the city eagerly waiting for a stage. We aim to have at least five to six open mics and 10-plus production shows in 2022.” This level of growth gives first-time performers and their audience a chance to explore their art in safe spaces. “Art needs artistes and artistes need an audience. We try to be a bridge between them,” says Varsha. Amplifying emotion Vidhya Rajagopalan, co-founder of the poetry collective Project Prodets, says there has been a visible effort to amplify the city’s artistic voices in the last two years. “In the last two years, we have conducted a lot of workshops — spoken word performance workshop, poetry writing and editing workshops, poetry appreciation workshops to help people make better use of their time,” says Michelle Ann James of Mockingbirds, Chennai’s first spoken word poetry collective, active since 2015. These events try to break free of convention and encourage artistes and their audience to come together to explore relatable experiences and find a shared sense of comfort and empathy. “I am an introvert. Performance and slam poetry is one way to get over that introversion. Being an introvert is not a bad thing but being a social introvert is having the best of both worlds. This is why I perform my poetry,” says Harrinei Kumaravel, poet and storyteller. Moreover, spoken word poetry does not fall into the realm of public speaking as the performance is part of the poem and thus cannot be dictated. Now, someone with a soft voice and simple things to say also has an opportunity to grab the mic. “We still have book-reading poets who write their content but still read it off pages. There are a few performing poets too. It is beautiful to listen to them because raw emotions are put out, through the entire piece,” says Thomas, founder of House of T. Though the community is growing, the city can pick up the pace, says Michelle. She adds, “We don’t lack performers but it is a lack of understanding. We don’t have large-scale literary festivals which is sad. But people have been seeking art in the last two years more than ever, which is a success.” The collectives can be reached at: uncalledknacks@gmail.com , wesayhi@dowithlit.com, projectxprodets@gmail.com, projectmockingbirds@gmail.com  Coming up||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/dont-drop-the-mic/article38140981.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:42 IST,||An abundance of time, lost||Alvin Presley has been making music in English, Tamil and Hindi for years. His first in 2022, is the latter, for reasons that had nothing to do with conscious decision. “Sometimes, it’s the words that come to me; at other times it’s the melody. I never decide in advance that I have to write a song in Tamil or Hindi or any particular language,” says the Chennai-based musician in a conversation about ‘Dil Ke Dairon Pe’, the first of his Hindi numbers to release. A blend of lilting melody and pensive lyrics, the pop number is a message from Alvin to himself: a reminder to take a moment to pause and re-orient. He elaborates, “I was in a very weird mental state when I wrote this; the whole year had me fatigued. These words reflect how far I was buried in my thoughts, and it tells me to pause and stabilise. Like many other people, 2021 was a tough year for me. Everybody wanted to do something different; I wanted to do something big too. Then I got COVID, and my plans had to change. I was trying to keep up, but never stopped to take stock of everything I had gone through.”  This is what the song keeps insisting on, with the refrain of “ ruk ja zara ”, as an alternative to the harried panic that many are going through in an attempt to make up for the months and years lost either because of lockdown, COVID or debilitating personal losses.  For all its emphasis on slowing down, the number is one of Alvin’s quickest compositions. “Unlike the other Hindi songs that I play at my gigs, this one was the product of less than 10 days: writing, composition, recording and release,” he says. And despite a number of older, oft-performed songs waiting in the wings, this one took precedence in getting released.  This was not because of the message it holds, but for a purely practical reason: “When people line up my discography according to the time of release, I want them to have a flow. I don’t want it to sound haphazard. I felt that this track would make for a smoother transition after my previous releases. The songs that I will be coming up with next will be more of alternative rock and an indie-pop mixture, different from the electronic-pop mixture I was creating with [previous album] Fall Today ,” says Alvin.  Multiple releases are in the offing this year, says Alvin, adding that he wants to experiment more with genres as well as with music platforms. He gives the example of the website he has collaborated with for his current release. “Audius is a comparatively new platform. They pay the artists better, and they also pay in a cryptocurrency called audio coins. This is an exclusively Audius-first release to start with, and will be available on Spotify, YouTube and all other platforms next week,” he signs off.  The songs that I will be coming up with next will be more of alternative rock and an indie-pop mixture, different from the electronic-pop so far Alvin Presley||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-abundance-of-time-lost/article38140984.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:41 IST,||Vidharth on his 20-year film career, playing a villain in ‘Anbarivu’, and more||It has been 20 years since Vidharth first appeared on the big screen in a blink-and-miss role in Minnale . Ten years since his breakthrough film, Mynaa . Despite the film’s commercial success and the appreciation he got, Vidharth’s career graph did not see a dramatic upward curve.  “I know I am not a star today,” he says, reflecting upon his journey, “But I never wanted to become one.”  That is because Vidharth always wanted to be an actor .   Cinema, for him, was a childhood fascination. His maternal grandfather had appeared in small roles in P Neelakantan’s Or Iravu (written by CN Annadurai) and Krishnan-Panju’s famous Parasakthi (written by M Karunanidhi) in which Sivaji Ganesan made his debut. He wanted Vidharth to be in the films too. When he liked a character in a film, he would address Vidharth by the character’s name. Vidharth, by now, was a constant presence in his school plays.   In the late ‘90s, he came to Chennai to be in films and Minnale happened within a few years.  “I was happy. But I knew that I did not come to Chennai to do just this. I felt I did not have the talent to be in films. I told myself, ‘Either you leave films or get trained and be a proper actor.’ That’s how I joined Koothu-P-Pattarai.” The popular Chennai acting school taught him about movies and life. “I have seen some phenomenal actors there. For example, there is a senior actor called Murugan. He would not even be the protagonist of the play but whenever he was on stage, he was a star. But the next morning, you would see him in a tea shop, almost inconspicuous. That’s when I learnt that more than talent, it is about the opportunities you get and what you do with them.” Stardom, Vidharth says, is fleeting. “Despite being in films, I have never felt like a star. My only desire is to be a part of good films.” Upcoming projects  After the success of Mynaa , Vidharth kept signing films. But one flop followed another. At one point, he asked himself what kind of films he wanted to do. The result of that reflection was M Manikandan’s Kuttrame Thandanai , in which he plays a man suffering from tunnel vision. “Though it did not make a lot of money, it earned me great respect. I would split my career into before and after Kuttrame Thandanai .”   Vidharth has eight films lined up for release. First up among them will be Anbarivu, which will stream on Disney+Hotstar from this Friday. Starring ‘Hip Hop Tamizha’ Adhi, Vidharth plays the antagonist.  “I was not keen on playing a villain in a commercial film. But Pon Parthiban, the dialogue writer of the film, told me the character was written for me. After the narration, I told him, ‘I would not have chosen myself for this role if I was the writer.’ He saw something in me that I did not.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/vidharth-on-his-20-year-film-career-playing-a-villain-in-anbarivu-and-more/article38140969.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 03:43 IST,||Learning to fly||Kalou’s circus classes are adventurous. But finding her school is an adventure in itself. Eluciole Circus, started by Kalou in 2012, is a circus school tucked away in the lush forests of Auroville. Google Maps is not your ally here. And after a point, beefy, four-wheeled vehicles too protest as the wooded lanes get narrower, until they can be manoeuvred only on foot. And therein lies the charm. A 10-metre high dome peeps from a canopy of trees. Inside the 12-pillared school, students aged five and above, stretch before they end up looking like malleable metal figurines. Some touch their nose to their knees, while others suspend themselves from thick purple cloths and cascade like a delicate waterfall. There is grace, balance, control and in the centre of it all, enviable abs. Each session is about two hours long. Before the pandemic hit, schools from Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai would visit this centre to experience the basics of circus. During the pandemic Kalou says she noticed more people taking an interest in their own bodies and wanting to learn certain skills from her. But these are experiences that cannot be imparted virtually, she believes. The circus school teaches acro yoga, juggling, hula hoop, acrobatics and aerial acts such as trapeze and tightrope walking. “These acts help develop all the muscles and the practitioner learns how to use these muscles. The body becomes supple, flexible and the body’s endurance and capacity to adapt are tested,” explains Kalou who moved to Auroville from France in 1998. After dabbling in theatre for a few years in Paris, Kalou found herself drawn to adrenaline-pumping acts like fire dancing. At 25, she joined a professional circus company and travelled the world performing fire dance, an act she perfected over 15 years. “At the age of 46 I started performing aerial acrobatics. I am 55 now,” she smiles, doing an effortless split as she levitates mid air with the support of a cloth.  In her initial years in India, she taught fire performances. “I developed an artform that combines dance, martial arts and acrobatics. Inspired by the mandalas and ancient signs of Tibetan culture, it is a purification ritual dance that celebrates life,” she adds.  Performing these artforms filled Kalou with an inexplicable sensation, an amalgamation of joy, harmony, concentration, love and transformation. She knew this is what she wanted to share with the world. “That’s why I started my circus school: to help people irrespective of age to explore and discover all possibilities of understanding themselves and their bodies at a deeper level,” smiles Kalou.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:15 IST,||On a wing and a prayer||The beginning of the year for us, is the middle of migration season for a number of our winged guests, and a time of important activity for Chennai’s birding community. This is when Chennai’s birders — like others around the country — take stock of both the domestic and migrant bird populations around the city. In a regular year, the month of January would have seen three annual events — the Chennai Bird Race, the Asian Waterbird Census, and the Tamil Nadu Government’s own Synchronised Bird Census — compelling birdwatchers to criss-cross the city’s wetlands, wooded areas and other hotspots in a patient, long-drawn attempt at documenting our avian population. Last year, however, the much-awaited marquee Chennai Bird Race had to be put on hold, while the other two events saw muted, focussed participation by a few long-term birders. This year, however, the Madras Naturalists Society (MNS) dares to hope for a little bit more despite a looming wave. G. Vijay Kumar, honorary secretary, MNS, the organisation behind Madras Bird Race, says: “We are hopeful of holding the HSBC Chennai Bird Race this year. Though the event is usually held in January for better sightings, there is no rule as such. It is in the migration period between December and February that you have some choice when you go out in the field. You don’t have to restrict yourself to woodland birds.” There are numbers to back this statement. For instance, when the last public Chennai Bird Race was held in 2020, some 30-odd teams of participants had in total spotted 171 bird species in the city. At least four teams had spotted upwards of 100 species each, states Kumar, adding, “The ‘bird of the day’ was the grey wagtail sighted at Semmenchery. Other notable sightings were white wagtail, Asian pied starling and Pallas’s grasshopper warbler at Pallikaranai Marsh, and the southern grey shrike at Perumbakkam Tank.” And these are just some of the wetland birds; Chennai also has a sizeable number of woodland birds who populated its urban treetops through the year. While Chennai Bird Race — one of many separate bird races sponsored by HSBC around the country — is entirely organised by Chennai’s fraternity, the society is also a part of a larger, concentrated effort to track the avian populations of bigger regions. The Asian Waterbird Census (AWC), for instance, was first held in 1987, and today covers about 26 countries along both the East-Asian Australasian Flyway, as well as a large part of the Central Asian Flyway. It is a massive citizen science effort, and depends on both amateurs and experts who put in tremendous legwork out of their own volition. In our part of the map in 2021, the State co-ordinator for the census was K.V. Sudhakar, a key member of MNS. At the forefront Sudhakar says, “The AWC is part of a concentrated effort by the Asian Wetland Bureau, and has been going on since the 1980s in Tamil Nadu. MNS member Dr. V. Shantaram had pioneered waterfowl censuses in Tamil Nadu, along with C. Teronno from Puducherry. Tamil Nadu has always been at the forefront of such initiatives, since the State has one of the highest coverage of wetlands in the country, after Maharashtra and Gujarat.” Like last year, this year’s efforts on ground are also spearheaded by multiple researchers stationed in Salem, Tiruchi and other parts of the State, says Sudhakar. While foot soldiers across Tamil Nadu submitted a total of 150 species for review in 2021, the final figures “are still being compiled by AWC,” he states. He adds, “Earlier, the Bombay Natural History Society used to be the national coordinator but now, birders can just record their observations on eBird, which makes it easier. We had requested participants of the Pongal Bird Count to also contribute; these initiatives require coordination.” Is the effort worth it? The birders are convinced in the affirmative: their observations not only help track populations and shifting migration patterns of species across the region, but are also an excuse to feel connected to the natural world again. As Sudhakar points this out, he speedily lists out the native waterfowl of his homeland: “Pelicans, painted storks, herons, egrets. The migrants include ducks, sandpipers, and plovers. We never used to see flamingos in Chennai; they were usually spotted only in Pulicat. Only in the last few years are they beginning to be sighted here: changes like these are important to note.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-a-wing-and-a-prayer/article38141413.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:14 IST,||Rise of the content head in fashion||“The January 2022 issue of VogueIndia ushers in a new era, a new chapter,” begins Megha Kapoor in her first editor’s letter, as she announces a “Vogue Reset” and plans to lead the magazine in a new direction.  Kapoor is the new head of editorial content at the magazine and her appointment to this role has sparked many conversations on the evolution of fashion journalism in the country. Already on shaky ground after decades of being relegated to the entertainment and party pages, Indian fashion writing, coverage, and reporting didn’t really have much time to develop to its fullest even with the coming of foreign legacy titles in the first decade of the 2000s. Advertisers quickly owned the pages, and monthly magazines rarely, if ever, critiqued collections of products. Then came the slump of the mid-2010s, followed closely by the social media onslaught, and then the COVID-19 pandemic. Not good. It is into this sorry state for print media that Kapoor, 35, steps up to the top job atVogue India, designations notwithstanding. Before moving to Mumbai a few weeks ago, Sydney-based Kapoor’s only connections to India seemed to be an internship atVogue Indiaover a decade ago, and that she is of Indian descent. A graduate of the University of Melbourne, it was her time atVogue Indiathat landed her a stint atVogue Australia’s fashion department. Since then, she has worked as fashion director at the indie Australian publicationOyster Magazine, and foundedInprint,her own luxury fashion glossy, in 2015. Six years later, Kapoor is ready to take charge of one of the youngestVoguesin the world — launched in October 2007,Vogue Indiais just about a year shy of its 15th anniversary. “It is kind of magical for me to be able to engage with India through this opportunity,” she says. “I think one has to be humble enough to [know] what one does and doesn’t understand, and I’m not going to pretend that I get every nuance. That said, there are over 36 million of us who have had the immigrant experience, and that does not make us any less Indian. I have a lot to learn, and I’m excited.” Meeting newer demands Her appointment followsVogue’s parent organisation’s global shakeup—Conde Nast’s reorganisation of the company’s content strategy, leadership teams, and structure. A similar exercise had taken place atThe New York TimesandWall Street Journaljust a few years ago. Gone are the powerful Editors-in-Chief of old; enter the Content Head, a hybrid entity who’s better placed to respond to newer demands from consumers as well as advertisers. The future, says Kapoor, lies in striking a balance between local and global content. “To me, it’s not a dichotomy. With every project I do, I want to ask myself who the audience is, and if we’re reflecting India’s modern and diverse voices.” She mentions the works of modern Indians like photographers Ashish Shah and Bharat Sikka, and adds that while she is loath to criticise what came before, she looks forward to evolving local content, talent, and image making for a platform that’s more 360-degrees in its outlook, and puts India on the world map. “I’m already working to get Indian designers on Vogue Runway [the title’s free app that covers global fashion] to ensure worldwide recognition.” No urban bias? When I ask what she thinks of exploring regional Indian languages, she says she is ready to take on every opportunity to connect with a diverse audience. And while it may take some time before we see fashion magazines offered in Punjabi, Bengali, or Tamil, it’s not as far-fetched a notion as it would have been even a few years ago. She wants to represent all of India, not just Delhi and Mumbai, which is encouraging in its intent. What will be truly interesting to see, though, is how well such developing editorial policies will work when it comes to advertisers, especially luxury brands, who have come to all but own the pages of Indian fashion magazines over the past decade. “There is definitely going to be a shift,” says Kapoor. “There will be more editorial solutions, and we are perhaps not going to be as dictated by brands.” Given Conde Nast’s influence over the magazine market, it is entirely possible that her outlook is quickly adopted across titles — those that still exist, of course.

06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:19 IST,||West Bengal cancels events as COVID-19 cases continue to rise||West Bengal on Wednesday swiftly got into cancellation mode, calling off several events scheduled this month, in an acknowledgement that a possible third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is setting in. The Kolkata International Film Festival, scheduled to be held between January 7 and 14, was “deferred” and a bunch of popular music festivals, including the Dover Lane Music Conference, were also cancelled. Organisers of the Kolkata Book Fair, scheduled to begin on January 31, are waiting for instructions from the State Government. The Calcutta High Court is currently hearing a writ petition seeking the cancellation of the Ganga Sagar Mela that is scheduled to be held in the State’s Sagar island from January 8 to 16. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from across the country attend this festival every year and many of them have already arrived. The court on Wednesday sought the State Government’s response on what it intended to do about the event. Until recently, the State, particularly capital Kolkata, appeared split into two camps: those who took the fresh surge in COVID-19 cases seriously, and those who had dropped guard because the Omicron variant that’s contributing to the surge is considered to be less severe. This, in spite of the State Government announcing a new set of restrictions as the number of cases began to explode. But with the positivity rate now jumping up from 1.5% to 19% in just a span of 10 days and many of those infected reporting symptoms that are not quite mild, panic appears to be slowly setting in. Chartered accountant Praggamoy Dasgupta, who lost his father to the second wave and who himself got infected at the time, has found himself to be COVID-positive once again.  “This time I’ve symptoms unlike last time. Since Monday I had a sore throat and runny nose. I tested yesterday and the report was positive. CT score is 16, compared to 28 the last time. I have a history of travelling to Bhubaneswar in the week gone by; I guess buffet spread in hotels must stop,” Mr. Dasgupta told The Hindu .  Dr. Koushik Chaki of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum — the organisation on Wednesday was made a party in the case related to the Ganga Sagar Mela being heard in the High Court — said the time had come to press the “alert button” and not the “panic button”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/west-bengal-cancels-events-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-rise/article38141440.ece

Along with January 8, a second Saturday, and January 9, a Sunday, each employee will get four days’ leave. But there’s a catch. The employees availing this leave will need to provide photographic proof of having spent time with their parents and in-laws to their senior officers after returning from the special “holiday”. “The State government will open a portal to encourage our officers and staff where they can also upload their pictures with their parents or in-laws. But it is a must that the employees will have to submit the pictures to their superior officer to regularise the leave,” Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. “We want the employees, including Ministers, IAS and IPS officers excluding the Chief Minister, Chief Secretary and DGP, to enjoy this leave,” he said. Mr. Sarma said it would be difficult for the police personnel to avail of the special leave. But a circular has been issued for them to avail it within four months. Economic help “From next year, we will try to give some economic compensation to our lower-ranked employees so that parents can be taken to some pilgrim or some tourist destinations. These are small ways of going back to our rich Indian culture and tradition,” the Chief Minister said. The leave, however, is not for the members of the police battalions as they get a month’s special leave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-govt-staff-given-meet-parents-leave/article38141426.ece

Online classes would however continue. Examinations would also be held online, the State’s Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant announced on Wednesday. “We held a meeting with vice-chancellors of all the universities, Collectors and divisional commissioners to discuss the situation. We reviewed the COVID-19 situation and the timetable of examinations to be held. The Chief Minister has directed us to take a decision keeping the welfare of students at the centre and based on that we have decided to discontinue physical classes till February 15,” said Mr. Samant. He said the university administration had been directed to ensure that students did not suffer due to issues such as lack of connectivity or power failure. Gondwana, Jalgaon and Nanded universities had reported connectivity issues, which would be resolved after discussions with the Collectors concerned. Mr. Samant said university hostels would also be closed after notice in advance. “Hostels for foreign students doing research and PhD, however, will continue to remain open as these students cannot go back to their native country due to visa issues.” All universities and colleges had also been advised to start helplines to sort out problems faced by students. “Vaccination data of students should be given to Collectors and special camps must be organised for students who have not yet taken the vaccines. Our priority is to restart physical classes from February 15. For that, every non-teaching staff also should get vaccinated at the earliest,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/maharashtra-colleges-to-close-till-feb-15/article38141434.ece
06 January 2022||January 06 2022 06:18 IST,||Former MP, 2 others booked on ‘provoking to cause riots’ charge||A First Information Report has been registered against former Rajya Sabha MP Mohammad Adeeb along with two others on charges of provoking with an intent to cause rioting based on the complaint of a right-wing outfit leader. Mufti Mohammad Saleem Qasmi, president, Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind, Gurugram, and Maulana Abdul Hasim Kasmi have also been named in the case. According to the FIR, the trio planned to grab a plot belonging to an individual and a piece of land in Jharsa village earmarked for a market by Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran to build mosque. The complainant, Dinesh Bharti, founder, Bharat Mata Vahini, also alleged that the accused had plans to incite riots with foreign funding.  Mr. Adeeb, speaking to The Hindu , said he was “shocked” to learn that a case was registered against him on charges of instigating violence and stressed that allegations against him were “baseless”. He said the police did not carry out any preliminary investigation before the registration of the case and the complainant himself had been facing criminal charges for disrupting Namaz in the open. Mr. Adeeb said he would take up the matter with the local administration.  The former Member of Parliament had recently moved the Supreme Court to initiate contempt action against Haryana authorities for not reining in “hooligans” who have created an atmosphere of communal hatred and terror for worshippers offering Friday prayers in Gurugram. He said the action against him was an act of vindictiveness. Mr. Qasmi said he was “surprised” at the police action. “We gave a complaint against three right-wing leaders for trying to create communal tension with evidence, but the police did not take any action. But a case was registered against us without any evidence,” said Mr. Qasmi.

Mr. Tope was speaking after an emergency review meeting chaired by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday morning at the Mantralaya in Mumbai which was attended by senior authorities. “We [the State government] are not going to use the vocabulary of a ‘lockdown’ right now and there is no pressing need of it as well. A lockdown means total shutting of all activities which we are not going to do. However, the challenge at the moment is to make sure that the restrictions already announced be implemented properly,” said the Health Minister. Mr. Tope, nonetheless, said that if cases kept on soaring in this fashion, then the State government was likely to take a decision soon on curtailing non-essential activities where crowding was observed. Maharashtra has been witnessing an alarming spike in fresh COVID-19 infections since the past few days, with the total number of active cases surging above 66,000 from a mere 7,000 a fortnight ago. Mr. Tope said that while there were indications of a ‘community spread’ in this ‘third wave’ of the pandemic, he said that the heartening aspect was that a significant majority of the Omicron variant cases were mild and not requiring oxygen. “The daily case surge is likely to exceed 25,000 cases today. However, the good part is that 90% of the new infections are either asymptomatic or mild in nature. Hence, we are laying stress on home quarantine in this third wave of the pandemic,” he said. Quarantine period The Health Minister informed that given the confusion over the proper definition of the quarantine period, it was decided at the meeting to keep the duration for seven days followed by an RT-PCR test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/no-immediate-need-for-lockdown-in-maharashtra-health-minister/article38141423.ece

Everyone should get vaccines,” said Brahmadev Mandal, 84, from Orai village under the Puraini police station of Udakishunganj block. In a viral video, Mr. Mandal, a retired postal department employee, claimed that he took his first vaccine on February 13, 2021 and the last on December 30 at the public health centres (PHCs) of Madhepura, Khagaria and Bhagalpur districts. Mr. Mandal has even jotted down on a piece of paper the time, dates and places where he took the shots. He allegedly used his Aadhaar card and phone number eight times and his voter ID card and wife’s phone number on the other occasions.  “It’s a matter of investigation and only after that anything can be said on this,” said Madhepura civil surgeon Amarendra Pratap Shahi. However, a Health Department official in Patna told The Hindu on condition of anonymity that “systems at offline camps can be cheated for jabs”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/octogenarian-claims-to-have-taken-11-covid-jabs/article38141430.ece
