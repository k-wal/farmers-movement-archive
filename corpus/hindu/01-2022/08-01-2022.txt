The court also upheld the 27% reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 10% for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in the All India Quota (AIQ) seats in accordance with a July 29, 2021 government order. There would be no further debate on this aspect. The Rs. 8 lakh gross annual family income limit criterion for identifying the EWS, as originally notified by a January 2019 official memorandum and recommended for retention by the government-appointed former Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey-led Expert Committee on December 31, 2021, would be now implemented for the admission year 2021-2022. The question of the validity of the EWS criteria, including the Rs. 8 lakh income threshold, which have to be implemented in this year’s NEET counselling so as not to upset medical admissions for 2021-2022, would be heard finally and decided upon by the Supreme Court in March third week, a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and A.S. Bopanna noted in its interim order. After pronouncing it, Justice Chandrachud clarified orally to the parties that “we have upheld the constitutional validity of the 27% reservation for the OBCs. On the EWS criteria, we have said for this year, the criteria which was notified earlier [January 2019] shall continue to operate to ensure that the admission process for this year shall not be dislocated”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/neet-counselling-can-begin-under-existing-ews-criteria-sc/article38182420.ece

Almost one year ago, the elephant, an adult tusker, known locally as ‘Ronaldo’ or ‘S.I.’ died from the injuries he suffered after three men, including two brothers running a resort-cum-residence in the buffer zone, hurled a burning object at the elephant, that got stuck around its head, leading to it sustaining severe burn injuries. After almost a week after it suffered the injuries, the elephant, believed to be around 40 years old and one of the largest tuskers in the landscape, died from its injuries while being taken by the Forest Department to the Theppakadu Elephant Camp for treatment. Following his death, a video surfaced of three men hurling a burning object at the animal when it approached their house in search of food. The police arrested two men – M. Raymond Dean, 28, from Mavanallah and S. Prasath, 36, from Masinagudi. However, Raymond’s brother, M. Ricky Rayan, 31, went absconding soon after the incident. While both Raymond Dean and Prasath were booked under the Goondas Act, Rayan has remained untraceable for the last one year.  Speaking to The Hindu , Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone), P. Arunkumar, said that a special team of Forest Department officials, led by the Singara Forest Range Officer has been formed to track and apprehend Ricky Rayan. He said that concerted efforts will be undertaken to ensure that the accused is arrested.  Officials said that Rayan had also failed to appear in court multiple times and that he has been given time to appear in relation to the case, failing which a non-bailable warrant would be issued for his arrest. Rayan is also not believed to be living in the Nilgiris, and could have fled to a neighbouring district, officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/forest-dept-forms-special-team-to-nab-accused-in-elephant-death-case/article38182531.ece

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana orally asked Punjab and the Centre to meanwhile put on hold the enquiries of its respective committees till Monday, the next date of hearing. The Prime Minister’s motorcade was stranded on a flyover in Punjab for 15 to 20 minutes. The incident created a furious exchange of accusations in public fora and developed into a political fistfight. A petition was filed in the Supreme Court accusing the Punjab police of “connivance”. It claimed the incident posed the “single biggest lapse in security of any Indian Prime Minister in recent years”. Terrorism angle On Friday, appearing before the Bench, the Centre joined with petitioner NGO Lawyer’s Voice and expressed suspicions about the security lapse having a “potential cross-border terrorism” angle. It submitted that prior to the Prime Minister’s visit, a banned organisation abroad published a video exhorting people to certain acts. It said the presence of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the investigation was essential. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the event could be pegged as “rarest of rare” as it could have unfolded into an “international embarrassment” for India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/get-pms-security-records-sc-tells-hc/article38182422.ece

The Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) registration is mandatory to receive foreign donations. Debate in U.K. House The move comes just days after the Ministry issued a statement that the FCRA registration of the MoC was not renewed as “some adverse inputs were noticed.” The registration was renewed, making MoC eligible to receive and utilise foreign funds in its bank accounts even as the U.K Parliament debated the issue, seeking to know if the British government had raised the issue of blocking of overseas funds of the MoC and other non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with India. On Friday, the MoC was removed from the list of around 6,000 NGOs whose registration has ceased to exist. The NGO with the registration number-147120001 was included in the list of 16,908 NGOs whose FCRA registration is active as on January 7. There are 1,030 NGOs eligible to receive foreign donations in West Bengal and the MoC was added to the list. The registration of nearly 6,000 NGOs ceased to operate from January 1 as the MHA refused to renew their application or the NGOs did not apply for renewal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fcra-nod-for-missionaries-of-charity-restored/article38182423.ece

Stalin on Friday told the Assembly that the State government would allocate Rs. 1,000 crore in the first phase to implement the recommendations of the flood mitigation panel, headed by V. Thirupugazh, to prevent Chennai and its neighbouring areas from being flooded during the monsoon. “The government is particular that there should not be even a little suffering to people in the next monsoon,” he said in reply to the debate on the Governor’s address to the House. ‘Not in Chennai’ Mr. Stalin said he was not in Chennai when the city witnessed heavy rain, but rushed to the flood affected areas on return. “It was an unprecedented rain in the last 50 years and all the lakes supplying water to the city overflowed. We averted the damage and saved lives and property by releasing water from the waterbodies [on time],” he said. The Chief Minister said that instead of waiting for an allocation from the National Disaster Response Fund, the State government allotted Rs. 801 crore to expedite the relief work. “We also appointed a panel under the leadership of Mr. Thirupugazh to advise the government on flood mitigation. Based on its recommendations, work will be carried out by the Departments of Municipal Administration, Water Resources and Highways at a cost of Rs. 1,000 crore in the first phase,” he said.  Mr. Stalin said former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had no locus standi to criticise the DMK government since it was the AIADMK government that had opened the Chembarambakkam reservoir at night without issuing any warning and flooded the city.  Deaths reported “Hundreds died and a lot of houses and huts submerged in the water. People lost their belongings and Tamils became refugees in their own soil. Newspaper called it as a man-made disaster. What the government offered in relief was paltry. They advertised Chennai as a smart city, but how they worked smartly was known to everyone,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-1000-cr-to-prevent-floods-in-chennai/article38182483.ece

Public health experts maintain cautious optimism that given the high background vaccination rate in the State, hospitalisations would not surge. Yet they warn that there is no room for complacency and appeal to the people to stay away from crowded places and to wear a good quality and well-fitted mask to prevent themselves from getting infected. The State reported 5,296 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday when 64,577 samples were tested in the past 24 hours. The test positivity rate has risen to 8.2%.

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:19 IST,||Police in hot pursuit of TRS MLA’s son||Amid growing demand from various quarters to speed up investigation into a previous case of abetment to suicide of a financier pending against Vanama Raghava in Paloncha town, the police expedited probe into the last year’s case pending against him. A notice was put up outside the residence of Raghava, son of Kothagudem MLA Vanama Venkateshwara Rao, in old Paloncha town on Thursday midnight. In the notice Raghava, an accused in a case of abetment of suicide of a Paloncha-based financier Venkateshwarlu in July last year, was summoned to report before the investigating officer (Manuguru ASP) at 12.30 pm on Friday in connection with the probe into the case relating to Cr No: 268/2021 U/s 306 of the IPC at Paloncha police station. However, he did not turn up before the investigating officer. Raghavendra is in the eye of the storm following serious allegations of abetting a debt-ridden businessman Ramakrishna to commit suicide along with his wife and two daughters in Old Paloncha on Monday. Ramakrishna’s selfie video, in which he squarely blamed Raghava for driving him to take the extreme decision unable to digest his "ulterior motives" targeting his wife, sparked public outcry. The anger over the alleged involvement of Raghava in the shocking suicide case spilled onto the streets with the JAC of the Opposition parties and a clutch of women’s organisations observing a bandh in Kothagudem constituency on Friday to press for harshest punishment to the accused. The demonstrators expressed their dismay over the delay in arresting the accused even four days after the shocking incident and called for a thorough investigation into all the cases pending against the tainted politician to ensure a harsh punishment. Sources, however, said that he remained untraced till reports last came in on Friday night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-in-hot-pursuit-of-trs-mlas-son/article38183122.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:54 IST,||NSO estimates FY22 GDP growth at 9.2%||India’s gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 9.2% in the current financial year following last fiscal’s 7.3% contraction, the National Statistical Office (NSO) said in its first advance estimates of economic output released on Friday, amid concerns over the likely impact of a third wave of the COVID pandemic. The NSO, however, made clear that these were “early projections” that did not factor in actual performance of various indicators as well as measures that may be taken to contain the spread of COVID-19. “GDP at constant prices (2011-12) in the year 2021-22 is estimated at Rs. 147.54 lakh crore, as against the provisional estimate of GDP for the year 2020-21 of Rs. 135.13 lakh crore,” the NSO said, adding that growth in real GDP is pegged at 9.2%. “Real GVA at Basic Prices is estimated at Rs. 135.22 lakh crore in 2021-22, as against Rs. 124.53 lakh crore in 2020-21, showing a growth of 8.6%,” it added. “The implicit GDP growth of 5.6% for H2 FY2022 built in by the NSO may not fully factor in the admittedly evolving impact of Omicron,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA Ltd. “Our sense is that after a 6.0-6.5% rise in Q3 FY2022, the GDP expansion is set to slip below 5% in the ongoing quarter,” she added. Mining spurt The NSO’s GVA estimates show the mining sector outpacing others with growth of 14.3% following last year’s 8.5% contraction, followed by manufacturing which is seen expanding by 12.5% after shrinking 7.2% in the previous 12-month period. Agriculture sector is estimated to grow at 3.9% in FY22 (3.6%). The electricity, water supply and other utility services category is estimated to grow at 8.5% (1.9%), while construction is expected to grow 10.7% (-8.6%) and trade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting services are projected to grow at 11.9% against a sharp contraction of 18.2% last year. “Compared to the pre-COVID performance of FY2020, the advance estimates project an anaemic rise of 1.3% and 1.9%, respectively, for GDP and GVA in FY2022,” Ms. Nayar said. “These estimates have utilised available information up to the months ranging from September to December 2021,” said D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor, EY India. “As such, the likely adverse impact of COVID's third wave on the economy may not have been fully incorporated in these estimates. It is possible that another 20 basis points of growth may be shaved off from 2021-22 growth by the time the second advance estimates become available,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nso-estimates-fy22-gdp-growth-at-92/article38182425.ece

Passing a slew of instructions to the government while hearing a batch of PIL and writ petitions connected to COVID-19, a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili said coronavirus diagnostic tests should be conducted on massive scale. With regard to tests, focus should be on airports, bus stations and railway stations. The bench made it clear that the ban on public gatherings should be enforced irrespective of caste, creed, religion and political affiliation. Authorities should ensure vendors and people at weekly vegetable markets, grocery stores and other bazaars wore masks and used sanitisers. Everyone visiting these places should comply with all COVID-related guidelines like maintaining social distance, the bench said. Operators of malls and movie theatres should take steps to ensure there was no congestion and social distancing was adhered to.

Within a gap of five years, the employees got an opportunity to serve for four years more, if their retirement age were to be 58 years. About five years ago, the previous government raised the retirement age from 58 to 60. In November 2017, the A.P. Legislative Assembly passed the Bill amending the AP Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) Act, 1984, enhancing retirement age of government employees to 60 years from 58. Then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu moved the amendment Bill in the House and requested members to adopt it unanimously. The retirement age was revised in 2017 after a gap of many decades. A lot of hullabaloo took place in 1983 when then Chief Minister of combined Andhra Pradesh N.T. Rama Rao attempted to lower the retirement age to 55 years from 58 years then. More than half the State’s six lakh employees went on an indefinite strike compelling the government to roll back its decision. The then Chief Minister of combined A.P. Marri Channa Reddy raised the limit from 55 to 58 in 1979. Increasing the retirement age would play a key role in ensuring the viability of pension systems. Again, the cash-starved government can postpone the payment of retirement benefits to the employees. A good number of employees, including some of the leaders of the associations, are slated to retire this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/from-58-to-62-in-less-than-five-years/article38183160.ece

Meanwhile, the Punjab Government submitted a report to the Centre saying an FIR had been registered in the matter. The Prime Minister’s convoy was stranded on a flyover due to the blockade, after which he returned from the poll-bound State without attending any event, including a rally. The three-member committee, constituted by the Union Home Ministry on Thursday, sought all the details regarding the sequence of events that unfolded during Mr. Modi’s January 5 visit, sources said. ‘No security lapse’ The Punjab Government has maintained there was no security lapse. On Thursday, it had announced a two-member panel to investigate the matter. It had been asked to submit its report in three days. The Punjab Police has also registered an FIR in Ferozepur against nearly 150 unidentified protesters who blocked Mr. Modi’s cavalcade on Wednesday. Amid foggy weather conditions, the three-member Central team visited the Pyarayana flyover near Ferozepur on Friday morning and interacted with senior Punjab Police and civil administration officials. The team is led by Sudhir Kumar Saxena, Secretary (Security), Cabinet Secretariat, and has Balbir Singh, Joint Director of the Intelligence Bureau, and S Suresh, IG, Special Protection Group as members. It spent around 45 minutes at the flyover before heading to the BSF sector headquarters for further questioning and investigation. At the BSF sector headquarters in Ferozepur, which is around 10 km from where the incident took place on National Highway 5, the Central team remained closeted with the senior civil and police officers who were directly responsible for ensuring the smooth passage of the Prime Minister’s convoy and its foolproof security. The Centre has advised the committee to submit its report at the earliest.

The bridge under construction connects the north and south banks of Pangong Lake, and officials said it would bolster Chinese capabilities to move troops and equipment between its garrisons on the two sides. The construction, officials said, was around 25 km on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “This bridge is being constructed in areas that have been under the illegal occupation by China for around 60 years now,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday, adding that New Delhi was “monitoring this activity closely”. India sees China as occupying at least 38,000 sq km in Aksai Chin. “India has never accepted such illegal occupation,” he said. “Separately, government has been taking all necessary steps to ensure that our security interests are fully protected. As part of these efforts, government has also, during the last seven years, increased significantly the budget for development of border infrastructure and completed more roads and bridges than ever before.” Asked about India’s comment on China’s “illegal occupation” at a daily press briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said he was “not aware of the situation”, but defended the construction. “I want to stress that China’s infrastructure construction on its territory entirely falls within its sovereignty,” he said, “and is aimed at safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and security as well as peace and stability in the China-India border area.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-defends-construction-says-it-is-within-its-sovereignty/article38182002.ece

Raj Kumari Bishnoi, Niraj’s mother, said her son was only close to her. Growing up, he never liked to interact with people or enjoy festivals. “Niraj didn’t have friends. He never liked any festival, was never excited about any,” she said. He also never liked to use his mobile phone a lot, she observed. He, however, was hooked to his laptop. “He was working on projects and assignments, he would say. I am an uneducated woman, so I never asked anything further,” she said. The family lives in Jorhat in Assam. ‘Buried in his books’ Niraj’s father, Dasrath Bishnoi, who runs a grocery store, said Niraj would barely talk to him and maintain his distance. “He was buried in his books all the time. That’s all he knew. He scored 86% in Class 10 and 82% in Class 12. He never took any tuition throughout and studied all by himself,” he said. “Never in this lifetime could we think that this would happen to us. Our house is filled with gloom,” the father said. Recalling the day the police came, Ms. Raj Kumari said she did not understand what was happening, but later the police questioned their elder daughter who is pursuing an MSc. “Then they asked Niraj questions. He said that he had created the application but didn’t use it,” the mother said. The parents asserted that Niraj never shared ill feeling against any community or women in general. The worried father asked, “His life is ruined, isn’t it? There’s no chance of bail, right?” They said that he wanted to become a software developer and eventually move abroad to work for tech giants. A second-year BTech student of a private engineering college in Bhopal, Niraj was arrested by Delhi Police from his residence on Thursday for creating the app. Suspended from college An official from the institution said he was suspended following his arrest. “Soon after we got information through the media and later through the Sehore police [about his arrest], we suspended Niraj from the college. The management will take further action depending on more details that emerge,” the official said.  Never in this lifetime could we think that this would happen to us.

The 26-second clip showed the Prime Minister’s vehicle being greeted with cheers of Modi Zindabad by a group of people who were on a parallel carriage way of the flyover where his convoy had stopped due to blockade by protesting farmers.  “Modi ji, isn’t this proof that you tried to defame the people of Punjab and Congress CM [Chief Minister] @CHARANJITCHANNI’s Govt? The only threat to PM and the nation’s security are BJP workers?” the veteran Congress leader posted on Twitter. The Congress has been claiming that even though the Prime Minister’s motorcade was stranded for 15-20 minutes while travelling by road to the Hussainiwala Martyr’s Memorial on Wednesday, there was “no security threat” and the protesters were nowhere near Mr. Modi’s convoy. “Any other PM would be focused on serious national security lapses in #PangongTso and Arunachal Pradesh. But for the first time in 70 years, a Prime Minister is worried about security threat from his own party workers?” the LoP said in another tweet. Meanwhile, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who has not commented on the security breach of the Prime Minister’s convoy in Congress-ruled Punjab, also chose to target the Prime Minister on China. “What has been happening at our borders is a major lapse of national security. Will the PM ever talk about it? #PangongTso #China,” asked Mr. Gandhi in a tweet, referring to the media reports of China building a bridge connecting the north and south banks of the Pangong Lake. The Congress leadership countered the BJP’s allegation of a major security lapse with examples of how former Congress prime ministers like Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi handled security threats and protests during their time. Senior leaders shared Whatsapp forward of a two-minute video clip of October 2, 1986 in which gun shots could be heard when late Rajiv Gandhi, was at Rajghat, Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial. When a reporter in the footage, taken by the news agency AP, asks the former Prime Minister about his well-being, he replied, “Absolutely, there is no problem at all”. Leaders also shared photos of an incident from 1967 when Indira Gandhi was hit by a stone and injured on her nose at an election rally in Odisha but finished her address.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-posts-clip-showing-bjp-cadre-on-flyover/article38181996.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:55 IST,||Rampant poaching in Odisha indicates massive network in operation||The Special Task Force (STF) of Odisha Police’s Crime Branch has seized four leopard skins in the past ten days, and 25 since 2020. The seizures made by the STF alone indicate multiple big networks of wildlife laws offenders may be operating in the State’s forests. If the State Forest and Environment Department’s seizures are taken into account, the number of leopards killed, and the average numbers poached, would be significantly higher. In October 2021, the Odisha Forest and Environment Department confiscated nine leopard skins in one case in Kalahandi. According to the STF, a special drive against wildlife criminals and poachers was launched in 2020. Apart from 25 leopard skins, the agency has seized 13 elephant tusks, seven deerskins, nine live pangolins, more than 16 kg of pangolin scales, and arrested 55 persons on charges of crimes against wildlife. “On the basis of reliable information, an STF team conducted a search with the help of Deogarh forest officials on NH 49 near Telibani in Deogarh district on January 6, as a result of which one wildlife offender, identified as Madan Kumar Jayapura, was apprehended. During the search, one leopard skin, one elephant tusk and 1.770 kg pangolin scales and other incriminating articles were recovered from his possession,” the agency said. On December 29, one leopard skin was recovered from an offender. On January 5, two criminals were arrested and two leopard skins and other incriminating articles recovered from their possession. The leopard skins were sent to the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun for chemical examination. “Of late, both the STF and the Forest Department has been working in a coordinated manner and on a mission mode. The result is evident. The frequent seizures of leopard skins will have an impact on criminals in the future,” said Jai Narayan Pankaj, Deputy Inspector General of Police, STF. But activists allege that the majority of wildlife crimes involving the poaching of leopards and elephants have gone undetected in the past few years. Biswajit Mohanty, secretary, Wildlife Society of Odisha, an environmental pressure group, said, “The State has become a graveyard of wild animals. The leopard skins seized in last couple of years are just the tip of the iceberg. Criminals are operating with impunity.” “Though there have been seizures and criminals have been caught red-handed, rarely have the cases ended in a conviction. Probably one conviction has been achieved in the past decade,” Mr. Mohanty said, adding that law enforcement agencies should make “watertight cases” to instil fear in the minds of wildlife criminals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rampant-poaching-in-odisha-indicate-massive-network-in-operation/article38182357.ece

The letter to Mr. Modi, signed by BMS general secretary Binoy Kumar Sinha, said that BMS would be willing to discuss the issues if the government calls for a dialogue, but “if the government doesn’t step away from the corrupt bureaucracy and vested interest advisors, we will without any seed of doubt, take the road of agitation and protests”. While appreciating the Centre’s efforts to revive BSNL-MTNL, the BMS said it was critical of the strategic sale of PSUs, merger of banks, IPO in insurance sector and corporatisation of defence, railways.

Separately, the Congress urged the Supreme Court to take note of news report on Tek Fog app, and have it examined by the expert panel that’s already looking into the alleged use of the Pegasus spyware on some Indian citizens.  A report on news portal, The Wire, had alleged that people associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party’s IT cell were purportedly using the app to take control of inactive WhatsApp accounts, send messages to frequently contacted numbers, and “hijack” trending topics on social media platforms.  Referring to the report, Mr. O’Brien wrote to Congress leader Anand Sharma, who heads the parliamentary panel on Home Affairs, to convene a meeting on the issue of “hijacking and manipulating” social media trends. In his letter, Mr. O’Brien wrote, “The existence and usage of manipulative technologies like Tek Fog is a severe danger to national and citizens’ security...

Arora on Friday, adding that Covaxin, which is being given to children between 15-18 years in India, is safe and backed by science and data. “So far over 1.6 crore children have been vaccinated and we have seen local pain as the most common adverse reaction. Painkillers are given only on doctor’s advice. Parents are advised to ensure that children don’t go on an empty stomach to get vaccinated. Also they must wait in the healthcare facility for 30 minutes after the vaccination to ensure that any adverse reaction is immediately addressed,” he said. Doctors have also advised that in case of any adverse reactions including allergic reaction, itching at site of injection within 2 to 12 hours of vaccination etc., should be monitored and reported to the nearest health care centre. “Under no circumstance should self-medication be encouraged,” said Dr. Arora. No to self-medication Doctors also advise that teenagers receiving COVID vaccines should not take paracetamol without consultation. The caution comes amid growing concerns that some immunisation centres are advising children to take three 500 mg paracetamol tablets after receiving the COVID vaccine. “Paracetamol is not recommended as prophylaxis, before and after any COVID vaccination as we don’t know how it alters the immune response of the vaccine. A low-grade fever, muscle ache, lethargy, headache, soreness at the injection site is common in the first 2 days after vaccination, which usually subsides on its own, without any medication. However, if the fever persists or the intensity increases then paracetamol or other painkiller is advised after consultation with a physician,” said Dr. Akshay Budhraja, senior consultant, Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Aakash Healthcare. “Giving paracetamol to children (15-18 years old) who are receiving COVID vaccines is not recommended because it has the potential to cause hepatotoxicity (liver damage caused by drug exposure) in them,” added Dr. Col.Vijay Dutta, senior consultant - Internal Medicine, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fewer-adverse-reactions-seen-among-teenagers-says-ntagi/article38182359.ece

Deputy CM says his bond with Adityanath is unbreakable||Amid a perception of differences between them over the question of leadership ahead of 2022 Assembly polls, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has said that his relationship with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is “so strong” that “no force in the world can break it”. Those raising questions over their relationship were naive, Mr. Maurya said in response to a question at a two-day conclave on the State election hosted by Doordarshan on Friday. Ever since the BJP came to power, with Mr. Adityanath nominated for the Chief Minister’s post by the central leadership, there has been a constant discussion on the uneasy relationship Mr. Maurya shared with him. On various platforms, the opposition parties, especially the Samajwadi Party (SP), have tried to project that Mr. Maurya was insulted and sidelined by the Adityanath-led government. Belonging to the OBC Kushwaha/Maurya community, Mr. Maurya’s elevation, first as State BJP chief, was part of the BJP’s larger strategy to consolidate the non-Yadav OBC votes ahead of the 2017 election. Akhilesh’s barb However, many of his supporters had expected he would sooner or later be projected as the chief minister face. After Mr. Adityanath was chosen, SP president Akhilesh Yadav often used it to mock Mr. Maurya saying that the BJP used the OBC votes to come to power on anti-Yadav sentiment but was not willing to elevate a leader from the community to the top post in the State. Adding fuel to the fire, Mr. Maurya himself on several occasions displayed reluctance to directly name Mr. Adityanath as the face of the party ahead of the polls. In June 2021, amid speculation of differences within the BJP over the question of leadership in U.P., Mr. Adityanath called upon Mr. Maurya over lunch. Though Mr. Adityanath chose the occasion to offer his “blessings” to Mr. Maurya’s newly-wed son and daughter-in-law, his visit, in a show of unity among with senior RSS leaders, to Mr. Maurya’s residence two blocks from his own on the Kalidas Marg here, was not bereft of political significance. When Mr. Maurya was asked about this on Friday, he downplayed the visit, saying Mr. Adityanath had visited his residence several times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-deputy-cm-says-his-bond-with-adityanath-is-unbreakable/article38181988.ece

The party will be contesting all the 40 Assembly seats in Goa. Notwithstanding Mr. Kejriwal’s appeal to the public to weed out the old parties and politicians and establish the first corruption-free government in Goa, the AAP’s first list includes a significant number of political defectors from these “old parties”, along with lawyers and social activists. Four former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders — Alinha Saldanha, Mahadev Naik, Satyavijay Naik and Viswajit Krishnarao Rane (not to be confused with his namesake, Goa Health Minister Viswajit Rane, who is also from the BJP) have been given tickets from the Cortalim, Siroda, Valpoi and Poriem Assembly constituencies, respectively. Ms. Saldanha was the sitting MLA from Cortalim and served as a Minister in the erstwhile Manohar Parrikar-led Cabinet before quitting the saffron party last month to join the AAP. Mr. Mahadev Naik, a former Goa Industries Minister and an ex-MLA from Shiroda, has been given the ticket from the same constituency by the AAP. A frequent party hopper, Mr. Naik had joined the Congress ahead of the 2019 bypoll, which he lost. Mr. Viswajit K. Rane, who exited the BJP in November 2021, is likely to come up against the might of the influential Rane clan in Poriem, led by the stalwart octogenarian Congressman Pratapsingh Rane, the incumbent MLA of Poriem. The AAP is hoping to break the Rane family’s stranglehold over Valpoi and Poriem by fielding Satyavijay Naik and Viswajit K. Rane.Announcing the list, the AAP’s Goa in-charge Atishi tweeted that “this is the beginning of change in Goa’s politics”. Wishing the candidates success, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said: “You are the torchbearers of Arvind Kejriwal’s honest politics, which Goa will witness in the upcoming elections.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/defectors-figure-prominently-in-aaps-first-list-for-goa-polls/article38181984.ece

None of our applications for renewal of FC registration has been denied either in the past or at present,” said Swami Suvirananda, General Secretary of the mission. It said that due to the pandemic, renewal of its Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) registration could not be made on time and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had extended the validity of the FCRA registration up to March 31 for those registrations expiring between September 29, 2020 and March 31, 2022 and who had applied/shall apply for the renewal. “Registrations renewed in 2016 became due for renewal in 2021 and all the associations are to apply to the MHA for renewal of their registration for a further period of five years. This procedure is stipulated by the Union government to ensure that foreign contribution is utilised for bona fide activities without compromising on concerns for national security,” it said.

The ruling will then apply prospectively and for the future”. Pronouncing the operative directions in the interim order, the court noted the “urgent need to commence the process of NEET counselling” for 2021-2022. Firstly, the court agreed with the government and the Pandey committee that the EWS criteria as stipulated in January 2019 need to be used for the NEET admissions this year so that the entire exercise is not derailed. “Counselling for NEET PG 2021 and NEET UG 2021 shall be conducted by giving effect to the reservation provided by the notification of July 29, 2021, including 27% reservation for OBC and 10% reservation for EWS category for the AIQ seats,” it ordered. Secondly, it directed that the “criteria for the determination of the EWS, as notified by January 2019 official memorandum, shall be used for identifying the EWS category for candidates who appeared for NEET PG and NEET UG examinations in 2021”. Thirdly, it said any further and prospective recommendations made by the Pandey committee, modifying the criteria in the January 2019 memorandum, would be subject to the final result of the adjudication of the case in court. The case concerns petitions filed by doctors in August 2021 against the July 29, 2021 notification issued by the Directorate General of Health Services of the Ministry of Health implementing 27% and 10% reservation for the OBC and EWS categories respectively while filling 15% undergraduate and 50% postgraduate AIQ seats under NEET. The hearings in the case saw the court raise questions about the Rs. 8 lakh income limit to identify the EWS category as per the January 2019 official memorandum. The court wondered whether there was any application of mind before fixing the Rs. 8 lakh limit , and whether it was only a “mechanical adoption” of the OBC creamy lawyer cut-off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/neet-counselling-can-begin-with-ews-criteria/article38181986.ece

The Centre and the petitioner said the court could carve the way ahead once the evidence was protected. Mr. Mehta said, “The investigation should rise above central and State politics”. Punjab, represented by Advocate General D.S. Patwalia, accepted that the incident was “very, very grave in nature”. It, however, expressed the apprehension that the Centre, through its committee, would pile the blame for the lapse entirely on the police. He alleged that there were chinks in the Special Protection Group’s (SPG) measures too. ‘Reeks of politics’ Mr. Patwalia informed the court that it was ready to face a “neutral” panel that would hear all sides on the issue. The Lawyer’s Voice petition “reeked of politics”, he observed. “The Chief Minister has said that this our Prime Minister,” he submitted. Punjab said it was the first to constitute an probe committee. Both the Centre and Punjab traded allegations at the neutrality of their respective committees during the hearing. Though the Centre suggested that the Bathinda district judge could collect and secure the records with the assistance of the NIA, the Bench decided to give the responsibility to the senior official of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “We direct the Registrar General, Punjab and Haryana High Court, to secure the records forthwith,” the apex court ordered. It also ordered the Punjab government, including State police authorities; the SPG; other central and State agencies to cooperate and assist the Registrar General to seize and protect the records. It further directed the Director General of Police (DGP), Union Territory of Chandigarh, and NIA officers to be included in the team to assist the Registrar General to collect the records. During the hearing, Mr. Patwalia said the separate committees of the State and the Centre have been asked to submit reports on their findings in the 24 to 72 hours. The Centre had called the DGP to give a report in 24 hours. “They are being summoned as part of a fact-finding enquiry... But my committee will hold its horses till Monday,” he stated. Chief Justice Ramana addressed Mr. Mehta, “Please hold your committee... Now we are collecting the records. Let it wait till Monday”. The Solicitor General agreed to convey this to the government. Mr. Singh submitted that the top court should decide what step to take further once the evidence was secured and kept in protective custody. The court should lay down guidelines as the country cannot afford further breaches in the security of the Prime Minister, he stressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/get-pm-security-records-sc-tells-high-court/article38182000.ece

Ravindra Gupta, Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases (CITIID), led a recent study on the Omicron variant. While the study showed that the new variant is infecting the cells in the lungs less, the virus itself is not becoming milder. “There is this assumption that viruses become more benign over time but that’s not what’s happening here because those are long-term evolutionary trends,” Prof. Gupta told PTI on Thursday. “SARS-CoV-2 is transmitting very efficiently so it doesn't have any reason to become milder, especially in the era of vaccination with plenty of susceptible hosts. So I think it’s an evolutionary mistake. It's not something intentional that the virus is trying to do to change its biology,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/milder-omicron-an-evolutionary-mistake/article38182366.ece

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested Mr. Sharma under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on July 1 last year. The ED’s case stems from an Official Secrets Act case registered against Mr. Sharma by the Delhi police in September 2020. Mr. Sharma is alleged to have links with a foreign intelligence officers and had been receiving money through illegal means and Western Union Money Transfer. Following receipt of this input from an intelligence agency, a case under the Official Secrets Act was registered on September 13, 2020 and Mr. Sharma was arrested the next day. Documents recovered During the search of his house, police said several articles and some sensitive or confidential documents related to the Indian defence department were recovered. The police claimed Mr. Sharma indulged in procurement of secret/confidential/ sensitive documents and conveying the same to his handlers (Chinese Intelligence officers) based in China. In December 2020, the High Court had granted bail to him in the Official Secrets Act on a technical ground that the Delhi police had not filed the chargesheet in the case within the stipulated 60-day period after arrest. Subsequently, in February 2021 the ED registered the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) to probe the money laundering side of the case. A sessions court here had on July 17, while denying him bail, said Mr. Sharma would definitely attempt to wipe off the footprints and cover up the traces if released on bail. In his bail plea, Mr. Sharma had contended that he was regularly joining investigation. The ED had opposed the bail plea stating that the offence committed by him has cross-border implications and if released, he would not be available for further probe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-grants-bail-to-journalist-rajeev-sharma/article38181983.ece

While reiterating an earlier judgment, in which the High Court had held that an officer of the CID could not be construed as an officer in-charge of police station as is found in Section 173 of Cr.PC, the High Court said that all proceedings based on the charge sheet were non est .   “If the charge sheet is filed by a person who is not the authorised person to file a final report as is contemplated under Section 173 of the Cr.PC, the entire proceedings would definitely stands vitiated. Consequently, the further proceedings in pursuance of the said charge sheet is to be declared as non est ,” the court observed.  Justice V. Srishananda passed the order while dismissing two petitions filed by the State Government and the victim woman questioning the trial court’s March 2016 order. The trial court had discharged the seer from the allegations while holding that “there was no iota of material to frame charges against him”.  “Since the entire charge sheet stood vitiated and the proceedings in furtherance to such a charge sheet has been held as non est , there is no necessity for this court to consider the argument on behalf of the victim in this regard any further. For the sake of unambiguity, it is made clear that the impugned order [of discharge] being non est has no consequence whatsoever in law,” the High Court said.  The CID had filed the charge sheet under three provisions of the Indian Penal Code - Section 376(2)(f) for allegedly raping a woman towards whom he was in a “position of authority, he was in a “position of authority, trust and a teacher”; and Section 376(2)(n) for “repeatedly raping a woman”; and Section 508 “for an act caused by inducing a person to believe that he will be rendered an object of the divine displeasure”. The investigation was carried out based on an initial complaint by the victim’s daughter in 2014, alleging that the seer had sexually harassed her mother. Later, the woman had given a statement to the police that she was raped more than 150 times between 2011 and 2014.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-dismisses-plea-in-seer-rape-case/article38182382.ece

Sumathi on Thursday said “external forces” were responsible for the problems faced by the copper smelter at Thoothukudi, which led to a mass protest and the police firing in which 13 persons were killed. This led to the closure of the plant in May 2018. “They were opposing the plant’s expansion,” said Ms. Sumathi, who has been with the company for 25 years. At that point, the company was planning to ramp up its capacity from 4 lakh tonnes to 8 lakh tonnes, and the stock exchanges were informed of the plan. As soon as the news went out, “these external forces were meeting the local people and NGOs” from February 2018, she said. Asked who these “external forces” were, she said that because the matter was in court, it would not be appropriate for her to divulge the details. Asked about pollution and other issues, Ms. Sumathi said there were issues before 2013, but nothing came up after 2013. “The technology used was the best, and the plant followed international standards.” She said the local people wanted the plant re-opened as the economy in that area had shrunk after it was closed. “Closing down is not the solution. We are open to dialogues, which will help us improve operations. Constructive dialogue is the way-out,” she said. According to her, the main concern at Thoothukudi was not sulphur dioxide; it was the dust levels. She said this emerged from a study conducted by the Centre for Climate Change and Adaption Research, Anna University. The study, she said, pointed out that PM10 mainly came from the mineral dust containing silica, owing to the resuspension of road dust. Since closure, the plant at Thoothukudi had been incurring a loss of Rs. 5 crore a day. A lot of water had entered the plant during the recent rain. A sum of Rs. 800 crore-Rs. 1,000 crore would be required to revamp the plant, if and when the permission came, Ms. Sumathi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/external-forces-behind-plants-woes-sterlite/article38183008.ece

The dead were identified as Deena alias Dinesh, 24, and Biscuit alias Mohammed Moideen, 20, of Chengalpattu. Santhosh Kumar, Inspector-General of Police, North Zone, who visited the spot, said: “When our special team tried to round up the suspects at a forest adjoining the Palar at Irunkundrampalli, they threw bombs and attacked it with knives. Our inspector opened fire in self-defence.” Deena and Moideen were part of a six-member armed gang which murdered two rowdies — Appu alias Karthik, 30, of K.K. Street and Mahesh, 24, of Mettu Street — on Thursday night in Chengalpattu. Around 7.20 p.m on Thursday, the gang members, riding two motorcycles, surrounded Karthik near a tea shop at Old Bus Stand. They hurled country bombs at him and hacked him to death in public. The gang then went to the house of Mahesh, a vegetable vendor and an associate of Karthik, on Mettu Street, and hacked him to death while he was watching television. Dispute over a love affair was said to be the reason behind the two murders. M. Sathyapriya, Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Kancheepuram Range, said Appu's friend Harikrishnan was in love with Deena's elder sister. As Deena opposed it, Appu and Mahesh assaulted him in 2018 and warned him not to interfere in the matter. A case was registered and the duo faced trial in the judicial magistrate court. The two asked Deena to withdraw the case. Angered over this, Deena and his friends allegedly murdered the duo on Thursday night. Three special teams were formed to nab the killers. At dawn on Friday, Madhavan alias Madu, 25, and Jessica, 26, wife of Ashok who was a member of the gang, were nabbed in Thirupulivanam forest area. Based on their information, the team tracked down Deena and Moideen. Superintendent of Police P. Aravindhan said: “When our team surrounded them, they threw two bombs at our personnel. One did not explode and another fell on the ground. They attacked two policemen with a knife. In self-defence, inspector Ravikumar fired at the accused.” The police were interrogating Madhavan and Jessica. Efforts were on to nab the remaining members of the gang, Mr. Aravindhan said. The police were also investigating as to how the accused procured country bombs. The two bodies were sent to the Government General Hospital for post-mortem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/duo-wanted-in-double-murder-case-shot-dead-in-encounter/article38182489.ece

Stalin on Friday said he will not spare the violators even if they belonged to the DMK. “I say it in the name of Anna and Kalaignar. Stalin will take action against the violators and spare none,” he said in his reply to the debate on thanking the Governor for his address to the Assembly. Mr. Stalin said he had no idea of the [alleged false] cases referred to by former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. “He has just made a sweeping statement that his party men are taken for questioning. We cannot protect anyone fearing the registration of one case or the other. No accused escaped the police. We have secured the only accused who was on the run [former Minister Rajenthra Bhalaji],” he quipped. Mr. Stalin said the police had rounded up 6,112 rowdies in a 52-hour operation and arrested another 9,498 in connection with the sale of ganja and other narcotic substances. “We have totally prevented the sale of narcotic substances near colleges and schools. Laws will be amended to treat the sale of narcotic substances as a severe crime,” he said. The Chief Minister said 2,363 cases had been filed under the POCSO Act. “After the DMK came to power, 135 cases were filed in Chennai and charge sheets were filed in 135 cases. In one case at Royapettah, the judgment was delivered in 85 days,” he added. He said improvement in law and order had resulted in new industrial investment. “The government is writing a new chapter.

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:43 IST,TAMIL NADU||What led to the closure of mini-clinics in T.N.?||Inadequate planning, hasty implementation without a gap analysis and the temporary nature of the scheme are all the reasons for the curtains to come down on the Amma mini-clinics in Tamil Nadu, a cross-section of government doctors and officials have said. It was in December 2020 that the AIADMK government rolled out the scheme for people to have an easy access to healthcare facilities. A year later, the clinics have ceased to exist. According to a government order issued on December 31, 2021, 1,950 mini-clinics were established with medical officers and multi-purpose health workers, while the posts of staff nurses could not be filled because of a stay order passed by the High Court. The performance of the clinics has not reached any substantial level, a review showed. Moreover, with the launch of ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ and ‘Varumun Kappom Thittam’, the objective of the clinics has more than been achieved. A total of 4,448 health sub-centres were converted as health and wellness centres for the implementation of universal health coverage, the order said. The mini-clinic scheme was sanctioned for a period of one year. After a review, the government decided not to extend it beyond December 31, 2021. Health Minister Ma. Subramanian on Tuesday said the clinics did not benefit members of the public. So what led to the closure of these clinics? A medical officer pointed out that the mini-clinics had “zero benefits” for people. “There was no manpower, no fund allocation and no infrastructure,” he said. They were launched without a gap analysis, said another doctor. Officials pointed out that as per the Indian Public Health Standards, the infrastructure gaps were very low in Tamil Nadu, thanks to the network of primary health centres and health sub-centres, especially in rural areas. Higher population “In urban areas, the distance that needs to be covered to reach a primary health centre is within the norms, but the population that a facility catered to is more. So, ideally, if the Health Department wanted to fill the gaps in infrastructure, it should have done a SWOT [strength, weakness, opportunity and threat] analysis and diverted funds as per the requirements,” the doctor said. Another doctor said that mini-clinics did not provide any new service other than what was available at the primary health centres and the health sub-centres. “The real need is not mini-clinics but male multi-purpose health workers. The strength of health inspectors was reduced from 7,000 to 3,000. In addition, while primary health centres in rural areas have two medical officers each, those in urban areas have only one. Another medical officer should be posted,” he said. P. Saminathan, president of Service Doctors and Post-Graduates Association, said the concept was good but the infrastructure was not adequate and manpower insufficient. “The previous government executed the scheme in an unplanned and urgent manner. It was all on a temporary basis. There were no permanent appointments and even salary allotment was for six months,” he said. The need for the mini-clinics was less in a State like Tamil Nadu that has a large network of primary healthcare facilities, he added. “Instead, the second healthcare set-up — that is, government hospitals — could be expanded to provide round-the-clock access to emergency healthcare for people in remote areas,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/what-led-to-the-closure-of-mini-clinics-in-tn/article38182515.ece

Federation president G.D. Rajasekaran said traders visit the market that usually functions between midnight and afternoon. Wholesale traders expect at least 20% dip in the number of visitors on Saturday as retailers might not want to stock produce for the next day. Retailers did not face any issue in reaching the market on Thursday night and were allowed entry into the market area, the traders said. “We have asked trucks bringing produce from other places not to visit the market after 8 p.m. on Saturday as the market will remain closed on Sunday and will start functioning only after Sunday midnight,” said Mr. Rajasekaran. Brisk sales Traders said sales were brisk on Friday as nearly 4,000-4,500 retailers’ vehicles arrived on Friday instead of the usual 3,000. P. Sukumar, a wholesale merchant, said retailers might have feared traffic congestion or spike in demand for vegetables on Saturday. Moreover, prices of most vegetables had come down with the improvement in arrivals. On Friday, the market received nearly 340 vegetable-laden trucks and several vegetables were priced less than Rs. 50 a kg. However, the prices of a few vegetables like carrot, beetroot and drumstick remained high. The prices were expected to drop after the Pongal festival, the traders said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/koyambedu-wholesale-market-to-be-shut-tomorrow/article38182495.ece

They were actually counterfeit products but brought wide smiles to the faces of orphaned children, many of whom were infected with HIV. A week ahead of Pongal, the Tamil Nadu police went the extra mile to make these children happy. Acting on complaints lodged by the manufacturers of reputed brands that some gangs were selling counterfeit products in the market, Additional Director-General of Police, Crime, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, formed special teams to conduct searches in Chennai and Madurai. Sleuths of the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Cell seized huge quantities of shirts, t-shirts, travel and school bags and sportswear worth about Rs. 4.5 lakh during the operation. Six cases were registered against the suspects for making these products in the name of reputed brands. After investigation, the police filed a charge sheet against six persons before the Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Saidapet. The court convicted the accused in all the cases. Since the property seized cannot be returned to the convicts, the only option before the police was to destroy them. “In other Copyright cases we usually destroy the seized or criminal property. But in this case, we thought these unused clothes could be useful to underprivileged children. The court was kind enough to approve our request to distribute the clothes to orphanages,” Mr. Aggarwal said. The Shakunthala Dhanasekaran Charitable Trust, TVK Nagar, Chennai; the Shelter Trust for HIV Affected Children, Redhills, Chennai; and the CSI Home for Children and the CSI Home of Abundant Life, Chengalpattu were identified for the purpose.

Making a suo motu statement in the Assembly, he said there were irregularities in the two districts. But Chief Minister M.K. Stalin agreed to treat them as a special case after a delegation of farmers met him and made the request. “The farmers of the two districts will also get crop loan in the current year.” He said sorghum and cassava had been cultivated in most parts of Salem and Namakkal. But the farmers had borrowed by claiming that they had grown turmeric and banana because the loan amount for sorghum and cassava per acre was lower. “The irregularities were found during a field survey. Though such irregularities were reported in other districts on a small scale, it was 97% in these two districts. But the government has directed the co-operative societies to prevent such practices in future,” he said.

As part of a ‘zero tolerance’ policy, the Railway Board directed the Railway Protection Force and ticket-checking staff not to tolerate smoking on trains and penalise the violators. “Smoking and/or disposing of the burning cigarette butt/matchstick in the toilet dustbins is a major hazard. Reckless behaviour by a few passengers is posing a threat to the safety of others on trains,” the Railway Board said in an advisory to the General Managers of Zonal Railways. Metallic bins Rolling out a plan, the advisory said loose non-metallic or fibre-reinforced plastic dustbins should be replaced with metallic dustbins in all coach toilets across the network. Railway coach manufacturing factories were told to install metallic dustbins in all new coaches. Even built-in bins should be replaced with metallic dustbins at the earliest. Penalty on violators “Smoking on trains should not be tolerated and controlled strictly by the Railway Protection Force and ticket-checking staff by imposing penalty on violators as per rules. Zero tolerance must be the policy,” the Railway Board said. Besides an intense awareness campaign through all forms of the media to sensitise people to the need for refraining from smoking on board, posters should be pasted in all trains to caution passengers against smoking in the coach toilets and disposing of any burning object in the dustbin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/railways-to-act-tough-to-curb-smoking-on-trains/article38182505.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 04:45 IST,TAMIL NADU||Political compulsions should not limit Thirukural to book of ethics: Governor||Political compulsions or ideologies should not be allowed to limit Thirukural to a book of ethics and morality, for it is rooted in spirituality, Governor R.N. Ravi said at the inauguration of the International Thirukural Conference 2022 at Sri Krishna Arts and Science College in the city on Friday. The event was organised by Sri Krishna Institutions and Kural Malai Sangam. “Limiting Thirukural to a book of ethics and morality reduces its messages to a list of ‘dos and dont’s’ or advice. Thirukural is more than that. Its couplets are pithy and pregnant with deep meanings, which cannot be understood without spirituality. Unfortunately, due to compulsion and ideology, Thirukural is getting reduced to [a] book of ethics and morality,” he said. In the thousand years or so since Thiruvalluvar had authored Thirukural, several ideologies have come and gone. Therefore, political correctness or the present ideology should not limit what the book has to offer. Only then Thirukural’s glory would continue, the Governor said. Though the work started with ‘Agara mudhala...’ and had couplets extolling bhakti (devotion), the translations he had received of the work had the spiritual quotient missing. Thirukural not only talked about devotion, it also had couplets on renunciation and the cycle of birth and death, Mr. Ravi said, and reiterated, “Limiting Thirukural to a work on ethics and morality is a great injustice.” If Thirukural was viewed in totality by including the dharmic perspective, then it would automatically achieve the status of a world classic. No effort was needed to promote it, Mr. Ravi said and appealed for more commentaries with a spiritual perspective on the Thirukural and not just translations, to make it more popular across the world. He said the book was also rooted in dharma, but “due to perverse politics”, the spiritual and dharmic quotients of the book were ignored. The couplets on ethics and morality did not stand independent of their spiritual meaning. The absence of such an understanding or appreciation would not reveal the inner meanings the couplets carried. Justice (retd.) N. Kirubakaran appealed to Governor Ravi to seek the Central government’s help in making Thirukural a world classic. Tamil was the oldest language still in use, he said, the Prime Minister had acknowledged it as well. Therefore Tamils should be proud of the language. But one should be open to all languages. For, knowing more languages brought about scholarship. Justice (retd.) Kirubakaran also said British civil servant and former Madras collector Francis Whyte Ellis was the first in government to recognise the value of Thirukural by minting gold coins with images of the saint. He had also translated the work into English. Sir Krishna Institutions Chairperson S. Malarvizhi welcomed the gathering. Kural Malai Sangam’s P. Ravikumar proposed the vote of thanks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/political-compulsions-should-not-limit-thirukural-to-book-of-ethics-governor/article38182541.ece

V. Noushad, Managing Director of Walkaroo and vice-president of Confederation of Indian Footwear Industries, told The Hindu on Friday, in the last one year, footwear prices rose 20 % approximately because of higher input costs. The GST rate earlier was 18 % for footwear priced above Rs. 1,000 a pair and 5 % for those priced less than Rs. 1,000 a pair. Now, the rates were revised to 12 % for footwear priced less than Rs. 1,000 a pair and those priced above Rs. 1,000 would continue to attract 18 % GST.  The revision had resulted in straight 7 percentage point hike in prices for the common man. The dealers were refusing to take delivery of goods now as the stocks with them would have to be sold at higher GST and this would result in loss to the traders. Footwear made of synthetic leather, synthetic rubber and PVC were all priced at less than Rs. 1,000 and these were purchased largely by the economically weaker section. The footwear producers were spread across States in clusters and most of them were in the small and medium-scale segment. There were also many in the unorganised sector. The Confederation was in talks with the government seeking reduction of the GST to earlier level. At a meeting of footwear manufacturers associations and footwear traders associations on Thursday, it was decided to reject the proposed increase of GST. The industry and trade would now take up the issue at the appropriate level in the government to roll back the increase and keep the GST rate at 5%, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/footwear-manufacturers-demand-reversal-of-gst-hike/article38182535.ece

Addressing mediapersons after visiting the rescued baby and its mother at the MCH here on Friday, Health Minister Veena George said the efficiency of the existing apparatus, including the CCTV network, would be reviewed during the audit. The Additional Chief Secretary has been tasked to submit a report on the measures to be initiated for modernising the security system. CCTVs at all MCHs “All medical college hospitals will install CCTVs while respecting the privacy of patients. In due course of time, CCTVs will be installed at all hospitals in the government sector,” the Minister said. The Minister said all hospital staff should mandatorily wear ID cards. An inquiry by the Joint Director at the Directorate of Medical Education has been launched into the abduction episode. The MCH too has constituted a four-member team led by its Resident Medical Officer to investigate the security lapse. Reason cited The police team probing the case found that the accused woman, identified as Neethu R. Raj, 33, had plotted the kidnap to prevent her friend from marrying another woman. The accused, whose husband is employed in Turkey, had been in a relationship with a man identified as Ibrahim Badusha. On learning that Badusha was planning to marry another woman, Neethu told him that she was pregnant. As it turned out to be a miscarriage, she decided to abduct a baby to convince Badusha and his relatives. “Soon after kidnapping the baby, the accused sent a photo of the baby to Badusha. Through a video call she also informed Badusha’s relatives about her delivery and the newborn,” said Shilpa Devaiah, District Police Chief, Kottayam. Cheating case While the investigations revealed that the kidnap was executed by the woman on her own, the police also arrested Badusha on charges of cheating her of gold and cash worth Rs. 30 lakh by offering to marry her. “There are two separate cases. In the kidnap incident, Neethu is the lone accused. On the basis of Neethu’s statement, a separate case has been registered against the man for cheating and theft,” the official added. Sources said Badusha would be also booked under provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act for allegedly assaulting Neethu’s eight-year-old son on many occasions. Neethu, meanwhile, was booked for criminal trespass, abduction and provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-security-in-medical-colleges-after-abduction/article38182376.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:44 IST,TAMIL NADU||Priest’s remarks on Bharat Mata prima facie promote enmity: HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday held that certain remarks made by Priest George Ponniah on Bharat Mata at a meeting in Arumanai in Kanniyakumari district prima facie amounted to deliberate/malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings promoting enmity. Justice G.R. Swaminathan observed that the Earth was worshipped as Bhooma Devi. She took the form of Bharat Mata. He said there was absolutely no need to mount a visceral attack on the religious beliefs of the Hindus. A reading of the petitioner’s speech as a whole did not leave any one in doubt that his target was the Hindu community. He was putting them on one side and Christians and Muslims on the other. The distinction was made solely on the ground of religion. “Bhooma Devi is considered a Goddess by all believing Hindus. I use the expression “believing” because, even materialists, rationalists and non-believers can also be counted as Hindus... Bharat Mata evokes a deeply emotional veneration in a very large number of Hindus,” the judge said. The words uttered by the petitioner were sufficiently provocative and they reeked of malice and supremacism. The question was whether the State could ignore such incendiary statements as that of a lunatic fringe, the judge asked. A critical or even a harsh statement pertaining to religion or religious beliefs coming from a rationalist, reformist, an academic or an artist would stand on a different footing altogether. The shield of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution would be available to them. On the other hand, an evangelist like the petitioner could not claim a similar privilege. He could not insult or outrage others’ religion or their religious beliefs. This was because he viewed the other religionists as a constituency to be poached. The State could not remain a mute spectator in such situations. To uphold the sanctity of the Constitution and maintain public order, the strong arm of law would have to come down heavily on those who sought to disrupt communal peace and amity. The court was hearing the petition filed by the priest in Kanniyakumari district, seeking quashing of the FIR registered against him under various Sections of the Indian Penal Code. In July 2021, the priest had made certain remarks on Bharat Mata, the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister. The court partly allowed the petition and held that offences for unlawful assembly, negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life, criminal intimidation under the IPC and offences under the Epidemic Diseases Act were not made out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/priests-remarks-on-bharat-mata-prima-facie-promote-enmity-hc/article38182958.ece

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan took note of the submission by the State that the amount was sanctioned from the Chief Minister’s relief fund. The family members of the victims had to appear before the Virudhunagar Collector and the amount would be handed over to them, the court was told. The judge, who was hearing the petitions filed by the family members of the victims, directed Virudhunagar District Legal Services Authority to take necessary efforts to ensure that the amount was paid to them. They had complained that the government had announced an interim compensation of Rs. 1 lakh each and the Collector had also assured them that adequate compensation would be provided to them. They had sent several representations to the authorities in this regard, but they did not receive any compensation, they said. They said since the State had allowed Rajammal Fireworks to function without a proper licence and permission, the authorities were vicariously liable to pay the compensation.

The Fisheries Department has sought to reach out to potential beneficiaries in the two districts with its 50 percent subsidy scheme for purchase of tuna liner-cum- gill netter fishing vessel. The scheme for purchase of a such a boat that entails 50 per cent subsidy to a maximum of Rs. 30 lakh requires the beneficiaries to contribute the remaining 50 percent of the cost. Fishermen could apply for the scheme in a group of six, or as cooperatives or as individuals. Factoring in readiness of fishermen in the districts to switch over to deep sea fishing to avoid mid-sea conflicts with Sri Lankan Navy, the Government must broaden the ambit of the 50 percent subsidy scheme to enlist fishermen in large numbers, Mohandas, a fisher representative of Akkaraipettai emphasised. Only through scaling up the number of beneficiaries can the positive impact of deep sea fishing that would, in the long run, reflect in recouping of fisheries resources in Palk Bay, be determined, said Mahendran, a representative of Kilinjalmedu hamlet in Karaikal district, said. According to a senior official of the Fisheries Department in Nagapattinam district, the scheme has been implemented for beneficiaries at the State-level on seniority basis, and, as such, there was no specific allotment per district. So far, over the last few years 13 boats have been sanctioned in Nagapattinam district under the scheme, he said. While they were game for deep sea fishing, the prospective beneficiaries have desired that their views must also be considered in right earnest by the government before finalising the design of the boat, as per the specifications of Naval architect that is a mandatory requirement. The fishermen in Nagapattinam-Mayiladuthurai belt also emphasised that the same scheme under Central funding was not impressive at the implementation level. Funding under the Central scheme for construction of large deep sea tuna long liners covers a project cost of Rs. .80 lakh per vessel with 50% Central subsidy assistance. But, availing the scheme has become a tough proposition due to the stringent norms in identifying the potential beneficiaries, Mr. Mohandas said.

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:37 IST,TAMIL NADU||Pandemic-induced restrictions put folk artistes in a spot||Folk and professional stage artistes who had recently revived their careers after enrolling as volunteer teachers in the Illam Thedi Kalvi (ITK - Education at the Doorstep) scheme of the Tamil Nadu government’s School Education Department, are staring at another dry spell in the wake of the pandemic-induced closure of schools and restrictions on public gatherings. Designed to bridge the knowledge gaps created by irregular classes since the first lockdown, ITK offers two hours of evening lessons for children Grades 1 to 8 of government schools, using folk and drama performers as part of the volunteer teaching team. Pilot projects of ITK were launched in October last year in Cuddalore, Dindigul, Erode, Kancheepuram, Kanyakumari, Krishnagiri, Madurai, Nagapattinam, Nilgiris, Thanjavur, Tiruchi and Villupuram districts. In Tiruchi district, the six-month scheme was expected to benefit over three lakh children studying in 1,269 government and 363 government-aided schools. However last week’s closure of physical classes for school students of Grades 1 to 9, and of colleges until January 20, in view of the rising number of COVID-19 and Omircon variant cases, has caused uncertainty among the volunteer teachers, especially those from the performing arts. M. Thangavel, 55, coordinator of the eight ITK groups in Tiruchi district, said, “Fresh restrictions or lockdown will impact many people, especially artistes, all over again as public celebration of festivals and gatherings will be banned. We have already suffered untold misery in the past year and a half. I have spent 32 years in the service of the arts, and have turned down steady jobs in order to follow my passion. But I do not know how long artistes like me can sustain themselves without professional work.”  “I have been a drama artiste for over four decades, and life has been tough since the first lockdown was declared in March, 2020. Volunteering for ITK was my first big break after a long period of unemployment. I have participated in at least 45 programmes since the initiative was launched, but now don’t know if this opportunity will come again once the schools close down,” Suganthi, 62, told The Hindu .   “I am not qualified to work in any other field, so staying jobless at home will be a painful decision,” she added. Life is a little easier for artistes who have developed alternative careers. S. Shanthishree, 46, a classical dancer and Valli Thirumanam exponent, said that she had joined the ITK scheme in a bid to give something back to society.  “Lockdown will definitely hit people who rely purely on the entertainment business for their livelihood. I have been able to survive the slowdown thanks to the Bharatanatyam classes that I run from home, plus my tailoring skills. But ITK has given me a fresh perspective on learning and teaching. It would be a tragedy if it is stopped abruptly,” she said.  Volunteering for ITK was my first big break after a long period of unemployment...

The entrances to the temples were closed by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department which put up flex banners outside the shrines informing the devotees that they would not be permitted inside in accordance with the government’s directive till Sunday.The department officials said poojas were, however, performed as usual to the deities in all sannidhis. Major temples in Tiruchi such as Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam, Sri Jambukeswarar Akilandeswari Temple, Tiruvanaikoil, Arulmigu Mariamman Temple, Samayapuram, and Rockfort Sri Thayumanaswamy Temple were all out of bounds for the general public. Announcements were made through the public address system at the Samayapuram Arulmigu Mariamman Temple conveying the government’s decision. Food items were distributed in packets to the general public at the temple. Thanjavur The three-day weekend closure has apparently hit those who depend on the temples and devotees for their livelihood. Sale of `puja’ materials such as flowers, coconuts, fruits, ghee lamp sets etc. are the major earning of families residing around temples such as the Big Temple in Thanjavur, Mariamman Temple in Punnainallur, the Saivaite and Vaishnavite temples in Kumbakonam and the ‘navagraha’ temples around Kumbakonam. Consequent to the outbreak of the pandemic two years ago, some of these vendors had to shut down their business and look for other sources of income as entry for devotees to temples was barred by the State government. Those who sell artefacts and other commodities and have established their units in spaces rented out to them by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department such as at the ‘mandapam’ of Sri Aadhi Kumbeswarar Temple have also taken a beating. A few months ago, the traders had heaved a sigh of relief after the State government relaxed some norms which ensured the entry of devotees into the temples. But their hopes have hit a roadblock again with the State government denying the entry of devotees into temples on weekends. Instead of banning the entry of devotees, the traders have pleaded that the government should consider ways to ensure personal distancing and adherence to other COVID-19 appropriate behaviour by devotees. Meanwhile, HR and CE department officials in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts have ensured that the State government’s instruction to keep temples closed for devotees for three days from Friday to Sunday was implemented without fail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/temples-wear-a-deserted-look/article38182630.ece

The Department has started the distribution of saplings to farmers and already about 70,000 saplings have been distributed so far. The remaining saplings are ready for distribution at the Forest Department’s Extension Centre nursery at P. K. Agaram, an official of the Agriculture Department said. The department was keen to distribute the saplings quickly so that farmers can plant the saplings taking advantage of the monsoon/agriculture season now. Under the initiative, farmers were being given 50 tree saplings an acre for border plantation and 160 saplings for low intensity planting. “Farmers are advised to raise the saplings as border crop if they raise crops such as paddy. Low density planting can be taken up by farmers raising horticulture and floriculture crops. In such crops, the saplings can be planted and raised as an inter-crop,” an official of the department explained. Saplings of high timber value species such as teak, red sandal, mahagony, vembu and pungan were distributed to farmers under the scheme. In Tiruchi district, teak saplings are distributed mostly to farmer beneficiaries. Teak sheds its leaves and will not compete with the main crop, the official said explaining the preference for teak. Farmers get the saplings free of cost and are also eligible to get Rs. 7 per sapling a year in the second and third years of its growth. Farmers who wish to avail themselves of the scheme, can apply through the Uzhavan App and register their name, phone number, land survey number and other relevant details. Agriculture officers will contact the applicant and visit their field for verification taking photos of the field and uploading the same online along with the chitta, Aadhaar details and bank account passbooks. “Farmers can still apply and benefit from the scheme,” the officer said. Earlier this week, Joint Director of Agriculture M. Murugesan, handed them over to a few farmers in Lalgudi block at the P. K. Agaram nursery of the Forest Department. Fourteen farmers from the block were given 565 teak seedlings, 321 red sandal and 50 mahagony tree seedlings. R. Sukumar, Assistant Director of Agriculture, Lalgudi, V.Suganya, Agriculture Officer, and other officials were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/204-lakh-saplings-to-be-distributed-under-new-agro-forestry-scheme/article38183145.ece

Transgender women self-help group ‘Tiruchi Pasumai Pattru’ (TPP) is reaching out to aspiring and expert green thumbs by offering to establish terrace gardens from scratch in residential complexes.  The SHG, that functions from a stall at Poomalai Vaniga Valagam building on Bharatidasan Salai, recently set up a terrace garden for a customer in the Cantonment area, and is hopeful of offering the same service to everyone. “We were requested by a homemaker to create a green space on her small balcony in her apartment; we were very encouraged to be accepted as part of society and treated on a par with other gardening professionals,” Kajol, the transwoman entrepreneur who heads TPP, told The Hindu .  All the members of the group have done a certificate course in organic farming methods at the ICAR-Krishi Vigyan Kendra (affiliated to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University) at Siruganur. To make the most of the limited space available on the balcony, Kajol and her colleague Pooja used grow bags rather than flowerpots filled with fortified planting soil. Rubberised tiles help to drain the excess water. “Our planting mix contains bone meal, natural fertilisers and other nutritional supplements. A medium-sized grow bag with soil costs around Rs. 300,” said Ms. Kajol. Grow bags are chosen according to the root length of the plant, said Ms. Kajol. “Tomatoes, chillies and brinjals can be grown in a medium bag; vegetables like snake gourd will need bigger sizes,” she said. Shade nets are set up to protect the plants from climate exposure. The success of the venture would depend on patronage, said Ms. Kajol. “If we are able to maintain such garden plots in public buildings or parks, it would help us to inspire others in the transgender community to take this up professionally,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transwomen-help-in-nurturing-terrace-gardens/article38182610.ece

The State exercised the option of postponing the exam last November to stave off protests by a section of students demanding conduct of the odd semester in online mode. Representatives of student organisations, including Students Federation of India and All India Students Federation, with whom Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi held discussions, had sought time to prepare for the offline exams. While a good number of autonomous colleges affiliated to Bharathidasan University are understood to have completed the processes of examination and valuation, and are even in a state of preparedness to publish results later this month, the non-autonomous colleges find themselves pushed into a situation of uncertainty. “Further postponement of examinations is not at all an option as it will be detrimental to the final year students. For them, the schedule of the final semester must not be affected on any account. The results for the final-year UG and PG students have to be published during June-July to enable them to pursue career options or higher studies without any hassles,” a Principal of an affiliated college said. Parents worried In any case, the odd semester exam will have to be conducted, be it in online or offline mode, according to professors of Bharathidasan University. According to university sources, there has been no communication so far from the Higher Education Department about the offline exams, even as parents have begun to raise safety concerns over the reported increase in surge in COVID infection of omicron variant. Since the exams for UG and PG courses have been scheduled to start on January 24, the university will be hard-pressed for time in the event of being instructed by the Higher Education Department to conduct the exams in offline mode, the sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/colleges-in-a-fix-over-conducting-exams-in-offline-mode/article38182607.ece

Vishnu has urged traders, hoteliers, owners of restaurants and cinema halls to strictly follow the COVID-19 norms to check surging Omicron cases in the district. Chairing a meeting with their representatives here on Thursday, Mr. Vishnu, after explaining the restrictions imposed by the State government in the wake of the sudden spurt in COVID-19 cases, said that those who were working in these business establishments should have received two doses of vaccines and wear masks during their business hours. The customers’ body temperature should be measured with the thermal scanners and offered hand sanitiser while entering the shop or hotel. They should be instructed to strictly follow physical distancing.Instead of operating air-conditioners, the owners of all business establishments should ensure that their shops had proper ventilation. “Only 50% of the customers should be engaged at any given point of time. Those who flout these protocols will face legal action and closure of their business establishments,” Mr. Vishnu warned. The Collector has appealed to the public to cooperate with the district administration in curbing the Omicron outbreak which was spreading like wildfire by scrupulously following the protocols. Following instructions from Corporation Commissioner B. Vishnu Chandran, Assistant Commissioner (in charge), Melapalayam Zone, Lenin conducted a surprise check at the ‘Uzhavar Sandhai’ in Melapalayam on Friday. 95 booked As the Thoothukudi police intensified night patrolling to book the night curfew violators on Thursday, 95 persons were booked for roaming around after 10 p.m. and Rs. 2.08 lakh was collected as fine from 1,041 persons who did not wear masks.

The urea, supplied by IFFCO, will be sold to farmers through Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies and the private retailers in the two districts. A team officials led by Joint Director of Agriculture, Tirunelveli, R. Gajendra Pandian received the urea that arrived from Karaikal on Friday. Mr. Gajendra Pandian said the present consignment would be distributed on 70 : 30 basis to the Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies and private retailers as directed by the Agriculture Production Commissioner. He cautioned the farmers against using urea excessively as it would cause adverse effect on the soil, quality of crop and the entire ecosystem besides leading to increased pest attack and diseases. Since the Department of Agriculture had provided soil health card to the farmers, they should apply urea based on the recommendations given on the card. He prescribed that 22 kg urea was adequate for one acre and it should be applied once in 15 to 20 days along with other nutrients. “It is like treating a patient based on blood test results… Hence, excess application of urea will increase ammonia content in the soil resulting in crop damage,” Mr. Gajendra Pandian cautioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/1300-tonnes-of-urea-arrive-in-tirunelveli/article38183154.ece

The service provider has been digging trenches and laying cables to strengthen its service across Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai, damaging the underground connections to the utilities in the process. In some places, the firm has installed poles at ‘cable connection junctions’ after closing the trenches. “This effectively denies the residents the chance of repairing their damaged drinking water or underground drainage connections. Even though this issue was brought to the notice of the Corporation officials, this unfair practice continues to affect drinking water supply at several places,” complains S. Nallaperumal, a retired government employee and president of Drivers’ Colony Residents’ Welfare Association. The residents also complain that the mobile phone firm refuses to properly close the trenches with soil and then concrete as mandated in the agreement it has reached with the Corporation. When contacted, Corporation officials said the private firm had been asked to stop the work after complaints flooded their office. However, the firm continues its work in the early hours, the residents complain. “The private firm’s contract workers drawn from Andhra Pradesh are compelled to work in the early hours. After digging the trench for about 1,000 feet along the north-south road near Employees’ Provident Fund Office to lay the cable, the workers dug across the 40-feet-wide road around 5 a.m. to connect two cables in a bid to evade action from the Corporation,” said Mr. Nallaperumal. This ongoing cable laying work has badly affected the Corporation’s drinking water pipeline work also. Assistant Executive Engineer of Tirunelveli Corporation’s Melapalayam Zone, Lenin, said the firm had been asked to dig the trenches carefully without damaging the underground drainage pipes and the domestic drinking water connections. “If the work results in damaging any pipe, it should be rectified on the spot. We’ve given them necessary instructions and any violation will be viewed seriously,” Mr. Lenin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mobile-phone-firms-cable-laying-work-damages-pipelines/article38183148.ece

Maximum 100 guests While a maximum of 100 guests will be allowed to participate in weddings, only 50 persons would be allowed in case of funeral. Since the officials will be closely monitoring wedding celebrations or funerals for any COVID-19 protocol violations, those who are conducting weddings or funerals should register without fail on the website. If any violation is noticed in the wedding or funeral, the officials will intervene and stop the event besides initiating legal action against the violators, Mr. Vishnu said.  In case of violation, officials will stop the event and initiate legal action Collector||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/register-weddings-and-funerals-on-portal/article38182641.ece

Food safety authorities have joined hands with hoteliers, marriage hall owners and party organisers to deliver excess food to the needy. As the first step, Vellore Collector P. Kumaravel Pandian has launched a helpline (893135000) at the Collectorate through which those who wish to hand over excess food can inform the network. The help-desk will seek details such as the type of cuisine, when the food was cooked and the quantity. One can also inform the help-desk about those who are in need of food. Similar helplines will be created in the other three districts. “We have also created a WhatsApp group connecting officials, hoteliers, marriage hall owners and others to channelize the excess food to the needy. The Collectors will monitor the group and its activities,” said V. Senthil Kumar, Designated Officer, Food Safety Department (Vellore, Ranipet and Tirupattur). At present, around four tonnes of food is being wasted at marriages, birthday celebrations, anniversaries, alumni meetings and temple festivals. Together, these districts have a total of 842 hotels, with Vellore having the highest of 262, followed by Tiruvannamalai with 250. Around 600 marriage and party halls are located in these four districts. Prior to the lockdown restrictions when a maximum of 100 persons were allowed to attend marriages, each of these districts had at least 70 marriage functions, 140 birthday celebrations, get-togethers and temple festivals every year. “We will provide free transport for delivery of excess food to the needy...,” said M. Venkeda Subbu, president, Tamil Nadu Hotels Association. These districts have a total of old age homes (270), orphanages (182) and more than 4,000 homeless persons and families. They depend mainly on donations and charities from philanthropists at places of worship and from NGOs. Officials say most of the excess food at hotels and marriage functions is wasted. To prevent such wastage, food safety officers have identified NGOs and welfare organisations to channelise the excess food to the old age homes and the orphanages.  We have also created a WhatsApp group connecting officials, hoteliers, marriage hall owners and others involved in the scheme||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-movement-takes-shape-to-provide-food-to-old-age-homes-orphanages/article38183106.ece

Meghanath Reddy on Friday. Thanks to his innovative programme, ‘Coffee with Collector,’in which students who excelled in academics, sports and arts were invited to his camp office here. The meeting was held in an informal set up - in an open space - where students formed a semi-circle around the Collector to have an extempore interaction. After offering the students coffee and snacks, the Collector interacted with them on their personal life, special talents and the dream for their future. The children were thrilled to have an exclusive meeting with the Collector that went for nearly an hour. “Joy and thrill were writ large on their faces when they came out of the session,” Chief Educational Officer A. Gnanagowri said. The Collector too was excited to know that every child had tonnes of talent and bubbling with enthusiasm. A girl student stunned the Collector by singing an extempore folksong on the event. “A big barrier in the minds of rural children about the highest office in the district was broken which gave them inspiration to emulate the Collector,” the CEO said. Teachers had accompanied the students to the camp office and back home. The district administration plans to conduct the event once a week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/virudhunagar-students-have-coffee-with-collector/article38182647.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 04:20 IST,TAMIL NADU||Surfing through two waves, learning lessons||The third wave has arrived. We now know that no two waves are identical and that each wave is unique. Each variant of the virus has its own clinical symptoms, course and death rate and therefore requires a different course of management. The age and gender predilections also vary significantly, but what has remained constant is probably the fear, fatigue and foremost question — When will it end? The first wave in India between March 2020 and December 2020, caused by the Alpha and Beta variants, typically involved all age groups. However, the older individuals and people with co-morbidities were more severely affected and unfortunately succumbed to the disease in large numbers. This wave was characterised by uncertainty and a gamut of therapeutic options lacking evidence, ranging from former President of the United States Donald Trump’s scientifically unfounded endorsement of hydroxychloroquine to the much-fancied convalescent plasma therapy. There was global confusion and chaos about the disease, its pathology and treatment. Following a falsely reassuring period of relative stability, the second wave arrived with an onslaught of cases, involving a larger proportion of the younger age group. The villains of the second wave — the deadly Delta and Delta Plus variants — predominantly involved the lungs resulting in varying degrees of hypoxia necessitating oxygen therapy. It was during the midst of this crisis that the results of clinical research trials became available and established treatment protocols were formulated and followed. Convalescent plasma therapy and remdesivir were unceremoniously tossed off their high pedestal. Heparin and steroids continued to be promising and effective. However, the heroes of this wave were the COVID-19 vaccines which were given EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) and administered to the vast majority of the adult population, which shielded many lives. As the third wave is gathering momentum, it is evident that it is going to spread rapidly, given its innate nature of high transmissibility. Regardless of our vaccination status, most of us are prone to getting infected but the real challenge we may be facing in a few weeks from now is that clinically severe COVID-19 that may be affecting the vulnerable, inclusive of the unvaccinated elderly, elderly with co-morbidities, pregnant and lactating mothers and probably extending to children, overwhelming our health care facilities. As we stand at the shore looking at the tsunami approaching, armed with the knowledge and wisdom gained, we now arrive at the question — Is there anything we can do? As socially aware and active citizens of this nation, it is incumbent upon us to adopt ideal strategies, whether old or new, to overcome the possible catastrophe heading our way. At the present doubling capacity of 48 hours, there is going to be an overwhelmingly large number of COVID cases. We need to remind ourselves and our public not to panic. Enough evidence is there that it is a mild form. Clinically not all positive patients need to be driven in herds to health facilities, least of all to a COVID designated higher centre. Remember, COVID does not replace non-COVID ailments, we need to keep the facilities open for timely management of non-COVID priorities too! Thankfully, Tamil Nadu’s infrastructure has been built up admirably during the second wave. This infrastructure has to be reactivated and ramped up wherever possible. The vaccine is our proven saviour and so we need to ensure an unabated vaccination drive, including administration of an early ‘booster’ or ‘precautionary dose’, as it is called now, to the high-risk and vulnerable population. This has to be started right away. Adolescent vaccination has to be parallelly maintained in full swing. An out-of-the-box thinking approach would be to consider “Reverse Quarantine” instead of exhausting all available resources and precious healthcare facilities with asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic individuals. It will be prudent to identify the following categories for reverse quarantining in facilities • Unvaccinated elderlies above 60 years of age • Unvaccinated with moderate to serious comorbidities. Identify them, drive them into the safety net/cocoon of CCC (COVID care center) or CHC (COVID health centre), vaccinate them and optimally control the co-morbid conditions. Through this strategy we can prevent the loss of many lives. Our state encompasses about 1.04 crore of elderly population and about 62% of them have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Bringing the remaining unvaccinated elderly and those with comorbid and multi-morbidities under the safety net may not be practical and viable, therefore a judicious use of clinical discretion with robust field activity becomes essential. COVID protocols and appropriate behaviour need to be followed diligently. To summarise, lessons learnt and wisdom gained should make us tide over yet another tsunami of COVID rather than be swept off our feet.

Society should drop the stigma attached to Devadasis and the Government should help them enter other professions by giving them skill training and easy loans to take up small businesses,” he said. He was speaking after inaugurating a multi-skill centre and community hall of Shakti Aids Control Association in Gokak. The former Minister stressed that Devadasis had to shed blind belief attached to the systemand develop a modern outlook.He said MBVwould work with organisationsthat would organise Devadasisand commercial sex workers,and help them turn entrepreneurs or skilled workers. Mr. Jarkiholi recalled the contribution of B.L. Patil, Athani-based advocate and founder of Vimochana NGO that is engaged in Devadasi welfare. He also credited Lalitha Hosmani who was engaged in organising Devadasis and commercial sex workers andLeela Sampige, activist and academician, who has worked with commercial sex workers for decades.Dr. Sampigehelped Devadasis and commercial sex workers organise themselves andset up a centre for multi-skill training and entrepreneurship, he said. He said that B.K. Hariprasad, MLC, had allocated funds from his local area development grants to set up the centre. Mr. Hariprasad expressed concern that crimes against women were onthe rise across the country. “A recent study has indicated that over 11,000 women have gone missing from Chhatttisgarh in the last 15 years. Similar is the situation in Jharkhand. The condition of women is not very different in other parts of the country. They are pushed into commercial sex work, slave trade, human trafficking, and other evil practices. There are no systems and processes to ensure their uninterrupted education and employment,’’ Mr. Hariprasad said. He criticised the BJP Governments at the Centre and the State for their “utter neglect” towards the problems of women and youth. He accused the BJP of diverting the attention of the people away from real issues such as poverty, unemployment, and price rise.“The economy is collapsing and people are finding it difficult to stay alive. But the ruling party is speaking of irrelevant issues such as anti-conversion Bills and beef ban.The BJP Governments are also targeting minority communities. The Union Government has frozen the accounts of established welfare NGOs such as the Missionaries of Charity who have helped thousands of destitute and the poor,’’ he said. Dr. Sampige said this was the first such centre in the country. “It will help women who have suffered ridicule, insult, and abuse for decades, turn into self-reliant employees and entrepreneurs,’’ she said. She said that the centre would start short-term and long-term skill training courses and entrepreneurship development programmes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ngo-to-work-with-devadasis/article38182688.ece

Among the prominent solutions is the construction of a new two-lane flyover to the west of the existing three-lane flyover for traffic movingfrom the city towards Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). A report from Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES), which was tasked with forming a master plan to decongest the junction, stated that piers of the new flyover would come up on the Hebbal Lake bund. The bund area will be restored to its original condition after construction is completed. It has also proposed the construction of a three-lane flyover on the eastern side in addition to the existing two lane-flyover for motorists coming from KIA towards the city. Another proposal examines the construction of a new loop for motorists traveling towards Tumakuru Road by dismantling the existing loop. The existing loop for traffic moving from the city towards K R Puram will be retained. “Agencies such as Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL), K-RIDE, Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and others have come up with various projects at the Hebbal junction,” said BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez. Keeping in mind future expansion and integration of various modes of operations, the Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) was asked to come up with plans to ease congestion. “BMRCL will build three proposed stations near Hebbal, one of which is part of the ongoing ORR- Airport line. Another station has been proposed under Phase III of Namma Metro that is Kempapura to J.P. Nagar line. There is also a proposal to build another station as part of a future expansion of the metro to connect Sarajpura and northern parts of the city. The State government will decide on the role of different agencies in decongesting the Hebbal Junction and integrating various modes of transport,” Mr. Parwez added. The State Government and Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) had engaged the service of the Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) to prepare a master plan for capacity augmentation and integration of various modes of transport at Hebbal Junction to meet the road traffic requirement for 2051. To carry out these plans, the authorities need 33,558 square meters of the land that included 10,440 sq m private land BMRCL has requested the general public to share their objections/ suggestions/views to the future plans by sending mail to chavan@bmrc.co.in in 15 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/additional-flyovers-proposed-to-decongest-hebbal-junction/article38182454.ece

Mr. Reddy said himself andSowmya Reddy,would stage a protest in front of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) office on Monday if Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who also holds finance and Bengaluru development portfolios, did not release funds by then. Mr. Reddy said he and Ms. Sowmya Reddy would stage a protest in front of the Chief Minister’s Office on Wednesday. He would not invite anyone to join the protests since the State Government has issued an order banning all protests citing rising cases of COVID-19, Mr. Reddy said. Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Reddy alleged discrimination in release of funds by the BJP government and said the BJP MLAs received huge sums of money while Congress MLAshave been left high and dry. While the State Government allocated Rs. 1,110.34 crore to 15 BJP MLAs, Rs. 248.29 crore had been allocated to nine Congress MLAs. One constituency represented by the JD (S) received Rs. 125 crore, he alleged. Mr. Reddy said he had spoken to BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta and other officials and sought reasons for not allocating money to BTM Layout and Jayanagar constituencies. The BBMP officials promised him that they would look into the matter. But “blatant bias” in allocation of funds would not help the development of the city, Mr. Reddy said. The BBMP had not released funds to any wards in 2019-20 and 2020-21. Only this year (2021-22), the government released Rs. 1,500 crore for executing 298 works related to roads, stormwater drains, bridges, and other infrastructure, the Congress leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protest-planned-before-offices-of-bbmp-cm/article38182456.ece

Kumaraswamy on Friday remarked that he too would participate in padayatra if the Congress could guarantee him that it [padayatra] would help get Centre’s nod for the project. He accused the Congress leaders of lying to the people of the State about Mekedatu project on a daily basis to gain political mileage and alleged that the party had done nothing to push for the project when it was in power for five years from 2013 to 18. Questioning the commitment of the Congress to Mekedatu project, he alleged that the party was fighting for implementation of the project in Karnataka while it had maintained close political alliance with the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu that had been opposing the project. He argued that the Congress should convince the DMK Government in Tamil Nadu to drop its opposition to Mekedatu project instead of hoodwinking people through padayatra. Terming the statement of the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah that it was during his regime that the DPR for the Mekedatu project had been prepared and submitted to the Centre, Mr. Kumaraswamy said actually it was the pre-feasibility report that had been submitted by the erstwhile Siddaramaiah Government. It was the government led by him (Mr. Kumaraswamy) that had actually prepared and submitted the DPR to the Centre, he claimed. Mr. Kumaraswamy said unlike Mr. Siddaramaiah who did not pay much attention to Mekedatu, he had attended 11 meetings on Mekedatu in his 14-month tenure as Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mekedatu-jds-asks-cong-to-convince-its-ally-dmk/article38182467.ece

While physical consultations have not increased, people are turning to doctors seeking help online.  According to integrated healthcare platform Practo, there has been a 21% increase in GP consults in Bengaluru since December 31. “People in the age group of 21-30 years constituted 45% of all online consultations. Those aged between 31 and 40 years comprised 41% of consultations, while senior citizens covered 14%. Concerns were mostly raised about COVID-related symptoms such as fever, sore throat, headache, body pain, and stuffy nose. There were also queries about Omicron, COVID vaccine booster doses, and vaccines for children, among others,” a spokesperson told The Hindu .  Across the country, with close to 38,000 infections recorded on January 4, COVID-related doctor consultations saw a massive jump of 50% the next day, Practo said, adding that this was the highest single-day increase in doctor consultations in 120 days since the decline of the deadly second wave. “More than 50% of all doctor consultations are for GPs and pulmonologists with major concerns like fever, sore throat, headache, body pain, stuffy nose, Omicron spread, COVID -19 vaccine booster doses, and vaccines for children, among others,” a statement from Practo said. Around 85% of these queries were come from metro cities. As far as the percentage of growth in queries was concerned, Mumbai saw the highest growth in GP-related consultations since January 1 at 132%, followed by Kolkata (106%), Delhi NCR (95%), Bengaluru (75%), Chennai (47%) and Hyderabad (42%).

The busy junction is a nightmare for pedestrians who struggle to walk from one point to another given the heavy traffic. Markets in the area that draw a huge crowd every day add to the congestion. In its proposal, BMRCL said that the Banashankari Skywalk project will ensure smooth vehicular flow and safe access for pedestrians. It also provides space for street vendors. “By directly connecting the metro station and bus stand to pedestrians from the other side of the street, the skywalk will provide safe access to commuters,” said BMRCL in a release. It stated that the circular structure will set it apart from regular foot-over-bridges in the city. “This skywalk will be a vibrant public space filled with greenery and resting pods. It will connect and enhance pedestrian experience,” the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/banashankari-to-get-circular-skywalk/article38182455.ece

Khandre of the Congress to the Legislative Assembly from Bhalki constituency in the elections held in 2018. Justice Krishna S. Dixit passed the order while dismissing a petition filed by D.K. Sidram of the BJP, who was defeated by Mr. Khandre. It was alleged in the petition that the election was vitiated by a series of corrupt practices such as distribution of wall clocks and money perpetrated by or at the instance of Mr. Khandre. The petitioner had also alleged that Mr. Khandre had failed to disclose proper details in the affidavit filed along with his nomination papers and had misused official machinery as he was a Minister in the State Cabinet then. However, the court found that the petitioner had failed to produce “material facts” and “material particulars” in support of the allegation of corrupt election practices levelled against the returned candidate as mandated in Sections 83(1)(a) and 83 (1)(b) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 The court also said that “the allegation of tampering of EVMs cannot be lavishly made, especially when in terms of decision of the Supreme Court the ECI has adopted VVPAT to the EVMs and thereby, rendered them nearly un-tamperable”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/plea-against-khandres-election-rejected/article38182464.ece

Ambuja by Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) police at Sringeri on January 6 evening was opposed by a group of people who are believed to be supporters of political parties. They gathered in front of the Inspection Bungalow, where the ACB officials were completing the formalities of arrest, and demanded release of the tahsildar. Following a complaint by Sanjay Kumar, a resident of Kavadi village, the ACB arrested village accountant Siddappa while accepting a bribe of Rs. 25,000 from the complainant. On further inquiry, police arrested tahsildar Ambuja as well. The complainant had applied for regularisation of his residential property, for which the officials had demanded a bribe of Rs. 60,000. The ACB caught Siddappa taking the first instalment of Rs. 25,000. As news of the arrest spread, supporters of political parties assembled at the Inspection Bungalow and urged the ACB Deputy Superintendent of Police C.R. Geetha to release the tahsildar. Some of them defended the tahsildar stating that many people had been able to get their properties approved and land granted after she took charge in Sringeri. However, Ms. Geetha insisted that she was acting on the procedure laid down by law. Later, the ACB officials presented the arrested officials before the judicial magistrate. Both were remanded in judicial custody.

In a press release issued from New Delhi, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi has said that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had floated the tender to convert the 31 km-two-lane bypass road between Hubballi and Dhawad into a six-lane expressway and for two-lane service road on each side under EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) mode. Mr. Joshi has said that the NHAI had floated tender for the work and the contractors were required to submit their bids before February 22. “Two-and-a-half years has been fixed for completion of the project and the contractor has to maintain the road for the next 5 years,” he has said. Exemption from toll Under the new tender, it has been proposed to remove all the existing toll plazas and set up only one toll plaza. This toll plaza to be set up between Kelageri and Narendra will ensure that those travelling between Hubballi and Dharwad will be exempted from paying the toll. Mr. Joshi has said that although the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway was expanded into a six-lane road, the Hubballi-Dharwad bypass had remained a two-lane road, leading to congestion and frequent accidents. Based on the experts’ opinion, the proposal for the widening the bypass was prepared and subsequently Mr Joshi had had taken it up with the Union Government. Rs. 1,200 cr. project The total cost of the project is Rs. 1,200 crore. TheUnion Government has sanctioned Rs. 800 crore for the six-lane expressway and the four-lane service road and another Rs. 400 crore for land acquisition, DPR preparation and allied works. Mr. Joshi has thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari for sanctioning the project. It may be recalled that the frequent accidents on the bypass had led to agitations, particularly after a tragic accident on the road stretch took away the lives of 11 women from Davangere. The accident and the congested road drew the attention of the Supreme Court also, which sought a report from the State Government on the remedial measures taken. However, technical issues had delayed project as the contract for maintenance of the existing bypass and toll collection was still in force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/finally-tender-floated-for-six-lane-hubballi-bypass/article38182684.ece

They accused the Punjab Government of deliberately posing a threat to the Prime Minister’s life for political reasons and demanded that the Congress-led Government be dismissed. The protest marches took place amid the ban on any type of protests and processions under the COVID-19 protocol imposed by the State Government. In Hubballi, BJP Youth Wing members took out a mock funeral procession of Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi from ESI Hospital to the Congress office on Karwar Road. District general secretary of BJP Dattamurthy Kulkarni alleged that the Punjab Government had deliberately stopped the Prime Minister who was proceeding to inaugurate development programmes, through a farmers’ protest. Altercation As the protesters tried to lay seize to the Congress office, the police intercepted them, resulting in an altercation between the two for some time. The police also foiled their attempt to blacken the Congress office premises. The protesters dispersed after burning the effigy. In Dharwad, a demonstration was held seeking imposition of the President’s Rule in Punjab.

She told mediapersons here on Friday that the trend of daily increase of cases was showing the imminent outbreak of the third wave of the pandemic in the district. “The rapid increase of positive cases of COVID-19 in the district shows the clear trend of the imminent third wave of the pandemic. The district currently has 100 positive cases and 15 of the patients are in hospital. Going by the trend during the first and second waves of the pandemic, the number of positive cases is likely to increase rapidly. The district administration is fully prepared to handle the situation,” Ms. Jyothsna said. Ms. Jyothsna said the administration had increased the hospital beds, including the oxygen beds and ICU beds, and made the oxygen plants functional. “The biggest problem we faced during the second wave was the oxygen crisis. To address the issue, we have already commissioned four oxygen generating plants in the public sector — two in ESIC Hospital Complex and two in Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS). There are four more plants in the private sector that will be taken into government possession when required. About 60% of the beds in all taluk hospitals have been converted to oxygen beds and 25% of them are ICU beds. Enough oxygen concentrators and cylinders are in place in every government hospital. Depending upon the requirement and in compliance with the revised guidelines, we will ask private hospitals to reserve 50% of their beds for COVID-19 patients and take them into our possession in compliance with the revised guidelines,” Ms. Jyothsna said. When asked about the enforcement of restriction norms, Ms. Jyothsna said only commercial establishments whose employees had taken two does of vaccination would be allowed to operate. “As per the revised guidelines, commercial establishments have to operate with employees who have been fully vaccinated. We have formed teams to ensure compliance. If we found any establishment operating without its employees having taken two doses of vaccination, they would be closed,” she said.On vaccination, Ms. Jyothsna said 98% of the population in the district had taken the first dose and 70% the second dose. Zilla panchayat chief executive officer Dileesh Sasi was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kalaburagi-administration-ready-to-face-emerging-covid-19-situation-dc/article38182686.ece

SKDRDP Executive Director L.H. Manjunath said the appointments were made on the directions of Dharmasthala Dharmadhikari D. Veerendra Heggade, who was keen on providing the required education in rural areas for economic empowerment of citizens. Mr. Heggade had introduced Jnana Deepa Shikshana scheme through SKDRDP for improving basic amenities and infrastructure in government schools three decades ago. He realised that rural backwardness was mainly due to inequality in education in urban and rural areas because of lack of infrastructure and connectivity, Mr. Manjunath said. At a time when the number of admissions in government schools has considerably increased owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project managers decided to provide teachers to the most needy schools. Of the 730 schools that got honorary teachers, 178 are single-teacher schools, Mr. Manjunath informed. Honorary teachers are provided to schools that have severe shortage of teachers in terms of student-to-teacher ratio. While the facility is a temporary one to tide over the Covid-19 crisis, SKDRDP has been paying honourarium to the appointed teachers. Rs. 9.5 crore has been spent so far on this initiative. Rs. 41 crore has been spent on the Jnana Deepa scheme that seeks to improve amenities and infrastructure in government and grant-in-aid schools across Karnataka. Recently, over 700 sets of bench-desks were provided to government schools in Uttara Kannada and a few north Karnataka districts. Besides engaging in teaching activities, the honorary teachers also visit houses of parents whose children aged between 6 and 14 years have dropped out of schools, to coax them to send the children back to schools. The idea is to ensure they complete at least the 10th class. The teachers also get involved in organising various activities in schools to make them centres of attraction for students, Mr. Manjunath said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/730-schools-in-state-get-honorary-teachers/article38182983.ece

The project, including a parallel bridge on the Phalguni (Gurupura) and a railway underbridge beneath the Mangaluru-Mumbai line, being executed at a cost of Rs. 50 crore, is likely to be completed by May 2023, according to PWD engineers. While the Airport Road is a four-lane concrete stretch from KPT Junction till Marakada, closer to Mangaluru City Corporation border, it is a two-lane bitumen road from Marakada onwards. The construction of a parallel bridge across the Phalguni for the four-lane road project is already in an advanced stage.  PWD Executive Engineer, Mangaluru, S. Yashvanth Kumar told The Hindu that the city corporation will widen the stretch between Marakada and the Welcome Arch on its border, a distance of about 300 metres. The department will continue the four-lane concrete work from its jurisdiction thereafter and take this up to Airport Entry Road.  Discussions are in the final stages with Southern Railway as to who will execute the work of constructing one more railway underbridge at Maravoor, funds for which the department has already kept apart. It may take about a year to complete construction once work is taken up thereby paving way for a complete four-lane corridor between the city and the airport, he said. The department is already in the process of straightening curves between the existing railway underbridge and Airport Entry Road on about a 1-km stretch of the Airport Road that passes adjacent to Sri Devi Institute of Technology. Hill cutting work is under progress that also involves blasting of rocks on the stretch, he said. The project cost of Rs. 50 crore includes the cost for land acquisition, parallel bridge on the Phalguni and the railway underbridge, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/work-to-widen-airport-road-gains-momentum/article38182968.ece

As an added factor, the untimely rains in November-December last year may have a bearing on the production. With the expected fall in production, the fruit is likely to turn expensive, particularly the premium varieties. Horticulture experts are forecasting a yield of about 7 to 8 lakh tonne this year in the State and the early varieties of the fruit are likely to hit the market by March-end or early April with lush flowering noticed in most parts, particularly in Ramanagaram, in December. Last year, the State produced around 15 lakh tonne of mangoes and only half of this production is the forecast for this year. Despite facing problems last year such as rains in May and June and COVID-19 induced lockdowns and so on, farmers managed to overcome difficulties as several of them resorted to direct marketing unlike in 2020 when the situation was entirely different with the outbreak of the pandemic. “Mango growers have now learnt how to overcome the situation after facing a tough year in 2020 over COVID-19. They did not lose much over issues like transportation and so on last year as they resorted to direct marketing which saved them from the adverse situation. I think they are strong now to overcome hurdles,” said horticulture expert S.V. Hittalmani. Mr. Hittalmani said there was sporadic flowering in October-November which is a common phenomenon. “But the flowering in December is more reliable as being the rhythmic cycle since they set into fruits as being noticed in my tour of the mango growing areas. In all probability, the early varieties like raspuri, sindhura, badami etc. are likely to arrive in the markets by March-April,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mango-may-turn-dearer-this-year-as-yield-is-set-to-drop/article38182695.ece

Mr. Bopaiah said he also did not divulge his identity to the caller. He said it appeared that the fraudster was calling after seeing his name as written on the nameboard outside his house. The alleged fraudster called Mr. Bopaiah for the second time on the same evening after a couple of minutes from a different number. The caller, who was speaking in Kannada, disconnected the call after Mr. Bopaiah threatened to take action against him. The return calls made by Mr. Bopaiah to the number went unanswered. However, suspecting that the fraudster could be targeting many others like him and trying to blackmail them, a formal complaint was lodged. The calls were traced to Andhra Pradesh. “The Cyber Crime Police in Bengaluru has taken up the case seriously and is investigating the matter”, Mr. Bopaiah told reporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bopaiah-lodges-complaint-against-telephone-call-demand-for-ransom/article38182995.ece

Growers and wholesalers faced problems in exporting fruits with disruption in flight operations amidst the pandemic. Also, the growers faced problems in harvesting their crop in some areas over untimely rains last year. Domestic markets Fruit flies also added to the woes of farmers. Despite all these reasons, the yield was reasonably good and output catered mostly to the domestic markets with exports hit for various reasons. Farmers were also by and large satisfied over the returns what they got last year in spite of the hurdles like bulk buyers staying away from the major markets for procuring the fruits over lockdowns and curbs imposed on the inter-State travel. Direct marketing Nevertheless, direct marketing or the “farm to home” initiatives of growers helped them overcome the hurdles triggered by the pandemic, said the people familiar to mango marketing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/uncertainty-continues-over-mango-exports/article38182699.ece

The suspension notice was served on Friday to Sneha Latha, HM of the Government High School in Gananguru who had allegedly tried to strip the student. The Deputy Director of Public Instruction of Mandya, Javare Gowda, said that a preliminary inquiry was conducted by the tashildar and the block education officer following which he recommended the HM’s suspension to the Commissioner. The suspension notice was served on Friday, said Mr. Javare Gowda. The HM allegedly locked up the 8th Standard student in another room and tried to undress the girl in a bid to confiscate the phone. The girl informed of the developments and the trauma she endured to her parents who complained to the tashildar and the block education officer.

The CPI (M) central committee, which met here on Friday to finalise the draft political resolution ahead of the party’s national congress at Kannur in Kerala in April, expressed concern over the ‘aggressive manner’ in which the BJP was trying to take forward its Hindutva agenda for the last few years. Issues like Citizenship (Amendment) Act aimed at dividing people on communal lines were being brought forward. At the same time, the BJP government hastened the implementation of neo-liberal policies as could be seen from privatisation of public sector companies and initiatives like national monetisation pipeline for further diluting the existing policies in favour of corporates. The party feels that there is widespread opposition to the policies adopted by the BJP government as could be seen from the agitations launched by various sections. Cong. facing issues This calls for the need to evolve an alternative that could carry out struggles against the government in a sustained manner. In this context, the central committee is understood to have felt that though the Congress, being the main Opposition, was expected to take the lead, it was facing its own weaknesses. The Congress faces organisational issues as could be seen by the manner in which it could not elect its president. “The party (Congress) is apparently afraid that it will lose Hindu votes if it raises voice against the Hindutva agenda of BJP. Moreover, it is taking opportunistic stand in different States rather than taking regional parties together for building up a formidable Opposition,” a panel member said. CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the draft political resolution would be put in the public domain for one month inviting suggestions and amendments before the final resolution is adopted in the national congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpi-m-to-strengthen-party-from-grass-roots-level/article38182783.ece

Shortage of workers for harvesting is a major concern for farmers in the district, and the arrival of harvesting machines from Salem in Tamil Nadu was their mainstay. But the dearth of harvesting machines this season has driven thousands of farmers in Panamaram, Kottathara, Meenangadi, Mananthavady, Thirunelli, Thariyodu, Noolpuzha, Vellamunda, Padinharethara, Sulthan Bathery, Nenmeni, Muttil and Ambalavayal grama panchayats into crisis. “Though the machines had reached the district by the end of November as usual, farmers could not utilise them owing to unseasonal rain,” said Praseed Kumar Thayyil, a progressive farmer from Nambikolli. Since around 70% of the machines that reached the district were wheel drive harvesters, farmers could not use them for harvest in waterlogged paddy fields. Now, the services of the remaining harvesters are available in the district, he added. Meanwhile, farmers complained that middlemen who brought the machines from Salem had been exploiting them by demanding exorbitant charges for the machines. “Last year, we had paid Rs. 2,200 a machine for an hour’s harvest. Now, middlemen are charging Rs. 2,700 to Rs. 3,000,” a farmer said. Though Nenmeni and Noolpuzha grama panchayats had fixed the charge of the harvester at Rs. 2,500 an hour, farmers were forced to pay Rs. 2,750 after middlemen tried to shift the machines to other parts of the district. “I had paid Rs. 8,500 to workers for harvesting on my land owing to shortage of machines,” said Gopi Keezhanikkal, a farmer from Meenangadi. Moreover, the daily wages of women workers too went up considerably this year from Rs. 350 to Rs. 400 a day. Though the district panchayat owns two harvesters, farmers never get them in time, he added.  District panchayat president Samshad Markkar told The Hindu that steps would be taken to address issues facing the farming community next season. “We are planning to procure some more harvesters next season and adopt steps to minimise the involvement of middlemen,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shortage-of-harvesting-machines-puts-farmers-in-a-fix/article38182799.ece

Jayarajan has warned against removing the survey stones laid for the SilverLine project. In his Facebook post, Mr. Jayarajan issued a veiled threat that those who remove the stones should watch out for their safety. He accused Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran of instigating people against the SilverLine project and encouraging miscreants to remove survey stones at Madayipara recently. Mr. Jayarajan said that K-Rail project was one of the major projects of the UDF manifesto of 2011 and Emerging Kerala of 2012. Ramesh Chennithala was the KPCC president and Oommen Chandy the Chief Minister then. Both of them were now silent on the K-Rail project, which was envisaged in their time. The evidence for the fact that the UDF had conceived the high-speed rail project had come out. So, it was not easy to get their own cadres to remove the stones. Hence, the KPCC president had deployed goons to dig up the stones, he said. He said that the people who were interested in development were not against the SilverLine project. Mr. Jayarajan said that the Mumbai-Ahmedabad and Delhi-Varanasi high-speed rail projects had already been approved and some had been completed. BJP slammed The people had realised the double standard of the BJP, which was favouring development work in the States ruled by it but stood against such projects in Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/jayarajan-warns-against-uprooting-survey-stones/article38182823.ece

The submissions were made when two writ petitions filed by James Alex and others from Kottayam challenging the demarcation of boundaries of land for the project came up for hearing before Justice N. Nagaresh. The petitioners contended that as per Section 20A of the Railways Act, only the Central government and its instrumentalities were empowered to issue notifications for acquisition, survey, measurement and valuation of land for any special railway project. Counsel for Railways submitted that, in fact, it had given in-principle approval for the project being implemented by the Kerala Rail Development Corporation (K-Rail), a joint venture company between the State government and the Railway Ministry. Railways had a share of 49% in the company. The counsel submitted that the State government could go ahead with the survey and acquisition proceeding for the project under the LARR Act (Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act), since the project was not a special one as contemplated under the Railways Act. The State government submitted that the survey and demarcation of boundaries of land were only preliminary works ahead of land acquisition. Besides, it was not a special project of Railways. Therefore, the provisions of the Railways Act were not applicable while implementing the project. The petitioners contended that the special project included all railway projects, including SilverLine. Therefore, the Central government alone was competent to issue the notifications for survey and proceeding for land acquisition. The powers under the Railways Act had not been delegated to the State government. Therefore, the orders issued by the State government for the survey and demarcation of land for the project amounted to usurping the powers of the Central government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-needs-no-central-nod-for-k-rail-survey-railways/article38182879.ece

This is the picture emerging of the sequence of events as the special investigation team (SIT) probing the incident pieces together the happenings from that stormy night with the help of statements from the accused and witnesses. As the fight got out of hand, security guards could hardly control it and had no other alternative but to alert the police, sources associated with the investigation said. Investigators continue to collect the statements of as many people as possible who were at the scene on the night. Interrogation The police have so far only sought and received the custodial interrogation of just four, supposedly key accused in the incident, out of the 174 arrested in connection with the incident. “We haven’t felt the need for seeking the custody of more accused. Though we have 90 days’ time to file the chargesheet, we will try to wrap up the investigation and file it as soon as possible,” said investigation sources. The Kunnathunadu police had registered two First Information Reports, one each for the assault of inspector V.T. Shajan and for the arson and damage of public properties worth around Rs. 12.05 lakh arraigning in a total of 300 identifiable persons. Among the charges invoked in the FIRs were IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 147 (rioting) and relevant sections of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. The accused allegedly attacked Mr. Shajan with sticks and stones while shouting out to ‘kill him.’ He was allegedly hit on his back and head inflicting a fracture on his left arm. They also allegedly assaulted Sivadasan, assistant sub inspector, of Kunnathunadu police, civil police officer Rejeesh and grade sub inspector Sajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/altercation-between-migrants-led-to-kizhakkambalam-violence/article38182859.ece

In addition, three additional tracks have been envisaged in between Ernakulam Town and Ernakulam Junction stations as part of the third track project. This will result in there being two tracks from Ernakulam Town towards Kottayam and another three leading to Ernakulam Junction. This would decongest the corridor linking the two stations, by segregating trains moving in either direction, sources said. The Shoranur yard will be remodelled by adding a track or more towards Palakkad and by constructing a new bridge over Bharathapuzha. In addition, yard arrangements will be readied in Ernakulam for laying a fourth track in the long term, it is learnt. The survey will shed light on the extent of land that is needed for the new platform at Ernakulam Town and the additional tracks that have been envisaged in the rail corridor leading to Ernakulam Junction. The Thrissur Railway Passengers’ Association had expressed concern at trains being detained at Shoranur and Vallathol Nagar, since the around a kilometre-long Shoranur Station-Bharathapuzha corridor remains single track. “The development of the Shoranur yard is crucial to change the situation and speed up train movement,” said P. Krishnakumar, general secretary of the association. The platform reception capacity at Ernakulam Junction is expected to be improved in tandem with the Rs. 400-crore project that will shortly be taken up on Public-Private Partnership basis. This is as part of augmenting passenger amenities. Many platforms here still do not have the capacity to receive trains having 24 coaches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ernakulam-town-railway-station-could-get-one-more-platform/article38182856.ece

According to government criteria, engines up to 10 years old alone will be issued fresh permits. It implies that thousands of vessels that fail the test will be out of the list of those eligible for subsidised kerosene through the Public Distribution System or Matsyafed. Vessels that were granted permits in 2012 and are still in operation will be among those losing permits under the new stipulations, said Charles George of Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedhi on Thursday. The fishing community had requested the government through several representations to fix the permit period for 15 years, but the government has not responded so far, he added. He said union members had met Fisheries Joint Secretary Asha Augustine on Thursday and conveyed their apprehension over the government move. According to him, as many as 158 vessels were issued permits in Ernakulam in 2015. Since then, over 200 had joined the fleet. Of them, only 148 have so far applied for permit renewal, which indicates that the rest may have already gone out of business, he added. Fishing vessels with outboard engines have been receiving a specific quantity of subsidised kerosene over the last three decades. The government has been slashing the quantum of subsidised kerosene supply to the fisheries sector following a World Trade Organisation recommendation that no fuel subsidy be offered to fishing vessels. A portion of subsidised kerosene distributed through Supplyco has been reserved for fishing vessels. However, the volume has been drastically reduced. While 600 litres of subsidised kerosene used to be given to an engine or a vessel per month two decades ago, the volume has been cut down to 129 litres. The volume of kerosene is not even enough to meet a day’s fuel need, claimed Mr. George. The subsidised quantum has now been further reduced to 40 to 60 litres per month, he added. Meanwhile, fishers said the decision of the Fisheries department not to renew permits for boats owned by those above 60 years old would result in livelihood issues. While boats will go out of business, their owners will be totally banned from engaging in fishing operations, Mr. George said. The fishing community, in a recent memorandum to the Chief Minister, had requested him to make State agencies intervene to end black marketing of kerosene.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-urged-to-review-decision-on-permit-renewal-for-fishing-boats/article38182854.ece

With this, KMRL will be able to generate about 3,000 units of power per day, helping the agency meet 42% of its total power requirements by itself. The metro agency is planning to produce an additional 2 MW of power by 2022 by setting up solar panels in Muttom track area and the nearby land area. “KMRL intends to develop the use of solar energy in an inclusive manner to ensure its maximum usage from the available solar potential in this region since the metro operations are solely dependent on electrical power,” Mr. Behera said.

A detailed project report based on the survey will be submitted to the Railway Board for its approval later this year. Trains would be able to travel at up to 130 kmph along the new track, in comparison with the maximum existing speed of 110 kmph (but average speed still hovers at 45 kmph) on select stretches in the State. The project, which is currently estimated to cost Rs. 1,500 crore, could cost anything up to Rs. 5,000 crore depending on the outcome of the survey which would help fix an alignment. The alignment will be located 50 m to 100 m away from the alignment of the existing tracks in places where there are steep curves. This would considerably flatten the curves. The Railways might also have to acquire the leftover land between new and old tracks in such places, informed sources said. The new track will ensure much faster commute since it will link minimal number of railway stations. This may even mean skipping a few major railway stations that are located away from the corridor. Each stop slows down the speed of trains by around 7 minutes, the time taken for acceleration and deceleration. Once realised, it is expected that trains like Rajdhani Express, Duronto Express and Jansatabdhi Express, which have limited number of stops, would be routed through the new track, it is learnt. More corridors The Railways would commence survey of the Kayamkulam-Thiruvananthapuram and the Shoranur-Mangaluru/Palakkad corridors to lay third track soon after. There would be little need for third tracks through Kottayam and Alappuzha in the foreseeable future since track doubling through the stretches is set to get over by March this year and March 2024 respectively, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/survey-for-laying-rail-track-begins/article38182804.ece

He, however, had turned approver later. The accused, identified as Vishnu Aravind, 33, of HMT Colony in Kalamassery, was arrested in the early morning hours of Wednesday while allegedly attempting to steal a motorcycle parked under the Edappally flyover. On being cornered by a police team, he stabbed Girish Kumar, an assistant sub-inspector attached with the Elamakkara police, on his hand. “During the course of the interrogation, it emerged that he was the 10th accused in the actor assault case who had later turned approver. In fact, he was very active in motorcycle lifting and chain snatching between 2011 and 2015 and has 18 cases against his name. The cases are under various stages of the trial,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). He wasn’t directly involved in the incident but got linked with the case after being lodged with ‘Pulsar’ Suni, the first accused, in the jail. He had allegedly handed over a letter from actor Dileep, another accused in the case, to Suni. In the instant case, the city police have registered two cases against Vishnu who is remanded in judicial custody. He was booked under IPC Section 379 (theft) in one case and under IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) in the other. Recent twist The actor assault case sprung back into life following the recent revelations by Balachandrakumar, who claims to be Dileep’s friend. In an interview to channels, he said he had seen ‘Pulsar’ Suni at the residence of Dileep. He said it was Dileep’s brother Anoop who introduced Suni to him in December 2016 at the actor’s residence in Aluva. He also alleged that Dileep had obtained a copy of the video on the sexual assault of the actor even before it was produced in the court. The Ernakulam Additional Special Sessions Judge Honey M.

They come at a high price, which leads to an increase in fodder price too. Measures will be taken to stop this. The land of Devaswom Board and Agriculture Department will be used to cultivate fodder,” she said. Planting material for a fodder grass cultivation project, which is being implemented through Kudumbashree units, was distributed during the event. The workshop presented various schemes of the Centre and State for milk production and entrepreneurship development. Pathanapuram block panchayat president A. Anandavalli presided while Jose James, Managing Director, KLDB, Vilakudy panchayat president Adabia Nasser, block panchayat member C. Sajeevan and Urban Bank Director G.R. Rajeevan were present.

The corporation had been trying to get the sanction for brewing home-grown feni and market it as a premium alcoholic beverage for several years. “There were many hurdles, including restrictions, in producing or selling cashew liquor in any State other than Goa. But the new policies of the Centre and State promote value-added agricultural products and the situation has changed. We are expecting approvals from all departments concerned, including the Excise, soon. The KSCDC will be the first public sector company to come up with such a project,” says Chairman S. Jayamohan. Since Kerala is a State with high per capita alcohol consumption, the cashew-based alcoholic beverage is expected to get good acceptance. As per a feasibility report prepared by the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organisation Ltd., the main objectives of the project include revival of the cashew sector in Kerala, employment generation, and supporting cashew farmers. Unit at Vadakara The KSCDC is planning to convert its cashew factory at Vadakara with a land area of nearly three acres into a manufacturing unit. “Kannur and Kasaragod districts collectively contribute more than 65% of the total cashew cultivation area in the State and it was decided to establish the unit at a nearby place with required infrastructure,” adds Mr.Jayamohan. The plant capacity of the Rs. 13-crore project will be three lakh litres per annum and the product will be sold as one litre bottles. At present, eight States, including Kerala, are into commercial cultivation of cashew and a considerable number of farmers depend on the crop. The KSCDC is procuring cashew apple directly from farmers for its value-added products, including soda, jam, and juice. “We usually don’t get enough raw material to meet the demand and this year we have already started an intensive procurement drive. During the last few years, the corporation and the Kerala State Agency for the expansion of Cashew Cultivation (KSACC) had distributed lakhs of saplings and soon there will be a notable difference in domestic production too,” says Mr.Jaymohan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kscdc-may-brew-cashew-liquor/article38182878.ece

The exhibition that began at the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi Art Gallery in Kozhikode on January 2 is an ode to that woman who forced the artist to overcome her deepest conditionings regarding the body. Until then, Sara had viewed the body, especially the female body, as “a space of fear, a certain kind of taboo, and a nameless shame that is meant for open view.” The woman posed for her in the nude, wearing just a turban veil, making the artist struck by the beauty and, at the same time, experiencing a sense of shock. What the Body Says... is modelled on that woman, along with Onyx Poulose, Sara’s mentor, in quite unromantic and asexual poses, unlike the popular depiction of nudity. Sara calls her characters ‘Yaksha’ and ‘Yakshini’. However, Yakshini here does the day-to-day household chores such as mopping the floor, washing undergarments, or better yet sighing in relief as she sits in a corner with a few morsels on her plate, exhausted from a day’s work. On the other hand, Yaksha gets ready for the bath, wiping his head after a bath, or sometimes idly sitting in an armchair doing nothing, wearing a quite unimpressive dhoti. In another painting, he is lying in a near fetal position wearing a small loin cloth, as would a newborn baby, opposite Yakshini who faces him in the same position. The faces of the characters are concealed in most pictures for a reason. “When we look at someone, we invest identity only on that person’s face, especially the eyes,” Sara says, adding that the face being covered “opened awareness fully to the majesty, the simplicity, and sheer power of presence of the body.” The expo, opened by artist-curator Bose Krishnamachari, will conclude on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/the-majesty-of-the-body-in-paint/article38182795.ece

The move comes in the wake of the rising number of complaints from environmental activists, who have been up in arms against the alleged nexus between large-scale quarry operators and influential politicians. Many vehicles, including trucks, earth movers, and compressors, used in granite quarries were recently impounded as part of the continuing legal action. The seized vehicles were taken to the Thamarassery taluk office on Wednesday despite resistance from owners. They will be released only on payment of fine for compounding the offence. Revenue officials said they had shut down an unlicensed quarry near the Vanaparvam biodiversity park at Kakkavayal in Puthuppady village. Besides taking legal action against the quarry owners, heavy machines used for breaking granite were impounded, they added. Meanwhile, local environmental activists alleged that the Geology department had failed to report the damage caused by illegal quarries. According to them, a number of houses near such a quarry had developed cracks, and the matter was casually handled by Geology department officials. “A report submitted by the Geology department to the Human Rights Commission on the impact of quarrying at Kolamala in Thamarassery was a surprise to many, thanks to strange findings. According to the report, it was not the impact of quarrying but the poor quality of construction that resulted in cracks on the walls,” said an activist. He pointed out that the report came at a time when local residents were fighting for justice. Sources in the department said the report was forwarded to the rights panel with accurate facts and figures on the basis of field-level inspections. The authenticity of the findings could be verified by the higher authorities through re-inspection, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/revenue-squad-holds-flash-checks-at-quarries/article38182819.ece

Noted filmmaker Srikumar Menon spoke to the Corporation Council on Friday to explain the proposal submitted to the corporation by his marketing firm Push 360, which had worked behind the Kochi International Half Marathon in 2014 and 2015. “Kozhikode has a greater scope for a branding event to the scale of an International Marathon, with at least 200 brands with an annual turnover of Rs. 200 crore hailing from North Kerala”, he said, adding that the Marathon would help Kozhikode claim the place that it deserves in the business map of the world. Mr. Menon said the corporation would have no financial liability even if the Marathon did not turn out to be a financial success. On the other hand, the corporation would get a share of the profit besides royalty from TV rights and such. “The marathon will be accredited by the International Olympic Committee, International Marathon Association and the Indian Athletic Federation, and hence, the best performances of the athletes will be on record internationally”, he said. Meanwhile, boxer Mary Kom and actor Tovino Thomas are likely to be the brand ambassadors of the event. Corporation Councillors approved the proposal with minor conditions. Congress Councillor K.C.Shobhita asked the firm to specifically outline the benefits to the corporation through the marathon while Health Standing Committee chairperson S. Jayasree wanted to know how much of the decision-making powers would rest on the corporation.

A dozen women sculptors from across the country are busy chiselling away at large granite blocks, turning them into exquisite sculptures of endless art value.  The excitement was palpable on the faces of each sculptor when The Hindu visited the symposium on Friday. They beamed in pride as they were part of the country’s first all-women sculpture camp.  The Ahalia national women’s granite sculpture symposium, which began on December 15 and is to conclude in a few days, is the seventh in a series of sculpture camps organised as part of developing Ahalia Sculpture Park. “The response from the women sculptors has been wonderful. We are developing the sculpture park with ‘celebration of womanhood’ as the theme,” said R.V.K. Varma, symposium director and Ahalia Sculpture Park consultant. When Arti Vijay Kadam from Maharashtra gave shape to Gandhari, Malayali sculptor Harsha Valsan was giving finishing touches to Anasooya. Her friends Ajitha was working on Vasavadatta, Celin Jacob on Uloopi, Chitra on Shikhandi, Sabitha Kadannappally on Shakuntala, and Shilpa T.K. on Gargi. Deepika Gauthami from Delhi has worked on Holika, Jyothi Bharati from Bengaluru on Kunthi, Renu Bala from Punjab on Vishvavara, Sonu Aggarwal from Jammu on Lopamudra, and Vijaya Chauhan from Chattisgarh on Ghosha. “We are enjoying the artistic freedom that we get in giving shape to each character in celebration of womanhood,” said Jyothi Bharati. Wonderful experience “It has been a wonderful experience. Even when we celebrate womanhood, this symposium has been a reassertion that women are no way behind in the art of granite sculpture,” said Harsha Valsan. Sabitha Kadannappally from Kannur found an unmatched opportunity to express herself at the symposium. “It is the first time that such an exclusive camp is being organised in the country,” she said, expressing her gratitude to the team Ahalia. For Chitra and Deepika Gauthami, it was the fifth and third sculpture camp respectively on the Ahalia campus. Yet they were excited. “For young artistes, such symposiums throw open wonderful opportunities,” they said. Wearing thick masks and protective goggles, the women sculptors were soon engrossed in their world of art. Undeterred by the scorching sun, their tanned hands continued to move nimbly along the rugged granite blocks in celebration of womanhood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/women-hone-their-craft-at-sculpture-camp/article38182936.ece

About his experience with various sports, Sharad said, “I for sure did not know that high jump was going to make it so good for me. I chose it because high jump called me. I was playing cricket, football and table tennis. I gave myself openly to the sport, and never said I am only good in football or cricket and thus will not play this sport. I saw how every game had an impact; chess made me mentally strong, football gave me agility, and high jump told me what physics and science is. I went for sports as I loved it and didn't make a compulsion out of it.” Besides love and passion for sport, it was also important to follow a disciplined life, he said. “The only shortcut to a good and successful life is eating on time, sleeping, following discipline, and not leaving things halfway.” Sharad also interacted with the students on the importance of a balanced diet and fitness. Role of food “Food doesn’t need to be expensive to give you nutrients. Even inexpensive food items can give you the nutrients you require. So have every food item, big or small, expensive or inexpensive. Just check it has the nutritional content that you require.” Sharad, who is a Sports Authority of India (SAI) coach, gave up-and-coming athletes tips on being better high jumpers and displayed his skills in table tennis. The ‘Meet the Champions’ initiative is part of the government’s ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ that was kicked off by Olympic gold medallist Neeraj Chopra in December last year and then taken forward by Olympic bronze medallist Bajrang Punia and sailors Varun Thakkar and K.C.

The one-year-and-three-months-old tiger cub, who was found abandoned in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR), was recently diagnosed with infantile cataract. Nevertheless, the Forest department is pulling out all the stops to prepare its adopted daughter returned to her natural habitat in the pink of health. An expert panel has recommended importing lanosterol-based eye drops from the United States to treat Mangala. It could be the first time in the country that lanosterol, a drug based on a naturally-occurring steroid, is being administered on a wild animal. Mangala was just two months old when she was rescued in frail condition near the Mangala Devi temple close to the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border at PTR in November 2019. The cub, which weighed 4 kg, was believed to have been abandoned by her mother. Ever since, it has come under the protection of the forest authorities in the State. It currently weighs around 40 kg. Special enclosure The department had commenced efforts to ‘re-wild’ the animal in accordance with the protocol laid down by the National Tiger Conservation Authority in July last. In a bid to familiarise the animal with the environment of a natural forest, the cub was shifted to a special enclosure spread over nearly half a hectare and trained to hunt its prey with a target of releasing it into the wild when it completed two years. Final decision However, its diagnosis of cataract has thrown a spanner in the works. A six-member expert committee, which included four veterinarians, examined the animal and has recommended lanosterol to treat the illness, said P.P. Pramod, field director (PTR), Kottayam. However, the final decision will have to be made by the Chief Wildlife Warden, he added Chief forest veterinary officer Arun Zachariah said the difficulties associated with undertaking the conventional cataract surgery on animals prompted the panel to opt for the eye drops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tiger-cub-to-get-cataract-treatment/article38182938.ece

The police had launched a witch hunt against those who publicly criticised the Sangh. “They (Kerala police) are worse than their counterparts in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh,” he said. The police had incarcerated scores of persons for condemning the divisive politics of the RSS. Mr. Sattar said the CPI(M) district conferences in Malappuram, Pathanamthitta and Idukki had flagged the “pervasive influence” of the RSS over the police. ‘An RSS cell’ CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and CPI leader Annie Raja had spotlighted the force’s RSS presence. BJP State president K. Surendran had claimed that an RSS cell worked in the State law enforcement. Mr. Sattar alleged that the police had made a youth chant ‘Jai Sriram’ and ‘Vande Mataram’ in custody. The RSS elements in the police detained the PFI Thrissur district secretary because he publicly disavowed the Hindu majoritarian politics of the Sangh Parivar. In contrast, the police had turned a blind eye to RSS persons who openly urged violence against minorities. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan headed the Home department. But the RSS elements in the polcie force were using the uniform to push the Sangh Parivar’s agenda, Mr. Sattar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-abetting-rss-agenda-says-pfi/article38182947.ece

It is also the government’s policy to encourage children in every possible way, Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty has said. He was speaking after inaugurating the ‘Pratibhasangamam’ and award presentation organised by the district panchayat here on Friday. The Minister said the government’s attempt was to conduct annual examinations on time so that children could become eligible to appear for competitive examinations. He said if an academic year was declared as zero, it meant one year lost in the duration of children’s education. The State government, despite many protests, was determined to hold examinations with the support of the General Education Department, teachers and parents and did so successfully. Students also got an opportunity to post good results, he said. The district panchayat, Mr. Sivankutty said, was implementing a number of model programmes in the education sector. He presented gifts to students who had secures full marks in Plus Two examinations. Students who got A+ in all subjects in SSLC and Plus Two examinations were honoured by MLAs G. Stephen and I.B.

Her paintings are a riot of colour. The cheerful hues of yellow, orange, red, green and blue lift your mood. Oceans 2 is the 12th show across the Deccan plateau by Ms. Michael, an assistant professor at Jain (Deemed-to-be University), Bengaluru. Art to her is an extension of her true self in creative forms. “Every painting of mine is a portrait of self-love. I don’t paint with grey. Yellow is my shade of hope. My perfect colour for happiness. If I struggle with words and if I fail to express my love, I prefer blue. Blue stands for dreams,” says Ms. Michael, who hails from Mattom in Thrissur district, about her experiments with colours. Oceans 2 is based on her own poem, dedicated to help the public “re-perceive” the oceans and water bodies as we them see now and how they will change our tomorrow, according to Ms. Michael, who holds a doctorate from the University of Madras in Chemical Disaster Management. Over 100 works The original series had 100-plus works, which had been displayed in some major galleries. The ongoing exhibition in Thrissur comprises 50 paintings from the collection. The styles of her art are contemporary, abstract and surreal. Her artworks bear Franco-German characteristics as well. Her mentor is the noted Berlin-based artist Alexander Jackert. The exhibition will conclude on January 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/capturing-seas-on-canvas-in-all-their-vivid-hues/article38183143.ece

In Super Sharanya , at least in its enjoyable initial portions, the gaze is from the inside, with the script portraying the bonding between a group of young women in an engineering college. Yet, for a movie that sets out with such sure steps, and a seeming intent, the way it squanders it all in the latter half comes as quite a disappointment.  Sharanya (Anaswara Rajan), a girl of low self-esteem, arrives at an engineering college away from her home, only to find the situation there even worse for someone like her. Ragging from seniors and her own apprehensions of how she is perceived by others drag her down. However, a bunch of hostel mates gives her some level of confidence. But more problems await her, with some men, including a senior and a professor, developing feelings for her. Parallels with debut  Filmmaker Girish A.D. had made a rather sparkling debut with Thanneer Mathan Dinangal , in which he showed that he has quite a grasp on how youngsters think and behave. The second outing almost gives one the feeling that he has begun from where he left off, with the protagonist Sharanya having much in similarity to Jaison from the first film. Not to forget, the crazy bunch of friends around her, especially Sona (Mamitha Baiju) who is constantly exasperated by Sharanya’s naivety.  Initially, the film gives us the idea of being a different kind, one in which the women are not reduced to being mere love interests. The scriptwriter has even created a hilarious caricature of a toxic man, similar in looks and behaviour to the much-celebrated ‘Arjun Reddy’. The lecturer who constantly pesters his student with a marriage proposal is also not portrayed kindly. Yet, Sharanya does not have much of an identity or existence beyond that of the object of desire of almost all the consequential male characters in the film. She is even shown falling for Deepu (Arjun Ashokan), who might not be an Arjun Reddy, but is domineering and senseless in his own way. Aimless meandering While the first half is quite pacy, with a good dose of humour, the script meanders aimlessly later on, not even justifying the run-time of 164 minutes. Much time is spent on Sharanya’s relationship with Deepu, their constant confusions, fights and patch-ups, all of which reduce the film to being a typical old-school romantic drama, only topped by a disappointing climax that appears to have been written to satisfy mainstream cinema compulsions.  Though Super Sharanya is partly enjoyable, it misses the spark or sensibility that marked Girish’s debut.  S.R.

Announcing this after chairing a meeting held to review the State’s preparedness in tackling the third wave, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the system of universal pass for fully vaccinated citizens will initially be introduced in BBMP limits and then extended in a phased manner across the State. “We are discussing with IT companies and our experts from the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on introducing this universal pass,” he said. The universal pass can be used for entry into offices, factories, banks, cinemas and auditoria, shopping malls and complexes, airports, gyms, pubs and bars, swimming pools, hotels and restaurants, wedding halls, zoos, parks and even places of worship, the Minister said. The TAC had last month recommended introduction of universal vaccine pass for fully vaccinated persons as it would help in better monitoring of vaccination status of people at the entry points. Tele-triaging Reiterating that hospital admissions will henceforth happen only through tele-triaging, the Minister said 10,000 house surgeons and nursing students will be roped in for this. To avoid a second wave like situation when there was an influx of even mild and asymptomatic patients into hospitals depriving critical patients of timely medical care, the State Government will not allow walk-ins into hospitals. “Only those who require admission will be triaged into hospitals. This will help in making beds available for critical patients, who require admission. It will also reduce the burden on hospitals,” he said. The Minister said this rule will be applicable for all citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/universal-vaccine-pass-for-fully-vaccinated-citizens-in-karnataka-soon/article38182412.ece

Chandrababu Naidu on Friday asserted that he would comfortably retain his constituency of Kuppam in the next Assembly elections and become Chief Minister once again. “The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government and its leaders resorted to the mean tactic of trying to create a divide between me and the people of Kuppam, which will never happen,” Mr. Naidu said at a press conference in Kuppam on the second day of his three-day visit to the constituency. The TDP chief accused Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy of undermining administrative systems in the State. “The TDP has embarked on a ‘Dharma Poratam’ to salvage the State from the YSRCP leaders’ atrocities against people. I request people to lend support to the struggle,” he said. Mr. Naidu said that the TDP had in the past won elections by being in an alliance with other political parties as well as by contesting alone. “The possibility of forming an alliance will depend upon the ground-level circumstances,” he said. He said that the people of Andhra Pradesh have realised that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government has led the State into a debt trap, and was encouraging hooliganism. Mr. Naidu alleged that the government was hand-in-glove with the liquor, sand and granite mafia. The TDP chief said that he would not rest until Minister for Panchayat Raj Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy is defeated in Punganur Assembly constituency. Earlier, Mr. Naidu had inaugurated an oxygen plant worth Rs. 50 lakh at the Government Area Hospital at Kuppam. The equipment for the plant was donated by the NTR Memorial Trust. “To join the fight against COVID, the NTR Memorial Trust has come forward with the noble gesture of donating oxygen plants. The plants at Mahabubabad in Telangana and Tekkali in A.P. would be functional shortly,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/will-retain-kuppam-become-chief-minister-again-says-naidu/article38183086.ece

Former MD and CEO of APSSDC Ganta Subba Rao and former director of APSSDC K. Lakshminarayana were sent to judicial remand and were later released on bail. The Special Investigation Team of the Crime Investigation Department (CID) has accused Mr. Subba Rao and Mr. Lakshminarayana of conniving with Soumyadri Shekhar Bose, Vikas Vinayak Khanvelkar and brought the concept of grant-in-aid in the Siemens project and sent proposals to the government as if the SISW and DesignTech would contribute 90% share as grant-in-kind and government had to contribute only 10%. “The MD and CEO of APSSDC sent proposals to the government for permitting to enter into an agreement by mentioning the project cost at Rs. 3,356 crore and percentage share of government at 10%, and percentage share of technology partners as 90% without any logic and rationale for arriving at the total cost of the project,” said a senior official of the SIT. Later, the government issued an order in June 2015 according permission to APSSDC to enter into an MoU with Siemens Industry Software (India) Pvt., Ltd., New Delhi, and DesignTech, Pune, for setting up skill development centres. As per the GO, the cost of each cluster was Rs. 546.84 crore and the Siemens and DesignTech had to contribute 90% of the project cost as grant-in-aid and the remaining 10% had to be contributed by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The 10% of the government contribution comes to Rs. 370.78 crore, including taxes. The total cost of the APSSDC-SIEMENS Project was Rs. 3,281.05 crore. The APSSDC released its 10% contribution amounting to Rs. 371 crore to DesignTech in advance without executing any work and providing any services by the technology partners and even before identifying the educational institutions. Interest not factored in The interest accrued on the advance fund given was never factored in, the official said. The SIT further turned its attention on two officers, Aparna Upadhyayula, IAS U.P. cadre, wife of G.V.S. Bhaskar Prasad (key person of Siemens Project of A.P.), who was appointed as deputy CEO of APSSDC, reportedly against the AIS rules. It was reportedy further established that the technology partners spent a meagre amount of around Rs. 130 crore of the 10% government contribution of Rs. 371 crore for the entire project. This was far less than the total project cost estimated at Rs. 3,356 crores, and the technology partners (SISW and A-4/DesignTech) allegedly diverted the remaining amount of around Rs. 241 crores by raising fake invoices and falsely represented and shown as if they had completed the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/noose-around-accused-in-skill-development-scam-tightens/article38183087.ece

This was decided on the last day of the RSS coordination meeting at Rashtriya Vidya Kendra at Annojiguda on Friday. Their history will be told in the form of plays by Samskara Bharati, an RSS affiliated organisation. During the meeting, the participants exchanged their experiences at the field level and discussed about issues that need to be addressed. No resolutions were passed as every organisation works independently. RSS joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya said that swayamsevaks were working in various sectors of the society. Talks were held on malnutrition in children, initiatives for employment generation and measures for India-centric education. About 10 lakh people in 6,000 development blocks across the nation were trained by the RSS to face the third wave of COVID, he said. “One lakh to 1.5 lakh youths per year are expressing their interest to join RSS,” he said, adding that 55,000 branches were presently functioning. “Diversity should not be seen as differences. India’s tradition speaks of spiritual oneness. The National Education Policy (NEP) has expressed our spiritual diversity from across the country. It should reflect Indian history and spiritual values,” he said. Meanwhile, he condemned the recent incident that took place in Punjab, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was stuck on a highway for sometime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rss-to-bring-to-limelight-unsung-heroes/article38182368.ece

People have put him on the seat of power but now he is hitting back at them. How much more corruption will you do? Will you eat up the entire Telangana,” he questioned, at a meeting held to welcome TS party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar at the party office. Jubilant scenes were witnessed at the Nampally office when Mr. Sanjay Kumar came from Karimnagar for the first time after his release from the jail as leaders and party workers jostled with one another to greet him. Mr. Chouhan, as the chief guest for the homecoming meeting, said TS people have already made up their mind and are gearing up to throw out the TRS government of power in the next elections. “We will have to keep up our fight against this dynastic, corrupt, tyrannical family rule for the next two years to form our own government. Nothing can stop the lotus from blooming here and saffron flag from being hoisted,” he claimed. The BJP leader said he has been a four term CM of MP, yet he had never behaved like Mr. Rao, who into his second term, had given posts to family members including son, nephew and ‘probably the daughter too’ soon. The TRS “undemocratic and dictatorial attitude” against political opponents, even thrashing them with help of police and putting them in jail will not be tolerated by the BJP and the party will not rest till the government is kicked out, he vowed. The Chief Minister of Telangana owes an explanation to the people about why he could not fulfil the promises made like giving — three acres to Dalits, free education from KG to PG, unemployment stipends, double bedroom houses and so on. Mr. Sanjay Kumar said the party’s agitation in support of the employees, teachers and others for the withdrawal of GO 317 pertaining to zonal transfers will continue and urged the affected groups to support the party. “How long will you suffer silently while your union leaders have become stooges of Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao. Join us in the protests to teach this CM a lesson. As soon as our government is formed we will throw these arbitrary orders out,” he said. Neither the BJP leaders nor the cadre are worried about going to jail for the just cause any number of times, he claimed and warned that KCR too will be ‘put behind bars for corruption’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/will-you-eat-up-entire-telangana-asks-chouhan/article38182370.ece

Raghavendra is in the eye of the storm following serious allegations of abetting a debt-ridden businessman Ramakrishna to commit suicide along with his wife and two daughters in Old Paloncha on Monday. Ramakrishna’s selfie video, in which he squarely blamed Raghava for driving him to take the extreme decision unable to digest his "ulterior motives" targeting his wife, sparked public outcry. Polic3e had put a notice outside the residence of Raghava in old Paloncha town on Thursday night. In the notice Raghava was summoned to report before the investigating officer (Manuguru ASP) at 12.30 pm on Friday in connection with the probe into suicide abetment case . However, he did not turn up before the investigating officer Earlier in the day, the JAC representing various Opposition parties observed a bandh in Kothagudem constituency demanding the arrest of Raghava and resignation of his father Vanama Venkateshwar Rao as Kothagudem MLA.

Alapu Giri (25) had ended his life in his house at Balupulapeta village under Samarlakota police station limits. His family had since been alleging that police harassment drove Giri to suicide. Immediately after the incident, Giri’s parents had staged a protest along with his body in front of the Samarlakota police station demanding that action be taken against the station staff. Last week, the police had registered a case against Giri following a complaint lodged by a woman ward volunteer that he had physically abused her while she was on duty. “The post-mortem examination has not been conducted as Giri’s family members have not given their consent till date. We appeal to the victim’s family to cooperate in the investigation of the case,” said Peddapuram DSP A. Srinivasa Rao. Giri’s body was kept at the Government General Hospital, Kakinada.

Chandrababu Naidu was attempting to create a rift between backward classes in the State. “The YSRCP will not fall for Mr. Naidu’s strategy of trying to create a rift among BC leaders of various parties in the State. The party does not wish to argue with any leaders from the backward classes on issues concerning their welfare, even if they are in opposition parties,” Mr. Venu Gopala Krishna said at a press conference. “The backward classes have received around Rs. 62,000 crore among the Rs. 1.7 lakh crore disbursed under various Direct Benefit Schemes. A majority of the 201 newly-formed welfare corporations are headed by BCs,” Mr. Venu Gopala Krishna claimed. “Our government’s strength is its welfare initiatives. The TDP is aiming to create a rift among the BC leaders in the State. The State government’s welfare measures and opportunities being offered to the BCs speak for themselves,” Mr. Venu Gopala Krishna said. ‘Only one community held power earlier’ “Mr. Naidu has lost his hold on the BCs.

Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan passed the directive on a writ petition filed by Peggy Fen of Thrissur seeking a directive to remove Churuli from the OTT platform as it contained obscene and filthy dialogues. The court ordered that the team be constituted within three days and the report be prepared within two weeks after the constitution of the team.  The Judge observed that the court could not dictate filmmakers to use Valluvanadan or Kannur or Thiruvananthapuram slang by the characters in a movie. The court could only verify whether the exhibition of the film violated any existing law enacted to ensure public order, decency or morality. While deciding the same, the artistic freedom of the filmmaker should be in mind. Before deciding the issue, it would be beneficial to get the opinion of the Police department, the court said. According to the petitioner, the language used in the film was opposed to public order, decency and morality and that releasing such movies would amount to a criminal offence and a violation of the statutory law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/churuli-kerala-hc-asks-police-chief-to-verify-law-violation/article38182373.ece

Speaking at an “investment roadshow” in Hyderabad on Friday, Mr. Vijayan showcased Kerala’s strengths to attract investors. The Centre had ranked Kerala fifth in good governance. Kerala ranked first among southern States in ease of doing business. Mr. Vijayan said the accent was on non-polluting and environment-friendly industries. The government’s industrial development strategy was firmly anchored to the principles of the “5R framework”: responsible industries and investment, reduced regulatory compliance burden, robust industrial infrastructure, renewed logistics ecosystem and a resilient thrust sector. Kerala had enacted a progressive “one-stop omnibus” legislation, the Kerala Investment Promotion and Facilitation Act, 2018, to usher in ease of doing business. The government had created the Kerala Single Window Interface for Fast and Transparent Clearance (SWIFT) and the Invest Kerala web portal to help investors get approval speedily and with zero red tape. It also instituted the Kerala - Central Inspection System (K-CIS) to make regulatory compliance smooth and frictionless. Favourable scenario Investors would find Kerala’s high literacy rate, surplus water, clean atmosphere, hygienic surroundings, uninterrupted power and a verdant environment favourable. The State has a highly skilled workforce with international experience. Mr. Vijayan said Kerala’s Gross State Value Added (GSVA) grew at relatively faster rates from 2016-19 despite a cyclone and back-to-back floods. Kerala looked forward to investments in medical technology, medical devices, virology, vaccine development and manufacturing, biotechnology & biopharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and veterinary medicine. The creation of a knowledge economy topped the State’s plan. It also desired investment in IT, hydrogen fuel production, petrochemical, food processing industries and other sunrise sectors. Leader in MSMEs Kerala was a leader for Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) with a 23 lakh estimated number of enterprises as per records of the Government of India. Kerala had an array of industrial parks with world class infrastructural facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/in-hyderabad-pinarayi-seeks-investments-lists-strengths/article38182380.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:57 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD to launch Panchagavya-based products||‘Namami Govinda’ is the brand name finalised for the bouquet of Panchagavya-based products to be launched by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). Equipped with a dairy farm that shelters hundreds of native cattle, the TTD got down to making productive use of the residual products such as cow dung and cow urine. The idea of Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy, who is basically a veterinarian, to promote chemical-free products attained shape in the form of toilet soaps, hand wash, nasal drops, agarbathi, ‘go arka’ (consumable form of cow urine), tooth powder, face pack, dhoop (smoky products in the form of cones, cups and powder), ‘vibhuthi’ and cow dung cakes meant for holy rituals. The temple management has roped in Coimbatore-based Aashirwad Ayurveda and built a massive production unit at Alipiri. While the TTD’s S.V. Gosamrakshanasala provides the required ingredients, Sri Venkateswara Ayurvedic Pharmacy provides the Ayurvedic formulations to be manufactured on a large scale by the company. “The soap sub-branded as ‘Mahi’ will be available in six flavours, where herbs and cow urine are infused into a combination of dolomite and wax, and mixed with essential oils. The dhoop products assume significance in the present context as according to Ayurveda, such fumigating material tackles several viruses,” says P. Muralikrishna, Principal of S.V. Ayurvedic College, who is coordinating the project. As the idea is to produce sacred ‘vibhuthi’ in its purest form, the makers have adopted the traditional practice of burning cow dung in ‘homagundam’ resembling the five elements, viz., sky, air, water, fire and earth. About 100 kg of dehydrated dung is burnt along with paddy husk, camphor, cow ghee and ‘dhruva’ (‘Garika’ grass) in the five gundams built with special bricks, clay and cement to withstand temperature of up to 300 degrees Celsius, till a pure white particulate matter is generated. ‘Superior quality’ Aashirwad managing director Ramkumar Kutty is confident of getting a ‘superior quality’ product, acknowledging the TTD’s contribution in providing ingredients from ‘desi’ cattle and tested formulations from classical texts. The makers have already installed state-of-the-art machinery at the workplace and hope to begin production by ‘Vaikunta Ekadasi’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-to-launch-panchagavya-based-products/article38182378.ece

There is a need to study and identify the district wise export potential. The farmers, more particularly organic farmers, have to realise the export potential, he said. Mr. Hari Babu inaugurated 4th Vijayawada Organic Mela-2022, rythu sammelanam, here on Friday.

Andhra Pradesh could take lead in agri and organic exports in the country, he said. Andhra Pradesh had already been leading in cultivation, yield and export of many agricultural products. The farmers from the State had proved their mettle wherever they went. They could take lead in organic farming as well and set an example to other States. Bringing down the expenditure on pesticides would automatically bring down the cost of cultivation, he said. Except for oilseeds, India was ahead of many other countries in agriculture production. The country had registered a good growth rate of more than 4% despite COVID pandemic. It was solely due to the agriculture sector and farmers. If there were a growth of 1% in the agriculture sector, the overall growth rate would be 10 %, he said. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (CAMPA) Chiranjeevi Chowdary, who earlier served as Horticulture Commissioner,stressed on the need for research in organic farming. Horticulture Commissioner P. Sredhar emphasised on the need for cutting down expenditure on fertilizers and chemicals. Andhra Pradesh was lagging behind other States with regard to organic farming. The government was extending a benefit of Rs. 10,000 per hectare to promote organic farming, he said. Government Adviser P. Vijay Kumar, Food Processing Society CEO Sridhar Reddy, Vijaya Dairy Chairman Chalasani Anjaneyulu, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh State executive member Jalagam Kumara Swamy, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pranta prachark Bharat Kumar, Gou Aadharita Prakruti Vyavasayadarula Sangham State president Bhupatiraju Ramakrishna Raju, mela president Muthavarapu Muralikrishna and others spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/focus-on-identifying-district-wise-export-promotion-plans/article38182432.ece

Anandaiah of Krishnapatnam cannot be allowed to treat patients afflicted by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus without a thorough verification of his claims. During the hearing by a Division Bench comprising Justices C. Praveen Kumar and K. Manmadha Rao on a petition filed by Mr. Anandaiah against his alleged prevention by the police from treating patients, special government pleader C. Sumon said that it was true that two constables were posted outside the residence of the self-proclaimed Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) to prevent people from gathering in large numbers due to the Omicron threat. Moreover, the local panchayat had passed a resolution against allowing people to visit Mr. Anandaiah in view of the Omicron threat and had requested the district Superintendent of Police to take necessary action. Mr. Anandaiah was not an RMP and he does not have a formal education. As for his statement that he learnt the methods of treatment of various diseases from his mother, Mr. Sumon pointed out that in Kerala Ayurveda Paramparya Vaidya Forum V/s State of Kerala, the Supreme Court had ruled that the ‘Paramparya Vaidyas’ could not practice their system of medicine said to be passed down through generations, without first duly registering themselves under relevant laws. When asked what prompted the government to bar Mr. Anandaiah from distributing the new formulation which is being promoted as a remedy for Omicron having earlier permitted his four COVID-19 medicines, Mr. Sumon said that the fresh claims needed to be verified whereas the herbal concoctions which were given to patients previously were examined in laboratories. The case has been posted for further hearing on January 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anandaiah-cant-treat-omicron-patients/article38183092.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:50 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Man installs wax statue of late wife at home||Mandava Kutumba Rao is basking in the afterglow of the warmth of his late wife Kasi Annapurna Devi, thanks to a precious and rare gift that had arrived at his doorstep on the night of November 13 last year – a life size silicone wax statue of Annapurna, gifted to him by their only daughter Sasya, who lives in the U.S. Annapurna Devi had died of ill health on July 17 in 2020, leaving behind a shattered Kutumba Rao, who struggled to deal with the loss. Nothing seemed enough to fill the void left behind by her. “My wife was the light of my life. She was a pillar of support through thick and thin, and I owe my successful business today to her,” says an emotional Kutumba Rao, looking straight in the eyes of the wax figure, seated on a giant wooden swing in a room in the first floor of his house near Chuttugunta Centre. The swing, earlier placed in the living area, was her favourite place. “She would sit on it and watch her favourite TV programmes,” recalls Kutumba Rao, explaining that what was earlier their home theatre in the upstairs, has now been transformed into a private space where the wax statue is placed. Unable to see her father sinking in depression, Sasya came out with the idea of gifting him the wax statue that she thought would make him feel a little better. Draped in green silk sari and adorned with glittering jewellery, the statue looks like it will talk any moment. “Unlike normal statues, these are flexible,” he says, tweaking the fingers of its hands and toes. He is into electrical works and flower decorations, but his passion lies in living with and tending plants and rearing ornamental fish showcased in giant size aquariums dotting every corner of his house. Sasya engaged a local sculptor, B.V.S. Prasad, to carve her mother’s statue. “I received a call from the U.S. asking if I could sculpt a silicone wax statue. I asked for three months time, but she said it had to be within 40 days as she wanted to gift it to her father on her mother’s birth anniversary on November 14,” recalls Mr. Prasad. Taking up the challenge, he and his team worked non-stop to carve out the figure and delivered it on time. “We first made a clay mould and after getting their approval, we sculpted a fibre wax silicone statue,” he says. The room where the statue is placed is treated like a temple. In the ground floor, a garlanded portrait is placed prominently with fresh fruits kept in front of it. “Mangoes and custard apples were her favourite fruits and so I make sure I get them daily. If they are not available locally, I import the fruits from the neighbouring states,” says Kutumba Rao. The sari on the statue will be changed on February 6 and so will be the jewellery. “It’s our marriage anniversary. I can’t thank my daughter enough as she has almost eternalised Annapurna’s presence in the house,” says Kutumba Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-wax-statue-at-home-in-wifes-memory/article38182411.ece

Addressing the media later, Mr. Veerraju said the Prime Minister was vulnerable to terrorist attack as the place where his convoy had been held up was barely 10 km from the border with Pakistan, and the role of the Punjab government in the issue was suspect. Mr. Veerraju said the Punjab government should have been on high alert on being informed in advance about Mr. Modi’s visit, but it was negligent. ‘Breach of trust’ The Charanjit Singh government owed an explanation on what was essentially a “breach of trust,” the BJP leader said, and added that the party cadres would stage silent demonstrations at the statues of Mahatma Gandhi across the State on January 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/probe-security-lapse-in-modis-punjab-visit-bjp/article38183084.ece

The active cases on December 27 was just 121 and as on Friday it shot up to 613. But according to District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar, most of the cases are asymptomatic and need no hospitalisation. As on date, the hospitalisation in the district is around 4%.

Dr. Sudhakar said that since a most of the population have received at least one jab, the severity of the infection appears to be less. He said there was a need to step up the vaccination drive and ensure that the entire target population receives both the jabs and simultaneously start the booster on a war-footing.

Mallikarjuna on Friday held a meeting with the officials at the AMC principal’s chamber and deliberated on strengthening the Home Isolation Committee.

The three were arrested on Thursday and the skeletal parts were also recovered from the spot, where they had hid the body after killing him. According to the police, an old grudge over an extramarital affair is said to be the reason behind the incident. On September 19, 2021, Parawada police had received a complaint from one Muthayala Naidu, stating that his son V. Akhilesh, a native of Venkatapathipalem of Parawada and resident of Ramachandra Nagar, Gajuwaka, was missing. Akhilesh, who was married to a woman about two years ago, was reportedly having an extramarital affair with another married woman, a known acquaintance of his wife. Akhilesh allegedly eloped with the woman and started to stay in a rented house at Anandapuram during June 2021. Later, the duo shifted to some other place. Some time in July 2021, Akhilesh reportedly told the woman that he would go back to the house at Anandapuram to collect the leftover luggage. However, after that he did not return. In the investigation, police found that three family members of the woman, S. Vasu (38), P. Vamsi and K. Sandeep, in their early 20s, had allegedly killed Akhilesh on July 13, 2021, under the motive of saving family honour. Inspector of Parawada Police Station, P. Eswara Rao, said that the trio had abducted the deceased and had taken him to an isolated spot near Sontyam and killed him by beating him with stones. The accused also smashed the face of Akhilesh with stones to conceal his identity. Thereafter, they hid the body under bushes and stones and sprinkled red chilli and pepper powder to escape detection from the dog squad. According to the police, the trio were earlier questioned, but they pretended not knowing anything. However, based on a tip-off and some sustained investigation the police zeroed in on the accused and after interrogation they confessed to the crime. They also led the police to the place where they had hid the body. The accused were sent in remand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/missing-youth-found-murdered-three-arrested/article38182435.ece

Five fishing boats were torched and eight persons were injured in the incident. Trouble broke out when one group of fishermen who use traditional crafts and gill nets opposed the use of ring nets, or seine nets, by the other group. The use of inappropriate fishing gear, especially in the reserve zones such as the coastal areas, which may lead to overfishing, is categorised as destructive fishing. The other destructive methods are cyanide fishing, use of explosives and bottom trawling. “Overfishing is destructive as more fish are caught, affecting their natural reproduction from the remaining population. This may happen when wrong gear is used at the wrong place,” says a professor from the Department of Marine Living Resources, Andhra University. Sub-adult fish at risk In the recent clash, one group of fishermen was seen using ring nets, or ring seines in the coastal area, which is categorised as a reserve zone. Experts say the use of ring seines, especially those with a mesh size below the prescribed one, would kill the juvenile, or sub-adult fish, and, in the process, deplete the catch in the region. The ICAR-CIFT has already made it clear in its recommendations that ring seines with very small mesh if operated in inshore waters will result in a catch that comprises the entire juvenile, or sub-adult population, and may ultimately lead to overfishing. Scientists at CIFT have called for measures to regulate the norms such as mesh size, horse power of the fishing craft, and minimum landing size of species caught. Reacting to the incident, the Animal Husbandry Minister had said the user of ring seines should immediately fix transponders on their boats so that their fishing area could be tracked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/experts-warn-against-destructive-fishing/article38183094.ece

Raja said on Friday. “They (BJP-RSS) do not believe in the Constitution, in democracy and parliamentary practices. Not only are the rights of the citizens, but powers of the State governments too being snatched,” he said, calling on the youth to become revolutionary icons like Bhagat Singh and Che Guevera. Addressing party cadre at the inaugural of the 16th national conference of All India Youth Federation (AIYF) here in Hyderabad, he said the young population must understand the BJP dynamics “to impose a monolithic, illiberal and socio-political order to achieve a theocratic State.” Mr. Raja describing the times as “irony of history, that those who played a collaborative role with the British in the Indian freedom movement are governing the country now,” said the BJP government has been pro-corporate and anti-people since 2014 when it came to power. “It was Nehru who brought the Industrial Policy Resolution, the Planning Commission and set up public sector enterprises as modern temples of modern India. Those modern temples are being sold to the corporate now,” former AIYF leader, Mr. Raja said. “Taking back-door anti-people decisions and making Parliament redundant, giving de facto position to a particular religion, and breaking the country’s togetherness by creating ‘they and we’,” the senior Communist leader pointed, are grave threats to the Constitution and the democracy. Mr. Raja, however, said the perseverance of protesting farmers, and the subsequent scrapping of the 2020-farm legislation, had shown the country the way. And a better India, with the defeat of the ‘BJP-RSS’, could be achieved if all pro-poor, secular, democratic and progressive sections form an alternative, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rss-and-bjp-subverting-the-constitution-alleges-cpi/article38182741.ece

Officials of TSCHE in association with the Telangana police are planning digital lockers where potential employers or foreign varsities can check the veracity of the certificates online itself bypassing the cumbersome process of personal visits to campuses. ‘Swift and authentic’ “The verification will be swift and authentic with one being able to do so sitting from the comfort of their own offices as they would get access to the servers on request,” an official said. To kick off the process of digitisation with the intervention of the present technology available with Telangana government, TSCHE chairman R. Limbadri and vice-chairman V. Venkataramana had a meeting with DGP M. Mahender Reddy, who assured them the technology to streamline the system permanently. DGP offers expertise Mr. Mahender Reddy is said to have offered the expertise available with the police department as it would not only enhance the image of Telangana but also nullify the fake certificate creators who are increasingly taking the gullible for a ride. Once the digitisation is done and processes are set, it would dissuade people approaching the fake certificate racketeers as they would no longer see the value in it, an official said. Joint meeting A joint meeting of the TSCHE and the Telangana police will be held soon in this direction. The digitisation and storage in digital lockers will be done for all the degree, post graduate and research courses as these are mostly sought-after for employment in India and abroad apart from the rising number of students going overseas for higher education. Osmania University, for example, gets scores of requests from foreign universities and employers for verification of certificates and often, they come across fake certificates. In the past three years, Osmania University detected more than 100 fake certificates when employers sought verification.  Digitisation is expected to dissuade people approaching fake certificate racketeers as they would no longer see the value of doing it.

Mr Singh was, on Friday, speaking at the 24th National Conference on e-governance, where he said that the ‘unlocking’ of the country’s space sector has begun, and that private entities are also being involved in this initiative. “We are in the process of opening up centres and other venues, other locations. Certainly, Hyderabad would also be in the queue, in waiting for that, because the kind of infrastructure they have, the kind of startup culture which already exists in Hyderabad, we would like to use it for the enrichment of the promotion of space technology in the country,” Mr Singh said. Referring to Telangana IT Minister K.T Rama Rao’s suggestion to establish an Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre in the State, Mr Singh said he would ‘carry back the suggestion’, and work on in. With India making efforts to “match global benchmarks”, he shared his views on how Telangana could play an important role. “And in a situation like this, Telangana is going to have a very major role to play. So, I just request the State government also to be on board with us. And we shall be on-board with you, so that we can ultimately achieve the objective of global excellence. You, in Telangana, deserve this, and you must seek this, and we are there to stand by you, and assist you,” the Union Minister said. ‘Progressive State’ Speaking at the event, Mr Rama Rao described the State as ‘progressive’ and Hyderabad as an important centre for aerospace. He buttressed this point by saying that over 30% of components of the Mars Orbiter Mission were made in Hyderabad. Mr Rama Rao requested Mr Singh to issue clearance for setting up a centre of excellence is space research. “I urge you, sir, in the new age of brilliant startups, such as Skyroot and Dhruva, which are headquartered here and have been making waves in the Indian spacetech industry, to grant an IN-SPACe centre in Hyderabad, and I urge you to consider that in your personal capacity also, sir,” Mr Rao said. He also urged that the Centre ‘relook’ withdrawal of Hyderabad as Information Technology Investment Region, and sanction two more electronic manufacturing clusters in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telangana-will-play-big-role-in-matching-global-benchmarks-in-space-research/article38182737.ece

Raghava is facing charges of threatening with life and abetment to suicide by a family in a property dispute case. The issue came to light after a selfie-video by victim Naga Ramakrishna was circulated of him along with his wife and two children ending their lives. Acting on the instruction of party president K. Chandrasekhar Rao, general secretary of the party Palla Rajeshwar Reddy and in-charge of party affairs in Bhadradri-Kothagudem N. Naresh Reddy suspended Raghava from TRS. Raghava’s father Mr. Venkateswara Rao was elected to the Assembly on a Congress ticket in the December 2018 elections but joined the ruling party along with six other MLAs later.

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 04:56 IST,TELANGANA||Former IFS officer connects passion with purpose||He may have retired from forest service, but the lure of nature is proving hard to resist for him. Praveen Rao Koli, who retired as Principal Chief Conservator of Forests in May this year having worked in Agra and other parts of Uttar Pradesh for 34 years, is spending his time capturing images of nature, far from the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle. In fact, the 60-year-old has his own YouTube channel ‘Nature Revisited’, which has become a hit across the country for creating awareness on the importance of conservation of forests, nature and wildlife. Recently, an image of star trail taken by him 15 km from Mancherial created buzz in photography circles. To freeze the “unforgettable” phenomenon, he had to choose a locale free from light pollution. “When I was told that I could find one near the footsteps of Gandhari Fort on last Amavasya (no moon day), I made a serious attempt and was glad that I could come up with this picture. It will remain special for me,” says Mr Praveen. “It is never easy to indulge in star trail photography because of the very difficult gradations,” the former officer adds. Speaking about conservation of nature, he opined that the rate of afforestation has gone up, but not the development of forests. “We still have a long way to go,” says Praveen, who is now shuttling between Hyderabad and his native place, 70 km from Mancherial. He points out that while development means improvement of infrastructure, especially in the transport sector, the environment and wildlife cost cannot be ignored. “Of course, there are more conscious efforts now to ensure wildlife is not disturbed, if you look at the long corridor in Seoni (Madhya Pradesh) passing through the Pench Tiger Reserve. But, we need more of them,” he says. Mr Praveen is, however, happy about the increasing awareness about wildlife and nature. “Social media platforms are playing a very constructive role in this regard,” he says, adding, “Thanks to digital cameras, which has apparently made photography easy, I wish more youth play their role in conservation of wildlife and nature.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/former-ifs-officer-connects-passion-with-purpose/article38182723.ece

There have been protests by college students and residents, so now we don’t know when it will open,” says Pappu Kumar Singh who runs a pan shop in the neighbourhood. There is a bus bay in front of the proposed liquor outlet and the word on the street is that it is going be moved to a different location. “We learnt about the liquor shop on December 15. We did a silent dharna, and on December 20, Minister K.T. Rama Rao promised to take action,” says the principal of St Ann’s Degree College. “The liquor shop would be next to the bus bay. Our young students will have to pass by the liquor shop once it opens, they will feel unsafe,” said the principal airing her concern. A few days before that, residents of two apartment complexes in New Bhoiguda near Gandhi Hospital protested opening of a liquor shop on the ground floor of one complex with 78 apartments. “The liquor shop is right where school buses stop for children to come inside,” says Vani Bharati who lives in Jaya Durga Towers. While the liquor shop may or may not open near Mallapur across the road, the Durga Bhavani Restaurant & Bar is stocked full and tipplers walk in and out of the outlet at all hours of the day. Liquor shops near temples, near kindergarten schools and apartment complexes have led to scattered protests in the city over the past two months. The government had auctioned new liquor outlets for a two year licence period from November 1. In the process, about 400 more shops were auctioned mostly in Hyderabad. Some of them are located near bus bays, others near busy junctions, and still other are leading to traffic snarls in the city. In the absence of any meaningful zoning norms where the allotment is made in a draw of lots, the spread of liquor outlets into residential areas has become a point of conflict. The application for the retail liquor licence A4 has one column for location and the Excise Department collects GPS details shop photographs of successful applicants’. The mushrooming of liquor shops has however, helped the State government in a big way. It has seen a 157% leap in excise revenue over the past seven years, from about Rs. 10,833 crore to Rs. 27,888 crore.  We staged a silent dharna, and on Dec. 20 Minister K.T. Rama Rao promised to take action.

Harish Rao has exhorted Health officials to effectively tackle the third wave of COVID-19. The Minister on Friday conducted a teleconference with officials concerned at grassroot level on Friday to check the preparedness for the third wave. He wanted the officials concerned to focus on completion of vaccination, especially for youth in the age group of 15-18 years which started recently. Reminding that youngsters would visit their homes during the Sankranti festival, he said officials should focus on educating them on the need for taking vaccination to avoid exposure to the virus. At the same time, officials should focus on covering the total population with two doses of vaccination. Officials should also be prepared for administering booster doses to people aged above 60 from January 10. Steps should be taken to ensure that people with co-morbidities were identified for administering two doses of vaccine as well as booster dose. Accredited Social Health Activists should motivate people to get inoculated so that there were no leftovers in vaccine administration in the areas allotted to them. The State government, for its part, had ensured availability of one crore home isolation kits and two crore diagnostic kits and these were positioned at all the district health centres as well as sub-centres. Steps should be taken to check people with symptoms and ensure isolation in cases of people who needed it. Health condition of people susceptible to the virus should be tracked on a daily basis and officials should ensure that people with symptoms were moved to the nearest health centre for timely treatment. Mr. Harish Rao said though there were reports that the spread of the third wave was faster, studies suggested that threat to life was lower. Accordingly, people should be educated to see that they took adequate precautions and avoid incurring huge expenditure on account of visiting private hospitals. Government hospitals were equipped with all facilities to tackle the pandemic and efforts should be made to see to it that people approached the State-run medical centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/is-telangana-prepared-for-third-wave-asks-minister/article38182730.ece

At a press conference here, vice president of AICC Kisan Congress M.

Chandrasekhar Rao, who speaks highly of Dharani portal, is not aware of issues in the villages. “Situation is totally different from what the CM perceives,” Mr. Kodanda Reddy said. He said such is the agony of people affected by the portal is that they equate it with the Patel-Patwari system and in fact, claim it was much better because the grievances could be brought to their notice.

Chandrasekhar Rao. After hearing a criminal petition filed by the MP seeking direction to quash the First Information Report (FIR) issued against him, the judge also directed the Member of Parliament to refrain from posting any such content in social media. Such posts may result in enmity and disturbances between different groups in the community, he said. The judge said the court had seen the photo copy of the social media post by the MP. It was not in good taste as the cartoon was connected to an elected leader holding high constitutional post, the bench said. However, the allegation against the MP and the issuance of FIR prima facie appeared to be exaggerated, the judge observed. The social media post related to the CM was nothing but caricature of the government’s decision. No criminal offence can be made out under Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code based on that, the judge said. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan noted that people these days are getting offended on the slightest of things.  People these days are getting offended on the slightest of things.

Sharmila has alleged that both the BJP and TRS have been playing ‘political games’ while farmers in the State were dying due to various problems. Ms. Sharmila interacted with the families of farmers who died and consoled them at the party office on Friday. She assured support to them from her party. “During the last seven and half years, more than 8,000 farmers committed suicide in the State. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao promised Bangaru Telangana but things are going the wrong way and he is responsible for their suicides. Some farmers committed suicide as government did not buy paddy and some as they were unable to sell their produce. Some others took the extreme step as they were unable to find their land details in Dharani,” said Ms. Sharmila while speaking to reporters in the city on Friday. She wondered how the Chief Minister promised to pay ex gratia to farmers who died in Haryana in the last one year of protests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sharmila-bjp-and-trs-playing-political-games/article38182780.ece

Niranjan Reddy has suggested farmers again to cultivate cotton on a large scale during the kharif (Vanakalam) season, stating that there is very good demand at the international level for cotton produced in Telangana. In spite of repeated appeals made to farmers before kharif season, cotton was cultivated in only about 46.43 lakh acres in 2021 against 60.18 lakh acres in 2020, he said. Cotton was commanding a very good price in the market now in the range of Rs. 9,000-Rs. 10,000 per quintal against MSP of Rs. 6,025 per quintal (long staple) as cultivation was not on the expected level globally, he said. Speaking at Rythu Bandhu celebrations at Alair in Yadadri-Bhongir district on Friday, the Agriculture Minister said there would be good demand for cotton globally in the years to come and the farmers could go for it without any hesitation. He said that it was historic that over Rs. 50,000 crore had been given as grant to farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/minister-urges-ryots-to-go-for-cotton-again-in-kharif/article38182772.ece

Telangana Mahila Congress chief Sunita Rao warned that women would send bangles to the top functionaries in the government to expose their inefficiency to respond when the entire State was moved by the suicide pact. She said women expected Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to send a message of confidence. “It is unfortunate that he has not even condemned the incident showcasing how he prefers politics over protection of women,” she said. “CM’s family was angry when a family member was body-shamed but have chosen to be silent when Ramakrishna’s family was forced to commit suicide to save the honour of women members of the family. Where were the women ministers when a married woman and two girls had to take their lives unable to bear the sexual harassment of a TRS leader,” she asked. “It is shameful on their part to say the least and they have forgotten basic decency, leave alone their responsibility.” Protests in Kothagudem Meanwhile, widespread protests rocked the industrial hub of Kothagudem and Paloncha towns on Friday as demonstrators took to streets in response to the bandh called by the JAC of various political parties demanding action against local TRS leader Vanama Raghava for allegedly abetting the suicide of a debt-ridden businessman. Taking up cudgels against a ‘rein of anarchy’ unleashed by Raghava, son of MLA Vanama Venkateshwara Rao, activists of the Congress, CPI, CPI (M) and other Opposition parties besides activists of women’s organisations staged a dharna in Kothagudem. They demanded Mr. Venkateshwara Rao’s resignation as Kothagudem MLA to ensure a free and fair investigation into the suicide case. The bandh was near total as traders downed their shutters voluntarily in the coal town as well as Paloncha. Police whisked away several demonstrators, including senior leaders of the Congress and the Left parties, to Paloncha police station. They were let off later in the day. CPI State assistant secretary and former MLA K. Sambasiva Rao and others took part in the demonstration in Kothagudem. Activists owing allegiance to the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) and a host of other women’s organisations marched on the streets in Kothagudem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-are-women-ministers-silent-on-paloncha-deaths-mahila-congress/article38182787.ece

Suffering endured The draft of these rules had been pending since 2018, prolonging the cruelty, pain and suffering endured by circus animals, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said. In their appeal, the veterinarians cited numerous reasons why circuses must be barred from using animals. The reasons include keeping animals in severe confinement like chaining elephants when not in use, tying horses and camels almost constantly in place, and caging dogs. Physical abuse They also include physical abuse with weapons to force animals to perform unnatural tricks that wreak havoc on their bodies and minds. “The veterinarians know what’s best for animals, and they are saying the use of animals in circuses must end,” PETA-India’s chief executive officer and veterinarian, Manilal Valliyate said, adding that his organisation joined the veterinarians in requesting Mr. Rupala to notify the rules. The Animal Welfare Board of India, a statutory body established under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, in 2017 and 2019, advised the Central government to pass legislation prohibiting animals in circuses. Recently, the Central Zoo Authority cancelled its recognition of the Great Golden Circus that was using elephants, a protected wildlife species, for performances. The experts’ appeal also noted that Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Greece, Guatemala, Italy, and Malta have prohibited the use of animals in circuses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/vets-seek-rules-to-ban-use-of-animals-in-circuses/article38182595.ece

The model is being considered for replication elsewhere in the State. A 20-member team of the Council visited Banswara district’s Amlipara village earlier this week to study the techniques and innovations which have enabled the farmers to meet their daily food necessities by growing fruits and vegetables at a low cost. The integrated system has also reduced the tribals’ dependence on market and improved nutritional status of the local population. The team members, drawn mostly from the State government’s Agriculture and Horticulture Departments, interacted with the farmers. They especially evinced interest in the functioning of the community-managed seed system, which has facilitated diversification of crops. The model entails adoption of organic farming, manure, medicines and pesticides and establishment of vermicompost units at agricultural fields. The locally prepared organic manure is used for growing maize, wheat, urad and other crops. Banswara-based Vaagdhara group has identified the key areas of intervention which would help ensure availability of food throughout the year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sustainable-farming-creates-new-livelihood-sources/article38182599.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 05:48 IST,||HC allows Ganga Sagar Mela||The Calcutta High Court on Friday allowed Ganga Sagar Mela to be held in West Bengal. However, it directed that a committee be set up to recommend to the State a ban on entry to the Sagar Island, where the pilgrimage is held, if there was any violation of health safety norms. Notified area A Bench of Chief Justice Prakash Srivastava and Justice K.D. Bhutia also directed the State government to declare Sagar Island as a notified area in terms of Section 3 of the Ganga Sagar Mela Act, 1976. This declaration will empower the State government to take measures as far as health and safety of devotees are concerned. The proposed committee will comprise the Leader of the Opposition or his representative, the chairman of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission or his representative and a representative of the State. The Court was hearing a PIL by a medical practitioner seeking directions to restrict and regulate the gathering of pilgrims, sadhus and tourists in Sagar Island during the mela scheduled from January 8 to January 16. The court also directed that the State should fully implement the directions contained in the order dated January 8, 2021. It also directed that the Home Secretary to “issue advertisements in daily newspapers and through the electronic media making the public aware of the risk of visiting Ganga Sagar Island between 8th and 16th January, 2022, in large gatherings and will make an appeal to them to stay safe and desist from visiting the island during this period”. In the order, the court also pointed out that an affidavit filed by the State government on January 6 where the government has stated that it is not in favour of banning the mela at this stage in view of the arrangements already made. “About 30,000 people have already visited the mela ground and nearly 50,000 people including sadhus have arrived and due to the COVID-19 situation, the inflow of devotees has come down and only about four to five lakh pilgrims are expected to arrive between January 6 to 15, 2022,” the order refers to the affidavit filed by the State government. A few days ago, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had also said that she cannot ban or impose curbs on the mela as it is not the State government’s event. Civil rights groups in the State expressed surprise that the post of the chairperson of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission remains vacant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-allows-ganga-sagar-mela/article38182601.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 05:47 IST,||In Kolkata, mood turns sombre as cases mount||If humour is a reflection of the times and seeks to make light of the prevailing challenges, then two WhatsApp forwards currently in circulation aptly sum up the COVID-19 situation in West Bengal and its capital Kolkata. One of them says, “If you are from Kolkata and none of your friends are COVID positive yet, then you don’t have friends.” And according to the other, Bengal is currently divided into two people: those who have tested positive, and those who have not tested and are negative. The mood in Kolkata, from being extraordinarily festive during Christmas, is now suddenly sombre, with roads and offices and public places appearing deserted. The pandemic, it is feared, will further tighten its grip on the State and, by extension, the rest of the country, by the time the Ganga Sagar Mela, to be held in Sagar Island from January 8 to 16, comes to a close. On Friday, the Calcutta High Court permitted the government to hold the annual mela, which attracts lakhs of pilgrims from across India. Almost everybody in the city now has a friend or relative who has tested positive. Those positive are curious to know whether they are infected by the Omicron or Delta variant, but there’s no way of knowing. To compound matters, several labs in the city are now — apparently according to latest ICMR guidelines — placing those with a CT value of less than 35 in RTPCR test as COVID-positive. “In Bengal, the number of new cases on Thursday was 15,421, active patients 41,101, but Omicron infected only 20. Likewise, in the country, the number of new cases was 90,928, active patients 2,84,155, but Omicron infected just 2,630. From this data, can we implicate Omicron as the prime mover behind the third wave — or Delta? Or is it flurona — flu and corona? Or some other variant? What are we missing?” asked Dr. Koushik Lahiri, a well-known city dermatologist. Writer Rajeshwari Mitra said, “This time I know of entire families that are infected. Thankfully, the severity of the disease seems less because most of the affected are recovering in two to three days. This also happens to be the season of cough and cold, and that’s only adding to the confusion. I think it is important for one to get tested.” Anupama Maitra, who teaches English at a college and lives on the southern fringes of the city, said the number of active cases in her housing complex — comprising 1,250 flats — on Friday stood at 45 and was going up by 10-15 daily. In spite of the surge in the number of daily cases, internal medicine specialist Dr. Rahul Jain said there was no cause for panic at the moment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-kolkata-mood-turns-sombre-as-cases-mount/article38182902.ece

A Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.R. Borkar dismissed the National Investigating Agency’s request for extending the date of surrender only by a week. The Bench said in view of the rising cases of coronavirus across the State, it would not be wise to send the 83-year-old poet-activist back to prison. Temporary bail Mr. Rao was granted temporary medical bail for six months in February 2021 by another Bench of the HC led by Justice Shinde. He was admitted to the private Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai for treatment of multiple ailments. His date of surrender was scheduled for September 5, 2021, but Mr. Rao filed a new application through advocate R. Sathyanarayanan and senior counsel Anand Grover seeking an extension of the medical bail. On Friday, NIA counsel Sandesh Patil told the HC that Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh had not been briefed in the matter and sought a week’s time to complete the process. The Bench, however, said there was no point posting the matter for hearing next week and extending the date of surrender considering the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Grover told the court that considering Mr. Rao’s health condition and his age, the Telegu poet had also filed a fresh application before the HC seeking “permanent bail on health grounds”. The Bench said it will consider all the contentions raised, including those in the new applications filed by Mr. Rao, on February 4, the next date of hearing. It, accordingly, extended the date of surrender for Mr. Rao till February 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-extends-varavara-raos-surrender-date/article38182596.ece

Mr. Tope said that the government’s foremost challenge is to ensure strict implementation of restrictions that are to be implemented by the state government. “We have been asking people to not crowd at public places and if, this is not being followed, then action will be taken,” he said. Commenting on the closure of schools in Mumbai, Thane and neighboring areas, Mr. Tope said that the decision in those areas was taken after the increase in positivity rate among school children. “The decision to close schools in some regions of the State was due to increased positivity rate. The similar situation is however not seen in other districts of the State and therefore there is no move to close schools in that part of the State,” he added. Meanwhile, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said that there is no plan of imposing lockdown in Mumbai. “Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is going to announce if restrictions are going to be increased,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cases-will-be-filed-against-violators-of-guidelines-maharashtra-govt/article38182904.ece

The commission has asked the Maharashtra Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police (DGP) and the Mumbai Police Commissioner, along with the Union Home Secretary, to appear for in-person hearing before it on January 31. Mr. Wankhede too has been asked to be present.

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 04:29 IST,||‘Bulli Bai’: Bishnoi used a gaming character to run Twitter handles||Investigation into the ‘Bulli Bai’ case has revealed that the main accused, Niraj Bishnoi, had five different Twitter handles, one of which he used to spread a fake narrative that ‘Sulli Deals’, another similar application, was created by a Muslim man to mislead the police. The 20-year-old engineering student was arrested in Assam’s Jorhat by the Delhi police on Thursday for allegedly creating ‘Bulli Bai’ where photos of Muslim women were posted for “auction”. According to DCP (Special Cell Cyber Unit) K.P.S. Malhotra, the Twitter accounts have been identified as @giyu2002, @giyu007, @giyuu84, @giyu94 and @giyu44. “Giyu” is a gaming character. Planting information Through @giyu007, which came to light during the probe in the ‘Sulli Deals’ case, Bishnoi used to plant information that it was created by one Javed Alam, a 23-year-old computer engineering graduate from U.P.’s Kushinagar. Mr. Malhotra said during this time, he also created a fake profile of a girl and tried to communicate with the investigating agencies as a news reporter. “He came in contact with various news reporters and tried to spread this misinformation.” Bishnoi’s interrogation further disclosed that he used @giyu2002 for allegedly making lewd and derogatory remarks on the picture of a woman who he had also attempted to “auction” through his Twitter account. The woman had filed an FIR in June last year at Kishangarh police station, a month before ‘Sulli Deals’ was created. She had said that on May 13, the Twitter handle started an auction of her and allegedly said, “I invoke the legendary @sullideals 101 to auction this Sulli…Minimum bid $1 USD. Bidding starts now. All the best to all players.” She had also said in the FIR that a number of people started bidding on her and made lewd comments. ‘Open challenge’ Mr. Malhotra said @giyu44 was created by Bishnoi on January 3 to demean the arrests made by the Mumbai police in the matter and to “throw an open challenge to law enforcement agencies to nab him”. Through this account, he changed his location to Nepal to mislead the police and also went on to post notices and communications he had allegedly received from GitHub, the hosting platform, about ‘Bulli Bai’. “After we sent a notice to GitHub seeking information about the creator of the application, it subsequently sent a notice to him, which he posted on his Twitter account,” a senior officer said. On his possible role in creating ‘Sulli Deals’, a police source said while he used his Twitter account to promote the application, forensic examination is on to unearth his actual role. “We are trying to recover the deleted files from his laptop in order to find a code which he might have used to create ‘Sulli Deals’ …the result will likely come within a day,” a senior police officer said. The police also said Bishnoi accessed the GitHub account using proton virtual private network and a proton email address. Earlier this week, the Mumbai police arrested three persons in the ‘Bulli Bai’ case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bulli-bai-bishnoi-used-a-gaming-character-to-run-twitter-handles/article38182568.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 05:47 IST,||Awaiting law panel report on Uniform Civil Code: Centre||“Citizens belonging to different religious and denominations follow different property and matrimonial laws which are an affront to the nation’s unity,” the Centre has informed the Delhi High Court while responding to a plea seeking direction to the government to draft a Uniform Civil Code. The Centre also said it was awaiting the report of the Law Commission of India, which is examining various issues relating to the Uniform Civil Code. The affidavit of the Ministry of Law and Justice came in response to a petition filed by BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, who has contended that the government has “failed” to put in place a Uniform Civil Code, as provided under Article 44 of the Constitution. “The expression ‘Uniform Civil Code’ denotes the field of personal law relating to marriage, divorce, maintenance, custody and guardianship of children, inheritance and succession and adoption,” the Ministry said. It said that Article 44 of the Constitution creates an obligation upon the State to endeavour to secure for citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the country. The Ministry said the purpose behind Article 44 is to strengthen the object of “Secular Democratic Republic” as enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution. “This provision is provided to effect integration of India by bringing communities on the common platform on matters which are at present governed by diverse personal laws,” the Ministry said adding, “Article 44 divests religion from social relations and personal law”. The Ministry said, “as and when the report of Law Commission in the matter is received, the government would examine the same in consultation with the various stakeholders involved in the matter”. ‘Power with Parliament’ Responding the plea which has sought a direction against the Union of India to draft a Uniform Civil Code in sprit of Article 44 of the Constitution within three months, the Ministry said it was against the Constitutional scheme. It reiterated that only the “Parliament exercises sovereign power to enact laws and no outside power or authority can issue a direction to enact a particular piece of legislation”. The petitioner, Mr. Upadhyay, had argued that Goa has a common civil code since 1965, which is applicable to all of its residents, and it is the only State to have it as of now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/awaiting-law-panel-report-on-uniform-civil-code-centre/article38182577.ece

It also said that the courts have no power to legislate any new offence. “Marital rape is a crime of cruelty in India. Married women and unmarried women are different under every single law,” government lawyer Nandita Rao told the HC which is hearing a batch of petitions seeking criminalisation of marital rape. Ms. Rao, additionally, said even in the case of one of the petitioners, who claimed to be a victim of repeated marital rape, the FIR stood registered for an offence under Section 498A of the IPC, which deals with cruelty to a married woman by her husband or his relatives. In India, marital rape is not defined in any statute or law. The High Court was hearing the petitions by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, and a man and a woman seeking to strike down the exception granted to husbands under the Indian rape law. The exception says sexual intercourse by a man with his wife aged 15 years or above is not rape even if it is without her consent. In October 2017, the Supreme Court increased it to 18 years. During the hearing, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, representing the petitioner woman, argued that courts all over the world have recognised marital rape as an offence. “Marital rape is the biggest form of sexual violence which happens in the confines of our homes. How many times does rape take place in the institution of marriage and is never reported? This figure is not reported or analysed,” he said. The High Court will hear the case again on January 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/marital-rape-already-covered-under-ipc/article38182583.ece

In a hardline address to the nation, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev also gave “special thanks” to Russian President Vladimir Putin after a Moscow-led military alliance sent troops to Kazakhstan to help quell the unrest. Security forces had blocked off strategic areas of Almaty — the country’s largest city and epicentre of the recent violence — and were firing into the air if anyone approached. Elsewhere the city was like a ghost town, with banks, supermarkets and restaurants closed. The few small shops that remained open were quickly running out of food. Mr. Tokayev said order had mostly been restored across the country, after protests this week over fuel prices escalated into widespread violence. “Terrorists continue to damage property... and use weapons against civilians. I have given the order to law enforcement to shoot to kill without warning,” Mr. Tokayev said in his third televised address to the nation this week. He ridiculed calls from abroad for negotiations as “nonsense”. “We are dealing with armed and trained bandits, both local and foreign. With bandits and terrorists. So they must be destroyed. This will be done shortly.” Long seen as one of the most stable of the ex-Soviet republics of Central Asia, energy-rich Kazakhstan is facing its biggest crisis in decades. Protesters stormed government buildings in Almaty on Wednesday and fought running battles with police and the military. The Interior Ministry said 26 “armed criminals” had been killed in the unrest, after earlier reporting “dozens” dead. It said 18 security officers had been killed and more than 740 wounded, and more than 3,800 people detained. Widespread disruptions The numbers could not be independently verified and there was no official information about dead and wounded among civilian bystanders. The full picture of the chaos has often been unclear, with widespread disruptions to communications including mobile phone signals, the blocking of online messengers and hours-long internet shutdowns. Western countries have called for restraint on all sides and for the respect of people’s right to protest peacefully. Mr. Tokayev said Almaty had been under assault from “20,000 bandits” with a “clear plan of attack, coordination of actions and high combat readiness.” He blamed “so-called free media” and unnamed foreign figures for instigating the violence, adding: “Democracy is not permissiveness.” Mr. Tokayev on Wednesday declared a nationwide state of emergency and appealed for help from the Russia-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). Russia’s Defence Ministry said on Friday that nine Il-76 military transport planes carrying paratroopers and hardware had landed in Almaty and that Russian forces had helped to secure the airport. Media reports in Moscow have said the Russian contingent is expected to number less than 5,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kazakh-leader-issues-shoot-to-kill-order/article38181980.ece

Mr. Xi, in what official media described as a “verbal message”, praised Mr. Tokayev for “taking decisive and effective actions at a critical moment” and "quickly calming the situation”. Mr. Tokayev said on Friday he had instructed security forces to fire upon protesters without warning. Sense of responsibility The Chinese leader said he had “shown the sense of responsibility as a statesman, and demonstrated a highly responsible attitude to the country and the people” and added that China was “ready to provide necessary support to help it overcome the difficulties” He said China “firmly opposes any force undermining Kazakhstan’s stability” and “strongly rejects any attempt by external forces to provoke unrest and instigate ‘colour revolutions’ in Kazakhstan,” the official Xinhua news agency said. China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing was “willing to do its best to provide necessary support”. “As a fraternal neighbour and a permanent comprehensive strategic partner, China is willing to provide necessary support to Kazakhstan to help it tide over difficulties,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, adding that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) security grouping, which counts as its members China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan, regarded as its “consistent purpose” the “maintaining of security and stability of the member states and the region.” The SCO’s members, he added, were “willing to promote the SCO playing an active role in this regard”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/xi-praises-kazakhstans-decisive-actions/article38181971.ece

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the two nations were signing a five-year extension of the support package provided by Japan for the hosting of around 50,000 U.S. troops on its soil. The new agreement “will invest greater resources to deepen our military readiness and interoperability”, Mr. Blinken said at the opening of four-way virtual talks between the allies’ foreign and defence chiefs. “Our allies must not only strengthen the tools we have but also develop new ones,” Mr. Blinken said on Thursday in Washington. Tokyo pays the costs of the U.S. forces in the country as well as utilities. A previous agreement was set to expire in March 2021, but was extended for a year around a change of administration in Washington. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, appearing from isolation after a mild case of COVID-19, said the allies were “evolving our roles and missions to reflect Japan’s growing ability to contribute to regional peace and stability”. Japan renounced its right to wage war after the Second World Warand has since developed a close alliance with Washington, which is treaty-bound to defend the world’s third-largest economy. According to the Foreign Ministry, the new five-year package will amount to 211 billion yen ($1.8 billion) per fiscal year, an increase of about 5%. The package comes amid growing tensions with China, which has stepped up incursions near the self-ruling democracy Taiwan. “Beijing’s provocative actions keep raising tensions across the Taiwan Strait and in the East and South China Sea,” Mr. Blinken said. He also described North Korea’s missile programmes as an “ongoing threat” after Pyongyang fired a suspected ballistic missile into the sea. A joint statement issued after the talks took aim at “efforts by China to undermine the rules-based order”, with specific reference to activity in the East and South China Seas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japan-us-expand-defence-cooperation/article38181978.ece

Mr. Poitier created a distinguished film legacy in a single year with three 1967 films at a time when segregation prevailed in much of the United States.  In Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner he played a Black man with a white fiancee and In the Heat of the Night he was Virgil Tibbs, a Black police officer confronting racism during a murder probe. He also played a teacher in a tough London school that year in To Sir, With Love .   Mr. Poitier had won his history-making Best Actor Oscar for Lilies of the Field in 1963, playing a handyman who helps German nuns build a chapel in the desert.  He was born in Miami on February 20, 1927, and raised on a tomato farm in the Bahamas, and had just one year of formal schooling.

PM||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said he has not yet thought about an extension to Chief of the Army Staff Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa’s tenure, which is coming to an end on November 28, 2022.  Prime Minister Khan said that he enjoyed an unprecedented relationship with the military leadership, the Dawn newspaper reported.  “The current year has just started and November is far away. Then why there is worry about extension in the tenure of the army chief,” Mr. Khan was quoted as saying in the report. Mr. Khan said that he had so far not thought about extension in the tenure of COAS Bajwa. Gen. Bajwa, a close confidant of Mr. Khan, was to retire on November 29, 2019 at the end of his three-year term but PM Khan gave the Army chief another extension of same length, citing regional security situation, through a notification. However, the Supreme Court on November 28 suspended the government order, observing that there is no law to give extension to the Army chief’s tenure. But the apex court granted a six-month extension to Gen. Bajwa after being assured by the government that Parliament will pass a legislation on the extension/reappointment of an army chief within six months. The government after initial hesitation secured the support of the main Opposition parties and introduced three Bills in the National Assembly to extend the retirement age from 60 to 64 years for the chiefs of Army, Navy and Air Force, and the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/decision-on-gen-bajwas-tenure-can-wait-pak-pm/article38181972.ece

Currently, India is the sixth-largest economy, behind the U.S., China, Japan, Germany and the U.K. “India’s nominal GDP... is forecast to rise from $2.7 trillion in 2021 to $8.4 trillion by 2030,” IHS Markit said. “This rapid pace of economic expansion would result in the size of Indian GDP exceeding Japanese GDP by 2030, making India the second-largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.” By 2030, the Indian economy would also be larger in size than the largest Western European economies of Germany, France and the U.K. The long-term outlook for the Indian economy is supported by a number of key growth drivers. “An important positive factor for India is its large and fast-growing middle class, which is helping to drive consumer spending,” IHS Markit said, forecasting that the country’s consumption expenditure will double from $1.5 trillion in 2020 to $3 trillion by 2030. For the full fiscal year 2021-22, India’s real GDP growth rate is projected to be 8.2%, rebounding from the severe contraction of 7.3% year-on-year in 2020-21, IHS Markit said. The Indian economy is forecast to continue growing strongly in the 2022-23 fiscal year, at a pace of 6.7%. The rapidly growing consumer market as well as its large industrial sector have made India an increasingly important investment destination for multinationals in many sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure and services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-to-surpass-japan-as-asias-2nd-largest-economy-by-2030/article38181945.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:13 IST,||No longer the ‘Happy Slam’||The rapidly spreading Omicron variant, no Serena Williams or Roger Federer and now the Novak Djokovic saga — the Australian Open is struggling to live up to its ‘Happy Slam’ reputation. With the tournament just 10 days away, there was the threat on Friday of more disarray with the possibility of other players being in a similar predicament to the World No. 1. The vaccine-sceptic Djokovic, the Australian Open defending champion, was detained on arrival in the country this week, his visa cancelled for failing to meet tough coronavirus pandemic entry restrictions. The 34-year-old Serb is now in a Melbourne immigration detention facility and fighting deportation. Two other players or staff attending the Open are also now being investigated, Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said. Tennis Australia, which organises the first Grand Slam of the year, is in the spotlight for its role in the debacle having been part of the process that got Djokovic a medical exemption from having a COVID jab. An online analysis piece by national broadcaster ABC said that the Open “is in chaos with arguably the tournament’s biggest drawcard on the men’s side in limbo and the decision-making of organisers and government under intense scrutiny”. The Australian Open is known as the ‘Happy Slam’ for its perfect weather, bumper crowds and party atmosphere at Melbourne Park, which sits beside the banks of the Yarra River. But like at all major sports events since the coronavirus emerged, the pandemic has come calling. Last year’s Australian Open was thrown into doubt by COVID and eventually started three weeks late before fans were barred mid-tournament when authorities ordered a snap lockdown across Victoria state. This year was supposed to be different with the vaccines, but then came Omicron and infection numbers rising fast in Australia and beyond. Nadal present, but... Even if Djokovic does go on to defend his title, the tournament will still be missing some star power. Federer, who also has 20 Slam titles, will not be there as he battles to recover from a knee injury. Also absent will be American Williams, who is managing her workload into the twilight of another of tennis’ great careers. Rafael Nadal will be there, having recently been “very sick” with COVID, but it remains to be seen if he can compete at his devastating best.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-longer-the-happy-slam/article38182443.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:57 IST,||Famed Indian attack came up short on a track with cracks||The defeat at the Wanderers would have come as a shock to those who believed a transitional Proteas team could be rolled over by India for a historic maiden Test series triumph on South African soil. Now the series is on a knife-edge at 1-1 ahead of the high-stakes decider at Cape Town from January 11. Principal cause There are several reasons for the Indian setback but the principal cause would be the failure of its highly-rated bowling on a track with cracks. To tell the truth, 240 was an eminently defendable score on this surface. All the bowlers had to do was to hit the cracks consistently. Had Glenn McGrath, Curtly Ambrose, or going further back, Brian Statham, all seamers known for control and accuracy, been around, South Africa would not have got 150 on this surface. Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami bowled excellently on the second morning without luck but disappointed in the South African second innings. They over-pitched, bowled short and wide, and landed the ball on either side of the pitch for runs. They should have choked the batters with control at the beginning of the second innings for pressure to build but instead allowed Aiden Markram to essay a series of shots to give South Africa momentum during the chase. Dean Elgar held firm at one end, marshalling the pursuit, and the next man Keegan Petersen, an impressive batter with flow and timing, was also able to play his shots. Bumrah and Shami could just not get their length right on this track. Target area The pace duo had to target an area just short of a good length from where the ball rose nastily from the cracks. And Bumrah and Shami had to get the sphere to bounce at the right shoulder of the batters, opening them up and getting them to fend at the deliveries, and not take them on the body. It doesn’t say much for Bumrah that on this surface he finished with match figures of one for 119. The incisive deliveries were missing when India needed them. Only Shardul Thakur, who bowled magnificently in the first innings, scalping seven, hit the cracks with regularity, but, for some strange reason, was introduced rather late on the decisive fourth day. With the dogged Elgar at the crease, South Africa was able to build partnerships. Even someone lacking in confidence such as Rassie van der Dussen grew in stature, and played shots on both sides. Wayward bowling The Indians leaked runs, and were just unable to stem the flow. You can’t set fields to poor and rather wayward bowling. And R. Ashwin has to bowl India to victory in the SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia) to be considered a truly great spinner. Yes, India should have scored at least 50 runs more after electing to bat, and yes, Rishabh Pant, struck on the helmet grill by a Kagiso Rabada lifter and riled up by van der Dussen from short-leg, should not have lost it in the mind and perished to a wild heave off the next delivery. But the buck stops with the bowlers. You expect this Indian attack to defend 240 against this South African line-up on this pitch. Even if the Indian bowlers had a plan, the execution was ordinary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/famed-indian-attack-came-up-short-on-a-track-with-cracks/article38182394.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 05:41 IST,||Tendulkar-Warne discuss Stokes’ survival||England batter Ben Stokes had luckiest of escapes in recent times when a Cameroon Green ball hit his stumps but he survived as the bails did not come off, prompting legends Shane Warner and Sachin Tendulkar to discuss introduction of a possible new law. The incident happened on the third day of the fourth Ashes Test on Friday when Australian all-rounder Green bowled one that was angled in and left-handed Stokes had shouldered arms, anticipating that the ball would pass by the stumps. But it came back enough to kiss the off-stump. The bail started getting out of the groove but eventually settled down. The on-field umpires asked for a referral but since the bails didn’t completely get out of the groove, Stokes was adjudged not out. He went onto make a crucial 66. “Should a law be introduced called ‘hitting the stumps’ after the ball has hit them but not dislodged the bails? What do you think guys? Let’s be fair to bowlers,” tweeted Tendulkar tagging Warne. The iconic leg-spinner Warner said in jest that the point needs to be debated. “Interesting point & one to debate my friend. I will take this to the world cricket committee for discussion & come back to you. Never seen anything like that today - Greene’s delivery was 142kph and hit the stump hard,” Warne replied. However another stylish Aussie batter of yesteryears Damien Martyn had a straight “No” to Tendulkar’s proposal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tendulkar-warne-discuss-stokes-survival/article38182988.ece

ATK MB, which has 15 points from nine matches, has shown a reformed performance under new coach Juan Ferrando, picking up seven out the possible nine points in the last three outings. Porous defence The last year’s runner-up was halted in its tracks in its previous outing by Hyderabad FC, which forced a 2-2 draw with a last-gasp equaliser in the added time. The porosity in its defence, which saw ATK MB concede 18 goals in nine matches, is one of the problems bothering Ferrando. The home side will also be missing the services of French playmaker Hugo Boumous owing to suspension, while Irish defensive midfielder Carl McHugh will be uncertain because of the concussion he suffered in the last match. No Vinit for Odisha Odisha FC, which is in the seventh spot with 13 points from nine, will be without its captain Vinit Rai, who has switched over to Mumbai City FC on loan for the remainder of the season. Jerry Mawihmingthanga, who scored a brace and provided one assist in Odisha’s 4-2 win over holder Mumbai City FC in the previous match, will be providing the side the necessary confidence to pull off another good win and helped the side climb up the table.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/atk-mb-faces-the-odisha-challenge/article38183013.ece

At close, England was 258 for seven, with Bairstow unbeaten on 103 (8x4, 3x6) and Jack Leach on four, to trail Australia by 158 runs. Bairstow screamed in delight after he cut Pat Cummins to the ropes to raise his third Ashes Test century, but the first Down Under. Bairstow reached his ton off the third-last ball of the third day for England’s first century in this series as he and Stokes led a recovery after England was in dire straits at 36 for four. England has already lost the Ashes, but it at last showed some fight. Stokes, grimacing in pain from a side strain picked up while bowling on Thursday, posted his highest score of the series with 66. Stokes dug deep to club nine fours and a massive six off Nathan Lyon over extra cover but the off-spinner had the last word, trapping Stokes plumb lbw with a skidding delivery to end his brave 91-ball knock. Stokes had a massive slice of luck on 16 when he was given out, only to win a review when replays showed a Cameron Green delivery actually hit the off-stump but the bail somehow was not dislodged. Stokes shared in a restorative 128-run stand for the fifth wicket with Bairstow to pull England out of the mire. Meanwhile, Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood has been ruled out of the fifth and final Test with a side strain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/plucky-bairstow-leads-england-fightback/article38182386.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:58 IST,||Rabada lives up to his reputation||Kagiso Rabada is special. A rare diamond in a land of precious stones. He’s so unique that among all Test bowlers — from the era of ‘uncovered’ pitches to the ‘covered’ times — he has the second best strike rate of 41.0 for those with 100 wickets or more. Only England’s G.A. Lohmann — he played between 1886 and 1896 — has a better strike rate of 34.1. However, Lohmann finished with 112 wickets from 18 matches on ‘uncovered’ pitches and Rabada already has 226 scalps from 49 Tests on ‘covered’ tracks. Rabada, just 26, is a rhythm bowler with explosive strength, efficient technique, disconcerting lift and searing pace. He’s an impact paceman who alters the course of matches. For South Africa, he’s the spearhead. The No. 1 in a compelling pace attack. And it was Rabada’s blistering spell of aggressive fast bowling — he is consistent between 140 and 150 kmph — of hostility and control that opened up the Test for South Africa when two old soldiers, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, were taking the game away from the Proteas on the third morning. He was charged up from the time he was brought on. Rabada’s first delivery was a nasty short ball. He immediately wanted a short-leg. Dean Elgar gave it to him. What followed was a red hot unforgettable spell of fast bowling. Watching from the press box, you could sense the intensity. Ajinkya Rahane fended a vicious short one and Aiden Markram in the cordon reacted late. This angered Rabada even more. The natural athlete ran in harder and bowled a brutish delivery of pace, bounce and away movement from the off-stump to find Rahane’s edge and ended the 111-run third-wicket partnership. Then he brought one back sharply into Pujara to win a leg-before shout. And he took out Rishabh Pant, after first striking the left-hander on the helmet grill with a nasty lifter, and then, after Rassie van der Dussen got the Indian worked up with his words from short-leg, took out the wicketkeeper-batter who perished to a forgettable coming-down-the-pitch biff. In the space of 11 balls, Rabada opened up the game for South Africa with three vital scalps. But then, who lit up the rocket? It was Elgar. Apart from being a fearless batsman who can withstand pain and construct influential knocks, Elgar is also an inspirational captain. Not happy with Rabada’s bowling, Elgar revealed that he told the pace ace, “You are an immensely respected cricketer within our group and at the moment I don’t think you are conducting yourself extremely well.” Elgar added, “When Rabada has his tail up, there’s no better bowler.” The skipper’s words had their effect on the marquee paceman. And a fired-up Rabada swung the Test South Africa’s way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rabada-lives-up-to-his-reputation/article38182399.ece

Spain had a big advantage before the semifinal had even started with Poland suffering a major blow when Kamil Majchrzak announced he had tested positive and been forced into seven days of isolation. Majchrzak had won all three of his singles rubbers so far and his replacement, doubles specialist Jan Zielinski, was a poor substitute. He crashed 2-6, 1-6 to World No. 20 Pablo Carreno Busta in just 53 minutes to hand Spain a 1-0 advantage before Bautista Agut, ranked one place above his teammate, battled past Hurkacz 7-6(6), 2-6, 7-6(5) in a high-quality thriller. Later, Poland’s pair won the dead doubles to make the scoreline 2-1. It is the second time Spain has made the decider of the tournament, losing in 2020 to Novak Djokovic’s Serbia..  The results: Semifinals: Spain bt Poland 2-1 {Pablo Carreno Busta bt Jan Zielinski 6-2, 6-1; Roberto Bautista Agut bt Hubert Hurkacz 7-6(6), 2-6, 7-6(5); Pedro Martinez & Albert Ramos-Vilonas lost to Szymon Walkow & Zielinski 6-4, 3-6, [6-10]} .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/spain-enters-the-final/article38182387.ece

CFC ended a two-match losing streak with a 1-0 win over Jamshedpur FC last Sunday and will feel good going into Saturday’s fixture. The team will also have the services of newly signed striker Nerijus Valskis who can provide much-needed attacking firepower in the final third of the pitch. The former champion has scored only nine goals so far, the lowest by any team in the tournament. “The players showed good character and ability to change things even after two defeats and that’s important for me. Even some of the stronger teams don’t make a comeback after conceding losses. I want my team to be stable,” said coach Bozidar Bandovic. Stuttering run Goa, currently ninth in the table, comes into the fixture on the back of three draws and a loss in its last four fixtures and injuries to key players has meant it hasn’t scored a lot of goals either. In the last match against Kerala Blasters FC, the team showed resolve to come back from going down 2-0 under 25 minutes to salvage a draw and a point. Coach Derrick Pereira though is aware that his side needs to start winning sooner rather than later if it hopes to have a chance to make the playoffs. “In the last match, the start was not good conceding two goals but (Jorge) Ortiz’s goal gave us hope and Edu’s goal (Bedia) gave us belief that we can make it,” said Pereira. “We had a very good second half and we need to carry on from there. We need to keep that composure upfront to finish and keep a clean sheet,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cfc-looks-to-pile-on-fc-goas-misery/article38182478.ece

SC EB continued to remain winless and stayed at the bottom of the table with six points from 10 matches but showed the right attitude and purpose that was missing in its performance so far. MCFC regained the top spot with 17 points but continued to remain winless for the fourth successive match. SC EB put up a good defensive plan that denied MCFC a clear look at the goal for a major part of the match. Striker Igor Angulo managed a header in the ninth minute off a D. Vignesh cross but the seasoned striker could not generate enough power to beat SC EB goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya. Mumbai’s attacks fell flat in the East Bengal box where India defender Adil Khan led by example. Mumbai City was denied a genuine call of penalty in the 23rd minute when East Bengal winger Bikash Jairu clearly handled the ball inside his own box while trying to stop a cross from Mumbai midfielder Raynier Fernandes.  The result: SC East Bengal 0 drew with Mumbai City FC 0.   Saturday’s matches: ATK MB vs Odisha, 7.30 p.m.; FC Goa vs Chennaiyin FC, 9.30 p.m .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sc-eb-mcfc-go-goalless/article38182392.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:57 IST,||Slow over-rate will lead to on-field penalties in T20Is||Slow over-rates in T20Is will invite stricter penalties with the ICC announcing on Friday that teams which fail to keep up will end up with one fielder less outside the 30-yard circle for the remainder of the innings, starting this month. The ICC also introduced an optional drinks interval midway through the innings in bilateral T20Is as part of its updated playing conditions. The in-match penalties are in addition to the sanctions for slow over rate outlined in Article 2.22 of the ICC code. The existing sanctions include demerit points and financial penalties on teams and their captains. “The over rate regulations are captured in clause 13.8 of the playing conditions , which stipulate that a fielding side must be in position to bowl the first ball of the final over of the innings by the scheduled or rescheduled time for the end of the innings,” the ICC stated. “If they are not in such a position, one fewer fielder will be permitted outside of the 30-yard circle for the remaining overs of the innings.” Under normal regulations, five fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle after six overs. The change was recommended by the ICC Cricket Committee, which regularly discusses ways to improve the pace of play in all formats, after considering reports on the effectiveness of a similar regulation in the playing conditions for the Hundred conducted by the ECB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/slow-over-rate-will-lead-to-on-field-penalties-in-t20is/article38182388.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 06:52 IST,||AC Milan cashes in on Roma’s errors||Jose Mourinho was left gesticulating in disapproval after two grievous errors from his Roma players handed AC Milan a 3-1 win in Serie A. First, striker Tammy Abraham stuck out his arm to block a shot that resulted in a penalty for Milan, then defender Roger Ibanez made a terrible back pass that was intercepted by Olivier Giroud, leading to the Rossoneri’s second goal in just the 17th minute. Giroud converted the penalty and Junior Messias scored Milan’s second on a rebound after Giroud’s effort hit the post. Abraham then pulled one back for Roma with a deflection but Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan maintained the team’s advantage with a series of superb saves. Milan also hit the goalframe twice, while Roma finished with nine men when Rick Karsdorp and Gianluca Mancini each picked up their second yellow cards — which will mean they’ll be suspended for Sunday’s game against Juventus. With Roma down to 10 men, Rafael Leao restored Milan’s two-goal advantage after being set up with a chested pass from fellow substitute Zlatan Ibrahimovic to sprint in alone toward goal. Ibrahimovic then had a penalty attempt saved by Rui Patrício. Mourinho questioned decisions by referee Daniele Chiffi and VAR official Gianluca Aureliano. Milan moved within one point of Serie A leader Inter Milan, whose game at Bologna was among postponed after the hosts were ordered into quarantine. The other games affected were Atalanta vs. Torino, Salernitana vs. Venezia and Fiorentina vs. Udinese. Thursday’s matches were held on a national holiday in Italy, the Epiphany. Another full slate of 10 matches is scheduled for Sunday. Napoli drops points Virus-depleted Napoli drew 1-1 at Juventus despite missing five players — plus coach Luciano Spalletti — who tested positive for COVID-19. Dries Mertens opened the scoring for Napoli with a shot through Alex Sandro’s legs then Federico Chiesa equalized with a shot through the legs of Stanislav Lobotka. Third-place Napoli dropped five points behind Milan while Juventus, which had captain Giorgio Chiellini out positive with the coronavirus, remained fifth.  The results: AC Milan 3 (Giroud 8-pen, Messias 17, Leao 82) bt Roma 1 (Abraham 40); Juventus 1 (Chiesa 54) drew with Napoli 1 (Mertens 23); Lazio 3 (Immobile 14, Milinkovic-Savic 66, 90+3) drew with Empoli 3 (Bajrami 6-pen, Zurkowski 8, Di Francesco 75); Sampdoria 1 (Gabbiadini 18) lost to Cagliari 2 (Deiola 55, Pavoletti 71); Sassuolo 1 (Berardi 55) drew with Genoa 1 (Destro 7); Spezia 1 (Erlic 85) lost to Verona 2 (Caprari 59 & 70) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ac-milan-cashes-in-on-roma-errors-scripts-a-3-1-victory/article38181952.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 07:03 IST,||God and His bhaktas||The essential dharma or duty of the jiva is ‘Seshatva’ or ‘Dasatva’ to the Lord and hence unconditional service to the Lord is central to the Vaishnava method of worship. But the tradition also highlights the importance of acharya bhakti and bhagavata bhakti, pointed out Asuri Sri Madhavachariar in a discourse. In the Ramayana, Lakshmana and Bharata exemplify bhagavat bhakti through their dasa bhava. They see Rama not only as their elder brother but also as their master. But Shatrugna stands out as an example for bhagavata bhakti in the exclusive way in which he serves Bharata rather than Rama. This does not mean he is not devoted to Rama or sidelines Him. This bhava only means that only when one is God’s servant, he can serve God’s bhaktas. Madhurakavi Azhwar renounces all else in favour of Nammazhwar, his acharya. Such practices that honour the preceptors and respect His bhaktas would please the Lord. In fact, He would frown and disregard those who are reluctant to do so. More interesting is the way in which the Lord, who is the ‘Seshi,’ the one and only Master of all, and the Ishwara Tatva, takes up roles in various contexts to serve jiva tatvas such as Vishwamitra, Vasishta or the Pandavas during His Vibhava avataras such as Rama or Krishna. Unlike jivas whose primary duty is service, the service bhava taken by Him is purely through His Sankalpa. Rama offers His service to Vishwamitra and obeys the sage’s order to kill Tataka. He is respectful when learning under Vasishta. These instances teach us the value of acharya bhakti that moulds the character of the disciple. Krishna goes to the extent of serving as a messenger to the Pandavas. The Lord thereby indicates that He takes sides with dharma and opposes adharma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/god-and-his-bhaktas/article38182015.ece

We are embarking on a year of immense potential: where blue skies full of opportunity and rolling greens of plenty beckon. But enough about my golf; now, back to you. In these trying times, I urge you to try even harder. You must try to do ten people’s work, which, of course, being a physical impossibility, will ensure that you do not hit your targets, forcing us to regretfully slash your salary next year, or your name right out of our records. Believe you me, I heartily appreciate your tireless work during this crisis, and there is nothing I’d like better than to give you a small raise. I’d like it better than a golf holiday, Tesla shares or a new car, but, of course, while I’m going to get myself these inconsequential trinkets, I can’t afford to do what tops my priority list and what would give me the greatest joy — ie. to give you a raise. I’ve constantly reiterated that our company is one which cares deeply for its valued employees as our many posters across the office and our daily memes remind you. I am sure you will remember our expensive internal advertising campaign to push on, strive harder, work till you drop? I hope you appreciate the constant positive energy being sent out to you — (though invisible, it is very much there). Right now, as I get a relaxing foot massage, I selflessly project the healing aroma not to my tired feet, but out across the seas, to you. It is also that much-awaited time to crown the Employee of the Year, and it goes out with a generous cash award, to our AI bot which works 24x7 to find clichés and positive phrases that worked for other companies, plagiarise and present them daily to you. I would not be the acclaimed, respected leader that I am, if I were to let your dedicated service go unrewarded. I am aware that many of you worked yourself sick, and though we had budget cuts, which prevented us from supporting your medical bills, we are determined to compensate you. Please accept this framed photograph of myself taking a much-needed break in the Alps after my challenging golf holiday. May the snow-capped peaks behind me inspire you to take our company to the pinnacles of success. Thank you, AI bot, for that shimmering cliché. The photo is personalised for you, ‘Valued Employee’.

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 04:00 IST,||Meet the 3 Shettys changing Kannada cinema||In October, Kannada star Rakshit Shetty — known for backing and being a part of ‘thinking projects’ — tweeted about a film that had blown his mind and that his production house Paramvah would be collaborating with. On November 19, when Raj B Shetty’s Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana ( GGVV ) released, viewers could relate to that emotional announcement.  The film marked the coming together of three talents from Dakshina Kannada, the coastal southern tip of Karnataka. It starred Raj (34) and Rishab Shetty (38), and was presented by Rakshit (38). “It stayed with me for more than three days, which is very rare for me,” says Rakshit, who watched it during the Covid-19 lockdown, in June 2020. “I knew this was special and that I had to become a part of it.” The film has now been picked up by Zee-5 — the third Kannada film that the OTT platform has chosen recently — and hopefully will see Kannada movies gain the kind of national popularity that Malayalam and Tamil films are experiencing at the moment. Spearheading a revival  Dakshina Kannada has slowly been reclaiming its space in mainstream Kannada cinema. Though actor-directors Kashinath and Upendra had paved the way a few decades ago, unfortunately, the region’s unique dialect and sing-song diction soon found itself being used just to elicit laughs rather than to serve as a cultural indicator. Quite like what happened to the deep South in Tamil Nadu and to the Hindi hinterland, before the revival (in Tamil, it was the ‘Madurai Triumvirate’ — as Anurag Kashyap calls Bala, Ameer and Sasikumar — with films such as Subramaniapuram , Sethu , and Paruthiveeran ; in Hindi, filmmakers like Kashyap, Prakash Jha and Anand Rai went back to small-town India in movies like Gangs of Wasseypur , Gangaajal , and Tanu Weds Manu ).   What brought the spotlight back on to Dakshina Kannada was Rakshit’s 2014 debut directorial, Ulidavaru Kandanthe. The crime drama inspired others in the industry such as Rishab ( Kirik Party , Sarkari Hiriya Prathamika Shaale… Kasaragodu ) and Raj. Today, the trio is ensuring the region’s stories, language, food and distinct culture (think tiger dance or pili vesha ) get noticed across Karnataka and beyond.  All things local GGVV references the trinity of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. Not unexpected, as all three actor-directors grew up surrounded by Yakshagana, the theatrical dance drama, and other local art forms. Udupi boy Rakshit recalls watching pili vesha artistes getting painted outside his house. “When I write my films, these images float in,” he says. Rishab was in class six when he played the role of Lord Subramanya in a Yakshagana performance in his village of Keradi, in Kundapura, about 40 kilometres from Udupi. Raj, the youngest of the Shetty trio, grew up in Bhadravati, near Shimoga, before moving to Mangaluru. “I wonder if any other region in the country offers this kind of cultural smorgasbord, featuring so many performing arts: Yakshagana, bhootakola , dance and music, and festivity,” says the actor-director, who also fell in love with Mangaluru Kannada.  The language factor  In fact, it was language — specifically Mangaluru and Kasargod Kannada — that Raj and Rishab bonded over in 2017. Impressed by Raj’s OMK, the latter asked him to write a few dialogues for Sarkari… , a 2018 film about a lone Kannada medium school struggling to survive in the border district of Kasargod. The ‘deal’ was signed in Bengaluru, over rice and leftover fish curry (without the fish). “I think our boys [Raj and his team] were just happy to get ooru -style curry and boiled rice in the city,” smiles Rishab, adding that Raj “wrote the dialogues for 10 scenes in 10 minutes, and tweaked them in another five”.   Rishab and Rakshit’s friendship, meanwhile, goes back to their struggling years, specifically 2011-2012. Rakshit, an engineering graduate, was trying to make a mark in cinema, and Rishab, who had a diploma in direction from the Government Film and TV Institute in Bengaluru, was doing everything from real estate to selling water cans in Bengaluru when the two met on the sets of Aravind Kaushik’s Tughlak — Rakshit’s debut as hero, with Rishab as antagonist.   In 2014, they would collaborate on Ulidavaru Kandante , now a cult classic, and in 2016, the two came together for Kirik Party . Rakshit is now working on Richard Anthony , Ulidavaru ’s possible prequel and sequel of sorts (which takes the story forward, but also delves into the past). Meanwhile, I learn, Raj was initially wary of interacting with Rakshit — he stayed away from stars. “But when I finally met him during the Covid-19 lockdown and we discussed cinema, I saw a kindred soul. I wrote an idea he had for an OTT project, and he loved what he saw of GGVV and offered to present it,” he says.  A growing community  Each of them, in their own way, has helped create an ecosystem of like-minded creators. Rakshit invests heavily in writing and his team, Rakshit and the Seven Odds, is quite popular in the industry. One of the reasons he decided to make Ulidavaru Kandanthe in the Dakshina Kannada dialect was because he was tired of hearing bad versions of the dialect on screen. “That is not the language we speak,” he insists.   Rishab has been producing films and backing new talent from across the state. He does this so “no one has to monkey pedal for 10 years before they get to ride a cycle!” — he got to make a movie ( Ricky , 2016) after 10 years of struggle.  For Raj, his ecosystem is his friends and his cinematographer-editor Praveen Shriyan with whom he’s worked since his first short film. “When like-minded people are involved in a project, it becomes more valuable... I feel I am giving in to the selfish motive of witnessing pure art being created,” he says.  ‘ Writing is deep catharsis’  Rakshit, Rishab and Raj — who write, act, direct and produce films — learn from each role of theirs. “When I direct someone like Anant Nag [ Sarkari Shaale ], I subconsciously pick up something I can use as an actor. Likewise, when I act with someone like Raj, I am in awe of what he manages to do as a director,” says Rishab.  For Raj, the stories come from his lived experiences. So, writing is deep catharsis. He calls himself a writer first, then a director and actor. “Producing my films gives me the freedom to write without worrying about selling. My friends take on the hard side of production. I only lend my name. So when someone like Rakshit offers to present the film, I am delighted, because that frees me up to just be creative,” he smiles. Rakshit considers himself a writer first. “I am constantly observing and absorbing stuff. And so, writing happens very naturally. As a producer, I have an eagle’s eye perspective — I don’t micromanage. As an actor, I just have to come to the set and be the character,” he says. Do the three men hope to collaborate more often? Yes, but only if the script demands it. They want to work with filmmakers from other parts of Karnataka so that they can give others a leg up and help narrate their stories in a commercial format.  Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana premieres on Zee-5 on January 13.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/meet-the-3-shettys-changing-kannada-cinema/article38182333.ece

Right from her digital debut with the first season of Masaba Masaba on Netflix back in August 2020 to her Fashion Week participation to her most recent collab with Nykd by Nykaa, where she printed milk cartons on sleepwear, Gupta has been busy. As for House of Masaba, well, last month saw a festive line for The Masaba Man, in habutai silk and natural crêpe fabrics with inspiration from kashida embroidery. The campaign had model Robbie Mairh rocking both lavender and a nose ring. “It is not really about breaking the rules. It is about making people comfortable with the idea of doing whatever they want to do, whether they want to wear a nose pin or don’t or want to wear kajal or don’t. I don’t think there are rules anymore,” says Gupta, who also launched Autumn Winter 2021 collections for Masaba Woman and Masaba Jewels (a gender-neutral line in gold).  What has been missing in Indian menswear, we ask her: Men are not fussy dressers. They want simple and straightforward. Brands interpret [this] as boring and that is not the case. So what is missing is something that is simple and straightforward but exciting. That is what we are offering. It is a basic kurta, but more exciting with the prints, colours, and our style.

One such is the Hindustan Trading Company in Chennai’s Royapettah. Amritha Venketakrishnan, 33, who has been running it for a while now, has also been creating a buzz online, for the store’s activities. HTC has attracted everyone from MF Husain and fellow artists to art professors and students since her grandfather started it about half a century ago, but Venketakrishnan has taken it further with her inventory, workshops and Instagram takeovers. The workshops, especially on trends like acrylic pouring and calligraphy, have been known to sell out in seconds. Then the pandemic put a stop to that and the store, like most others, had to down its shutters during the lockdowns. Noting the increasing interest in art during the first wave, at a time when outfits like Amazon could not operate either, Venketakrishnan began taking orders and delivering them herself. She also used the extra time to focus on social media.  ‘Live at 5’ on their Instagram page was a series of collaborations with well-known artists, including The Hindu’s cartoonist, Keshav Venkataraghavan. While the third wave may affect plans for upcoming workshops — Sonali Singh Rao (@sonalisinghrao on Instagram), a resin artist, will be conducting a workshop, as will Tejo, a doodle artist (@tejo_oo on Instagram) — Venketakrishnan knows the demand for professional art supplies will continue. Here she puts together a list of bestsellers and new entrants, be it Edding Germany’s hobby paint markers or Jacquard USA’s steam-set silk dyes. @hindustanonline on Instagram.  Amit Kapoor’s Escoda brush set “Most artists have their ‘favourite brushes’ and use only three or four at a time,” explains Venketakrishnan. Amit Kapoor, a leading master of the watercolour medium in India, has a signature set and his Escoda Barcelona brushes are priced at Rs. 7,160. Resin pen holders Eldorado resin pen holders by Luis Creations are popular with calligraphy artists, especially the ones with crystal clear resin and embedded gold-coloured foil. There are the pastel and aluminium Moblique Al pen holders, another product of Luis Creations. Approximately Rs. 2,667 onwards. Remote-controlled easels Mabef easels are professional and yes, expensive. These remote-controlled beauties are ideal for restoration work, with an electrically powered raising and tilting motion. Made of stain-resistant beech wood and walnut lacquered, with an extensible sliding mast. There are tabletop and big heavy-duty versions, ranging from Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 1,00,000. Porcelain travel palettes Etchr mini palettes are tidy travel companions. Designed by Stephanie Law, they are made from smooth porcelain and easy to clean. Specially designed for watercolour, but acrylic, gouache, and miniature paints work well too. The set of two palettes — one for storing paint and the other for mixing colours — come in a small, easy to pack steel tin.

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 04:01 IST,||Sex education & the classroom||When Anamika, mum to a 15-year-old, wanted her son to know “about the birds and the bees beyond the ninth standard textbook lesson”, she approached a physician. Having taught her son about ‘good touch, bad touch’ when he was younger, she wanted this to be handled by a professional. The male doctor, in his late 50s, told her that she would be setting a bad example for him. A second, younger physician told her not to worry and that “boys have a way of figuring things out. For all you know, he already knows”. She then approached a female doctor, in her mid-30s, who asked if her husband was aware that she was “teaching these things to his son”. A fourth doctor told her that young girls get pregnant because mothers like her supported their sons in doing these things . Finally, Anamika decided to have a chat with her son by herself, and documented the experience on her Twitter account (@HiAinwe).  This, in a nutshell, is the issue with sexuality education in India. Since it has its seeds in the AIDS awareness movement, it tends to focus on what not to do instead of helping adolescents navigate relationships, establish boundaries, and understand protection. Neelu Grover, a safety and sexuality educator, who runs the Facebook page, The Gandi Baat Project, has worked with almost 50 schools in Mumbai. “Both schools and parents find it difficult to accept and acknowledge that a teenager is a ‘sexual’ being,” she says. “The concepts of friendship, romantic relationships, and sexual pleasure taught in a wholesome way are missing. Hence, the youth are learning [and they will, in this hyper sexualised world] about sexual pleasure in manipulative, harmful and unsafe ways.” Not just about periods Sexuality education in India is a little hazy. While the country is obliged to provide free, compulsory, and comprehensive education to adolescents and young people — as one of the signatories to the 1994 United Nations International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) — a 2008 report published in the United Nations Human Rights Council site states, “In India, private schools are free to choose whether to include sexuality education in their curricula… Those schools affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) are required to have a component of sex education in their syllabi but such schools are a minority. Most schools do not have any form of sexuality education in their curricula.” This seems to corroborate our findings: sexuality education is conducted in schools but is not mandatory. Mumbai-based children’s author Natasha Sharma is a mother to two teenagers, a son and a daughter, aged 16 and 14. They study at one of the city’s reputed schools. “My children did have some sessions from as early as grade five, which explained periods, hormonal changes, puberty.” However, while they were helpful and conducted timely, she feels “sex education needs to grow much broader today. Talking about different gender choices, acceptance and respect for the same, pronoun choices — these are extremely important. In addition, we need conversations on the sexualising of language, and the chatter on social platforms and WhatsApp groups need to be addressed”. Continued on page 4 Continued from page 1 Keeping it simple and accurate Swati Jagdish, a psychologist and sexuality health educator, runs the popular Instagram handle @mayas_amma (with a following of 331k) that prominently features conversations with her eight-year-old daughter Maya. “I don’t think schools are doing much as of now. Some do take the initiative of inviting a sex health educator/doctor to talk about puberty and menstruation. From what I have understood after interacting with parents is that for most schools, sex ed is just period education. Barely have I come across a school that has done a talk on online safety, sexual grooming…” When Jagdish started conducting classes on motherhood, the menstrual cup, etc, she received a lot of queries from parents looking for help on how to address children-related issues such as preventing sex abuse, and watching pornography. “I realised that sex education is important to manage a lot of issues that we face, such as gender-based violence, body shaming etc. It can slowly put an end to these.” Jagdish conducts workshops for parents of kids in the 1-10 age group. “That’s the right time to start. We can have simple conversations regarding body safety, consent, autonomy, and decision making.” Till date, she has conducted workshops in Chennai, Bengaluru, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, and Hyderabad, and online as well. What is the role of schools then? Grover feels the institutions should give scientific, inclusive, and accurate information over multiple sessions throughout students’ school years. Woodstock School in Mussoorie, for example, follows PSHE (Personal, Social, and Health Education), a curriculum used in the UK. Jeffrey Doerfler, Head of Upper Years, tells us, “We introduce the topic of sexuality in grades six to eight. In the beginning, it is introduced in a scientific manner. As this is taught by our trained personal counsellors, they are able to have Q and A sessions as well. As the students get older, we emphasise the emotional side of relationships.” Home, a good place to begin  While schools can add to the foundation, the home needs to be the basis for such conversations to begin. Even if we can’t all have a parent who is a certified sex therapist, like Gillian Anderson’s open-minded Jean Milburn, in Netflix’s British comedy, Sex Education. Dehradun-based businessman Himmat Kohli, father to a son and a daughter, aged 21 and 17, says that his family structure “is such that we had incorporated an open forum as early as in class five. It was the perfect opportunity to normalise conversations around sex and help build a healthy attitude towards it, and when the kids went to their boarding schools [The Doon School and Mayo College, Ajmer] they were less likely to fall victim to false information”. The onus, he feels, lies with all the stakeholders: children, parents and teachers. While Sharma adds that both parents and schools have a crucial role to play: “It’s better to get some of this information from a reliable source rather than curious minds trying to figure out on the internet or incorrect information garnered from a peer group. Secondly, discussions on gender choices, both at home and in school, normalises this and increases acceptance in society overall.”  When my 12-year-old daughter came home from her international school, with homework that entailed watching a series of videos on YouTube called The Great Sperm Race , I took it as the perfect opportunity to sit with her and become part of the journey of her sexuality education. We watched the videos (Part 1 has over a million views) and then had an open conversation about sex, with surprisingly no giggling or squirming.  ‘Birds and bees’talk in Arunachal Most professionals agree that sex education needs to go beyond what Grover calls “safe” and “incomplete” concepts such as menstruation, reproductive organs, and STDs. To address this gap, Reckitt, the consumer-healthcare company (which owns Durex), designed The Birds and The Bees Talk, and launched it in 2020 with the support of the state governments of Manipur, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh (where the prevalence of HIV is high). “We wanted to design a programme that is children friendly, with a focus on five pillars: Awareness, Consent, Protection, Equity and Inclusion,” says Ravi Bhatnagar, Director of External Affairs and Partnerships, South Asia. The programme — which has already reached two million school children and aims to touch another three million — has an interactive curriculum, using AI-based chatbots, workshops, webinars, and age-appropriate videos to impart behavioural change communication. It is now launching a digital ecosystem and trying to establish new vehicles of communication such as audiobooks and podcasts. Given India’s chequered history with sexuality education, has the programme encountered roadblocks? “We haven’t faced any hesitation because the curriculum is largely co-created and co-owned [they work closely with Wipro GE Healthcare, Love Matter — a global sexual and reproductive health and rights programme — state governments, parent groups, school committees, etc],” he explains. To increase acceptance, the programme also uses local festivals as a vehicle to propel discussions around sexual awareness. Perhaps such public-private partnerships are the answer going forward. They could help bring comprehensive sexuality education to the 600-odd million youth in the country. Kohli sums it up best when he says, “India needs a curriculum which teaches respect, consent and love.”  In grade six, we had a basic adolescence workshop conducted by the school counsellors. I don’t remember much except that we were made to watch a Dr D video. A more age-appropriate session should have been offered to us again Agastya Rao 14, Gurgaon   In the eighth grade, we had lessons by the Biology teacher. Only the outline was given though.

Or else, try framing a wallpaper you like in a barely-there frame to create your own wall. #2 If you don’t have the kind of spaces you need, create them with screens You can work with the original wooden screen – be it Victorian, Chinoiserie or Japanese style — or can bring in a modern touch by using a shelf or book rack as a room divider. #3 If you can’t hammer nails into the wall, lean your artwork against it If the landlord’s really got a thing about nails, consider leaning your artwork — big or small — against the wall. Larger pieces can stand on the floor; smaller ones can be placed on tables and sideboards. #4 If you are always short of storage, work with multifunctional furniture Choose from the multitude of options available — beds with storage, under-bed drawers, poufs that open up, coffee tables that offer extra surfaces or nifty benches with storage. The choices are plenty. #5 If you don’t like the floors, go shopping for a brand new rug Mosaic and terrazzo might have been the most popular flooring material once but if it’s not what you like, cover up with a fancy rug. Layering rugs can give you a wall-to-wall carpet kind of feel. #6 If the windows seem grimy no matter what you do, cover them up with vibrant drapes A set of colourful curtains will get your mind off the dull windows and up the style factor of the room. You can also use curtains to section off awkward corners and niches. #7 If the living room doesn’t seem party ready, get home a couple of lamps A combination of lamps — may be a floor lamp, a chandelier or a pendant — will create a warm ambience and instantly make your room more glamorous. #8 If the corridor seems too dingy, brighten it up by placing a large mirror at the end Most often than not, corridors tend to grubby and dull. Brighten them up by bringing in a large mirror in a shiny metallic frame and placing on the dead wall. #9 If the kitchen doesn’t seem homey, consider open shelving Most rental kitchens tend to be sterile and uninviting. Make them home-like by displaying colourful crockery and jars on open shelving. Don’t forget to line the shelves for greater impact! #10 If the bathroom’s not to your taste, add colourful touches Bright towels, a cushioned bathmat, a pretty shower curtain, a vibrant counter set... the bathroom will no longer look like what it did when you moved in! #11 If the apartment still doesn’t look lived in, bring in some greenery Chances are you won’t have a garden so bringing in potted plants is a quick and expensive way to add a new breath of life to your rooms. Pick hardy plants that will survive even if you don’t have a green thumb! Once you’re done, see how the rented house becomes a home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/a-fancy-rug-here-a-potted-plant-there/article38182353.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 03:48 IST,||RWAs embark on cloth bag campaign||ABJT Residents Welfare Association in Kovilambakkam welcomes the New Year – 2022 with a resolution: to get residents to use cloth bags and stay away from single plastic bags. ABJT association represents the following localities – Ambedkar Salai, Bavani Street, Judges Colony, and TNPL Colony – in Kovilambakkam. The association has embarked on this effort to support the State’s recently-launched campaign of “Meendum Manjapai”. As part of this exercise, the association distributed cloth bags to customers and vendors of shops in its region. “The association has bought 300 bags for this awareness campaign. Each bag costs Rs. .24. We have also created a WhatsApp group with the vendors. The challenge they face is that customers do not bring cloth bags. They also pointed out that some insist on plastic bags so that they can reuse them to discard waste generated in their houses. We told them to refer those customers to us so that we will try to educate them,” says J Shankar, treasurer of the association. The Association also has plans to rope in children in this campaign. “We will be organising a rally where children will go around the various streets highlighting the hazards of single-use plastic items,” says Shankar. Likewise, two other associations in Kovilambakkam – BKR Residents Welfare Association and Engineers Avenue Residents Welfare Association will be carrying our similar campaigns along the lines of Meendum Manjapai. “We have placed an order for 7,000 bags from a manufacturer based in Thirupur. Each bag is priced at Rs. .23. We will be giving a set of 1,000 bags to each shopkeeper. We have asked them to charge Rs. . 5 for each bag and upon return during their next visit to the shop that amount should be returned. Mostly, on or before January 26 the distribution will begin. In fact, we did a similar campaign a few years ago,” says G Venkataramesh Kumar, president, BKR Residents Welfare Association. In Velachery West, AGS Colony Residents’ Welfare Association (ACRWA) has launched a different campaign in support of Meendum Manjapai. “Instead of buying and giving cloth bags to the vendors, the association has shared a list of manufacturers based in Namakkal. This time we decided not to distribute cloth bags either to vendors or residents. Because we tried giving them cloth bags in 2018. However, this did not bring in the desired change. Nobody bothers to carry a cloth bag to this day. So this time, we again tried educating the shopkeepers in our colony and succeeded in making two shopkeepers to buy and keep stock of cloth bags, one runs a grocery store and other, a supermarket,” says Geetha Ganesh, secretary, AGS Colony Residents Welfare Association. However, Geetha Ganesh along with Jayanthi Premchander, a resident of Valmiki Nagar has plans to distribute 200 cloth bags to the underprivileged at the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board tenement (the erstwhile Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board) at Rajiv Gandhi Nagar in Thiruvanmiyur. “Even though, single use plastic items are banned in Tamil Nadu, nobody pays any heed to it. To cite an example, each time we cut plantain trees at my house, I inform the nearby flower vendors to come and collect the leaves and make use of them to wrap their flowers. No price attached, it was for free. But they did not bother and continue to use the plastic covers. That is because they did not have fear over violating the ban. I welcome the State’s attempt to make its people get into the habit of using cloth bags through Meendum Manjapai campaign. But it has to enforce the rule with an iron hand,” says Geetha Ganesh.  “The State has to enforce the single-use plastic ban with an iron hand”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/rwas-embark-on-cloth-bag-campaign/article38182212.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 03:56 IST,||Have you met the moths of Valmiki Nagar?||Away from the glare of the concrete jungle, attracting moths is as easy as a five-finger piano exercise. Actually, easier than that. Just a plain white screen generously washed with the rays of a properly placed light source would leave one beady-eyed from going sleepless, counting these lepidopterans. At his sequestered home in North Carolina, Vikas Madhav Nagarajan has had the pleasure of hosting 65 moth species in one night, with a black light-lit moth screen playing the genial usher. Before May 2021, when he moved to the United States for higher studies, at his apartment in Valmiki Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur, Vikas discovered the limitations of moth screens — no matter how brightly and cleverly lit — amidst the unblinking, sleepless lights of a bustling urban space. A criss-cross of competing lights is hardly good news for moth-spotting. “When you are in a place that has a lot of light pollution — like the city — moth screens do not really attract that many moths,” notes Vikas, while discussing a project he spearheaded — “The Moths of Valmiki Nagar”, . He certainly required a wider surface area to study moths and he found it in the roughcast walls and stairs of his three-block apartment. He would keep a night aside, every 15 days, and play Jack on the Beanstalk, clambering up and down the lit stairs of the apartment — on Fourth Seaward Road in Valmiki Nagar — bogged down with essential impedimenta: a torch, a camera and during the pandemic, a hand sanitiser to boot. “I did get a few on the screen that I kept in my flat. I got a lot of moths on the stairs of the apartment, which were left lit through the night. My apartment complex has three buildings and all of them have four floors,” explains Vikas. That sounds like a great workout. One that Vikas counts the benefits from the exercise in toned calf muscles, moths. “All the 135 moths are from — I would not even say, Thiruvanmiyur — Valmiki Nagar. Out of them, 98 had been documented at the apartment complex on Seaward Road in Valmiki Nagar.”  The project to document the moths of Valmiki Nagar racked up 135 species, with those stairs contibuting a vast chunk of it. The effort is subsumed in a larger, pan-Chennai moth project, one that features two other well-known naturalists: R Bhanumathi — better known as ‘Butterfly Bhanu’ — and M Yuvan, author of A Naturalist’s Journal. Explorations in the Adyar Poonga in the fag end of 2018 essentially signalled the launch of the pan-Chennai moth project. “Yuvan, I and Rohith Srinivasan were carrying out the moth documentation work at the Poonga,” notes Vikas. Additionally, whoever was on board was carrying out moth studies in their own diggings: Mahathi Narayanaswamy started documenting them on the IIT-Madras campus; Rohith Srinivasan in the Velachery and Perungudi region. For his part, Vikas started wooing moths to his flat. Vikas was successful in coopting residents of his apartment into the project. “They know that I work with moths — so, many of them would send pictures: ‘Hey Vikas, this moth came home!’nd if it is something new, I would be like “Aunty, can you keep it there for some time?” and then go and take a few pictures. It did engage a few people — that was a very heartening thing to see.” Pre-Covid — and when Covid-19 restrictions were eased — Vikas would head to the apartments his friends stayed in and study moths again on lit stairways at night. “By increasing the area of my focus, I tried to assess how diversity mattered and how diversity changed from place to place. But I could not see any great change in diversity within Valmiki Nagar, because it is obviously a very small area. “IIT-M, Guindy National Park and Madras Christian College, Tambaram — they are definitely much more diverse in their moth life. But I did see several interesting stuff at Valmiki Nagar,” remarks Vikas. From the data acquired from December 2018 to May 2021, the paper notes that the most diverse family of moths recorded was Erebidae (39%) followed by Crambidae (30%) and Geometridae (8%). “The moth diversity in the month of July was seen to be the highest,” it adds. Mahathi and Rohith came on board the Valmiki Nagar project, largely intrigued by the environment it which it was being conducted. They assisted Vikas’effort in the areas of paper preparation and presentation. “When we started working on the paper as such, going through additional literature, especially since it was an urban setup Vikas was working in completely, not to mention it was along the beach, the data was very interesting,” remarks Mahathi. Vikas reveals that Geetha Iyer, a moth expert from Kanyakumari, helped them confirm the moths they have identified. He notes: “Moth identification can be tricky. You often need to wait to know who you have met. You need to read up — even if you have experts on board, there could still be blind spots. There is just too much to know about moths. And there is a lot of old data floating around.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/have-you-met-the-moths-of-valmiki-nagar/article38182269.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 03:56 IST,||A lake sustains local residents during lockdowns||D Gopal and M Hari are with a network company: flinging and stringing wires in the heights is in a day’s work for them. Residents of Agaramthen, their after-work routine has a parallel to it: they work with wires of another kind which they fling the other way, down to the depths. The crepuscular hour is not too distant, and these youngsters are trying their luck for the last time at the Agaramthen lake, with fishing nets. From the enthusiasm with which they discuss the nuances of fishing in the freshwater lake, they seem to be looking forward to these outings. Against a dimming sky, the silhouettes of these two young residents — accompanied by a junior from the village, B Akash, pursuing higher secondary education — are a defining image of the pandemic, particularly its crushing lockdowns. Darwin Annadurai of Eco Society India, an environment-related voluntary organisation carrying out eco-restoration work at the lake notes: “During the lockdown, when jobs dried up for the residents, they got by on the catch from the lake.” Gopal and Gopi discuss how much the fish fish them. They look for rohu (one of the carp varieties) and veeral meen (snakehead murrel), particularly the latter for the good price they fetch them from fish retailers. Of course, there is the resilient jelebi (tilapia) which also turn up often in the nets. Gopal observes that the fish are caught essentially for the market, and sometimes, they do take some home for their table. From Darwin’s interactions with the residents, during the lockdowns though, this pattern was reversed on most days. While the picture is largely sunny most of the time, an alien species does cast its shadow on it. The young part-time fishers are aware of the problem: The invasive African catfish (Clarias gariepinus), an introduced species that is have started owning the lake, as it has many other waterbodies in other parts of the country, to the detriment of the native species. “They eat the young the rohu, so that we mostly do not get to have grown fish,” remarks Gopi. The youngster volunteers additional insight, one that illustrates how informed the millennials are: “with videos about this fish on YouTube, people know how harmful they are to the other fish. Only older people buy it.” The presence of the catfish goes largely unknown except when the water levels dip, which would be in February — however, they would be doing the damage hidden from view. “Getting rid of them is a tricky issue. Assuming we don, catfish will find its way back during the rains — the natural flow of water is from the west to the east, and the fish may get reintroduced from other waterbodies to the west,” says Darwin. Besides its fish life that sustains the local residents, that lake offers a plethora of medicinal herbs. “While carrying out tree plantation and lake-bund strengthening work — with official permission — we have been simultaneously documented 125 plant species, which include rare endemic species. “Residents regularly harvest the medicinal plants to deal with common ailments,” Darwin points out. “South of the lake, there is a scared-grove tropical dry evergreen forest. As part of an ancient tradition, scared groves command reverence and therefore the plants and trees in the area are left alone.” The picture seems free of wrinkles — at least, to all appearances. There are the low-slung hills further south and south-west — much like a toddler struggling to his feet and never quite making it. On the eastern side, the bund is long, and marked by pastoral scenes. there is some habitation towards the north, and the western side is also enchantingly stark, seemingly unsullied by human activity. There is something to the south that mars the picture — a dumping ground which was closed following protests by the villages. Darwin says: “There was a dumping ground on the southern end of the lake — it was called the Vengadamangalam solid waste dumping ground. It was operated by the government until one and half years ago, and the Tambaram and Sembakkam and Pallavaram municipalities would bring the solid waste ton the dump yard. It is closed now because the villagers opposed it, when the incinerators were not being operated well. The incinerator performs well only when source segregation happens properly. When wet and dry waste are mixed together, the moisture content of the solid waste increases and the incinerator collapses when the waste burns at higher temperatures. Many people were affected by the burning of the garbage. Many complaints went up and we also complained to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.” He continues: “Fish grow well when there is a good amount of benthic invertebrate population, which include include worms, larvae of insects and many other invertebrates. When the fish feed on benthic organisms, they flourish. When the sediments contain toxic components or when they are polluted, benthic organisms perish. Earlier, during the rainy season, rainwater would trickle down the landfill, creating leachate which would move downwards, contaminating the lake. We complained about this to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, the collector and the revenue department officials. And it is closed now. Due to the garbage, the sediment was polluted three years ago. This year we did not see much pollution. The lake is now recovering; but it has to be protected.” It is among the rarer lakes one might encounter: Not too removed from suburbia, but still serves as a showpiece of how a waterbody can be blessing to the local community. Visible and hidden stressors should be removed so that it continues in this role forever.  As part of an ancient tradition, scared groves command reverence and therefore the plants and trees in that area are left undisturbed||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-lake-sustains-local-residents-during-lockdowns/article38182270.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 03:47 IST,||Civic sense beyond the backyard||Where most others do not see a jot to write home about, they see scope for a string of missives. Without thinking twice, this rare breed of residents generously lend their time to civic issues not their own, often picking them up while on the move. And when they start pursuing it, they do so with the urgency and persistence of someone putting out a fire in their own living space. Here are two from that tribe. CR Balaji rides the office bus to the Tamil Nadu Petroproducts Limited. In 2020, during these commutes, one unseemly image left a mark on his mind. It would not let him be till he made a missive out of it for those with the power to make that image look better. Now, just before the north-east monsoon, Balaji develops invisible antennas with acute sensitivity to choked waterways and water channels. He would also visit lakes around monsoon time with the ardour of a monk on a series of pilgrimages. In 2020, ahead of the north-east monsoon, during his daily commute down the Manali Express Highway, near Sathyamurthy Nagar he noticed a stretch of North Buckingham canal caked with water hyacinth. Images of the 2015 deluge are haunting for those who had experienced it at close quarters. Sathyamurthy Nagar was among areas that bore the brunt of the Deluge, with the invasive waters damaging essential goods in many houses. Balaji is familiar with developments in that neighbourhood. “In 2020, I complained many a time about it, but without the expected outcome,” recalls Balaji. With the monsoon beating a retreat and the season changing colour, the monsoon-preparedness antennae retracted. The antennae were up again when the 2021 north-east monsoon was just a whiff away. Besides sending his plea to the engineer in chief of the water resources department and the chief engineer (general) public works department, he directed it to the CM’s cell as well. Ridding the canal of hyacinth was entirely the WRD and PWD’s responsibility. Balaji discloses that to achieve critical mass, he sent a copy to the local Corporation AE as well. Simply-worded, the letter reminded the recipients that during the 2015 deluge, there was neck-level water in Sathyamurthy Nagar. The request read: “North Buckingham Canal flowing in Manali Express Highway near Sathyamurthy Nagar needs complete removal of Hyacinth. It joins Puzhal Surplus course and moves towards Ennore creek after merging with River Kosasthalaiyar running parallel filled with Fly Ash.” Balaji notes: “Just before the second spell of heavy rains, the water hyacinth was removed. The action could come a bit earlier, but I guess it was still not too late. I do not know if my letter had any impact, as I did not get a reply — but I am glad that the hyacinth has gone.” Baskar Seshadri has gained a well-earned reputation as a chronicler of hyperlocal realities, with human-interest snippets thrown in for good measure. Unlike CR Balaji, he works in a limited area — it is usually about Mylapore and Mandaveli and Royapettah, and he would occasionally let himself wade into RA Puram. “I generally like to range about where I live and the surrounding areas, as if I were governing the whole place,” says Baskar in a tone that is as matter-of-fact as it is self-deprecating. “I often step out around 5 a.m., sometimes earlier, and I would invariably have my coffee at some eatery.” The fact that Baskar is on his own, and his business requires him to travel from point to point within these localities helps him in his passion for chronicling the everyday lives of the footsoldiers he encounters on the way as well as the challenges they take in their stride. He treats the Facebook wall with the same reverence publishers have for the printed page. Recently, he did a compilation about PS Sivaswamy Salai which witnessed heavy waterlogging during the November rains, and then again, following the December 30 cloudburst. The provocation for the piece was the accidents involving pedestrians — how they fell off the tall platforms, which had gained dreadful height following the fresh construction of stormwater drains a few years ago. “When it was heavily water-logged, the road had come on par with the platform. Giving in to the illusion of levelness, many stepped down, only to land with a thud,” notes Baskar. The highlight of the effort was how Baskar got a passerby to stand on the pavement — after the storm waters had receded — to give a sense of how distant its surface is from that of the road. Baskar observes: “When the waters recede, these issues also recede from our mind. But they will come back to haunt us — I wanted the issue to stay alive so that it gets addressed before it causes problems again.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/civic-sense-beyond-the-backyard/article38182204.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 03:55 IST,||Civic sense beyond the backyard||Where most others do not see a jot to write home about, they see scope for a string of missives. Without thinking twice, this rare breed of residents generously lend their time to civic issues not their own, often picking them up while on the move. And when they start pursuing it, they do so with the urgency and persistence of someone putting out a fire in their own living space. Here are two from that tribe. CR Balaji rides the office bus to the Tamil Nadu Petroproducts Limited. In 2020, during these commutes, one unseemly image left a mark on his mind. It would not let him be till he made a missive out of it for those with the power to make that image look better. Now, just before the north-east monsoon, Balaji develops invisible antennas with acute sensitivity to choked waterways and water channels. He would also visit lakes around monsoon time with the ardour of a monk on a series of pilgrimages. In 2020, ahead of the north-east monsoon, during his daily commute down the Manali Express Highway, near Sathyamurthy Nagar he noticed a stretch of North Buckingham canal caked with water hyacinth. Images of the 2015 deluge are haunting for those who had experienced it at close quarters. Sathyamurthy Nagar was among areas that bore the brunt of the Deluge, with the invasive waters damaging essential goods in many houses. Balaji is familiar with developments in that neighbourhood. “In 2020, I complained many a time about it, but without the expected outcome,” recalls Balaji.

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 03:56 IST,||Pongal Bird Count to take off with clipped wings||The 2022 edition of the Pongal Bird Count is poised for take-off, but with clipped wings — blame it on the Coronavirus and its recent inroads. However, if the 2021 edition of this pan-Tamilnadu-and Puducherry Count were a barometer, the annual exercise would still gain notable elevation, being cannonballed from private balconies. This year’s edition is from January 14 to 17. P Jeganathan, a bird enthusiast with Tamil Birders Network (TBN), touches upon the curious irony of the situation: “The 2021 Pongal Bird Count had the most number of birders ever — 340 — sending in checklists.” Tamil Birders Network, which Jeganathan calls “a loosely structured consortium of bird watchers with no fancy titles and labels, except for the uniform and status-levelling description ‘volunteer’, has been coordinating this Count for eight years on the trot in line with the larger goals exemplified by Bird Count India (birdcount.in). In the last two, it has been pushing the right messaging buttons, advocating caution ahead of data. “For the last two years, overshadowed by the pandemic, we have been encouraging birders to get their checklists birding from their balconies. We dissuade them from travelling to count birds, unless the birding hotspot is found in their locality,” explains Jeganathan. TBN would be pushing those buttons harder, due to a crucial difference between the last and this edition. In January 2021, Coronavirus numbers were dropping. But now, we seem fastened to the tailwinds of a fresh wave. Even on a low key, a Count that is organised is better than one that is cancelled is the line of reasoning. “We just want the culture of birding to continue, even if it were to be from constricted balconies. Due to the reduced focus area, the data may take a beating, but that does not matter as much as losing the momentum gained over the years. It is particularly important when you realise a majority of the children today know the penguin and the ostrich, but not the common mynah and the yellow-billed babbler,” he notes. The momentum gained has to do with how birding has progressed from an inward-looking, self-indulgent pursuit to an act that has some significance for ecology. “In earlier days, people would bird for their delectation and the exercise would help their mental health. They still do for the same reason, but they have the option of going beyond that — and many do take that option. It is about being ecologically conscious, and accommodating concern for birds alongside the efforts to ensure personal wellbeing. In the new scheme of things, watching is not enough; it has to be accompanied by counting and reporting.” To put it in one short line — to count birds is to save them. Even report the number of common species such as the house crow, the common mynah and the yellow-billed babbler can underlie shifts in species concentrations. The checklists would add to the data about these species found in the public domain on the eBird platform. Lack of extensive knowledge about avians should not deter people from participating in the exercise, says Jeganathan. “In citizen science, we take inexperience into account. During this time, many people will report common cuckoo, but it would actually be the Asian koel. Similarly, people may report the common babbler while having seen the yellow-billed babbler. When such records come, depending on the location, we would know this person is just a beginner in birding. We engage with the person to refine their sighting skills. We point to the resources that would help them identify birds better — on Bird Count India, there is a photography field guide and a video on bird identification. The public output is curated. Ninety five percent of the output will be curated. Even the rest that would have slipped in through the gates would be subsequently reviewed and refined.” The pandemic has hugely altered the way the approach the Count — the significantly missing aspect is the in-person meetings in November or December preceding the event. “When the volunteers would be gathered, they would be asked its anyone would want to volunteer to coordinate the Count in a district. Hands would go up, and two to three volunteers would be found for each district. Now, regular processes are happening online.”  It is about being ecologically conscious, and accommodating concern for birds alongside the efforts to ensure personal wellbeing||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/pongal-bird-count-to-take-off-with-clipped-wings/article38182272.ece
08 January 2022||January 08 2022 03:46 IST,||All for a goal||It all began during the swimming classes. While their children trained in the pool, the mothers bonded over a range of topics: from therapy sessions to tantrums thrown by children. That is how four mothers of children with autism came together to start Sangamitra Foundation. The voluntary organisation (registered) has Annapoorni Ramakrishnan, Jisha Rajesh, Devaki Balaji, Grace Santosh and sports coach Satish Kumar as trustees. The idea to do something together was conceived more than two years ago but due to the pandemic the plan did not take off. We bump into each other at schools, therapy centres; and these interactions have only given us strength to do something for children on the spectrum, say the moms. On January 5, the Foundation held a sports meet at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium for children on the spectrum, inviting participants from various special schools. Siva V Meyyanathan, minister for environment, climate change youth welfare and sports development was the chief guest. “We received more than 400 registrations but due to the current restrictions called due to the increase in COVID cases, we stopped with 250,” says Grace Santosh. A host of events like 100 meter running, standing jump, short put, bocha ball and relay race were conducted. The sports fest was a platform to allow the special needs children have a field day and not put any restrictions on them.  “My 12-year-old sang the Tamil Thai Valthu . Tell me where will he get such an opportunity to get on stage, perform before an audience and not be scolded if there are mistakes,” says Annapoorni.  Preparation for the sports event started over a month ago, each taking up a role. Satish, a swimming coach, with his network of friends got other instructors to help him. The events chosen had to be friendly to the special children. “We wanted children to participate and enjoy,” says Jisha Rajesh. Reaching out to special schools, getting sponsors, finding a venue and inviting dignitaries was part of the responsibilities the moms enjoyed every bit. They say they are overwhelmed with the response from the sports meet and plan to hold more such events in the future. The mothers say the pandemic, especially the early days of the lockdown, was a stressful time for them as children had to be confined at home. The lockdown had aggravated the erratic behaviour of children and they have been looking at offering children a place to unleash their energy. As much as the children were looking for a safe and comfortable space to develop their social skills, the parents too needed the confidence to come out. The team say this is a humble start to work towards their dream of planning something for their children. “The larger goal of the Foundation is a establish some kind of community exclusively for children with special needs that will take care of them and where they can live with each other’s support,” says Jisha.  “This is a humble start to work towards their dream of planning something for their children”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/all-for-a-goal/article38182186.ece

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 03:49 IST,||Four decades of service||As Srinivas Young Men's Association, popularly known as SYMA, enters its 45th year there are a number of firsts that this Triplicane-based social welfare organisation will be remembered for. Started in 1977 by a few youngsters in Triplicane who got together to clean the streets and the temple tank, the group has since then spread its activities with a good number of volunteers and well-wishers helping carry its legacy. In 1987, when the ground water level in the Triplicane locality dropped to low levels, our Association shifted to taking up remedial action to recharge the ground water. Even before the State Government passed orders making it mandatory for the people to install rain water harvesting system in their homes, our association went on a door-to-door campaign impressing upon the residents the need for harvesting the rain water. Our association funded the construction of a rain water channel with the help of the Government authorities to collect the rain water that was going waste in T P Koil Street and South Mada Street and linked it to the already existing channel that carried the rain water from the Temple to the Temple tank. Later, Chennai Corporation consulted us and identified the ways to bring rain water into the temple tank and executed projects under the elected representatives development fund. Today entire rain water falling in the Mada streets flow into the temple tank, which has not only prevented water logging but also increased the quality of ground water. Our education initiatives started by distribution uniforms to two students. Today 1500 students benefit from this initiative. Through GROWTH, which is our tuition centre, economically weak students of classes 10 and 12 are helped with academics. Our medical initiatives has reached to many people thanks to the nominal consultation fee of Rs. 2 that we charge, which is inspired by Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Sankara Medical Trust and Dr K Sridhar. From a shed to a permanent building The medical centre operated from a 250 sq ft shed belonging to Vadhi Kesari Azhagiya Manavala Jeeyar Swamy. In 1997, Shri Badrinath of Vasavi Builders helped us by converting this shed into a proper building free of cost. In 2007, Dr K Sridhar started a laboratory in our Medical Center with the help of financial assistance provided by the family members of P V Rama Iyengar and Suganthavalli. The laboratory conducted blood tests at a very nominal cost. Later, in 2009, Dr Sridhar entrusted SYMA with the sole responsibility of running the Medical Center and also provided an endowment to enable us to run the laboratory. We are now associated with Neuberg Ehlrich Laboratory. Since August 4, 1989, the centre is run from a spacious building at Car Street offering a host of services. Apart from general consultation, new services like eye tests through Pammal Sankara eye hospital are being offered. The charges for those availing these facilities are fixed at a very nominal rate to cater to the under privileged sections of society, like Rs. 50 for eye testing, Rs. 100 for physiotherapy and Rs. 50/- for ultra sound scan. Every year, on August 15, the association conducts a free eye testing and cataract detection camp in association with Sri Sankara Eye Hospital, Pammal. Those diagnosed with cataract are operated free of cost and those identified with defective eye sight are provided spectacles. A range of medical services are offered like a gynaecologist visits the centre every Thursday and a dermatologist twice in a month. Various organisations like Manpower group services India, Star Health Allied Insurance Company Limited, Karix Mobile Pvt Ltd, Paleppu Pharma Pvt Limited and Grundfos Pumps India Private Limited have supported us as part of their corporate Social Responsibility. SYMA Medical Center is at 37 Car Street, Triplicane.

Elangovan recently. This is the first commissioner of the Corporation, so the meeting was important in terms of presenting a wish-list for the area. Initiate work on constructing an underground sewage system, repair roads and look into flooding in the area were some of the main concerns they represented. “We urged the commissioner to facilitate an underground sewage system network in the region at the earliest. In the absence of underground drainage system, residents discharge waste and sewer water into the stormwater drain network, which is supposed to carry rainwater to Chitlapakkam and Sembakkam lakes. Besides, sewage from nearby regions, flows through the drain network into the lakes,” said M. Ravi, secretary, Sri Sarvamangala Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association Delay in re-laying of roads “For more than a year, three streets in Anna Nagar, West Chitlapakkam, Thirumurugan Salai, Ramanar Street and Maruthupandiyar Street have not been relaid. The roads were dug for construction of cut and cover drain network by the Water Resources Department, a wing of Public Works Department,” says P. Viswanathan. The work was understaken to drain excess rain water from Chitlapakkam Eri to Sembakkam lake through a manmade regulator through Thirumurugan Salai, Ramanar Street and Maruthupandiyar Street. At the intersection of Maruthupandiyar Street and Babu Street, the drain network is connected to another drain network, which drains excess rain water from Selaiyur lake to Sembakkam lake, says S. Chandrasekaran. L. Sundararaman wanted cleaning up of streets to be done on a regular basis. Road getting inundated with water is a common complaint in these areas. Even after construction of cut and cover drain network in the region, several streets including Maraimalai Adigalar Street, Tagore Street, Bhavani Street, Bharathiyar Street, Manimekalai Street, Abraham Lincoln Street and Vaidhyalingam Street got flooded during the rains, said S. Kumara Subramanian. Residents wanted the gasifier crematorium, located on Balaji Avenue in Chitlapakkam, to be operational. Other demands by the residents include providing adequate street light and removal of unauthorised structures affecting free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-raft-of-issues-presented-to-new-commissioner/article38182239.ece

A prudent call at the eleventh hour changed the trajectory of its journey, as also the situation of two individuals who were just looking for printers of that kind but could ill afford them. One of the two is dealing with disability and the other is helping young children deal with the challenges on many levels that result from mental retardation. Gayathri Shankar, manager, HR, Ramboll India, notes that most companies decide to scrap equipment of this sort when they are moving offices. ‘These printers are still good enough and easily have 15 years ahead of them. As we were moving offices, a decision was taken to scrap them. Fortunately, we revered it, deciding it to donate it to people who would make the most of it.” Scanning lists of possible beneficiaries threw up two names — Andeshwari with a disability from the waist down that has her dependent on a board with rollers for mobility; and Dr. Sundar, who runs a NGO: a home for special children. While Andeshwari who has a way with making utilitarian items out of scrap, will use the printer to have a Xerox shop. Dr. Sundar will use it in the office of his home for social children. Gayathri notes that in these times of climate change, it makes absolute sense for both individuals and organisations to use any equipment till it cannot be used anymore.

08 January 2022||January 08 2022 03:43 IST,||RWAs embark on cloth bag campaign||ABJT Residents Welfare Association in Kovilambakkam welcomes the New Year – 2022 with a resolution: to get residents to use cloth bags and stay away from single plastic bags. ABJT association represents the following localities – Ambedkar Salai, Bavani Street, Judges Colony, and TNPL Colony – in Kovilambakkam. The association has embarked on this effort to support the State’s recently-launched campaign of “Meendum Manjapai”. As part of this exercise, the association distributed cloth bags to customers and vendors of shops in its region. “The association has bought 300 bags for this awareness campaign. Each bag costs Rs. .24. We have also created a WhatsApp group with the vendors. The challenge they face is that customers do not bring cloth bags. They also pointed out that some insist on plastic bags so that they can reuse them to discard waste generated in their houses. We told them to refer those customers to us so that we will try to educate them,” says J Shankar, treasurer of the association. The Association also has plans to rope in children in this campaign. “We will be organising a rally where children will go around the various streets highlighting the hazards of single-use plastic items,” says Shankar. Likewise, two other associations in Kovilambakkam – BKR Residents Welfare Association and Engineers Avenue Residents Welfare Association will be carrying our similar campaigns along the lines of Meendum Manjapai. “We have placed an order for 7,000 bags from a manufacturer based in Thirupur. Each bag is priced at Rs. .23. We will be giving a set of 1,000 bags to each shopkeeper. We have asked them to charge Rs. . 5 for each bag and upon return during their next visit to the shop that amount should be returned. Mostly, on or before January 26 the distribution will begin. In fact, we did a similar campaign a few years ago,” says G Venkataramesh Kumar, president, BKR Residents Welfare Association. In Velachery West, AGS Colony Residents’ Welfare Association (ACRWA) has launched a different campaign in support of Meendum Manjapai. “Instead of buying and giving cloth bags to the vendors, the association has shared a list of manufacturers based in Namakkal. This time we decided not to distribute cloth bags either to vendors or residents. Because we tried giving them cloth bags in 2018. However, this did not bring in the desired change. Nobody bothers to carry a cloth bag to this day. So this time, we again tried educating the shopkeepers in our colony and succeeded in making two shopkeepers to buy and keep stock of cloth bags, one runs a grocery store and other, a supermarket,” says Geetha Ganesh, secretary, AGS Colony Residents Welfare Association. However, Geetha Ganesh along with Jayanthi Premchander, a resident of Valmiki Nagar has plans to distribute 200 cloth bags to the underprivileged at the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board tenement (the erstwhile Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board) at Rajiv Gandhi Nagar in Thiruvanmiyur. “Even though, single use plastic items are banned in Tamil Nadu, nobody pays any heed to it. To cite an example, each time we cut plantain trees at my house, I inform the nearby flower vendors to come and collect the leaves and make use of them to wrap their flowers. No price attached, it was for free. But they did not bother and continue to use the plastic covers. That is because they did not have fear over violating the ban. I welcome the State’s attempt to make its people get into the habit of using cloth bags through Meendum Manjapai campaign. But it has to enforce the rule with an iron hand,” says Geetha Ganesh.  “The State has to enforce the single-use plastic ban with an iron hand”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/rwas-embark-on-cloth-bag-campaign/article38182150.ece

Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association is requesting the State to resume the service of mobile ration shops which was introduced in September 2020 in view of the COVID 19 pandemic. However, the service was terminated in November 2021. The Association feels the need for restoring the mobile service because the two Tamil Nadu Urban Co-operative Society (TUCS) ration shops on Rameshwaram Road in T. Nagar — identified as HC 007 and HC 009 — were shifted to Mambalam High Road. According to the cardholders, the shops were shifted in February 2020. This move has affected the cardholders of HC 007 and is beneficial to HC 009. The cardholders of HC 007 are residents of Mahalakshmi Street, Motilal Street, Sarojini Street, Ramaswamy Street, Venkatesan Street, Pinjala Subramaniam Street, Mangesh Street, Rangan Street, Rangan Lane, Ramanathan Street, Ramanujam Street, Soundarajan Street, and Rameshwaram Road. They are disappointed about the new location because it is nearly two kilometres away. Whereas, the cardholders of HC 009 who are residents of Ramachandra Street, Car Track Road,Vasan Street, and Mambalam High Road are happy about the new location. They find the new shops nearby when compared to the earlier location. “It is quite difficult to access the new shop. With unfriendly footpaths and congested road traffic, we feel the need for a mobile ration shop. That service will be of immense help to the cardholders, especially for senior citizens,” says V.S. Jayaman, a member of the association. The building to house the ration shops on Mambalam High Road was constructed under the Member of Legislative Assembly Local Area Development (MLALAD) Fund scheme by the former T.

In the absence of a contractor, vehicles are parked in a haphazard manner. Further, the vehicles are at the risk of theft or damage by miscreants. The parking lot is meant for commuters of both EMU trains and metro trains. “For weeks, there is no contractor at the parking lot. Commuters park their vehicles wherever they find space. As a result, the vehicles get stuck to each other at times. This damages the vehicles,” says S. Karthikeyan, a commuter and resident of Puzhuthivakkam, Some park their vehicles on the passageway. Commuters find it difficult to enter and exit the premises of the parking lot. “At times, we find it difficult to take out our vehicles. We have to lift the other person’s vehicle to park our’s or even to walk out of the parking lot. Women and senior-citizens find it very difficult and seek help from others,” says N. Fathima Nurullah. Vehicles could be found parked at the entrance area to the ATM and the public find it difficult access and exit the facility. Commuters also pointed out that there is some space near the parking lot which is not put to proper use. In fact, it is misused to dump waste and people relieve themselves in the open. Commuters say that this area should be cleaned and restored and should be earmarked as parking lot. Yet another issue, pointed out by the commuters is that there is no proper illumination at the parking lot. The facility plunges into darkness after sunset. The lights in the walkway and ticket reservation counters are the saving grace.  “Some park their vehicles on the passageway. Commuters find it difficult to enter and exit the parking lot”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/chaos-at-parking-lot-in-mount-railway-station/article38182242.ece

Residents cite uneveness in roads and faults in stormwater drains. “Most of the roads in the localities have been laid without milling. To cite an example, at the intersection of VGN Nagar First Main Road and VGN Nagar Second Cross Street, the former is at a raised level than the latter. Hence, water remains stagnant in the VGN Nagar Second Cross Street,” says Senthil Kumar, a resident. Next, the stormwater drains are not interlinked properly and in some places they are laid above the height of the road which hinders the flow of water. “Sewage is also discharged into stormwater drains through illegal means,” adds Senthil. Residents also point out stagnation of water in vacant plots. They say stganation of water on vacant plots for many days provides a fertile ground for vector-borne diseases. “When we took up the issue of stagnation in many vacant plots with Iyappanthangal Village Panchayat officials, they said that the responsibility of pumping out water lies with the respective property owners. The owners reside else where and they are not bothered about the stagnation and how it poses a health hazard to residents living nearby. During the dengue surveillance drives in November, the Panchayat had imposed fine to many residents for water stagnaton. On those grounds, Panchayat should penalise the owners of the plots. But they say the dont have any information about the owners and hence unable to contact them. If if they have the will to help the citizens, they can get their information from the registration department,” says Senthil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/water-stagnation-irks-iyappanthangal-residents/article38182258.ece

So far, from IIT-M, we have documented over 250 species, and the count is nearing 300 now. In 2021, Padma Manivannan, her daughter Shivani Manivannan and son Chinmaya Manivannan took to setting up a moth screen in their home and documenting moths. I had done a couple of samples from the area they stay in — now that is an additional location from which we are getting data. We have had around 20 to 30 new species documented from that effort,” observes Mahathi. “When I started off, I used to leave a light on. Later on, I got a mercury vapour bulb and I egan to use that. Apart from that, there is a couple of apartments here that have the light on in their stairways. I typically used to go up the floors and come down just to see what one could find there. While moths are usually successfully found at night, Mahathi’s experience with them bears out that daytime can also throw up lepidopterans. “We also do carry out daytime surveys: there are daytime-flying moths. Moths have resting spots, and those that do not get light-trapped easily, may have to be studied in these spaces.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/250-moths-documented-on-iit-m-campus-by-residents/article38182250.ece
