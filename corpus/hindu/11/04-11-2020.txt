04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘States cannot make isolated plans for vaccine distribution’||The Health Ministry on Tuesday said it has asked the State governments to refrain from making isolated plans for vaccine distribution. At a press conference on Tuesday, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the States had been asked to work with the Central government, which has set up an expert committee on vaccine administration, and to adhere to the directions from the Centre. He said they had been advised to create a database according to the blueprint issued by the Central government and also take stock of the storage and transport facility for the distribution. “States/UTs have been also asked to set up committees under Chief Secretaries for administration to ensure time-bound implementation of the Central government direction,” he said. The Ministry noted that the expert committee, besides using the infrastructure of the immunisation programme, is also looking at the infrastructure and manpower support that the private players can offer. Giving details of the progress on COVID-19 cases, Mr. Bhushan said Manipur, Delhi, Kerala and West Bengal were showing a rise, as was reported this month. “These States need to continue the test-track-trace-and-treat strategy. They have also been asked to preserve and protect the gains of the past and guard against future surge during festivals by following COVID appropriate behaviour,” he said. He said the new confirmed cases in the last 24 hours had fallen under 40,000. “The daily new cases now stand at 38,310, which has happened after 15 weeks [105 days]. The new added cases were 37,724 on July 22.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-cannot-make-isolated-plans-for-vaccine-distribution/article33017629.ece
04 November 2020||VIENNA,||Convicted IS supporter kills 4 in Vienna rampage||Austrian police were hunting for suspects on Tuesday after at least one gunman killed four people in a rampage in the heart of Vienna overnight. Fourteen people were injured — some seriously — in the attack. Police killed one gunman wearing an explosive belt that, however, turned out to be fake. Authorities identified him as a 20-year-old convicted jihadist, and said they could not rule out the possibility that other shooters were still on the loose. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz pledged in a televised address to “hunt down the perpetrators and those who stand behind them”. “The attack yesterday was clearly an Islamic terror attack,” Mr. Kurz said. “This is not a conflict between Christians and Muslims or between Austrians and migrants. No, this is a fight between the many people who believe in peace and the few (who oppose it). It is a fight between civilisation and barbarism.”  The attacker was identified by Interior Minister Karl Nehammer as Kujtim Fejzulai. A dual citizen of Austria and North Macedonia, Fejzulai was sentenced to 22 months in jail in April 2019 for attempting to travel to Syria to join the IS but was released in December.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/convicted-is-supporter-kills-4-in-vienna-rampage/article33017627.ece
04 November 2020||Belagavi,||A day after shoot-out, driver dies of bullet wounds||Monday’s shoot-out claimed another life in Vijayapura on Tuesday. Lakshman Khogaon (25), driver of Mahadev Bhairagonda, rowdy-sheeter, died of his injuries at the BLDE Hospital in Vijayapura. He had received bullet wounds in his stomach. Bhairagonda and party had been fired at during an ambush by a rival gang near Kannal Cross on Monday. The other four are responding to treatment. Doctors conducted surgeries to remove two bullets from Bhairagonda’s body. He is on ventilator support, but is responding to treatment. He is stable now, a senior doctor said. The victim’s family members told journalists in Vijayapura that they were willing to take him to Hyderabad or Mumbai for further treatment if needed. Officers of the forensic laboratory visited the crime scene to collect samples and evidence. The two vehicles involved in the incident have been removed from the spot and kept on the Rural Police Station premises. Inspector-General of Police Northern Range Raghavendra Suhas visited the hospital and spoke to doctors. He also visited the crime scene on Bhutnal-Chadachan Road. He later held a meeting of officers at the District Police Office. Mr. Suhas told The Hindu that there were definite clues to the murder. “Obviously, it is a planned attack and not a road rage brawl. We have found machetes and knives on the spot. There is also an unexploded petrol bomb. There are some abandoned motorcycles too. Our officers have collected cartridges and some bullet pieces. We suspect that it was a gang of around 15 persons that carried out the attack. Based on these evidence, we have got a fair idea of who they could have been. “We have some information that apart from residents of Karnataka and Maharashtra, there were some persons from other States among the offenders. We have learnt that the attackers also suffered some injuries as the bodyguards of Bhairagonda also opened fire in retaliation. We are visiting hospitals in Karnataka and Maharashtra for information about any of the accused being treated there,” he said. He said that nearly 1,000 police personnel of Bagalkot and Vijayapura were involved in the investigation. Investigation is going on in the right direction. It will be an investigation to remember for the officers and the residents of the region, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/a-day-after-shoot-out-driver-dies-of-bullet-wounds/article33017759.ece
04 November 2020||Bengaluru,||Despite pandemic, Sira sees big turnout; voter response lukewarm in R.R. Nagar||The bitterly fought byelections in Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituencies — in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic — saw an impressive turnout in the former and a lukewarm response in the latter. While Sira segment recorded 84.54% polling, higher than the previous elections, R.R. Nagarin contrast saw 45.24%, the lowest in the five elections held since 2013.The turnout in the two constituencies, despite R.R. Nagar recording lower polling percentage, has belied expectations that the pandemic could force a large number of voters to stay home. The polling went off peacefully, barring a few petty incidents.In a first for any election, COVID-19 patients came to vote in ambulance while the polling staff donned personal protection equipment. Booths were sanitised. Previous polls Sira had recorded a turnout of 84.31% in the 2018 Assembly elections and 73.89% in the 2019 parliamentary polls while R.R. Nagar had registered 54.38% and 53.12% polling in the 2018 and 2019 elections, respectively. Polling in Sira, which saw just about 8.25% turnout in the first two hours, gained momentum after 9 a.m. As the day progressed, the turnout increased by an average of 15 percentage points every two hours.

A total of 5,019 postal ballots were issued in Sira for those with COVID-19, persons with disabilities, and those aged above 80, of which 4,821 were used. In R.R.

04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Amended J&K land laws have built-in safeguards, says L-G||Jammu and Kashmir Lt. Governor Manoj Sinha sought to allay apprehensions over the new amendments to laws regarding the acquisition of land by outsiders in the Union Territory, stating that protections of the kind enshrined in land laws of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand were incorporated into the new laws. Speaking exclusively to The Hindu , Mr. Sinha, who has completed nearly three months at the helm in J&K, said the amendments covered only non-agricultural land and were for giving a fillip to industrial development in the Union Territory. “I am telling you with great responsibility that all the safeguards in the laws in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are there in these amendments,” he said. “The truth is that 90% of land in J&K is agricultural and no one from outside can buy it. The amendments did away with some older laws, some mutually contradictory, that had become redundant. For example, in an earlier law, a ceiling of 182 kanals had been fixed for private holding, after that it was amended to 100 kanals in 1976; these two provisions existed together. Secondly, there was an unfortunate law that required the government’s permission to plant orchards and harvest the fruit, now we have freed that. These were old agrarian laws,” Mr. Sinha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/amended-jk-land-laws-have-built-in-safeguards-says-l-g/article33017631.ece

With the world awaiting the outcome of the intense tussle, Thulasendrapuram, Ms. Harris’ ancestral village, was soaked in religious fervour, with villagers organising a special puja at the Sri Dharma Sastha temple. The otherwise sleepy village was dotted with flex boards and banners with huge photographs of Ms. Harris, wishing her a resounding victory. Some residents of the neighbouring Painganadu village also participated in the special puja, timed to coincide with the election in the United States. Ms. Harris’ maternal grandfather, Gopalan, hailed from Thulasendrapuram village, locals said. “The puja lasted for over four hours, with abishekham of milk, honey, turmeric powder, coconut water, lime and holy ash performed separately for Sri Dharma Sastha,” said J. Sudhakar, a resident of Painganadu and the president of the Green City Rotary Club, Mannargudi. Annadhanam (free food) was organised and devotees were served idli, vadai and sambhar as they were said to be Ms. Harris’ favourites, Mr. Sudhakar added. Special pujas were performed when Ms. Harris was announced as the Vice-Presidential candidate. “A victory for Kamala Harris would not only be a big day for the United States but also for Thulasendrapuram village and for our country,” he said. He said villagers were expecting Ms. Harris to visit Thulasendrapuram on becoming the Vice-President.  A victory for Kamala Harris would not only be a big day for the US but also for Thulasendrapuram village and for our country. J.

04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Governor can rule on Rajiv convicts’ plea’||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said the Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) investigation into the “larger conspiracy” behind Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination in 1991 need not deter the Tamil Nadu Governor from deciding the plea for pardon of convicts like A.G. Perarivalan, who have been serving their sentence in jail for over two decades. “Larger conspiracy probe is only to prove if any other people are involved. It is not for them [people already convicted],” Justice L. Nageswara Rao, leading a three-judge Bench, observed orally. Turning to Additional Solicitor General K.M. Nataraj, appearing for the Centre, he asked, “This larger conspiracy investigation is pending for the past 20 years... Still you are waiting for details from U.K., Thailand?” The court was responding to submissions made by Mr. Nataraj that the scope of the MDMA probe extended to many countries, and it is still going on. Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, for Perarivalan, said the status report filed about the MDMA probe was a “copy-paste” of earlier such reports. In January last, the court said the body was yet to conclude its investigation on the origin and make of the bomb that killed the former Prime Minister. The court made it clear during the hearing that it was reluctant to exercise its jurisdiction when the Governor was already seized of Perarivalan’s plea for pardon under Article 161 of the Constitution. “Why don’t you ask the Governor to pass orders without our intervention?” Justice Rao asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/governor-can-rule-on-rajiv-convicts-plea/article33017646.ece

Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday called upon party cadres to launch public agitations in every Assembly constituency with slogans — “My House My Right” and “My House Site My Right”. The TDP should stand by poor people till they got their houses and house sites. The poor beneficiaries should take possession of their allotted houses eventually, he said. Addressing a video conference of party elected representatives and in-charges of 175 Assembly constituencies, Mr. Naidu stressed on the need to counter the “YSRCP misinformation campaign” on the distribution of house sites. Only 2,000 acres of the total 60,000 acres acquired for houses sites was under court litigation. The rest of 58,000 acres should be distributed among poor families. The YSRCP leaders were causing deliberate delay in distribution of houses and pattas with an eye on commissions and share in the booty, he alleged. Referring to Polavaram, the TDP chief said the Polavaram works were stopped in the name of reverse tendering. The focus was on mudslinging on the TDP, but not on continuing the works to complete the project at the earliest. Even during the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy tenure, just Rs. 400 crore was spent on Polavaram works. Whereas, the TDP regime spent Rs. 11,000 crore in its five-year rule and completed 71 per cent works, Mr. Naidu claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stand-by-poor-till-they-get-house-sites-naidu-tells-partymen/article33017641.ece

The State government has issued an order for the release of funds to provide foodgrains and toor (equivalent to cooking cost) to all the eligible students from class one to 10. The order, issued on Tuesday by the Primary and Secondary Education Department, stated that Rs. 449.84 crore has been sanctioned for this purpose. The foodgrains will be provided for the period from June to October 2020. In October, The Hindu had reported how 48 lakh children — a majority from lower socio-economic backgrounds and marginalised communities — had not received the promised ration kits for five months.

However, it did not distribute rations to students from June to October. The Department of Public Instruction has been directed to come out with detailed guidelines on how the foodgrains will be distributed. “In the wake of COVID-19, the Finance Department’s austerity instructions must be followed.

The police said the deceased could be Velmurugan, 32, son of Sendu and Annammal, near Periyakulam in Theni district of Tamil Nadu. Velmurugan was a member of Kabanidalam-2 of thee Western Ghats Special Zone Committee of the proscribed Communist Party of India (Maoist), the police said A Thunderbolt team, the commando force of the Kerala Police, was engaged in regular patrolling on the Bappanam Mala forest under the South Wayanad Forest Division around 9.15 a.m. when a six-member Maoist group allegedly opened fire at them. The commandos returned fire in a bid to pin down the Maoists and force their surrender. Fighting retreat However, the armed group staged a fighting retreat and disappeared into the forests, leaving behind one of their dead. The police had inserted a squad of eight commands to interdict the armed groups to deny them operational space in the area. By one account, the commandos surprised the Maoists and called out to the group to surrender. However, the police encountered irregular fire from the dense undergrowth. Ammunition recovered The police recovered the body, a .303 bolt action rifle and several rounds of expended assault rifle ammunition from the spot. The exchange of fire lasted around 30 minutes. The commandos have suffered no casualties. A search operation was under way to track down the others, the sources said. Balan, a tribesman in the area, said he heard the sound of thunder from the hilltop which lasted around five minutes. Though mediapersons tried to reach the site, the police blocked them around 3.5 km from the site. The body was shifted to the mortuary at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. Alert sounded State law enforcement has alerted their counterparts in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The police were scouring tribal settlements and checking hospitals to find out whether they had admitted persons with gunshot injuries. The incident comes nearly 19 months after C.P. Jaleel, 25, a suspected Maoist, was shot dead in an encounter at a private resort at Lakkidi in the district. Senior police officers, including K. Sethuraman, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Kannur Range, and District Police Chief G. Poonguzhali, visited the site. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran condemned the “extrajudicial killing”. He accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of giving free rein to the police to kill Maoists with impunity instead of arresting the insurgents and bringing them to book.

04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Indian Navy matches skills with three foreign fleets off Vizag||Phase I of the Malabar 2020 naval exercise by India, Australia, Japan and the U.S. began off the coast of Visakhapatnam in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday. Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the imperative to cooperate closely with regional defence partners on shared challenges was stronger than ever. “Exercise Malabar is an important opportunity to work in concert with like-minded nations to support a secure, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.” This is the first time Australia has joined Malabar since 2007. Two parts This is the 24th edition of the exercise that began in 1992 and this time, it is being held in two phases, in the Bay of Bengal and from November 17 to 20 in the Arabian Sea. Indian Navy ships Ranvijay , Shivalik , Shakti and Sukanya and submarine Sindhuraj were exercising with U.S. naval ship USS John S McCain , Royal Australian Navy ship HMAS Ballarat , and Japanese Maritime Self Defence ship JS Onami , the Navy said. The four Navies would conduct a range of high-end training, including air-defence and anti-submarine exercises, aviation, communications and at-sea replenishment between ships, a statement from the Australian Defence Ministry said. “India and Australia are natural partners in the Indo-Pacific, and Exercise Malabar is a clear demonstration of the depth of trust and cooperation between our defence organisations,” Ms. Reynolds added.  Mission Sagar-II  The Navy also began Mission Sagar-II, under which INS Airavat entered the Sudan port carrying 100 tonnes of food, the Navy said. Under the mission, India provides assistance to friendly countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mission Sagar-II is a follow-up of Mission Sagar undertaken in May-June 2020, during which India delivered food and medicines to the Maldives, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Madagascar and Comoros. “As part of Mission Sagar-II, Indian Naval Ship Airavat will deliver food aid to Sudan, South Sudan, Djibouti and Eritrea,” the Navy said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-navy-matches-skills-with-three-foreign-fleets-off-vizag/article33017599.ece
04 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||PSUs may go full steam ahead||Public sector units (PSUs) in the State, many of which had almost come to a halt following the COVID-19 outbreak, have been slowly limping back to normalcy in the past two months, with an increase in attendance levels and production. However, some PSUs are still going slow with production as industries that depend on their products are yet to fully open up. According to sources in the Industries Department, the impact of the pandemic continued even after the initial lockdown period as attendance levels remained low for months. Even later, the declaration of containment zones had hampered operations. The scenario began to improve by September, with more than 60% utilisation being reported in many units. The attempt now is to bring back full operational levels by this month. Amendments In September, the State government made amendments to the Public Procurement Policy, by which State PSUs and local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are getting price preference up to 15% in all procurement of government departments and local self-government institutions. Also, up to 50% of the order quantity need to be bought from the PSUs and the MSME. If there are multiple State PSUs in contention, they are to be given equal proportions of the 50% order. Sources say that this has begun reflecting in the departmental purchases. For companies, including Travancore Cochin Chemicals and Travancore Titanium Products Limited (TTPL), the operations of a few companies that depend on their products are limited. Some of these PSUs have tried to rake in revenue by manufacturing alternative products including hand sanitisers, handwash and cleaning solutions. The biggest gainer in this field has been the Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals, which was quick to launch sanitisers, enabling a general fall in prices in the market. The TTPL also recently launched similar products. The State government’s 17 textile mills in the cooperative sector have also opened up and have ramped up production, even as National Textile Corporation’s (NTC) mills in the State have remained closed since March. Employees of the NTC’s four mills in the State have been on strike for the past 70 days, demanding reopening of the mills and payment of benefits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/psus-may-go-full-steam-ahead/article33017875.ece
04 November 2020||New Delhi,||Grand Alliance works as one unit||When RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav voted on Tuesday morning in the Digha constituency in the second phase of the Bihar Assembly election, his vote went to CPI(ML) candidate Shashi Yadav. Hours later and some 150 km away, CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya addressed a public meeting in Keoti constituency in Darbhanga for senior RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui. Weeks ahead at a door-to-door meeting conducted by CPI(ML) candidate Mehboob Alam for the Balrampur Assembly seat in Katihar, slogans hailing Lalu Prasad, Rabri Devi, Tejashwi Yadav, Rahul and Sonia Gandhi were raised. In the Paliganj Assembly seat, which went to the polls in the first phase, Mr. Tejashwi directly reached out to CPI(ML) candidate Sandeep Saurav and later addressed a public rally seeking votes for him. These are snippets from the Bihar Assembly elections 2020 where the allies of the RJD-led Mahagatbandhan (grand alliance) are working in perfect synergy in contrast to the NDA alliance, where the BJP and the JD(U) seem to be running individual campaigns parallel to each other. BJP State president Sanjay Jaiswal recently publicly rued the lack of coordination between the NDA allies. Even in the few joint rallies that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have held, the Prime Minister has skipped mentioning Mr. Kumar’s work. The party leaders claim that the cadres of all the five parties — the RJD, the Congress, the CPI (ML), the CPI and the CPI (M) — have come together organically without directions from the top. “There is perfect synergy, coordination and coherent strategy between the RJD-Congress and the Left parties. We haven’t received any complaints in the 243 constituencies other than one or two for minor local issues,” senior RJD leader Manoj K. Jha. Barring the initial meetings in Patna among the allies17, most of the coordination, he said, was being done at the constituency level. All the campaign material carries pictures of leaders of the five parties. CPI (ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said the common manifesto too did not require much brainstorming, since it was a compilation of the popular demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/grand-alliance-works-as-one-unit/article33017592.ece
04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||‘We will get more than 170 seats’||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav has been drawing huge crowds at public meetings across the State. In an email interview, Mr. Yadav claimed the UPA would get more than 170 seats out of the total 243 constituencies in the Assembly. Excerpts:  Are you going to be the new Chief Minister of Bihar? As far as palpable sentiment on the ground is concerned, I believe people of Bihar now want a change. You’re addressing over a dozen public meetings every day, almost thrice the number Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is addressing. Is there no other star campaigner in the UPA? It’s not that there is a dearth of star campaigners in the UPA. But being the chief minister candidate of the ‘mahagathbandhan’, I should reach out to more and more people in the given time and make them aware of the ground reality of Bihar. I want to let them realise that stakes are too high. Frustrations of the unemployed people have accumulated for too long now. It needs to be addressed; else millions of lives will lose their potential to political ineptness, bureaucratic apathy and policy paralysis. Had the time allowed or had there been no restrictions, I would have loved to add another 5 to 8 rallies in the daily tally. I am a young, athletic man. I don’t get tired easily. Why do you think there is a huge turnout of young people at your public meetings? Is it because of your promise to provide 10 lakh government jobs to them if voted to power? We have presented our progressive vision to people and we are very determined to bring very substantial changes in the quality of their lives. We have not only promised 10 lakh government jobs but we have plans for every sector and every aggrieved section of society because we know that development is a multidimensional entity and one has to work perseveringly on every facet of it, has to put every cog of the wheel in order to bring about progress in society. Just having a look at our manifesto Pran Hamara [our resolve] one can easily make out that we mean business. It is this conviction of ours that has caught the imagination of the young people. What if there is a fractured mandate? There will be no fractured mandate. We are easily going to cross the two-third majority mark. Everyone in Bihar knows that, including NDA leaders. How many seats you hope for the RJD and the UPA as a whole? The  UPA will get more than 170 seats.

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Parties free to engage in political activity in J&K, there is no proscription’||Lieutenant-Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Manoj Sinha speaks on his three months at the helm, the land amendments in J&K, the Gupkar declaration and the Shopian encounter . It has been three months since you were appointed Lieutenant-Governor. What has been your major focus? One of the first things I noticed was that the ordinary citizen had no platform to express grievances. A system via District Collectors as well as Divisional Commissioners and Inspector General rank of police to designate specific days in a week for public grievances was set up. These platforms have been institutionalised, and I review it every month. Secondly, social security schemes suffered in comparison to construction-related government spending. I focussed on upping that, and I can say that 16 out of 20 districts have shown more than 95% coverage in terms of social welfare schemes. Jobs and skilling are an important aspect too. It is instructive to know that J&K and Bihar have similar numbers of government employees whereas Bihar’s population is 11 times that of J&K. For the last 70 years, for many reasons, private employment could not be boosted, and while we have started recruitment for 11,000 government posts and an additional 13,000 to come up, we have undertaken to develop as a skilling hub and to set up industry in the State. For example, Ashish Chauhan of the Bombay Stock Exchange said that three-month programmes for youngsters who want stockbroking or insurance agent skills will be set up by him. The Tata Group has also committed for two hubs — one in Baramulla (which is ready) and another in Jammu, which will be ready in November. The aim is to engage with 80% of the youth by 2025. When you speak of public grievances, political parties and people’s representatives are important conduits of grievances. Major leaders of political parties were arrested after the reading down of Article 370 and there is hardly any political engagement currently. It was also expressed in some quarters that a new layer of leadership in the State would emerge from local bodies, such as panchayats and municipal corporations, but that doesn’t seemed to have happened either. In 1992, when the 73rd Amendment was brought in, a three-tier Panchayati Raj system was envisaged for the entire country, but in J&K this was limited to two tiers. The necessary amendments have been made, however, and local body polls for the district development council will be notified any day now. I believe this will strengthen grassroots-level democracy and development, and the participation of local representatives will deepen the roots of democracy. I believe this is part of the political process and is the best kind of political process. I acknowledge that some leaders of political parties were not free earlier, but there was a system of assessment under Principal Secretary, Home, which would review the matter and, as of now, I don’t think any major political leader is under detention. Our country is a free country and people are free to engage in political activity, which these leaders are doing and the country is also watching, listening. The events of August 5, 2019, saw major leaders of political parties under detention. It is being said that this has finished off the middle ground in politics in Kashmir. My priority, as far as I see, is the development of J&K, engaging the youth, and creating an environment for prosperity. Political parties, on their part, are free to engage in political activity, there is no proscription. It is up to them as to which direction they take. Much of it is unfortunate and we have to see how we can change that. By unfortunate, do you mean statements on seeking Chinese help to restore Article 370? I feel that those who have held Constitutional positions in the past should remember that they had once [been] sworn into office on the Indian Constitution. That maryada (decency) should be maintained. Secondly, many of this very set of people have gone before the Supreme Court on these and related matters, reposing full faith in the Indian judiciary and Constitutional system. Having done that, shouldn’t they wait for the court’s judgment? My second suggestion would be to remember that it is only in India that there is full freedom to say what you feel. The recent amendments made to land-related laws in J&K have elicited strong opposition in both the Valley and Jammu, with apprehensions that there is some sort of plan for a demographic change via land acquisition by outsiders. If some people want to misguide people, they can say what they want. The truth is that 90% of land in J&K is agricultural and no one from outside can buy it. The amendments did away with some older laws, some [that were] mutually contradictory, that had become redundant. For example, in an earlier law, a ceiling of 182 kanals had been fixed for private holding, after that it was amended to 100 kanals, [and] in 1976, these two provisions existed together. Secondly, there was an unfortunate law that required government’s permission to plant orchards and harvest the fruit; now we have freed that. These were old agrarian laws, and to make a shift to a modern economy, we made some changes. We have selected 6,000 acres of land for an industrial park and other industry will also be facilitated. We want private enterprise and industry for creating more jobs for the youth in J&K. We are expecting at least Rs. 25,000-30,000 crore worth of investment after our new industrial policy is cleared by the Union Cabinet. The false propaganda being spread about these amendments need to be seen in the context of the J&K High Court order in the Roshni Act case where, out of 3,48,000 kanal land, 3,40,000 kanal land was given away for free in questionable circumstances. The honourable High Court said that the government was only a trustee of the land and had no rights to give such land away for free. I am telling you with great responsibility that these amendments are on the lines of the laws in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand in terms of protection of land and rights of the local population. Can panchayat polls be held with panchayat-level workers having been killed in the last few months? The polls will be notified in a day or two and some forces want to disrupt these processes. We are trying to ensure security for all. The situation is pretty much under control. There are some who want to block deepening of democracy, it will not be allowed to happen. The Shopian encounter [in which three labourers from Rajouri were killed] was a very regrettable development and happened just as you took over. This was an incident of around July 22-23. I reached J&K around August 7 to take over as Lieutenant-Governor, and read about it in the newspapers. I immediately asked the Army people to look into it. The response from the Army was positive, and when we found that a mistake had been committed, there was an honest attempt at some restitution. I myself went and met the family members of the Shopian victims and gave them Prime Minister Modi’s message, and condoled with them. I am firm that the innocent should not be targeted, even when we don’t spare the guilty. The Union government has said that there would be restoration of Statehood to J&K. When can we expect that to happen? This was a solemn assurance by the Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the floor of the House in Parliament and it will be done.  The panchayat polls will be notified in a day or two ...

04 November 2020||Patna,||Bihar poll: phase 2 ends peacefully||The second phase of elections for 94 seats across 17 districts in Bihar ended peacefully on Tuesday though there were some reports of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) malfunctioning. Top party leaders across the spectrum continued campaigning for third and final phase of polls on November 7. The voters turnout till 6 p.m. was over 56%. In first phase poll for 71 seats, voters turnout was over 55% which was higher than the figures for the 2015 Assembly election. Meanwhile, top leaders including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of the JD(U), Prime Minister Narendra Modi of BJP, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav continued campaigning for the third phase of 78 seats. At a public meeting in Harlakhi in Madhubani district, onions were thrown at Mr. Kumar. “ Khub pheko, khub pheko, khub pheko (keep throwing),” a furious Mr. Kumar responded as security personnel shielded him from the missiles. The Chief Minister, however, told security personnel not to arrest the man who threw the onions. “Let him go... no need to pay attention to him,” Mr. Kumar said. The 69-year-old JD(U) chief has faced protests at his public meetings, including slogans of “Lalu Yadav zindabad”. Public meetings Mr. Modi and Mr. Gandhi also addressed public meetings in northeast Bihar. The third phase will largely be held in northeastern part of the State including Katihar, Purnia, Kishanganj and Saharsa, considered as an NDA stronghold. The RJD-led mahagathbandhan has been raising issues of unemployment and migration and promised 10 lakh government jobs. The NDA has banked on development issues of ‘double engine’ governments in the State and the Centre. Counting of votes will take place on November 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-poll-phase-2-ends-peacefully/article33018220.ece
04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||More children to get fortified rice||Children in anganwadis and government schools could soon be eating rice infused with iron, folic acid and vitamin B-12. In a bid to combat chronic anaemia and undernutrition, the government is planning to distribute fortified rice through the Integrated Child Development Services and Mid-Day Meal schemes across the country from next year, with a special focus on 112 aspirational districts, according to a statement from the Food Ministry. However, an existing pilot scheme to distribute fortified rice through the Public Distribution System in 15 districts has only been implemented in five districts so far, although more than half the project duration is over. The Food Corporation of India has now been asked to come up with a comprehensive plan to scale up the annual supply of fortified rice from the current 15,000 tonnes to at least 1.3 lakh tonnes, said the statement. Under way in 5 States The centrally-sponsored pilot scheme was approved in February 2019, and allocated a total budget outlay of Rs. 174.6 crore for a three-year period from 2019-20 onwards. However, only five States — Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh — have started distribution of fortified rice in their identified pilot districts. The remaining 10 States have only now identified their respective districts, and will soon start distribution, but less than one-and-a-half years remain in the scheme period. At a review meeting last week, the new Food Minister Piyush Goyal emphasised the need to scale up the distribution of fortified rice. Accordingly, at a meeting chaired by Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey on Monday, the Ministry asked FCI to develop a plan to procure and distribute fortified rice under the schemes from 2021-2022, starting with the 112 aspirational districts. On Tuesday, discussions on the supply chain and logistical implications were held with NITI Aayog, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), and NGO stakeholders including the Tata Trust and World Food Programme. Fortifying rice involves grinding broken rice into powder, mixing it with nutrients, and then shaping it into rice-like kernels using an extrusion process. These fortified kernels are then mixed with normal rice in a 1:100 ratio, and distributed for consumption. Currently, there are only 15,000 tonnes of these kernels available per year in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/move-to-extend-fortified-rice-scheme/article33017608.ece
04 November 2020||BENGALURU,||Punjab, Kerala score in farm price stabilisation||Punjab and Kerala have stolen a march on Karnataka in terms of granting legal status to minimum support prices (MSP) either directly or indirectly with respect to some chosen crops. Though the Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission (KAPC) had mooted the concept in 2015 and come out with a recommendation backed by a roadmap in 2018, the State is yet to implement. While Punjab has adopted three Bills that seek to prevent sale or purchase of paddy and wheat below MSP, Kerala has fixed base prices for 16 farm produce, including vegetables and fruits. For 26 crops The KAPC had come out with “multifaceted” recommendations in its report titled ‘Assured price and stable market for agriculture horticulture crops in Karnataka’ in 2017-18 that analysed 26 major crops of the State for estimated cost of cultivation, market arrivals, market analysis, and price forecasting. These crops accounted for 87% of the total cropped area in the State. The recommendations included providing legal status to MSP by making it statutory minimum price. Dishonouring it was supposed to attract penalty. “Mere announcement of the MSP does not mean that it would be operational. Providing legal status to it ensures that it is always operational so that no time is lost in protecting the interests of farmers,” said T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, former chairman of the KAPC, during whose tenure the recommendation on providing legal status to MSP was made. According to him, the report was in a crucial stage of discussion in 2019, but did not go through as the government collapsed soon after. Dr. Kammaradi, who was involved in consultations by Punjab and Kerala, said the calculations by the KAPC had indicated that Rs. 10,000 crore was enough to ensure MSP for 17 major crops of the State, including onion, tomato, and areca, going by the market situation in the last five years. The recommendations by the KAPC also included bringing about ‘Karnataka Agriculture Produce Procurement Responsibility Act’ to make it mandatory for the government to procure certain quantity of foodgrains at MSP under its various welfare schemes. For welfare schemes Dr. Kammaradi explained that 500 lakh quintals of farm produce was being used every year under various welfare measures, including public distribution system, midday meals, for government-run hostels, Integrated Child Development Scheme, and for Indira Canteen. Barring some schemes, purchases are being made through agencies or middlemen under tendering process where the contractor or supplier would not ensure MSP for farmers. He stressed the need for procuring produce directly from farmers at MSP for such welfare measures to bring about market stability. Food and policy analyst Devinder Sharma observed that ensuring market stability would go a long way in providing a boost to agriculture sector which is in crisis. He argued that failure by the market to ensure remunerative prices to agricultural crops was the main reason for agrarian crisis. Karnataka should implement the recommendations of the KAPC to ensure legal status for MSP in the interest of farmers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/punjab-kerala-steal-a-march-on-state-in-agricultural-price-stabilisation/article33017805.ece
04 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||ED probe against Bineesh now shifts focus to Kerala||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigation into the drug trafficking-related money laundering charges against Bineesh Kodiyeri in Karnataka lengthened to Kerala on Tuesday. Bineesh is the son of Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. An Enforcement Directorate team from Karnataka has reportedly arrived in the State to investigate persons and businesses they suspect had helped Bineesh conceal and launder money obtained illegally. The CPI(M) has attempted to distance itself from the case. The Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have sought to weaponise the probe against the Left Democratic Front government and the CPI(M). In a filing in the court of the Special Judge, Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Bengaluru, on Monday, the ED alleged Bineesh had many front persons (benamidars) to “create assets in their name to avoid detection”. Bineesh owned “high-end cars” in the name of Al Jassam Abdul Jabbar. Abdul Latheef, a businessperson, co-owned Old Coffee House restaurant with Bineesh. Firms under ED lens The ED said UAFX solutions, Car Palace, Capito Lights, KK Rocks Quarry, and their promoters were under the ambit of its investigation. The agency required to question Latheef to “gather evidence regarding the illegal activities and proceeds of crime”. The ED wanted to “confront Bineesh and Latheef” with the “voluminous documents and digital evidence” agents had ferreted out. Investigations so far had revealed that Bineesh had generated large sums of money from the State and infused the cash into the accounts and shell companies run by his “frontmen”. The arrest of Muhammad Anoop, a Kochi resident, on drug charges by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Bengaluru in April had led to the arrest of Bineesh by the ED. The ED’s task in Kerala was to trace the proceeds from the crime, identify diversions, single out “end users”, and confiscate properties involved in money laundering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-probe-against-bineesh-now-shifts-focus-to-kerala/article33017565.ece
04 November 2020||HYDERABAD,||On day 2, operation of land record portal Dharani smooth||Registration and mutation of agricultural lands online through Dharani, the integrated land record management systems portal, were by and large satisfactory on the second day on Tuesday. The portal witnessed teething troubles on Monday, the opening day of the portal, with a spree of complaints on slow internet speed and problems in other operational areas which led to difficulties in opening of the portal to facilitate online registrations. The Information Technology department officials who registered the complaints focused on redress of these complaints and took steps to ensure that they did not recur. Connectivity One of the main issues encountered on the first day was connectivity in the wake of huge traffic. “We have accordingly altered the configuration to accommodate more users to login simultaneously and the problem has been overcome easily,” a senior official told The Hindu . According to him, alterations made to the configuration will enable 5,000 users to login simultaneously and thus, there will not be any hiccups in operating the portal. There were no reports of delays or technical glitches from any part of the State as problems relating to reverse endorsement and signature by the MRO concerned had also been redressed satisfactorily. There were also issues faced relating to multiple users in single transaction. “There are no problems as far as single users are concerned. But problems were reported in case where a land owner intended to sell his land to more than one buyer. We have focused on that aspect too and it is now possible to conduct registration of properties in the name of multiple buyers,” the official said. IT department officials are confident that after the changes made in the configuration of Dharani portal, the system will be streamlined and stabilized in a day or two thereby allowing seamless transactions in the coming days. On the connectivity side, officials explained that adequate care had been taken to ensure that there was no breakdown in connectivity at any point of time. All the mandals have been given the option of secondary internet broadband connection and infrastructure has been set up to equip these offices with broadband of 12 mbps connectivity through the State Wide Area Network. “This secondary connection from local operators has been allowed to avoid downtime/failure in connectivity while operating Dharani portal,” the official said adding it would be available 24X7 for conducting the operations. In addition to provide required manpower for operating these systems, the government had also communicated that the mandal offices where secondary broadband connectivity is being utilized will be reimbursed upto Rs. 2,000 per connection per month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/on-day-2-dharani-operation-smooth/article33017765.ece
04 November 2020||Hyderabad,||Hyderabad man stabbed to death in U.S.||A 37-year-old Hyderabad-born man running a convenience store in Thomaston City in Georgia of the United States was reportedly killed by his business rivals there on Halloween night on Sunday. He was stabbed multiple times by the attackers — a US citizen and two Indian nationals — and was found dead in a pool of blood outside his house on Crawley Street. The victim, Mohammed Arif Mohiuddin, a resident of Bahadurpura in the Old City, went to the United States 10 years ago for higher studies and settled there. He opened the store two months ago, after losing his job at a consultancy firm due to COVID-19 lockdown. Thomaston Police Chief Mike Richardson, who is investigating the murder said that Arif, who operated ‘The Heights’ a convenience store on East Moore’s Crossing, was involved in a business dispute with his alleged attackers. Footage of the surveillance cameras near Arif’s property had shown multiple assailants, including an employee at the store. “They (attackers) wanted to open a new store quite opposite to Arif’s on East Moore’s Crossing, and the local authorities asked them to take clearance from the former, for which he denied as his business could run into losses with the opening of another store on the opposite street,” Arif’s father-in-law Khaja Moizuddin, a retired physical director from Anwarul Uloom College told The Hindu . Arif got married to Moizuddin’s daughter Mehnaaz Fatima (27) two-and-a-half-years ago and the couple have a 10-month-old daughter. Arif’s last visit to Hyderabad was in 2019 and his mother stays with his sister in Australia. Both Mr. Moizuddin and Ms. Mehnaaz have applied for an emergency visa to the US to see Arif for the ‘last time’ before the body is buried there. “I request the government to arrange for me and my father to go to the US on an emergency visa so that we could perform his final rites,” Ms. Mehnaaz said. She said that on Sunday around 9 a.m. Arif called her and they spoke for a few minutes. “He hung up the phone stating he will call back in half-an-hour but I did not get any call from him. Further, he was not answering to my repeated calls, and I grew suspicious,” she said. Soon, she called her husband’s sister in Australia who informed her about the stabbing. “There is no family member around him now. His body is at the hospital,” Ms. Mehnaaz said. Immigration papers of Ms. Mehnaaz and their newborn were pending, and her husband is already a permanent resident card holder there. Ghouse Mohammed , a techie from Georgia, who is coordinating with the authorities and Arif’s family here told The Hindu that further details about the attackers can be known only on Wednesday. “Police told me that the investigation is still on and they cannot come to a conclusion at this moment. A few people were taken into custody,” he said. Mr. Ghouse, who stays one hour away from Thomaston City, said that as per the initial report, two Indians and one US citizen are suspected to be involved in the crime. Arif’s body is in the crime lab for investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hyderabad-man-stabbed-to-death-in-us/article33017577.ece
04 November 2020||Bengaluru,||Drugs case: HC rejects bail pleas of Kannada film actors||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday declined to grant bail and anticipatory bail to two Kannada film actors, Ragini Dwivedi and Archana alias Sanjjanaa Manohar Galrani, and four others allegedly involved in a drug racket case being probed by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the Bengaluru city police. Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar passed the order while dismissing the separate petitions filed by Ragini (accused number two in the first information report registered on September 4, 2020), Sanjjanaa (accused number 14), and Prashanth Ranka (accused number four) seeking their enlargement on bail. The Special Court for the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances cases had on September 28 rejected their plea for grant of bail. All the three accused are in judicial custody. No advance bail Meanwhile, the High Court declined to grant anticipatory bail to Shivapraksh (accused number one), Abhiswami (accused number 10), and Prashanth Raju G. (accused number eight), who have sought advance bail apprehending their arrest by the CCB based on their names in the FIR. Before trial court The Special Court, while rejecting the bail pleas of Ragini and Sanjjanaa, had observed that “the apprehension of prosecution that petitioners may abscond and tamper evidence could not be ruled out”. It was contended on behalf the CCB before the Special Court that Ragini and Sanjjanaa had direct contact with drug peddlers across the country and abroad and were part of a WhatsApp group for sharing messages. It was also alleged by the CCB that both Ragini and Sanjjanaa had deleted various chat messages from their mobiles and did not cooperate with the investigation. The CCB had specifically alleged before the trial court that Sanjjanaa was part of a WhatsApp group, members of which used to party consuming drugs, and she had deleted the group soon after the arrest of one of the accused in the case. In case of Ragini, the CCB had alleged that the investigating officer had collected call records of her conversing with Loom Pepper, a Senegalese national who has been arraigned as accused number seven, asking him deliver drugs to various places in Bengaluru. Both Ragini and Sanjjanaa had neither shared passwords of their mobile phones with the investigating officer nor gave blood samples for medical examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/drugs-case-hc-rejects-bail-pleas-of-kannada-film-actors/article33017581.ece

The Congress leader was addressing public meetings at Katihar and Kishanganj districts of northeast Bihar where the third phase of poll is scheduled to be held on November 7. “I want to ask all the youth who are here, has Modi ji given them two crore jobs for which he had made announcement during last Lok Sabha poll?

04 November 2020||Srinagar,||Old land laws were pro-people: J&K parties||The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), an amalgam of around six parties in Jammu and Kashmir, on Tuesday disputed the defence of the administration of the newly introduced land laws and described it as “a bundle of lies” and “an attempt to change demography”. “The PAGD rejects the statement of the official spokesman [of November 2] as a bizarre attempt to distort facts, weave lies and mislead people”, a spokesman of the Gupkar alliance said in a statement. Disputing the remarks made by government spokesman Rohit Kansal that the previous laws were “archaic and regressive”, the alliance spokesman said the land laws regime of Jammu and Kashmir was “most progressive, pro-people and pro-farmer in the entire Indian subcontinent”. “The real object to repeal the basic land laws and to make massive amendments to the other laws is to push in and implement the agenda of effecting demographic change and disempowering the people of Jammu and Kashmir”. The previous laws ended the exploitative practice of “absentee landlordism”, he stated. “Whosoever calls it archaic would be guilty of ignorance of the history of J&K. It is because of the timely land reforms that there are no starvation deaths in J&K and no farmer suicides,” he said. Describing the new laws as undemocratic and backward looking, he said, “The recently introduced laws ‘now allows’ the land to be transferred to non-state subjects, denuding the residents of their most precious rights”.

04 November 2020||BENGALURU,||Karnataka plans to ban conversion for marriage||Minister and BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi on Tuesday said Karnataka would enact a law banning “religious conversions for the sake of marriage”. “We will not remain silent when Jihadis strip the dignity of our sisters. Anyone involved in the act of conversion shall face severe and swift punishment,” Mr. Ravi tweeted. He said that the proposed law would be “on the lines of Allahabad High Court’s order”. Mr. Ravi’s statement comes three days after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s remarks that his government would bring an “effective law” against “love jihad” (a term used by the Hindu right-wing to refer to inter-faith relationships and marriages involving a Muslim man and a Hindu woman). Mr. Adityanath had also issued a “warning” to those who “played with the honour” of “sisters and daughters” by concealing their identities. He had also said that if they did not mend their ways, their “funeral processions”would be taken out. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister too had referred to a September 23 order by the Allahabad High Court dismissing a writ petition filed by a married couple seeking police protection. The woman, who was Muslim by birth, had converted to Hindu religion just a month before the marriage. The court observed that the religious conversion had taken place only for the purpose of marriage. The court, while dismissing their petition, pointed out that in the Noor Jahan Begum alias Anjali Mishra case of 2014, it had observed that “conversion just for the purpose of marriage” was unacceptable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-plans-to-ban-conversion-for-marriage/article33017563.ece
04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Governor can rule on Rajiv convicts’ plea: SC||Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, for Perarivalan, said the status report filed about the MDMA probe was a copy-paste of earlier such reports. In January last, the court said the body was yet to conclude its investigation on the origin and make of the bomb that killed the ex-Prime Minister. The court made it clear during the hearing that it was reluctant to exercise its jurisdiction when the Governor was already seized of Perarivalan’s plea for pardon under Article 161 of the Constitution. Perarivalan applied to the Governor for pardon on December 30, 2015. Almost three years later, on September 6, 2018, the Supreme Court asked the Governor to decide the pardon plea as he “deemed fit”. Three days later, on September 9, the Tamil Nadu Cabinet recommended to the Governor to remit Perarivalan’s sentence and release him forthwith. “However, it seems neither the recommendation was signed by the Tamil Nadu Governor nor the order of September 6 has been honoured by the Governor for the past two years,” an application filed by Perarivalan, through advocate Prabu Ramasubramanium, said. On January 20, the Supreme Court sought information from Tamil Nadu, represented by Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan and Yogesh Kanna, on the steps taken by the Governor pursuant to the September 6 order and the Cabinet’s recommendation. In February, the State government informed the court that the Cabinet recommendation had been sent to the Governor for his signature. The court responded by asking the State to ensure that the Cabinet decision to release Perarivalan was enforced. On Tuesday, Justice Rao’s Bench agreed to hear the case in detail on November 23. Perarivalan has contended his role in the alleged crime taken to the maximum would be that of supplying two 9-volt batteries without knowledge of what it was going to be used for. He said his confession under the lapsed TADA to a police officer was not a valid evidence. Alleging that “a grave prejudice” has been caused on him, Perarivalan said he was a “19-year-old boy when his mother handed him over to the CBI and now he is 45 years old, lost his prime youth in prison that too in death row under solitary confinement for over 16 years”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/governor-can-rule-on-rajiv-convicts-plea-sc/article33017578.ece

Paul, also speaking at the conference, said India needs to be cautious now. “We are still vulnerable and the situation is still not fully under our control. We need to build on the gains India has been able to achieve so far. The public effort has to remain sustained. We have to test, isolate and work at breaking the transmission of the virus. Anyone who has symptoms should get tested. This will keep your family and society safe. “Every missed case means multiple infections and we are duty-bound as citizens to get ourselves treated. Any symptoms of cold, fever, throat irritation should be taken as COVID, unless proven otherwise during this season.’’ He said social distancing, washing hands and wearing masks are our ultimate vaccine. Reiterating this, Indian Council of Medical Research Director General Balram Bhargava said: “COVID appropriate behaviour is the most cost effective, preventive treatment against this disease and we should take this seriously. There is more data emerging now that masks are as good as a vaccine. We recommend using a mask while walking and exercising.’’ The Ministry on Tuesday said the active COVID cases have drastically declined below 5.5 lakhs and the positive cases are 5,41,405 comprising 6.55% of the total cases. The total recovered cases have crossed 76 lakhs (76,03,121). The gap between active cases and recovered cases has crossed 70 lakhs on Tuesday and stands at 70,61,716.

Also 74% of the new confirmed cases are from 10 States and UTs. Kerala, Delhi and Maharashtra have contributed the maximum to them with more than 4,000 cases. West Bengal follows with more than 3,000 new cases. India has reported 490 case fatalities in the past 24 hours. “Of these, nearly 80% are concentrated in 10 States/UTs.

The Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav and the Bahujan Samaj Party’s Ramji Gautam won from Uttar Pradesh. The Congress lost one seat from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand with the retirement of senior leaders P.L. Punia and Raj Babbar. The elected BJP members include Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri. The Opposition has been steadily losing ground in the Rajya Sabha. In its first defeat, in July 2019, the Opposition lost the vote on the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights of Marriage) Bill, 2019, this despite key NDA allies, the Janata Dal (U) and the AIADMK, opposing the Bill. The Jammu and Kashmir Re-organisation Bill on August 5 last year was cleared without any trouble. The Congress is now down to 38, its lowest-ever tally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-reaches-92-mark-in-rajya-sabha/article33017610.ece

04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||RGGGH’s pathology laboratory receives NABL accreditation||The pathology laboratory of the Madras Medical College and the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) has received certification from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) as an accredited testing laboratory. On Tuesday, RGGGH dean E. Theranirajan formally handed over the certificate issued by NABL to director of pathology Bharathi Vidhya Jayanthi. A three-member team from NABL had conducted an inspection of the laboratory in December last, and the certification was issued in February. “The accreditation will mean that the laboratory is standardised, and all procedures are carried out as per protocols, starting with receiving samples to issuing the reports,” Dr. Theranirajan said. Getting the “NABL Accredited Testing Laboratory” status was the outcome of two years of work, a professor said. “It is important for a laboratory to give accurate and quality reports. There are so many procedures involved from the moment a laboratory receives a blood sample. This starts with alloting an identity number for the patient to how the specimen is processed. It is important that our machines are in working condition, and are calibrated every year as per international standards,” she said. She added that documentation for each and every machine was done every day. “It is important that we provide accurate diagnosis for our patients, the majority of whom are in the BPL category. So we worked for two years and put in place protocols to run each test perfectly as per international standards. Maintaining the quality is crucial,” she said. On average, 100 to 120 tests are done at the laboratory (histopathology and cytopathology) every day. “If a test is done in a NABL accredited laboratory, there is no need to repeat them. It is a sign of accuracy,” the professor added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rggghs-pathology-laboratory-receives-nabl-accreditation/article33018170.ece
04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State gives a big push for e-vehicles through 100% tax exemption||Electric vehicle manufacturers and those wanting to own clean energy vehicles have a lot to cheer this festival season with the State government announcing a 100% tax exemption to battery operated vehicles for more than two years. The additional good news is that the tax exemption is being extended to even transport vehicles (vehicles used for commercial purposes). In a Government Order issued by Additional Chief Secretary S.K. Prabhakar on Monday, the State government gave 100% tax exemption for all battery-operated vehicles, including transport and non-transport types, from November 3 to December 31, 2022. Transport Commissioner T.S. Jawahar said the decision of the State government would help in giving a big push to electric vehicle sales and also help in reducing pollution. He said that despite the earlier tax waiver of 50% given only to non-transport vehicles, sales in the State were still lacking. The G.O. comes in the wake of the Transport Commissioner seeking 100% waiver of vehicle tax for both transport and non-transport vehicles through a letter to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in November last. A senior official of the State Transport Department said several State governments and Union Territories, such as Delhi, had been giving tax breaks of different percentages but a big State like Tamil Nadu giving 100% exemption would pave the way for promoting the sale of e-vehicles for commercial exploitation in a big way. All that the e-vehicle purchasers would have to pay would be the registration charges of a minimum of Rs. 1,200 for two-wheelers and Rs. 2,500 for four-wheelers.  Electric vehicle manufacturers welcomed the move of the State government for waiving off-road tax for more than two years. Ravneet Singh Phokela, chief business officer, Ather Energy, said, “The past few days have been great for the e-vehicle industry, with progressive policies continuing to come into play. The removal of the 4% road tax will significantly reduce upfront costs. This has come at an opportune time for Ather as we begin deliveries of the Ather 450X in Chennai this Deepavali. With this announcement, residents of Chennai and Coimbatore will now save nearly Rs. 6,900 when they purchase Ather scooters. This is a welcome move for the entire industry and will accelerate the shift towards EVs.” However, clean energy activists are taking the tax break with a pinch of salt. Sivasubramaniam, of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy India, said, “A welcome move from the Tamil Nadu government to promote electric vehicles. However, the sale of private motor vehicles is already sky-rocketing since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Considering the higher reliance on private motor vehicles, it is advisable to consider the purchase of new vehicles along with old vehicle buyback and scrapping policies.” This would help in controlling the number of vehicles in our system, he said. In addition, promoting electric vehicles was better for the environment only if it was fully supported through clean energy, Mr. Sivasubramaniam added.

04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Positivity rate down to 3.5%: Minister||Tamil Nadu’s positivity rate is down to 3.5% from last month’s 10%, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said on Tuesday, even as another 2,435 persons tested positive for COVID-19 in the State. “COVID-19 cases are on a declining trend. At a time when the positivity rate is 15% and 35% in other parts of the country, Tamil Nadu’s positivity rate is 3.5%, from 4% last week and 10% last month,” he told reporters in Chennai. Several developing countries are struggling with a second wave of infections, with European countries recording 2.5 lakh cases daily and the U.S. reporting one lakh cases, he said. “Kerala and Delhi have been reporting 5,000-plus cases. We have been registering a declining trend after a peak in July and August,” he added. It was an achievement for the State to have tested over one crore samples through RT-PCR tests, he said. “Even today, it takes three to five days for laboratory results in some developed countries. However, we have reduced the time from the earlier 24 hours to 10 hours now,” he stated. The mortality rate is also declining. From 120 deaths earlier, the number of deaths has reduced to 70, and this has further declined to 30 now. Referring to the second wave of infections in many developed countries, he said the festival season and winter in December were challenges for the State. “Preventing a second wave of infections is in the hands of the people. We can prevent a second wave of infections only if people cooperate,” he said. “Celebrate Deepavali by following public health norms, with self-restrictions. There are chances of industrial, family, workplace and festival clusters,” he added. So far, 2.34 crore persons have been screened through fever camps. With the fresh cases, the State’s tally rose to 7,31,942. As another 2,707 persons were discharged, the total number of persons discharged so far crossed seven lakh. Another 31 persons died, taking the toll to 11,214. Of the new cases, Chennai reported 669, while Coimbatore saw 238. Chengalpattu and Tiruvallur reported 136 and 113 cases respectively. The remaining districts had less than 100 new cases. This included Salem (97), Tiruppur (98) and Kancheepuram (90). With another 70,398 samples tested, the overall sample count increased to 1,01,69,917.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/positivity-rate-down-to-35-minister/article33017710.ece
04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State may get widespread rainfall||After a break of one or two days, the State is heading for another wet spell as the Meteorological Department forecasts an increase in rainfall activity during the rest of the week. According to officials, light to moderate rains may occur in many places in the State till November 7 due to the cyclonic circulation over southwest Bay of Bengal off Tamil Nadu coast. S. Balachandran, deputy director general of meteorology, Chennai, said the cyclonic circulation is moving westwards and easterly winds are also strengthening with the presence of the weather system. Picking up pace After a slight drop in rainfall, the monsoon is picking up pace over the State. Interior and south Tamil Nadu may have more rains compared to northern parts of the State. During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, Manjalar in Theni district received 9 cm of rainfall, which is the highest amount for the day. This was followed by Burliar in the Nilgiris and Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district which recorded 8 cm and 7 cm respectively. Officials said heavy rains with thundershowers may occur in one or two places in districts, including Madurai, Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Tiruppur and Theni, for the next two days. Heavy rain spell with thunder showers is likely to occur in many places of the State from November 6. The State has so far received an average of 11 cm. which is 47% less than the normal rainfall, for the period since October. However, rainfall in the coming days may bridge the shortfall, officials added. Rainfall may revive in Chennai too with light to moderate rains predicted in some areas for two days. The city may continue to experience relatively a warm weather with maximum temperature hovering around 34 degree Celsius till Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-may-get-widespread-rainfall/article33017683.ece
04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||K.N. Nehru moves High Court against cancellation of Grama Sabha meetings||DMK principal secretary K.N. Nehru has filed a public interest litigation petition in the Madras High Court to restrain the State government from interfering with decisions taken by village panchayats to conduct grama sabha meetings. He also urged the court to declare as illegal the cancellation of grama sabha meetings scheduled to be held on October 2 and issue a consequential direction to the government to ensure that the meetings were conducted within three weeks. According to the litigant, the State government did not conduct local body elections for long number of years. It was only after orders were passed by the Supreme Court and the High Court that elections were held partially for 9,424 out of 15,525 village panchayats in December last. DMK candidates won most of the Panchayat president posts and assumed office. As per the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act of 1994, grama sabha meetings should be conducted twice every year and as per executive instructions issued by the government, they should be conducted on January 26, May 1, August 15 and October 2. Recently, the Centre had brought in the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act of 2020, the Farmers' Produce, Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act of 2020 and also an amendment to the Essential Commodities Act. These legislation were opposed nationwide by farmers and Opposition parties. Hence, DMK president M.K. Stalin had urged the villagers to pass resolutions against the legislations in the grama sabha meetings on October 2. On coming to know about the request made by the Leader of the Opposition, the government illegally cancelled those meetings, the petitioner claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kn-nehru-moves-hc-against-cancellation-of-grama-sabha-meetings/article33018180.ece
04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin urges govt. not to open schools, colleges till next year||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Tuesday said it was highly condemnable that the AIADMK government had decided to open schools and colleges at a time when a second wave of COVID-19 infections had been predicted by bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO). “I want to remind Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami that the safety of students is very important. Instead of taking decisions in a hurry, he should hold a meeting with parent-teacher associations and medical professionals. Till such time, he should put a hold on the announcement to open educational institutions on November 16,” he said in a statement. He said parents and teachers were worried ever since the government made the announcement. Recalling that a study done by WHO in the U.K., Israel, South Korea and Vietnam had concluded that higher and higher-secondary schools reported more cases, Mr. Stalin said it was a big question how educational institutions would be in a position to ensure handwashing and adherence to physical distancing norms. “We are seeing that safety measures are being thrown to the wind in areas where lockdown regulations have been relaxed. If the government is not able to ensure the safety of students, there is a danger of parents, teachers and students contracting the infection,” he said.  He said teachers and parents wanted schools and colleges to open only by the end of January, after Pongal. Mr. Stalin, in a separate statement, described as “anti-human and a violation of power” what he called the endless delay on the part of Governor Banwarilal Purohit in taking a decision on the Assembly resolution recommending the release of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-urges-govt-not-to-open-schools-colleges-till-next-year/article33017707.ece
04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Traders not keen on setting up temporary fireworks shops||There has been a lukewarm response among small traders to set up temporary shops to sell fireworks ahead of Deepavali, sources said. The police and fire department officials said the number of applications received from traders was lower this year compared to previous years. Every year, the police invite applications seeking licences to set up temporary fireworks shops a month ahead of Deepavali. Usual procedure The applications, with relevant documents, would be processed by the Fire and Rescue Services Department, the police and other authorities. A senior official in the Fire and Rescue Services Department said the poor response could be an impact of the pandemic, which had affected business. “Normally, we used to give 1,100-1,200 no-objection certificates (NOCs) every year in the city limits. But this year, we have received 272 applications. Of them, we have issued 69 NOCs and others are in process,” he said. Last year, over 5,800 licences were issued across the State. Officials said the figure would not touch 4,500 this time; only 3,000 applications had been cleared so far. M. Sheik Ali, a wholesale dealer of fireworks in Broadway, said, “Normally, by this time, many traders across the city would gather in large numbers to procure crackers to set up temporary shops. But this year, we see fewer buyers. This year, gift boxes of crackers have not been sold so far. Normally, such boxes used to be procured by people who ran Deepavali chit fund schemes. Since many defaulted to pay the chits during the lockdown period, they did not come to us for buying such items.” Deepavali fair The Mega Deepavali Fair on the Island Grounds will commence from Friday. Sheikh Abdullah, secretary, Chennai Metropolitan City Firecrackers Sellers’ Association, said, “We are reducing the number of shops here due to restrictions imposed on us. Last time, 65 temporary shops were permitted at the fair.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traders-not-keen-on-setting-up-temporary-fireworks-shops/article33018166.ece
04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC grants leave to Amala Paul to sue estranged fiancé||The Madras High Court on Tuesday granted leave to actor Amala Paul to file a defamation suit against her estranged fiancé Bhavninder Singh Dhatt for uploading pictures of their engagement on Instagram, and claiming it to be photos of their marriage ceremony. Justice N. Sathish Kumar gave permission to file the suit after the actor’s counsel Chandraprabu told the court that though Mr. Singh, a singer by profession, had an office at Ashok Nagar in Chennai, he resides mostly in Puducherry and so she required the leave of the court to file the suit. Counsel told the court that Ms. Paul was in a relationship with Mr. Singh and got engaged to him in 2018. However, following an estrangement, they parted ways early this year. After this, he uploaded some photographs of the private engagement on his Instagram page and claimed they were photographs of their marriage. This news was carried by almost all media houses and particularly by those in Chennai, and hence a part of the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of the Madras High Court, he said. Claiming that the singer was threatening to upload more photos, he said Ms. Paul wanted a permanent injunction restraining him from sharing in the public domain any of her personal moments spent with him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-grants-leave-to-amala-paul-to-sue-estranged-fianc/article33018174.ece
04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||In a surprise, air fares remain affordable this festival season||For air passengers wanting to travel home this festive season or for emergencies, air fares are unusually low despite holidays in the next couple of months, owing to the pandemic. The air fares for Bengaluru are the most affordable and passengers have to spend just Rs. 1,700-2,000 one way for travel next week. 30%-40% dip Similarly, the fares for travel from Chennai to Hyderabad are only Rs. 2,400-Rs. 2,800. While the prices for Delhi range between Rs. 4,000-Rs. 4,200, for most of next month, it is as cheap as Rs. 2,500 one way. Shahul Hameed, chairman of the Travel Agents Association of India, said the fares this time had dipped 30%-40% when compared to the previous year. “This is because the airfares have been regulated by the government, and the circumstances are not normal. In a pandemic situation, this will help those who travel for essential needs, like for medical treatment, deaths or other emergencies,” he said.  Sriharan Balan, deputy managing director of Madura Travels, said this time last year if a passenger booked an air ticket to any major destination at the last minute, it would be 4-5 times higher than usual. The most travelled sectors are Chennai-Bengaluru, Chennai-Salem, Chennai-Mumbai and Chennai-Ahmedabad. “There are businessmen and industrialists travelling to some extent now. Otherwise, since most people are working from home, they don’t have to travel to their hometowns to celebrate. This is another important reason restraining people from flying,” he said. Interestingly, a very small section of people are going on vacation. While newly married couples are opting to fly to Kochi and then drive down to Athirapally or Alappuzha, some others are flying to Goa in groups. “Those who recovered from COVID-19 are the ones heading on holidays now. They tell us that since they have antibodies, they can travel without fear,” Mr. Sriharan Balan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/air-fares-remain-affordable-this-festival-season/article33018172.ece

The guidelines mandate six-feet physical distance inside cinemas, masks for both patrons and employees, 50% occupancy of seats, the reduction of touch points at ticket counters and canteens, and the screening of patrons for COVID-19 symptoms. As per the government notification, it is compulsory for cinema owners to collect the phone numbers of patrons to aid in contact tracing in the event of someone testing positive for COVID-19. Only packed food and drinks are permitted to be sold. Sanitiser dispensers must be placed at the entrance and exit points, and the movement of people must be regulated. Vacant seats should be marked with fluorescent tape. Cinema owners have also been asked to reorganise the timings of shows to ensure that there is no crowding in cinema halls with more than one screen. Online payments While prescribing the use of online payments, e-wallets and payments using QR code to reduce touch points, the State government has said touch points that are used frequently, such as doors, and cinema halls should be sanitised after every show. “If a person with symptoms is found, they should be isolated in a separate room, and a rapid response team (RRT) should be contacted. Based on the assessment, contact tracing and further course of treatment should be ensured,” the guidelines said. The government has prohibited cinema halls situated inside COVID-19 containment zones from reopening, and employees residing in such zones from reporting to work. Cinema owners have been advised not to employ elderly people, pregnant women, those with co-morbidities and symptomatic workers in roles that require direct interaction with the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-govt-unveils-sop-for-cinemas/article33017698.ece
04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Over 30 hospitals pulled up for violations||More than 30 private hospitals in Tamil Nadu have been pulled up for overcharging patients for COVID-19 treatment. Following action from the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMS), a majority of these hospitals have refunded the excess charges to the patients. Non-compliance with treatment costs fixed by the State government was one of the main violations that came to the notice of officials. “There were many issues related to payments. We received more than 30 complaints on excess charging by private hospitals. We took action and have settled almost all complaints. Hospitals have refunded the excess amounts to the patients,” an official of the Health Department said. The government, in June, had classified private hospitals, and fixed a maximum of Rs. 7,500 a day for treatment in the general ward, in grade A1/A2 hospitals, and up to Rs. 5,000 a day for grade A3/A4 hospitals, while a maximum of Rs. 15,000 was fixed for treatment in ICUs in all categories of hospitals. “The cost was fixed for ICU and non-ICU wards. But private hospitals have single and double rooms and suites as well. So they went ahead and increased the charges. We intervened following complaints and made them reduce the prices. Many hospitals have been complying with the government-stipulated fee structure, and we have been conducting regular checks,” he said. Earlier, nine private hospitals faced “temporary cancellation” of permits to treat COVID-19 patients, after various violations of norms laid down by the Central and State governments. “Some hospitals did not follow COVID-19 protocols. On verification, we first issued a warning. When the violations continued and there were more complaints, we took action. We temporarily cancelled licenses of nine hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients, and have now revoked the suspension for more than half the facilities, following explanations and undertakings not to repeat,” the official said. Periodic revisions in COVID-19 treatment protocols were communicated to private hospitals through joint directors in the districts, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-30-hospitals-pulled-up-for-violations/article33017701.ece

This will also have an implication on the seats surrendered from the All-India Quota pool,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/merit-list-for-medical-counselling-on-november-16/article33017704.ece
04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||PIL plea on COVID-19 precautions: HC reserves verdict||The Madras High Court on Tuesday reserved its verdict on a public interest litigation petition that had challenged the State government's move declaring non wearing of masks, failure to maintain physical distance and violating other COVID-19 related precautions as compoundable offences which attract fines ranging between Rs. 200 to Rs. 5,000. First Division Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy deferred their verdict to November 27 after hearing elaborate arguments advanced by the petitioner R. Muthukrishnan, a 77-year-old advocate from Ramapuram here, and State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan. The petitioner claimed that the move to impose fine, without a solid statutory backing, for issues such as not wearing masks and failure to follow standard operating procedures amounted to violation of rights guaranteed to citizens under Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution. Pointing out that the government itself had conceded to have collected several crores of rupees in fine, the petitioner said such a measure could not be resorted to unless there were clear cut provisions under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act of 1939 declaring non adherence to physical distance norms and so on as offences that could be compounded. He said a government gazette notification issued on September 4 had declared them to be compoundable offences by relying upon Section 76(2) of the 1939 though that provision only empowers government officials to issue SOPs and ensure wearing of masks and so on to control spread of notified diseases. The Section nowhere declares non adherence by individuals as an offence, the petitioner pointed out. He also stated that the gazette notification had been issued by the Health Secretary and not the Governor. On the other hand, Mr. Narayanan claimed that there was no need to obtain prior approval of the Governor before issuing the gazette notification which had declared certain COVID-19 preventive measures as compoundable offences. The SGP asserted that the notification had been issued in accordance with the rules which had been framed by the Governor, exercising powers under Article 166(3) of the Constitution, for allocation of business to various departments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pil-plea-on-covid-19-precautions-hc-reserves-verdict/article33018179.ece

According to sources in the railways, the LTE-R was also contemplated for Mission Critical Passenger Safety Services & Applications, Video Surveillance System through Closed Circuit Television cameras in trains and Passenger Information System and Internet of Things (IoT) on rolling stock & fixed assets. The railways have roped in the expertise of institutions like the IITs in Chennai, Roorkee and Kharagpur and the University of Mumbai in the mission to use advanced technology, including MTRC and Artificial Intelligence, to enable prediction of signalling assets failures and enhance reliability of signalling system. In a separate order, the Railway Board in an advisory to all Zonal Railways has called for cutting costs incurred on housekeeping activities on trains and stations. With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the situation of operating only a few trains was expected to continue for some more time. “All possible measures should be taken for reduction/control of expenditure on housekeeping on trains and stations in the current financial year. Railways should critically review contracts and operate at appropriate level as per requirement,” the advisory said. In an earlier order the Railway Board wanted Zonal Railways to review the cleaning contracts in view of the pandemic and even suggested that they look for sponsorship with suitable branding of trains/stations and use the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds for cleaning activity as a measure to save expenditure. Divisional Railway Managers were empowered to allow NGOs to adopt stations for cleaning purposes by allowing suitable display of their name, logo etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/railways-to-deploy-high-speed-internet-for-passenger-safety/article33017733.ece

Alagiri has written to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to reconsider the blanket ban on sale of all fireworks during Deepavali and allow ‘green crackers’ from Sivakasi to be sold there. ‘Ill-informed ban’ Mr. Alagiri said the Sivakasi fireworks industry not only employs the poor and the marginalised people but also is instrumental in creating a supply chain that involves small traders, transporters and wholesalers across India, whose livelihood would be grossly affected by the “ill-informed ban”. He said these families had toiled the entire year to prepare for the single season sale of their products and would be pushed to a dire situation due to the ban.  He said the Supreme Court driven green innovation in the fireworks industry had led to the creation of a whole new range of fireworks in which the major pollutant sulphur dioxide had been avoided and the emission of all other gases were also within the limits prescribed. “Considering these facts, I appeal to you to relax the blanket ban on all fireworks and allow the sale of scientifically ratified [by CSIR-NEERI and CPCB], eco-friendly ‘Green Fireworks’ of Sivakasi,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allow-sale-of-green-fireworks-from-sivakasi-alagiri-tells-rajasthan-cm/article33018185.ece

04 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Observation, application helps in animation and design’||The field of animation and design has been growing in leaps and bounds in the last few years. Keeping this in mind, The Hindu Education Plus , along with the Hindusthan College of Arts & Science (Coimbatore), DJ Education and Maya Academy of Advanced Cinematics (MAAC), hosted a webinar on October 31, focusing on career opportunities in the area. Sivaprasad Velayudhan, founder of Coimbatore-based Realworks Studios, explained what the industry looked for. “Learning in this field is more about observation and application rather than memorising from a textbook,” he said. Just studying a course is not enough to excel in the real world, he added. To add value to the work you create, Mr. Velayudhan suggested getting out and experiencing the world, and applying what you observe. “Creativity is like a new recipe in which you take existing ingredients and mix and match them to create something different from what already exists. This is why many movies and books are influenced by what we see and observe around us,” he said. He also spoke about how the industry was interested in people who were dynamic, problem-solvers and team players. Internships and work experience are a great way to improve and gain the knowledge required to thrive, he added. Stalin T.M., creator and educator in the field of 3D Animation and VFX, MAAC, Coimbatore, gave a presentation with video examples of works that could be created through animation and VFX. He focused on the academic side, the subjects that a student would learn during the degree course, and the different career streams one could follow. He introduced the different industries in the stream, including graphic and web, animation, VFX and gaming, and highlighted how the growing media industry was offering different roles for specialisation. A. Ponnusamy, principal of Hindusthan College of Arts & Science, Coimbatore, welcomed the viewers and introduced the new Bachelor’s in the Graphic Design course that the college had introduced. At the end, the panelists took multiple questions from the audience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/observation-application-helps-in-animation-and-design/article33017734.ece

The State government has already finalised operation of electric buses (e-buses) all over the State with a major portion of them to be operated in Chennai through the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC). A senior official of the Institute of Road Transport (IRT) said the tender calling for finalising the contractor for purchasing 500 e-buses was over and once the selection of the two consultants for implementing the project was over, the first phase of launching e-buses would get under way.

04 November 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Red-headed vulture spotted on an unusual terrain near Coimbatore||In what appears to be a rare sighting, a bird watcher from Coimbatore spotted a Red-headed vulture ( Sarcogyps calvus ) or King vulture from Theethipalayam near Peur on Tuesday, much away from its existing known habitat in the region – the Moyar valley in the Nilgiris. N. Srinivasan, a private school teacher from Gandhipark in Coimbatore and an active member of the Coimbatore Nature Society (CNS), spotted the vulture when he went to the area for birding.  Identity “I photographed the bird which was on the flight towards the Siruvani hills. I shared the photo with CNS office-bearers G. Prakash and R. Selvaraj who confirmed its identity,” said Mr. Srinivasan. As per details available with birders and nature enthusiasts, sightings of Red-headed vulture in Coimbatore district were documented only within the limits of Sirumugai and Mettupalayam forest ranges that lie close to the eastern slope of the Nilgiris where Moyar valley is located. Home to vulture species Moyar valley is home to three out of the nine vulture species in India that are listed as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species namely Red-head vulture, White-backed vulture and Long-billed vulture. “Red-headed vulture or King vulture or Black vulture was once present all across Tamil Nadu. It was also used to be called Pondicherry vulture. The sighting of Red-headed vulture in a place far away from Moyar valley could be a sign of the extension of their territory”, said S. Bharathidasan, secretary of the non-governmental organisation Arulagam which is involved in conservation of vultures. Mr. Prakash of CNS said that the Red-headed vulture spotted from Theethipalayam could be a vagrant or an individual that was into range extension. Nesting “It is a good sign that Red-headed vulture, which scavenges the carcasses of wild animals, was recorded from an urban area of Coimbatore district. Siruvani hills are also home to trees that are preferred by Red-headed vulture for nesting,” Mr. Prakash said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/red-headed-vulture-spotted-on-an-unusual-terrain-near-coimbatore/article33018202.ece

He highlighted the condition of Sanganoor Canal, the Periya Odai that passed through Neelikonampalayam Indira Nagar, the natural drain in front of the Singanallur farmers’ market on Tiruchi Road, the canal that carried the surplus water from Selvachinthamani tank to the Ukkadam Big Tank., He also reminded the Corporation of last year’s inundation of houses in several low-lying pockets in the city to press his demand for cleaning the water courses ahead of the monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/clean-water-courses-ahead-of-monsoon-mla-tells-corporation/article33018203.ece
04 November 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Service providers’ work disrupts water supply in some areas||Supply of drinking water by the Coimbatore Corporation had worsened in the recent past in areas such as Kavundampalayam and Vadavalli. From once in 10 days until a few weeks ago, the supply of late had been made only once in 15 to 20 days, said official sources. The problem was not with distribution. Damage to pipeline It had to do with the water that the civic body received from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board under the Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli scheme, and damage to pipeline by works taken up by other government departments. TWAD board work The problem peaked just ahead of the Ayudha Puja holiday, when the Board stopped water supply to take up maintenance of the main supply line near Narasimhanaickenpalayam. The Corporation wanted the Board to postpone the work by a few days – it had suggested to the Board that the work be taken up after Monday (October 26). But over the weekend, the Board stopped water supply twice to take up the work. The impact of the stoppage was that several pockets in Vadavalli and Kavundampalayam received water only on the 19th day, the sources said. Though this was the latest instant, there had been several such in the past, the sources said and pointed to the Corporation’s request to the Tangedco to streamline maintenance at sub-stations that powered water supply motors. Each sub station that powered one or the other motors in the Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli water supply system had a different maintenance date and even if one of those shut down, the entire system was affected, the officials explained. Road widening Likewise, the National Highways widening the Mettupalayam Road too had affected water supply as during earth work, the pipeline got damaged. And, every such instance resulted in at least four to eight hours of disruption in water supply. The Corporation had therefore asked the Board to direct its engineers to attend to those leaks that were not major ones on days that the Tangedco suspended power supply for maintenance. And, it had also asked the agencies concerned for a schedule of their work, the sources added. Vadavalli resident and consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon said the agencies would do well to remember that they worked for public welfare and therefore should coordinate work so that the public was inconvenienced to the minimum. A senior Corporation officer said the Corporation had once again asked other government departments to ensure that they worked in tandem with it and kept the civic body informed of their work schedule so as to ensure minimum disruption in water supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/service-providers-work-disrupts-water-supply-in-some-areas/article33018205.ece

04 November 2020||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Maize crop comes under Fall Army worm attack in Dindigul district||Athoor region farmers, who have raised maize in over 2,000 acres, have suffered a total loss of their crop due to Fall Army worm attack. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, one of the farmers, Radhakrishnan from S. Paraipatti, said farmers in that region were traditionally raising maize crop. Though agriculture officials encouraged the farmers to increase crop coverage, they could not resolve pest and insect attacks of the crops. The Fall Army worm attack had been a recent irritant. “Though we took up the issue with officials, they promised all assistance, but never visited our area and inspected the damaged crops,” Mayappan from S Paraipatti said. The farmers said they even stayed indoors and escaped from the COVID-19 pandemic, but they could not save the crops which was fit only for giving as fodder to grazing animals. The woes of farmers in Seevalseeragu was still worse. While the crops suffered partial damage to the Fall Army worm attack, the crops had withered due to lack of rains. The standing crops, which were sown in July-August, had completely turned black, signalling that the plants had withered, Muthukannan of Akkaraipatti said. Progressive farmer Radhakrishnan, who has raised maize in 30 acres, had similar woes. He said that he had spent almost Rs. 35,000 per acre over the last 100 days. “Today, they are gone,” he said and recalled the paltry sum they used to get from insurance companies. He said the government should bring experts to this belt and show how to counter the Fall Army worm attack. Also, insurance companies should be sensitised to be liberal and fast in settling claims. They should not look at the farmers with an element of suspicion, he said. Joint Director of Agriculture Pandidurai said that last year also the issue cropped up. Maize crops raised in Palani and Oddanchathiram belts were hit due to drought. The complaint that Fall Army worm attack had damaged 2,000 acres in Athur belt was not true. A team of officials would inspect the region in the next two to three days for an on-the-spot assessment, he said. The Assistant Director said they had inspected the fields twice along with scientists from Krishi Vigyan Kendra and Vagarai Maize Research Station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fall-army-worms-attack-maize-fields/article33017721.ece

The police have planned to organise an awareness-cum-surrender campaign in the villages in Kalvarayan Hills situated in the Eastern Ghats as part of the rehabilitation programme. “Though illicit distillation of arrack has been controlled to a large extent in the hills, a few hamlets have been still persisting with the practice. The rehabilitation programme will now ensure financial assistance to prohibition offenders to wean them away from taking to distillation and smuggling,” Superintendent of Police Ziaul Haque said. The rehabilitation programme will also cover former and repeat offenders. The Police Department is preparing a list of offenders and the list would be forwarded to the Collector, he said. The Prohibition Enforcement Wing (PEW) has registered 265 cases and arrested 241 offenders for distillation and smuggling of arrack and fermented wash. About 9,935 litres of illicit distilled arrack, 95,110 litres of fermented wash and 630 litres of rectified spirit were seized in surprise raids conducted in the hills so far. Undertaking Mr. Haque said that the offenders who would be covered under the rehabilitation scheme would have to give an undertaking and execute bonds promising good behaviour under Section 110 of Code of Criminal Procedure. The Department would also be doing a follow up to ensure that the person does not step back into the world of crime. Vigilance has also been stepped up along prohibition check posts set up on major inter-district routes to prevent distillation and smuggling of arrack.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rehabilitation-programme-for-prohibition-offenders/article33018409.ece

04 November 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||T.N. considering regulating online games, says AAG||In the wake of half-a-dozen people in Tamil Nadu ending their lives in recent days after falling into a debt trap due to online gambling, Additional Advocate General (AAG) M. Sricharan Rangarajan on Tuesday informed the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that the State government was actively considering regulating such online games. The latest victims of online gambling were two men in Coimbatore. Taking serious note of people, especially youngsters, killing themselves over debt linked to online rummy and similar games, the court called for appropriate steps to regulate such games. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi ordered notices to the Centre and the State government on a batch of public interest litigation petitions filed in this regard. The court also ordered notices to cricketer Virat Kohli, former cricketer Sourav Ganguly and actors Prakash Raj, Tamannaah Bhatia, Rana Daggubati and Sudeep, who had endorsed online games in advertisements. Seeking a response from the governments on the steps taken so far, the judges adjourned the hearing of the case to November 19. Referring to an order passed by Justice Pugalendhi in July on the need to regulate online games like rummy, Justice Kirubakaran reiterated that legislation was required to regulate such games. The judge asked the State government if any steps had been initiated to pass relevant legislation. Agreeing with the judge, Mr. Rangarajan submitted that online games involving gambling and betting had turned into a menace, and the State government was actively considering regulating them. He sought time to get instructions in this regard. The judge pointed out that Assam, Odisha, Nagaland, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh had either banned or were regulating online games, particularly those that involved gambling. A similar issue had been raised before the Gujarat High Court, and the court had directed the government to deal with it appropriately, the judge noted. Justice Pugalendhi had, in July, asked the State government to consider passing suitable legislation to regulate and control online gaming, taking note of the fact that these games were mushrooming and advertisements on social media were aimed at inducing unemployed youth into playing these games. Two die The Coimbatore police said P. Jayachandran of Machampalayam, who was employed at an industrial unit, ended his life after racking up debt due to an addiction to online gambling. He had also incurred medical expenditure recently. Likewise, 28-year-old S. Jeevanantham, from Thondamuthur, who was engaged in sales and servicing of computers and peripherals, committed suicide after losing money in online gambling. [Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State’s health helpline 104 and Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.]  (With inputs from Wilson Thomas in Coimbatore)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-considering-regulating-online-games-says-aag/article33017680.ece
04 November 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||PIL plea filed against release of ‘Irandam Kuththu’||In order to ascertain the mechanism involved in curbing obscene content, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Tuesday ordered notice to the Centre and the State on a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to forbear the release of the Tamil movie ‘ Irandam Kuththu’ . The teaser of the film has already drawn flak from various sections. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi also suo motu impleaded the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in the petition filed by the Madurai-based Samuganeedhi Kalvi Panpattu Maiyam, represented by its secretary S. Perumal who also sought a direction to take down the teaser of the film from platforms like YouTube. The petitioner pointed out that ‘ Irandam Kuththu’, the second part of the controversial yet well received movie ‘ Iruttu Arayil Murattu Kuththu, ’ had many objectionable scenes and dialogues as can be seen in the teaser of the movie showing women in poor light. The movie is to be released at a time when there is an increasing number of cases of sexual violence against women, he said. Vulgarity In the name of content, the movie was propagating vulgarity and obscenity and media was being misused for the purpose of commercial benefit. This will leave a wrong impression in the minds of youngsters. The seed should be nipped in the bud and the posters and the teaser of the movie should be taken down in the interest of society, he said. The case was adjourned for further hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pil-plea-filed-against-release-of-irandam-kuththu/article33018298.ece
04 November 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Implement wage hike’||Over 100 panchayat workers affiliated with the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) staged a demonstration and petitioned the Collector here on Tuesday, urging the district administration to implement the wage hike announced by the government. The protesters included overhead tank operators and conservancy workers of the village panchayats in the district. K. Thangavel Pandian, a protester, said that the wage hike issued for the overhead tank operators and conservancy workers was not implemented across the district. “The workers toiled for long hours every day to help in containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. But, they earn a pittance as wages every month,” he said. The protesters also demanded the district administration to pay one month's salary as bonus for Deepavali festival. They urged the district administration to settle the arrears of the workers before Deepavali. The workers who were paid salary on a time scale basis must be given pension and gratuity after their retirement above 60 years, demanded the protesters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/implement-wage-hike/article33018304.ece
04 November 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||HC comes to the rescue of bereaved man||Coming to the relief of a bereaved man, Justice G.R. Swaminathan of the Madras High Court not only treated the mail sent by him to the Registrar (Judicial) seeking compensation for the death of his son as a writ petition, but also made a spot inspection to the site of occurrence to ascertain facts and ensure speedy justice to the family. G. Sendhattikalaipandian of Alangulam in Virudhunagar district wrote the letter to the Registrar (Judicial) seeking compensation from the State for the death of his son who came in contact with a live wire. The youth, Saravanan was pursuing Postgraduation in Journalism. “Did not Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer treat letters as writ petitions?”, Justice Swaminathan asked, adding he did not have the heart to tell the father to consult a lawyer and file a writ petition before the HC or file a suit for compensation before a civil court. In order to satisfy his conscience, the judge had made a spot inspection. After ascertaining the facts, the judge said on an overall consideration of the circumstances, the tragedy was purely an Act of God and Tangedco could not be fastened with any negligence as such. However, applying the principle of ‘Strict Liability’, the judge ordered a compensation of Rs. 8.86 lakh to be paid in addition to Rs. 5 lakh already paid to the family. The judge said he was of the view that Tangedco should offer the job of Junior Assistant to the second son of the petitioner, S. Bharathi, who had necessary qualification. Tangedco must ensure that such accidents did not occur in future and undertake a comprehensive safety audit. Bushes underneath electric poles and transmission lines could be cleared. They could announce cash prizes for young scientists to come out with ideas on how to make the feeder trip automatically, once the line was snapped, he said. The judge pointed out what was originally a government department became a statutory board and now metamorphosed into a corporation. While the form had changed, the situation on ground remained the same. The time had come to administer shock to the system. One looked forward to the day when Tangedco would be a profitable enterprise maintaining the highest safety standards, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-comes-to-the-rescue-of-bereaved-man/article33017714.ece

04 November 2020||NAGERCOIL,TAMIL NADU||‘Wrong design causes fatal accidents at fishing harbour’||Following repeated fatal mishaps at the entrance/exit point of Thengaipattinam fishing harbour, thousands of fishermen from eight villages in western Kanniyakumari district launched an indefinite strike on Tuesday demanding the restructuring of the fishing harbour To highlight their demand, the striking fishermen staged a dharna at Chinnathurai village on Tuesday. They say the design of the Thengaipattinam fishing harbour itself was faulty and sand gets accumulated in the nearby estuary caused the mishaps. “The officials, without discussing with the local fishermen about the ‘sea pattern,’ had established the harbour. The sea is usually rough on the Kanniyakumari west coast, more so during monsoons. It should have been taken into account while designing the harbour,” said Sunil Sabariyar of Vallavilai on the Kerala border. It is where 53-year-old Jesudasan lost his life last week when his boat was capsized in a giant wave at the exit point of the harbour. Mr. Sunil says tidal velocity during various months, depth of the sea, sea erosion, nearby estuary, experiences of local fishermen - these were all factors that should have been taken into consideration before designing the harbour. An M.Tech. degree holder, he said the small granite stones were used for constructing the breakwater instead of laying huge rocks there to neutralise the giant waves. “The breakwater, which is constructed to ensure a camp sea inside the harbour throughout the year, has failed to serve the purpose as the groynes were very close to the harbour. So, the waves capsized the boats entering or exiting the harbour, leading to loss of lives. The breakwater should be extended by another 500 metres from the Thengaipattinam shoreline for neutralising the waves and ensuring calm inside the harbour,” he said. The fishermen also said dredging of sand, getting accumulated in this ‘danger zone’ due to rough seas and the nearby estuary, would not be a solution as sand removed from the accumulated areas would get filled up in no time due to the wave pattern. “So, the government, besides restructuring the breakwater and the fishing harbour, should provide a lasting solution to sand getting accumulated in this accident-prone zone and inside the harbour by stationing a dredger,” the fishermen said. The fishermen, demanding shifting of Parakkani check dam to some other place as it was facilitating sand accumulation, complained that they had witnessed the loss of 24 fishermen in the mishaps at the Thengaipattinam fishing harbour entry / exit point since 2014 – four fatal accidents in the past five months.

04 November 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Theatre group works on new play during lockdown||The Adishakti theatre group is working on a new play that will seek to re-evaluate rape and the politics of power. The main reference points of the production are the story of the Araja character in the Mahabharatha and the deconstruction of the Dandakaranyam episode by acclaimed Malayalam litterateur Sarah Joseph’s play, “Bhoomirakshasam” (Demonic Land). “The play is a broad recreation of the original. Of course, we have taken the creative liberty to develop the script to suit our dialectics,” said Vinay Kumar, Adishakti Artistic Director. The brief, but poignant, story of Araja (or Ara), the daughter of sage Shukracharya, which is deconstructed in Sarah Joseph’s work, interlocks with the central theme of Adishakti’s play on the power dynamics behind rape. “We hope to keep the title of our play eponymous, but that is to be decided later,” he added. In the episode from the epic, Araja is living with her father in the forests. Once, the king Danda passes by during a hunting foray and on seeing the beautiful adolescent lusts for her, but she spurns his advances. Burning with slight, fury and lust, the king rapes the young woman. In another unjust occurrence, the entire kingdom burns down and is reduced to a wasteland for the act of its king on the curse of an incensed Shukracharya. Rehearsals for the production, which will prominently feature music, have been apace over the six months of varying degrees of lockdown. This would also be Adishakti’s first creative venture after ‘Bali’ (2018) written and directed by Nimmy Raphel, which was a retelling of the various events leading up to the battle between Bali and Rama, and eventually, the former’s death. The play will also interrogate the crime-punishment binary that often characterises the narrative around rape. “A binary approach usually reflects extreme positions, including punitiveness of the opinionators who are disconnected from the incident, whereas the predicament of the survivor lies in between these ends and involves much more complex sweep of issues,” Vinay Kumar also said. For the group of seven theatre artistes featuring in the production, the lockdown period had its benefits as well the flip side. While much of the creative processes going into the theatrical production benefited from fewer distractions during the lockdown, the flip side was that in the absence of support staff, the upkeep routine of the campus had to be shouldered by the artistes themselves. Reflective phase “This lockdown period has been quite reflective for us as a theatre group,” said Ashiqa Salvan, artiste. Though theatre groups across the country were turning towards online modes of showcasing their works, due to lack of opportunities and initiations to perform live to an audience, Adishakti preferred to keep the art form intact and intend to continue to make possibilities to perform in front of a live audience. “For seven months straight the team has been living and working together in lockdown. Our campus was quarantined and our office was closed. But the work was still happening,” she said. Meanwhile, registration is full for Adishakti’s flagship, ‘Source of Performance Energy’ residential training session scheduled for December, and it includes a few of the finest artistes from film and theatre. Some time in January, a near-final theatrical version is to be staged for a select audience for feedback. Adishakti hopes to premiere the play during the 2021 edition of the Remembering Veenapani Chawla theatre festival, an annual homage to its founder, that had to be cancelled this year because of the pandemic. “Come April, we are intent on holding the festival even if it means a socially distanced audience and complying with a range of other SOPs,” Vinay Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/theatre-group-works-on-new-play-during-lockdown/article33018417.ece

Despite several representations made in the past to the authorities concerned and the Collector, the hospital’s functioning had been far from satisfactory, the members charged. Speaking to reporters, CITU district secretary M Sivaji said medicines were not available on many occasions in the hospital. The staff directed poor patients to buy them from pharmacies. Similarly, some staff sent in-patients to private hospitals and took commission for the reference. Citing lack of trained personnel and absence of senior doctors, patients were coerced by the staff to go to private scan centres for quick examination. The technicians claimed that the machines were not working due to poor upkeep, while it was not so. Likewise, the government should transfer staff who had served here for long years to other GHs as it would not only prevent corruption, but also facilitate smooth functioning of the hospital, Mr. Sivaji said and urged the GH authorities should not refer COVID-19 patients to private hospitals since they could not afford the costly treatment there. When the government claimed that they had state-of-the-art facilities in the hospitals and infrastructure, there was no need to refer patients, especially, poor patients, to private hospitals or scan centres, which ripped them. Recently, a patient was informed that he tested positive for COVID-19 by a private hospital, while the test results from the GH showed negative. Police should book a criminal case against such private nursing homes, Mr. Sivaji said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/probe-irregularities-in-hospital-citu/article33017717.ece

04 November 2020||Sivakasi,TAMIL NADU||MP says Rajasthan must reconsider ban on sale of fireworks||While the upcoming festive season gave some hope to lakh of employees of Sivakasi-based fireworks industry that was hit by COVID-19 pandemic, the ban by Rajasthan government on fireworks has again put the industry under threat, said Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore. In a memorandum sent to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Mr. Tagore said the fireworks industry employed around six lakh employees in 780 micro, small and medium enterprises, established under the ‘One district, One product’ initiative of the erstwhile Congress government. “It is our duty as true representatives of an aspirational India and its medium-small scale manufacturers to safeguard their interests and livelihood,” the Congress MP said. Stating that the fireworks industry had undergone phenomenal changes following Supreme Court order and new chemical ingredients developed in consultation with CSIR-NEERI had reduced emissions and produced no poisonous gases. “The emission of other gases is within the standard limits prescribed by National Ambient Air Quality Standards. No Sulphur is used in manufacture of light emitting fireworks products which remove the possibility of production of Sulphur di-oxide gas, the primary pollutant in question,” he said. Mr. Tagore said the fireworks released only nitrogen gas which was a major constituent of natural air and was harmless. Reduced usage of Barium Nitrate resulted in a reduced emission of upto 30% in the light emitting fireworks, hence it was environment-friendly, he said. Stating that Sivakasi was producing only such green crackers, the MP said that what should be banned was only the cheap and fake Chinese crackers that were illegally imported and sold as indigenous crackers. “The recent decision to ban sale of fireworks in view of COVID-19 crisis is discretionary and regressive without a sound scientific study. COVID-19 is transmitted by air and is not known to suspend beyond the normal range of minimum social distance or suspend with fireworks emission,” Mr. Tagore said. The ban would send a negative message and create paranoia against Indian fireworks and destroy the industry. Stating that many small-time traders across Rajasthan had already procured stocks by taking loans from financial and non-financial institutions, he said that ban on fireworks in the present circumstances would drive them into bankruptcy.  Only the cheap and fake Chinese crackers, illegally imported and sold as indigenous crackers, must be banned B.

Police said a constable, Jaffer Sathik, attached to Tiruthangal police station, had constructed a house on Kamarajar Salai near Sivakasi railway station. In order to convert the temporary electricity connection into permanent connection, he required the property tax receipt. When he approached the Revenue Assistant for processing his application, he had initially sought Rs. 20,000 as bribe. However, he brought down the demand to Rs. 15,000 and then to Rs. 10,000. Sathik, who did not want to pay the bribe money, lodged a complaint with the DVAC unit in Virudhunagar. A team of sleuths led by Inspector of Police Vimala laid a trap and arrested Karthikeyan when he accepted the money at the newly-constructed house.

04 November 2020||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||BJP man hacked to death over enmity||Tension prevails at Thenthirupperai near Srivaikundam in the district after a farmer, who joined the BJP recently, was murdered due to previous enmity on Tuesday morning. Police, who have picked up six persons, including a teenage boy, in connection with the murder, categorically maintained that the murder was due to previous enmity and did not have any political or religious angle. They said farmer Ramaiya Das (56) of Thenthirupperai had been posted as Thoothukudi district secretary of party’s traders’ wing. When the goats of one Marimuthu from the same area reportedly grazed in his farm 20 days ago, Ramaiya Das warned him that any recurrence of the incident would have serious consequences. Against this backdrop, Ramaiya Das was hacked to death allegedly by Marimuthu’s 18-year-old son, when he was in an eatery in Thenthirupperai. Alwarthirunagari police sent the body of Ramaiya Das to Government Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital for a post-mortem. Demanding the arrest of the assailant and seeking compensation for the murder of Ramaiya Das, his relatives blocked Tirunelveli-Tiruchendur Highway. Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar and Tiruchendur Revenue Divisional Officer D. Dhanapriya assured the protesters that the accused would be arrested soon and their demand for compensation would be forwarded to the government. Meanwhile, a group of people, carrying clubs and lethal weapons, damaged a few bikes parked in front of the houses of Marimuthu’s son and relatives in Thenthirupperai and set them afire. They also smashed a couple of cars. However, no one was arrested in connection with the incident.

04 November 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Hospitality industry in dire straits||Two months have passed since the State government granted nod for the hospitality sector to resume business after being closed for more than five months following the imposition of nationwide lockdown since March 23. Most of the hotels, resorts, homestays and lodges were reopened on September 1. But, the hospitality sector is yet to pick up steam. Expecting a turnaround, most of the online travel agencies as well as tour and travel agents resumed booking from September. There are about 120 hotels in Tiruchi providing employment to nearly 1,000 persons. Nearly 40% of them are located in Central bus stand and Chathiram bus stand areas. Remaining hotels are scattered in different parts of the city including Srirangam. Unlike in the past, when tourists walked into hotels to book a room, online booking has become a norm in the hospitality sector now. Nearly 60% of rooms are booked online. To attract travellers and tourists, the hotels have slashed their tariff by 60% to 70%. Yet, the occupancy rate continues to hover around 30% in majority of hotels. Some hoteliers say that the occupancy rate in October has gone up by 10 % when compared to September. “We have noted a slight increase in occupancy rate in October. But, we miss the foreign travellers particularly from Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka,” says T.V. Prabu of Hotel High Point in Tiruchi. Hoteliers point out that though the fear of contracting COVID-19 virus has subsided to an extent, there is still no substantial increase in business, pilgrims and corporate travellers. The companies that usually conduct dealers or agent meets continue to avoid such meetings. Similarly, clubs and forums have also not shown interest to book hotels for weekly and monthly gatherings. Mr. Prabu added that operation of full-fledged train services from other States and resumption of flight services to Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka and other middle east countries were need of the hour to revive the hospitality industry. S.A. Mubashir, Joint Secretary, Tiruchi Tourism Federation, said that every hotel had taken extra care in implementing safety standards. Business could pick up henceforth as the footfall of pilgrims and corporate travellers are expected to increase in the weeks to come, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hospitality-industry-in-dire-straits/article33017692.ece

04 November 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Over 700 hectares of invasive weeds being removed in MTR||Invasive weeds over 700 hectares of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) are being removed by the forest department. The removal of invasive weeds, that have taken over the vast majority of the reserve is an annual exercise carried out by the forest department. Due to the extensive spread of the weeds within the tiger reserve, small patches of forest are cleared each year in both the core and buffer zones. According to S. Senbagapriya, Deputy Director of MTR (Core Area), invasive weeds, including Lantana camara and other species are being cleared in around 300 hectares of the core area of the tiger reserve, mostly around the areas where eco-tourism activities are conducted and also by the side of major roads cutting through the reserve. Ms. Senbagapriya said that the weeds are being cleared for around 30 meters along each side of the road in areas where eco-tourism is allowed, including Circle Road, Sand Road, Ponnyangiri, Link Road and the stretch between Mudumalai and the Kakkanallah check post. In the buffer zone of the reserve, invasive weeds are being cleared in around 250 hectares, while a further 200 hectares that were already cleared last year would be maintained, with fresh growth being removed this year as well. L.C.S. Srikanth, Deputy Director of MTR (buffer zone), said that apart from the Lantana camara, Eupatorium and Parthenium species, the buffer zone also home to certain other invasive flora, such as the Opuntia stricta , a type of cactus, as well as Prosopis juliflora, commonly known as seemai karuvelam , which has spread across the Thengumarahada region along the Moyar valley. Mr. Srikanth said that with funds from ‘Project Tiger’ and the Special Area Development Programme, more than 250 hectares of invasive plants would be cleared this year, while 200 hectares which were cleared last year would be once again maintained, with fresh growth being uprooted. Field Director of MTR, K.K.Kaushal, said that invasive wattle trees are being removed in around 100 hectares of the Mukurthi National Park as well. However, despite the yearly removal, invasive species continue to spread throughout both Mukurthi National Park and MTR, said forest department officials. “Despite our continued efforts each year, the growth of plants like Lantana camara is extremely quick, and when a portion of it is cleared, it manages to grow back again before the next year. So it is a constant battle, and one that cannot be won except if taken on in a large scale,” said Mr. Kaushal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-700-hectares-of-invasive-weeds-being-removed-in-mtr/article33018208.ece
04 November 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Reduce use of products packed in plastic, says NGO||Clean Coonoor, the NGO that runs the waste management facility in Coonoor has appealed to the public to reduce the use of products packed in plastic. P.J. Vasanthan, trustee of Clean Coonoor, which runs the facility with the assistance of the Coonoor Municipality, said that since the facility was inaugurated last year by Nilgiris Collector J. Innocent Divya, the mixed stream processing facility had processed more than 8.7 lakh kg of municipal solid waste, of which 3.23 lakh kg was recycled and the rest safely disposed as per Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board norms. However, Mr. Vasanthan said, consumer awareness was the need of the hour as low-value plastics continued to comprise the bulk of the recyclable waste handled at the facility. “Around 1.32 lakh kg, representing nearly 40% of the total waste handled at the facility, is plastic. Nearly 80% of the plastic waste is of low value, which can only be disposed of by tertiary and quaternary recycling methods, which are not readily available everywhere,” he said. Samantha Iyanna, managing trustee of Clean Coonoor, appealed to the public to minimise the use of products with unnecessary plastic packaging that were hazardous. Shunning these could go a long way in tackling the menace of plastic pollution in the district. “Clean Coonoor is trying to set up a pyrolysis plant, and has also worked out an action plan, which will help to dispose the nearly five-tonne load of plastic that is being generated on a daily basis within this district,” a statement from Clean Coonoor said. With the waste management park being operational for a year, Clean Coonoor thanked the Coonoor Municipality officials and the staff for their assistance in keeping Coonoor litter-free.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reduce-use-of-products-packed-in-plastic-says-ngo/article33018206.ece

This is the second human fatality resulting from human-elephant conflict in the division in the last one week, and the fourth this year so far. Forest department officials identified the deceased as K. Balusamy, a resident of Upper Gandhinagar located near the Manjushree estate in O-Valley, Gudalur.

The forest department had issued warnings to local residents to stay inside their homes on Monday night, with field staff making announcements using microphones that an elephant was spotted in the vicinity where the incident occurred.

Referring to an order passed by Justice Pugalendhi in July on the need to regulate online games like rummy, Justice Kirubakaran reiterated that legislation was required to regulate such games. The judge asked the State government if any steps had been initiated to pass relevant legislation. Agreeing with the judge, Mr. Rangarajan submitted that online games involving gambling and betting had turned into a menace, and the State government was actively considering regulating them. He sought time to get instructions in this regard. The judge pointed out that Assam, Odisha, Nagaland, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh had either banned or were regulating online games, particularly those that involved gambling. A similar issue had been raised before the Gujarat High Court, and the court had directed the government to deal with it appropriately, the judge noted. Justice Pugalendhi had, in July, asked the State government to consider passing suitable legislation to regulate and control online gaming, taking note of the fact that these games were mushrooming and advertisements on social media were aimed at inducing unemployed youth into playing these games.  The Coimbatore police said P. Jayachandran of Machampalayam, who was employed at an industrial unit, ended his life after racking up debt due to an addiction to online gambling. He had also incurred medical expenditure recently. Likewise, 28-year-old S. Jeevanantham, from Thondamuthur, who was engaged in sales and servicing of computers and peripherals, committed suicide after losing money in online gambling.

04 November 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||GRAKOOS members take out rally||Members of the Grameena Koolikarara Sangha (GRAKOOS) took out a rally in Belagavi on Tuesday seeking effective implementation of MGNREGA scheme across the State. They sat in dharna for some time at Rani Channamma Circle and from there walked to the Deputy Commissioner’s office holding placards. Their demands include increasing the mandatory days of employment under MGNREGA scheme to 200 days a year and immediate payment of wage arrears. They also demanded that the Union and State governments provide five kilogrammes of additional foodgrains for another six months. This is because the lock down has severely affected rural areas where the poor are having a difficult time in feeding their families. Added to this is the losses suffered due to floods and heavy rain. The landless poor need the government to support them at this crucial time, they said. They warned of a State-wide agitation if their demands are not met.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/grakoos-members-take-out-rally/article33017782.ece
04 November 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||DCC Bank polls bring about a rare camaraderie in Belagavi||One of the few things that the elections to the District Central Cooperative Bank has achieved is to bring Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi and his old political rivals, the Katti brothers and the Jarkiholi brothers together, at least outwardly. District in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi was seldom seen with Mr. Savadi in government or party events, since he joined the BJP last year. But they held a joint press conference in Belagavi on Saturday to declare that they were supporting Arvind Patil, MES leader and former MLA, against Anjali Nimbalkar, Congress MLA, in their fight for the directorship of the DCC Bank. Mr. Savadi said that they had all decided to forget all bitterness and differences of the past and come together for the development of the district and welfare of farmers. Both the leaders clarified, more than once, that the polls were non-political, but they were working towards an unanimous election for the sake of political harmony in the district. They also said that they were confident of unopposed elections to 13 of the 16 seats in the bank’s board. “We are having contests only in Khanapur, Ramdurg and the wool and silk sectoral constituency, where there are multiple candidates. Polling is only a formality. We are confident that our candidates will win from there too,’’ Mr. Savadi said. The two leaders have not been on friendly terms in the recent decades. In 2015, it was said that the Jarkiholis, despite being in the Congress, had backed the candidature of Ramesh Katti, the former MP and BJP leader, in his bid to assume the chairmanship of the DCC Bank. The former Minister Umesh Katti threw his weight behind his brother Ramesh Katti to see that Mr. Savadi lost by one vote. The Katti brothers seemed to be in rare agreement with Mr. Savadi over his choice of the candidate for Khanapur. Mr. Arvind Patil is a known loyalist of Mr. Savadi and had faced opposition from the Katti clan in earlier elections. Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi announced on Sunday that Mr. Patil was his candidate and that he would be joining the BJP soon. This reveals that the Katti brothers have expressed their acquiescence to Mr. Patil’s candidature. This also meant that MES, which has been rallying around the single agenda of merging Belagavi with Maharashtra, lost one of its longest serving leaders. DCC Bank elections have revealed once again the tacit fraternity of the Jarkiholi brothers who otherwise seem to be quarelling over political issues. Earlier, where there were two months to go for the elections, Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi had declared that he would abide by the decisions taken by his brother Balachandra Jarkiholi and Umesh Katti. He did not say he would accept Mr. Savadi’s nominees. He also asked Mr. Savadi to sacrifice membership of the DCC Bank Board, as he was holding a bigger position [Deputy Chief Minister]. But he came around when Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi decided to support the nominees of Mr. Savadi. The Katti- Jarkiholi formula also included letting KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi field some of his candidates and supporting them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dcc-bank-polls-bring-about-a-rare-camaraderie-in-belagavi/article33017772.ece
04 November 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||From teaching English to selling incense sticks||Samrat Rane uses English, Hindi and Marathi while advertising his incense sticks, standing near Samadevi Galli in Belagavi old city. He starts by saying that he procures them from self-help groups of women and from physically disabled youth in Belagavi and Maharashtra. He speaks about the benefits of meditation and pooja, and soon, he starts sounding philosophical, quoting Buddha and Marathi saints like Tukaram and Namdev. “That comes from force of habit. This is how I taught English to students,” says Mr. Rane. The visually-challenged former teacher has a postgraduate degree in English from a university in Maharashtra. Samarthanam Trust, an NGO, had employed him to teach English to visually challenged children. But he was laid off during the lockdown. “I had to pay rent and feed my family. But I could not go back to Maharashtra. I had to look for some means of livelihood. Some friends helped me get in touch with some women and some disabled youth who made incense sticks. I became a vendor. Sometimes, people stop just to listen to me speak. That makes me happy,” he said. Pushkar Bumb, a young entrepreneur, says such people need to be encouraged. “I not only buy from him, but also refer his products to my friends,” Mr. Bumb said. Mr. Rane is one among many who had to switch professions due to the extended lockdown. Supplying vegetables Lagamanna Balur was a foreman in a factory in Udyambag in Belagavi. He was laid off and no one would hire him. He spoke to the wholesaler who supplied vegetables to the factory. “He agreed to give me a few bags of vegetable on credit and I began selling them on my bike door to door,” he said. A few months later, he got a shop on rent in Rani Channamma Nagar. Now he sells vegetables, fruits, milk and sweets.  E-governance services Sarala Satpute was a journalist with a local Kannada daily. She was relieved during the lockdown. Her husband Sagar Satpute, a weaver, had to sell his loom after suffering heavy losses. The couple got a shop on rent in Janata chowk in Wadagaon to provide e-governance services. “I had to pass the licensing examination to set up a Grahaka Seva Kendra (Common Service Centre) under the digital India project. I help poor people get benefits of Central and State government schemes,” says Ms. Satpute. Her Siddarth CSC centre in Teggina Galli has also become a place for the weavers of Shahapur and Wadagon to sit and discuss issues plaguing them. Selling masks Ramachandra Chulaki had bought an autorickshaw after taking a bank loan. But the strict lockdown meant that he could not get rides for more than a month. “I began to see advertisements asking people to wear masks. But I knew that there was no way people could go out and buy masks. So my wife and I began stitching masks at home, with my children helping us out. I began riding the autorickshaw around the city selling them. When some policemen stopped me, I gave them some masks free,” he said. Now, he stops his vehicle laden with masks at a busy street and sells them. “I have divided masks based on age groups, as young people do not buy masks meant for the old,” he said. On occasions, he has door delivered masks to senior citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/from-teaching-english-to-selling-incense-sticks/article33017795.ece

04 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Stark divide in polling between middle-class and poor pockets||The overall voter turnout in R.R. Nagar Assembly constituency on Tuesday was low, at 45.24%. However, there was a clear divide between the turnout in middle-class residential pockets and lower-income areas, with the latter being significantly higher. This has set off calculations among political parties on who is likely to have benefited. The lack of enthusiasm among middle-class voters was compounded by COVID-19 fears and the fact that Tuesday was a workday. Several polling booths in the middle-class pockets of Nagarabhavi, R.R. Nagar, and Jnanabharati recorded less than 30% turnout by the end of the day. While the turnout in lower-income pockets such as Hegganahalli and Laggere remained lower than that in the general elections, it was significantly higher than the turnout in their posh residential counterparts. By afternoon, most of the polling booths in Laggere had long lines of women, maintaining social distance and waiting to cast their votes. ‘New normal’ voting Voters had to compulsorily wear masks, were thermally screened, and given gloves before voting. Those who turned up without masks were fined by the police, but given masks and allowed to vote. A senior polling official said there were very few such cases. In some polling booths, the thermal scanners malfunctioned, raising concerns among the polling agents. A polling officer said, “I will know if there were any problems only a week later.” Given that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and theCongress ran a pitched campaign, the police had anticipated trouble and were present in large numbers. “The polling went off peacefully, without any untoward incident,” said City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant. There were a few verbal duels between workers of different parties, but none went out of hand. At a polling booth in Nagarabhavi, Congress workers took objection to a securityperson wearing a saffron mask and BJP agents sitting near the booth wearing saffron T-shirts. While the police got the security person to replace the mask, the BJP workers stood their ground, given that their T-shirtsdid not display the party flag or symbol. Waiting for ‘gifts’ In two instances, Janata Dal (Secular) and Congress workers alleged that the BJP was distributing money to voters and lodged complaints. While JD(S) candidate Krishnamurthy alleged that BJP workers were distributing money near a polling booth in Sumanahalli, Congress workers alleged that voters in Yeshwantpur ward were queueing up at the residence of former councillor G.K. Venkatesh to receive a “gift”. The BJP denied bothallegations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/stark-divide-in-polling-between-middle-class-and-poor-pockets/article33018152.ece
04 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Primary contacts per patient highest in Ramanagaram, lowest in Bengaluru Rural||Over the past two weeks, 2.71 lakh primary and an almost equal number of secondary contacts have been traced across the State. This is nearly half of what had been traced in a two-week period prior to September 3, when 4.9 lakh primary and 4.3 lakh secondary contacts were traced. While officials said that the total number of contacts would reduce with a declining caseload, experts said contact tracing is very difficult at this stage of the pandemic. Although Karnataka had won appreciation from the Centre for its robust contact tracing efforts in the initial few months, authorities have been struggling to keep the exercise going at the same pace. Till early July, the State was tracing an average of 47 contacts per patient. A district-wise analysis of the primary contacts per patient in the seven days prior to November 2 shows that Ramanagaram has reported the highest number of primary contacts, with an average of 14 per patient. While Mandya and Dharwad have an average of 11 and 10 primary contacts per patient respectively, Dakshina Kannada, Shivamogga and Chickballapur have an average of nine primary contacts per patient. At the bottom are Bengaluru Rural and Belagavi who have just three primary contacts per patient. Bengaluru Urban, which is reporting the highest number of positive cases in the State, on an average has four primary contacts per patient. Haveri and Chikkamagaluru also have a similar number. When it comes to both primary and secondary contacts put together, Mandya has the highest number at 27 followed by Ramanagaram at 26 contacts. While Bengaluru Rural is the lowest in this category too with five contacts per patient, Bengaluru Urban has nine contacts per patient. Asserting the importance of contact tracing, which is vital to break the transmission chain, public health experts said identifying the vulnerable population including those with comorbidities, ILI and SARI is what is needed at this juncture when the virus is spreading extensively. ILI surveys Giridhara R. Babu, member, State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said contact tracing is very difficult at this stage of the pandemic, given the lack of manpower in urban areas such as Bengaluru. “What we need now are ILI surveys at the population level. Such surveys are more important than contact tracing now during the extensive spread,” he said. Munish Moudgil, who heads the State’s COVID-19 War Room, admitted that contact tracing needs to improve in the State. “Contact tracing is not upto the mark as patients are not cooperative in general in giving us their contacts. Also, our staff involved should improve their efforts,” he said. On ILI surveys, Mr. Moudgil said one such survey was done in April covering 1.5 crore households. “But that is not of much help as most ILI patients recover by the time the survey is completed,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/primary-contacts-per-patient-highest-in-ramanagaram-lowest-in-bengaluru-rural/article33017799.ece
04 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||KSPCB cracks the whip on bulk waste generators||Despite Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules 2016 mandating segregation of waste at source and mass sensitisation programmes to be conducted by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), many bulk waste generators in the city are yet to comply with the rules. To tackle this problem and ensure collection of only segregated waste from bulk generators, including commercial establishments, multi-storey buildings, malls and large housing complexes, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), in a directive issued on October 19, asked the civic body to prepare a time-bound action plan for compliance with the rules. It has asked the BBMP to submit an action taken report within 30 days. “...It has come to the notice of the Board that many bulk waste generators under the BBMP limits are not segregating the waste and disposing the mixed waste to the BBMP in violation of the SWM rules,” the KSPCB stated. Srinivasulu, member secretary, KSPCB, told The Hindu that segregation at source by bulk waste generators had been an issue for quite a long time. “Until and unless strict action is taken against them, they will repeatedly violate the rules. “We will, in the near future, also review door-to-door segregation, collection and transportation of waste,” he said, and added that if bulk waste generators segregate waste, the dependency on landfills would drastically reduce. Rs. 23 lakh collected in fines From June 1 to the last week of September this year, BBMP marshals registered 341 complaints regarding non-segregation of waste from bulk waste generators across the city and collected around Rs. 23 lakh in fines. “We are coming down heavily on repeat offenders. In the future, we will take strict action against such violators,” a senior BBMP official said. He added that bulk waste generators generate around 1,500 tons of waste per day and if that is not segregated, it goes to landfills.  We will, in the near future, review door-to-door segregation, collection and transportation of waste Srinivasulu, member secretary, KSPCB||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kspcb-cracks-the-whip-on-bulk-waste-generators/article33018137.ece
04 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Voter turnout in Sira surprises parties||The impressive turnout in Sira has surprised political parties, which were expecting fewer number of people to vote, given the pandemic. Calculations on which party is likely to benefit with this turnout have commenced. Sira reported polling of 84.54% on the day (out of the total 2.15 lakh eligible voters). This is higher than the 2018 election turnout of 84.31%. While over 1.77 lakh voted physically in the booths, 4,821 chose the postal ballot. The initial assessment of political parties was that many people could keep away from the polls as there was a surge in COVID-19 patients in the first week of October, with Sira having the highest number of COVID-19 patients within Tumakuru district. “We are surprised by the turnout. Across all age groups, people have come out and voted. We are still assessing the reasons for this huge turnout,” a Congress leader in Tumakuru said. According to him, many voters in Sira who work in Bengaluru and Tumakuru or other places had returned to their villages ahead of poll day to participate in voting. Political observers believe more women than expected turned up to vote. Of the total 1.05 lakh women voters in the segment, close to 86,000 exercised their franchise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/voter-turnout-in-sira-surprises-parties/article33018156.ece

04 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||42 COVID-19 patients vote donning PPE kits||Polling officers in PPE kits and voters turning up in similar gear... There were scenes reminiscent of sci-fi films at some polling booths in Rajarajeshwarinagar and Sira constituencies on Tuesday. In all, 42 COVID-19 patients — 38 in Sira and four R.R. Nagar — walked into the booths to exercise their franchise with the help of polling officials. Four persons with COVID-19 under home isolation — all men — were brought in ambulances to their respective polling booths in R.R. Nagar. They cast their vote during the last hour of polling. The Election Commission (EC) had identified 148 persons with COVID-19 eligible to vote in the constituency. None of the patients eligible to vote in R.R. Nagar had opted for the postal ballot. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) organised ambulances fetching these persons from their homes and dropping them back. Meanwhile, 12 other patients being treated at various hospitals had also expressed their interest in voting, but doctors advised them against going out, sources said. In Sira, 38 voters with COVID-19, including 16 women, voted, apart from five primary contacts. This apart, election officials had received postal ballots from 105 patients. The poll officials monitoring the temperature of those who came in to vote also identified 17 persons who were running temperature on Tuesday. They were allowed to vote separately. As part of the precautionary measures to ensure safe polling, the EC had thermal scanners and hand sanitisers in every booth, besides providing gloves for the hand used to press the EVM button. The number of polling booths had been increased as the voters per booth was brought down from 1,500 to 1,000 to avoid crowding. Sources in the EC said that the poll expenditure had increased by 50% as the logistics became more complicated. On an average, the EC had spent Rs. 2 crore during the 2018 Assembly elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/42-covid-19-patients-vote-donning-ppe-kits/article33018155.ece

Noticing that masks and gloves used by the patients have to be treated as bio-medical waste as per the norms and that it is important for the BBMP to ensure segregation and disposal of materials used by such patients as per the BMWM Rules, 2016, the Court wanted to know how the BBMP was ensuring implementation of the rules across the city. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar issued the direction during the hearing of PIL petitions related to COVID-19 health management issues. The Guidelines for Handling, Treatment and Disposal of Waste Generated during Treatment/Diagnosis/ Quarantine of COVID-19 Patients, issued by the Central Pollution Control Board has specified how these used materials will have to handled as per BMWM Rules.  Food security Meanwhile, the Bench directed the State government to clarify how it is ensuring food security of children enrolled in anganwadis and students covered under the mid-day meal scheme when the schools and anganwadies have remained closed.

04 November 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||All set for jatra||The Hassan district administration has completed preparations for the 12-day Hasanamba Jatra Mahotsava beginning on November 5. Deputy Commissioner R. Girish and other officers inspected the preparations on Monday evening. The festival attracts lakhs of devotees every year. Hasanamba temple is opened only during this festival. However, this year, devotees will not be allowed to enter the temple due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Girish said the district administration would install LED screens near the temple so that the devotees could watch the programmes being held inside the temple live. “It is difficult to allow devotees inside the temple, as a gathering of a large people at one place could cause the fear of COVID-19 spread.”  The priests and officers will visit the temple to ensure the religious programmes are held.  Elected representatives and other important persons would be allowed to visit the temple on the first and last days of the festival, he said. Superintendent of Police R. Srinivasa Gowda, Additional SP B.N.

04 November 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Continue three-year LL.B course in constituent college, varsity urged||Members of the All India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) have urged Karnatak University to rescind its Academic Council’s decision on discontinuing the three-year LL.B course in its constituent college and continue the course in the interest of students. A delegation of the Dharwad district committee of AIDYO led by president Bhavanishankar and others met Vice-Chancellor of Karnatak University A.M. Gudasi and urged him to revoke the decision of discontinuing the course at Sir Siddappa Kambali Law College, a constituent college of the university. Recently, the Academic Council of the university had taken a decision to discontinue the three-year LL.B course in the Sir Siddappa Kambali Law College, citing lack of basic infrastructure and shortage of law teachers in the college as reason. The delegation told the Vice-Chancellor that since the university’s constituent college was the lone government college in Dharwad district that was offering the law course, discontinuing the course in the college would mean poor students would be deprived of law education. Closure of the course at the government college would also mean that the students would have to cough up more fees to pursue the three-year LL.B course in private colleges, the delegation members said. Mr. Bhavanishankar, AIDYO secretary Hanumesh Huded and students in the delegation urged the Vice-Chancellor to provide the requisite basic infrastructure and appoint required law teachers to continue the three-year law course. Responding to their plea, Prof. Gudasi told the delegation members that a review committee would be set up to look into the issue and advise the university in the matter. Any decision would be taken after the committee’s report, he told the delegation. ‘Golden chance’ Meanwhile, a delegation of All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) met the Registrar (Evaluation) of Karnatak University Ravindranath S. Kadam seeking a “golden chance” for final year students of 2019-20 to clear their pending subjects by conducting another examination for them. District president of AIDSO Mahanthesh Bilur, secretary Ranjit Dhoopad and others urged the Registrar to allow a “golden chance” for such students. Prof. Kadam assured them of placing the matter before the Syndicate meeting for a favourable decision. ABVP protest On Tuesday, students led by ABVP office-bearers staged a demonstration in front of Sir Siddappa Kambali Law College. During the protest, the ABVP office-bearers urged the university authorities to rescind the decision of the Academic Council and continue the three-year LL.B course in the university’s constituent college.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/continue-three-year-llb-course-in-constituent-college-varsity-urged/article33017776.ece
04 November 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘KIADB has suddenly increased land prices at Gamanagatti Industrial Area’||While the State and Union governments were making tall claims about ease of doing business, small and medium enterprises have been left out and, despite being in power, the BJP has failed to address the problems of small entrepreneurs and industrialists, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has said. Addressing presspersons here on Monday, president of the Dharwad district unit of AAP Santosh Naragund, district executive committee member Vikas Soppin and other office-bearers said that while sops were being announced for bigger companies, the basic requirements of small industrialists in the industrial estates were being neglected. “It is ‘cease of doing business’ for the smaller and first generation entrepreneurs,” Mr. Naragund said. He said that while it was natural to see revision to an extent of 10 % to 15 % on the price of industrial plots in industrial estates, Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB), which functioned directly under Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, had issued notices increasing land cost by over Rs. 30 lakh to Rs. 38 lakh per acre of industrial land at Gamanagatti Industrial Area in Hubballi. “Being a government agency, KIADB should at least have an estimate while taking up development of industrial areas. While one could understand an increase in the final cost of industrial plots, KIADB suddenly increased land price for plots allotted almost eight years ago,” he said. “The single window system, as claimed by the government, is non-existent for MSMEs,” he said. Mr. Soppin said that the way the land price had been revised gave room for suspicion that the authorities were trying to help real estate mafia. “Otherwise, there is no logic in the way prices have been revised,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kiadb-has-suddenly-increased-land-prices-at-gamanagatti-industrial-area/article33017774.ece

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||‘Greater Mysuru’ proposal brings MCC’s resources under focus||The proposal to include areas on the outskirts of Mysuru and the revenue pockets in the City under the jurisdiction of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) and upgrade the civic body into “Bruhat Mysuru Mahanagara Palike” or “Greater Mysuru” has brought the MCC’s resources under sharp focus. Though Mysuru MP Pratap Simha had already met Minister for Urban Development B.A. Basaravaj and Minister for Municipal Administration K.C. Narayana Gowda with a representation to include in MCC’s jurisdiction the areas on the outskirts of Mysuru and the revenue pockets in the City, the MCC refused to include a proposal to transfer Alanahalli, Srirampura, Chamundi Hills and Hinkal into the civic body’s jurisdiction as a subject in the agenda of last week’s Council meeting. Responding to calls for adding more areas into MCC’s jurisdiction, former JD(S) corporator K.V. Mallesh sought to know if adequate attention had been paid to MCC’s resources and infrastructure. “Our revenues are barely enough to pay the salaries of pourakarmikas and bear the expenditure incurred on vehicles and phone bills. The civil contractors have boycotted MCC work because the civic body does not have money to clear its bills. How can the MCC bear the burden of additional areas coming under its jurisdiction?”, he sought to know. Most of the new areas proposed to be transferred to MCC are revenue pockets without any civic amenities and residential layouts approved by gram panchayats on the outskirts of the city. Many private layout developers had sold the sites without properly creating underground drainage system, laying roads or providing electricity connections. “The MCC will need a huge amount of money to provide basic amenities including underground drainage system, drinking water supply, roads, street lights, garbage clearance, besides maintaining parks”, Mr. Mallesh said. He said the government should include only areas within the Outer Ring Road in MCC’s jurisdiction while upgrading the other areas on the outskirts of Mysuru into Town Panchayats or Town Municipalities for localised development and decentralisation. This approach will relieve MCC of the additional burden, he said. Meanwhile, Chamundeshwari MLA G.T. Deve Gowda, who was in favour of merging parts of his constituency including Alanahalli, Chamundi Hills, Srirampura and Hinkal in MCC limits, said the civic body’s finances will also improve if the developed areas are brought under its jurisdiction. Additional funds will also come from the State Government and Centre. Special meeting Deputy Mayor C. Sridhar, who was in the chair during last week’s MCC Council meeting, said a special meeting of the MCC Council will be convened after holding a detailed discussion on the issue with MLAs and MLCs, besides other people’s representatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/greater-mysuru-proposal-brings-mccs-resources-under-focus/article33018350.ece

Delay in sanctioning of the project, changes in the plans and alignments, and an increase in guidance value are some of the factors that influenced a steep rise in land acquisition for Phase II of Namma Metro. In the detailed project report (DPR) prepared in 2011, land acquisition for the ongoing 72-km metro line was estimated to cost Rs. 2,300 crore. Fast forward to 2020, the figure has touched Rs. 6,400 crore. BMRCL requires 12.66 lakh square metres of land, most of which it has acquired. While sanctioning the project, it was agreed that the State government would bear the complete cost of land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation (including cost escalation). BMRCL had initially planned to complete the project within six years after the Central government’s final nod, which was given in 2014. However, the deadline to complete all reaches of Phase II has been extended to 2024. An official of the BMRCL said, “The land acquisition for Phase II is almost complete, barring a few properties. In the DPR, it was estimated that Rs. 2,193 crore would be the land cost. Escalation in cost involves various factors that include increase in guidance value, which happens almost every year. In 2018, the State government had given its consent for land acquisition cost up to Rs. 6,293 crore, but now it has touched Rs. 6,400 crore.” Learning from previous mistakes To avoid delay in execution of the project, in Phase II (A and B), which is extending the metro from Silk Board to Kempegowda International Airport (ORR-airport link), the BMRCL is making sure that land is available prior to awarding tenders. For the ORR line from Silk Board to K.R. Puram, the BMRCL has already acquired 59,103 square metres of land at a cost of Rs. 569 crore. For the K.R. Puram to KIA line, it is spending Rs. 2,100 crore for 3.17 lakh square metres of land. “For the ORR line, the entire land identified for the project is already in the possession of the BMRCL,” said the official. From K.R. Puram to KIA, the notification has been issued for all the land identified. According to officials, barring the land required for the construction of a depot and other areas, acquisition has reached an advanced stage. The BMRCL had initiated the process to finalise an alignment to KIA in 2016. In December 2017, the State cabinet had approved extension of the metro from Nagawara to KIA via R.K. Hegde Nagar, but the alignment was changed. In January 2019, the State government approved a plan to extend the metro from K.R. Puram to KIA via Nagawara, Hebbal. The BMRCL is waiting for the final sanction from the Union government for implementing the extended line.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cost-of-land-acquisition-for-phase-ii-of-namma-metro-touches-rs-6400-crore/article33018145.ece

A release said after a relative slowdown during the first four months of the lockdown necessitated due to pandemic, freight loading has picked up in SWR consistently from August 2020 and the zone has steadily loaded over 3.0 million tonnes every month since then. “After the setting up of the Business Development Units (BDU) on SWR both at the zonal and divisional levels in April 2020, the freight loading has picked up. A slew of freight incentive schemes and concessions were announced to give boost to freight loading and attract customers to use Railways as their preferred mode of transport of goods and to bring more and more commodities into the freight basket of Railways’’, the release added. During this financial year, SWR has loaded 19.51 million tonnes of freight up to October 2020. The release said in spite of the restrictions due to the pandemic, SWR has so far loaded 5.035 million tonnes of coal to ensure uninterrupted power generation for the plants in Karnataka. The zone continued to load Hot Rolled Coil Steel from the steel plants and 4.768 million tonnes of steel were loaded till October 2020 during the current financial year. “Despite the lockdown, SWR could load over 10,000 tonnes of foodgrains and maintained the food chain in Karnataka’’, the release added. For the months of September and October 2020, the SWR has surpassed the freight loading target set by the Railway Board and also corresponding figures of last year. During September, the SWR loaded 3.03 million tonnes of freight which is 4.48 per cent higher compared to the corresponding period last year. During October, the loading hit 3.22 million tones which is 8.61 per cent higher than the same period last year. The highlight of this year's freight loading is quantum jump in transportation of automobiles from Doddaballapur, Penukonda, Kadakola, Hosur etc. On an average one rake of New Millennium Goods has been transported from SWR every day of the month during October.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/freight-loading-hits-new-heights-in-swr-zone/article33018348.ece

The incident took place on Tuesday morning and the elephant was returning to the forest when it tried to cross the rail barricade but died in the process. “Based on the preliminary observation it is suspected that the elephant may have stood on the lower railing in its efforts to cross over to the other side and slipped. In the process the elephant may have landed on the parallel beam and suffered a compression in the chest given its huge body and heavy weight’’, said S.R. Natesh, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve. He said when the elephant slipped from the railing, the lower portion between its chest and underbelly took the hit and suffered compression resulting in its suffocation. There was no other physical injury which reinforces the speculation that the tusker suffocated, said Mr. Natesh. This is the second incidence of an elephant suffocating to death trying to cross the rail barricade, the earlier being in Nagarahole 2 years ago. Wedged In June this year, an adult female elephant got wedged between the ground and the lower railing in its attempt to squeeze itself out and was choking. But the local people near Vasthihalla - also near Bandipur- saw the elephant struggling and informed the Forest Department staff who reached the spot and freed the elephant. The State government has taken up barricading of forest boundaries using rail tracks in a bid to prevent elephants from straying into human landscape and to minimise the conflict situation. But the barricade design has come under flak from wildlife activists and experts. They want the height of the barricade to be increased so that it acts as a deterrent to the elephants from trying to cross over. Sources said the barricades laid in the initial stage of the project had a height of 2 metres but it has subsequently been increased. The gap between the two parallel beams is said to be wide which tempts the sub-adult elephants to try to squeeze through which was fraught with danger., as indicated by the tusker's death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tusker-dies-trying-to-cross-rail-barricade/article33018135.ece

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order on a PIL petition filed by C. Gopal, a resident of Shatinagar in Bengaluru. The petitioner had questioned the correctness of the government’s June decision permitting the BTC to conduct betting through online platform sans spectators in the race course in view of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. It has been alleged in the petition that the betting on horse racing, which is at present restricted to only the race course in Bengaluru, will open up betting to the entire society, including rural areas, as people sitting in any location can participate in betting. The petition said that the Chief Minister, without studying the pros and cons of online betting on society at large and on youngsters and rural masses in particular, has approved the proposal for online betting based on a representation by the BTC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/how-was-online-betting-allowed-for-racing/article33018140.ece

The overhead power supply between Maddur and Mysuru failed at 8.15 a.m due to grid failure. Power was restored at 9.12 a.m. Passengers, who had to bear the long delay, vented their ire on social media. ‘Had to send someone’ Divisional Railway Manager (Bengaluru) Ashok Kumar Verma said, “Incoming power supply from grid to Yeliyur sub-station failed in the morning. While restoring power supply, there were some fluctuations. Attempts to supply power from other grids did not happen. We are investigating the reason. Usually, these situations were remotely controlled, but this time we had to send a person from Mandya to Yeliyur to fix the problem, and that took time.” Four trains were affected by the failure: Mysuru-Varanasi (06229), Tuticorin-Mysuru (06235), Kacheguda-Mysuru (02785) and Hubballi-Mysuru (06581).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/power-failure-disrupts-train-services-on-mysuru-line/article33018146.ece

The land of Onam, it is also known for its cultural uniqueness, history and once agricultural prosperity. But various facets of Onattukara and its rich story have been slowly fading into oblivion. Not any more. The history, heritage and agricultural tradition of Onattukara have come alive in a museum set up by the Mavelikara block panchayat on its office premises. Farm practices Onattukara had its own agricultural practices and lifestyle and the same has been revived in the museum. It showcases erstwhile agricultural implements like different types of ploughshares, yoke used to attach animals to plough, equipment used to thresh paddy, mat to dry rice, spades, historical equipment used for measurements, utensils made of clay and brass, lamps, clocks and so on. On the other side of the museum are pettiyum-parayum (a traditional dewatering mechanism), traditional rice bin, grinders made of stone, hand-cart used to transport goods and inland fishing equipment. Murals depicting paddy fields and the Kettukazcha pageant associated with the Kumbha Bharani festival at the Chettikulangara Devi temple are a treat for the eyes. The land The Onattukara region, spread across Karthikapally and Mavelikara taluks in Alappuzha and Karunagapally and parts of Kunnathur taluks in Kollam, was once a flourishing centre of Buddhist culture. A Buddha statue made from stone columns found at the Prayikkara Palace is also installed outside the museum. It was created by sculptor Anil Kattachira. Various other sculptures reveal the history and tradition of the place. “We have preserved 150 things, collected from different parts of the Onattukara region in the museum. A majority of the equipment and materials displayed are not in use at present, which increase its historical value. The museum will help the present and coming generations understand the history of the place better,” says K. Reghu Prasad, president, Mavelikara block panchayat. The panchayat has also arranged an Onattukara Pusthaka Moola (book corner) close to the museum. Works of 579 writers of Onattukara have been made available there. At Rs. 13 lakh The Onattukara Historical Heritage Agricultural Museum, set up at a cost of Rs. 13 lakh, was inaugurated by Public Works Minister G.

Port museum The port museum was set up by renovating godowns close to the old port office, near the Alappuzha beach. It is likely to be opened to the public in February 2021. The Soukar Masjid has been a place of worship of the trading Halai community of Muslims who migrated from Porbandar in Gujarat in the 19th century. The afforestation programme using the Miyawaki method was done on 20 cents of land near the port museum. The upcoming heritage museum will use the warehouse property of the erstwhile Seth Brothers.

The aim was to supplement the livelihood of the community, which mainly survived on the collection of medicinal plants from the forests and selling them to Ayurveda practitioners. The project covered the families mainly from Kalamassery, Kanjoor, Malayattoor, Sreemoolanagaram, and Vazhakkulam. “However, they were often taken for a ride by the buyers who undervalued their stuff. The project facilitated link-up with Ayurveda companies and modern distribution technologies, thus rescuing them from unfair practices,” said M.B. Sasidharan, who retired as the college principal earlier this year. At present, they do business worth over Rs. 40,000 thanks to the tie-up facilitated under the project with 11 Ayurveda companies. Still, there were some gaps in the distribution as some medicinal plants were not easily available. In order to solve this, cultivation of such plants was launched on Tuesday in 1 acre at Kanjoor that will directly benefit 10 local Ullada families. The project is being implemented jointly by the Kanjoor Service Cooperative Bank and the commerce department of the Al-Ameen College, Edathala, as part of the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan that aims at transformational change in rural development by leveraging knowledge institutions. “Medicinal plant species such as datura metel, pumbago auriculata, heart-leaved tinospora, and aloe vera were not easily available. These plants will be cultivated under the project so that the clients would not have to go elsewhere,” said Mr. Sasidharan, who is now the president of the Kanjoor Cooperative Society.

Third accused The agency also wanted Mr. Shoukry, an Egyptian, to be arraigned as the third accused in the dollar smuggling case. Swapna Suresh and P.S. Sarith too have been arraigned as accused in the case. Travelled together Swapna, according to investigators, had given a statement to the Superintendent of Customs stating that the foreign currency was concealed in the handbag of Mr. Shoukry.

The notification, which was issued on October 30, had stated that candidates applying for the post of Assistant Professors had to pay Rs. 5,000 as registration fee. For SC/ST candidates, the fee was Rs. 2,500. The revised fee for SC/ST candidates is Rs. 1,000. Applicants pointed out that the fee structure was huge and unheard of in recent times. “Usually, the average registration fee for such recruitments was in the range of Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000. The university should have realised that many applicants could be jobless and would find it difficult to pay such a high fee. Even the revised fee of Rs. 2,000 is on a higher scale,” they said. An aspirant said that the varsity coffers would have received an impressive Rs. 1crore, if 2,000 candidates had applied for the post of Assistant Professors under various schools of the university. “They were trying to take advantage of the fact that the applicants would pay up as they were desperate for a job. The high fee was fixed at a time when many continued to reel under the financial crisis induced by the pandemic,” he said. No change The varsity authorities said that the revised notification would be published on Wednesday. There would be no change in the registration fee for candidates applying for the posts of Professor and Associate Professor. It would be Rs. 7,500 and Rs. 5,000 respectively, they said. Applications were invited for recruitment of Assistant Professors in 10 schools under the varsity including School of Indian Legal Thought: School of Pure and Applied Physics; School of Pedagogical Sciences; School of Chemical Sciences; School of Management & Business Studies; School of International Relations and Politics; School of Behavioural Sciences; School of Computer Sciences; and School of Social Sciences. The notification was issued for filling up 12 posts based on a decision taken at the Syndicate meet held on May 26 this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/registration-fee-shocker-mg-varsity-cancels-notification/article33017918.ece
04 November 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Signboards on roads: HC seeks State’s response||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday asked the State government to respond to a petition seeking a directive to establish signboards along all public roads, including State and national highways, showing the speed limits on each stretch. The directive came on a petition filed by Siju Kamalasanan of Kochi. Penal notice According to him, he was issued a penal notice for speeding along the Kulakad-Kollam road. In fact, section 112 of the Motor Vehicles Act required the government to set up appropriate traffic signboards in areas where the speed of vehicles was regulated, besides notifying the same in the gazette. However, no such sign was placed along the Kulakad-Kollam stretch. He contended that without erecting signboards showing the speed limit and alerting motorists of the presence of speed-detecting cameras, authorities were not legally entitled to initiate penal action against the petitioner. The authorities were using the speed-detecting cameras as a measure to enrich the State coffers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/signboards-on-roads-hc-seeks-states-response/article33017937.ece

The corporation had outsourced the e-governance and office digitalisation projects to ULTS, a subsidiary of the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS). “The issue was raised in the council when it started the survey and it had assured to take needed measures. But during the pandemic it continued with the survey, uploading all data in the private server of ULTS,” said P.R. Prathapachandran, UDF chairman of Kollam constituency. Using technologies such as drone, DGPS, laser tape, and other applications, Intelligent Property Management System (IPMS) collects all demographic, topographic, and property-related data of residents. It uses GPS to record the correct demarcation between the wards, panchayats, and corporation while also registering the details of paddy land, wetland, and waterbodies. Oppn. charge “Instead of the Information Kerala Mission (IKM), the Kollam Corporation handed over the project to ULTS and it is using its own software to collect data. At present, its questionnaire include 60 direct questions and 140 subsidiary questions, most of which are health-related. Two hundred questions are not needed for a survey related to tax fixing, but it is collecting a lot of data about the medical history of the four lakh residents of the corporation. This is a serious issue and the corporation authorities should take immediate steps to protect the sensitive data and cancel all contracts with ULTS. If they don’t take any action, we are planning to approach the court,” he said. Meanwhile, the Kollam city Corporation authorities have temporarily stopped the survey and the Corporation Secretary has been instructed to probe the allegation. “We are trying to find out if it is collecting any unnecessary details and the survey will only resume after that,” said Mayor Honey Benjamin. Earlier, the corporation had issued strict directives to maintain physical distancing and not to enter houses during the survey. “The city corporation will not go ahead with activities causing any kind of difficulty to the residents,” the Mayor added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kollam-corpn-draws-flak-for-data-collection/article33017893.ece

The centre follows the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines and from now on the people here will not have to depend on RCC for various treatments, including chemotherapy,” said Minister for Fisheries J. Mercykutty Amma who inaugurated the centre.

Vijayan Pillai,” she said. The Minister also condemned the attempts by certain sections to organise protests alleging that the government had outsourced the operations of the centre to private agencies. ‘Baseless charges’ “All the allegations are baseless and such protests will only aggravate the misery of the cancer patients,” she said, instructing the local body officials to explain all details concerned to the public to clarify their doubts.

04 November 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Backwater town Vaikom now on State tourism map||An iconic location rich in heritage and sights, Vaikom has always been dazzling due to its proximity to some of the best backwater destinations in Kerala. Thanks to PEPPER (People’s Participation for Planning and Empowerment through Responsible Tourism), the backwater town has now found a place on the official tourism map of the State government. In a recent order, the Department of Tourism has included Vaikom and nine panchayats adjoining it as a tourism destination under its destination management programme. Earlier in February this year, the State government constituted a destination management committee for successful implementation of the PEPPER project in Vaikom. The committee, comprising the District Deputy Director of Tourism and theDistrict Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) secretary as members, has Vaikom MLA, C.K. Asha as its chairman and the RT Mission Kerala State coordinator as its convener. Through PEPPER Launched on November 3, 2017, the PEPPER project envisaged developing Vaikom municipality and nine of its adjoining panchayats as a tourism destination through local participation. As part of it, special tourism grama sabhas were convened in all local bodies to identify the tourism potential of respective regions, followed by the formulation of a tourism directory, preparation of tourism packages, training for resource persons and implementation of projects. Tourism Minister Kadakampilly Surendran said the massive involvement of the local people through the PEPPER project prompted the State government to declare Vaikom as a tourist destination. Taking a cue from its success in Vaikom, similar projects to ensure local participation are being initiated in 48 other locations. Under PEPPER, which has now entered its third phase, training has been imparted to 976 persons and a dictionary covering all details of the destination, including the local cuisine, festivals and accommodation units, has been published. The project also encompasses the implementation of 448 projects, including 15 accommodation units in and around the region. 12 projects Further, 12 projects including a Global Tourism Village at Enadi are currently being implemented. “About 14,518 tourists have visited the destination so far as part of PEPPER and the revenue from their visits is estimated to be around Rs. 2.14 crore. The RT Mission currently runs 14 experiential tour packages for the region,” said K.Rupesh Kumar, State coordinator, RT Mission Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/backwater-town-vaikom-now-on-state-tourism-map/article33017898.ece

Surendran on Tuesday said that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was on the verge of losing his mental control as the ongoing investigations against his office were about to reach their logical conclusions. Addressing mediapersons in Kottayam, Mr. Surendran said a worried Chief Minister was now attempting to drive away the Central investigation agencies out of the State fearing the investigation would reach the door steps of his family. Intimidation bid “The CM should remember that it is not Manmohan Singh, but Narendra Modi who is in power at the Centre. Threats, intimidation and attempts to create confusion by citing federal principles will not be yielding any results,” Mr. Surendran said. He also warned of serious consequences in case the Left Democratic Front government sabotaged the investigation. “The State does not have the right to question the Central investigation agencies. Despite accusing these investigation agencies of jurisdictional overreach, the CM has failed to point out any single instance to back his argument,” he added. According to him, even if the CPI(M) tried to unleash violence like what they did it when the CBI launched an investigation against P. Jayarajan, people would not take it for granted. Internal tussle Meanwhile, Mr. Surendran sought to sidestep repeated queries on the internal tussle within the State unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party. “We express our sincere gratitude to all the concerns showed towards the BJP,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cm-on-verge-of-losing-mental-balance-surendran/article33017889.ece

Ramakrishanan declared the completion of the first phase of Kozhikode Corporation’s project to convert all street lights into LED lights on Tuesday. The project, being implemented by Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation Limited (KEONICS) has covered most parts of the city. The maintenance of the street lights in the city has been a constant headache for the Kozhikode Corporation over the years. But the contract with KEONICS includes 10 years of maintenance, which takes a major burden off the Corporation’s shoulders. In the first phase, conversion of 42,600 poles have been completed. Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said the project was beneficial to the civic body in many ways due to several penal provisions in the contract. Each pole is equipped with Central Control Monitoring System (CCMS), which enables a centralised control unit to monitor the working of every lamp round-the-clock. The company is bound to repair any faulty lights within 48 hours. The project is expected to save annual energy expenditure for street lights by 54%. Meanwhile, the Opposition councillors have flayed the declaration on the grounds that the conversion has not been completed and the move was an eyewash in view of the forthcoming local body polls. They staged a protest in front of the Tagore Centenary Hall on Tuesday while the declaration event was in progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shift-to-led-street-lights-corpn-declares-completion-of-phase-1/article33017817.ece

Kamaruddin in Kasaragod district after the party landed itself in a soup. Sources said on Tuesday that the leadership had decided to distance itself from the issue even as complaints were piling up against the Manjeswaram MLA for allegedly cheating investors, mostly sympathisers and party workers. Over 90 cases have been registered at various police stations against Mr. Kamaruddin, also a former district president of the party. Ahead of polls Earlier, the party leadership had given him six months to sort out the issue after many of the investors, including women, reposed their faith in it. The State leadership had also tasked the IUML district treasurer Kallatra Mahin Haji to mediate the process of repayment of the investment. But now the wounds have inflamed and festered, especially when the party is gearing up for the three-tier local bodies and the Assembly polls. The local leadership fears a possible backlash from ordinary party workers in the elections.  Bid to return money Incidentally, Mr. Kamaruddin, who won from the Manjeswaram assembly segment in the byelection last year, was struggling to repay back the funds to the duped investors. He along with T.K. Pookoya Thangal, a local leader of the IUML who is also the managing director of Fashion Gold, the company set up by them, had used their political clout to woo investors. The probe Now the Crime Branch, which is investigating the case, has taken over the possessions and assets of the company. Consequently, the IUML leadership feels that the mediator role it has been playing will not work to its advantage any more. The Crime Branch sleuths are also looking into the allegations that the company proprietors had secretly sold its assets and property in Bengaluru. The party leadership, the sources said, also feel that the Enforcement Directorate, which is investigating a series of cases under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, is likely to take up a fresh probe as well. Despite the damage-control efforts, the IUML leadership and the United Democratic Front, which are now facing a political embarrassment, will have to prepare better for the challenging situation in Kasaragod district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/iuml-not-to-play-mediator-role-in-cheating-case/article33017943.ece

Very few directors in Malayalam cinema have been as prolific and stayed as relevant for so long. Fewer could boast as many classics. Hariharan is glad that he has been chosen for the award, though it may have come to him a bit late. “I am happy to accept the award decided by a jury headed by M.T. Vasudevan Nair, a writer and director I have great regard for and who has written the scripts of some of my most acclaimed films,” Hariharan told The Hindu over the phone from Chennai. He said he would like to dedicate the award to his gurus in cinema. “I was fortunate to work with some fine filmmakers such as M. Krishnan Nair, M.S. Mani, J.D. Thottan, A.B. Raj, P.B. Unni, and C.V. Sridhar, who even influenced the way I dress (all white),” he said. “It is important for an artiste to learn from the masters.” Hariharan may have completed five decades in cinema, but he continues to make films. He was working on the pre-production of Nambiar sometime ago, but its shooting had to be postponed because of COVID-19. “I do not know when will I be able to shoot the film, which has to be made on a large canvas,” he said. “The pandemic had been a huge setback for the film industry,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/glad-to-accept-award-from-jury-headed-by-mt-says-hariharan/article33017926.ece

With the tenure of another member expiring next month, the vacuum is likely to affect the interview process of job aspirants and the promotion procedure of government staff. According to sources, the tenure of P. Sivadasan, T.T. Ismail, Simmy Rosebell John, and E. Ravindranathan expired on June 3, 2019 and that of S. Shine on June 10 the same year. P. Suresh Kumar demitted office on April 4 this year and D. Rajan on November 2. Lopus Mathew is scheduled to end his term in office on December 17. The government is yet to nominate new members to replace them. The tenure of a PSC member is for six years or 62 years of age, whichever is earlier. The PSC website says that “... The chairman and members of the Commission are appointed by the Governor of the State. The composition of the Commission is such that as nearly as one half of the members of it shall be persons who on the date of their appointment have at least 10 years of service under the government.” Increase in workload A former member of the commission told The Hindu on Monday that the size of multi-member interview boards could be reduced now. This would lead to more workload for the remaining members and possible delay in appointments to various departments. Also, PSC members chair the department-level promotion committees, in which the respective Principal Secretaries are the conveners. If the commission does not have full strength, it could affect the promotion procedures of government employees as well, the former member added. The sources pointed out that the government would not be able to nominate new members if the Election Commission of India issues notification for local body polls in the coming days as it would lead to the enforcement of the model code of conduct. Soon after the local body polls, the notification for the Assembly polls too could be issued. This means the vacancies are likely to remain for some more time, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/seven-of-20-posts-of-psc-members-vacant/article33017925.ece

It was a moment of celebration for the people of Muthuvallur panchayat the other day when the civic body chief Ahamed Saghir inaugurated the newly constructed pathway to the Bhagavathi Temple near Kozhikkodan Moochithadam colony. Although the temple perched on a tiny hill was more than 40 years old, it did not have proper access to it. The temple managers approached the Parathakkad Juma Masjid committee requesting their help to get a pathway. The mosque committee members decided to donate the land required for the pathway. However, with an assurance from the grama panchayat about constructing concrete steps to the temple, the mosque committee handed over the land to the panchayat. “The panchayat promptly built the pathway and helped the people living in the colony to reach their place of worship without difficulties,” said Shihab Edakkad, mosque committee secretary.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the Sanmathi park here on Tuesday in the presence of Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, Mayor K. Sreekumar, and other leaders. The accumulation of the waste at Erumakkuzhi began after the closure of the centralised waste treatment plant at Vilappilsala in 2011. As much as 2,388 cubic metres of different kinds of waste had accumulated here.  Migrant workers Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Corporation had rehabilitated several people from the street and migrant workers staying in unsafe dwelling spaces at its rehabilitation centres.  A group of these workers joined the Corporation’s sanitation workers in clearing up the mounds of waste and segregating it. They have all been provided wages as per the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) norms. The biodegradable waste from here was used for the growbags being prepared by the Corporation for organic farming purposes. The non-biodegradable waste was segregated and sold to different agencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/turnaround-for-citys-dumping-yard/article33018441.ece

04 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Congress councillor jumps ship, joins BJP||Nedumom Mohanan, a councillor of the Congress party representing the Thiruvallam ward in the city Corporation, jumped ship to the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday, at a time when seat allocations for the upcoming local body elections are about to reach its culmination. After Mr. Mohanan submitted his resignation in the afternoon, BJP district president V.V. Rajesh welcomed him with a garland at a function held in front of the city Corporation office in Palayam. It is a kind of homecoming for Mr. Mohanan as he has been a panchayat member for the BJP since 1987 in Thiruvallam, before it was added to the Corporation in 2000. From 2000, he was also the BJP’s council party leader for two terms in the city Corporation. In 2010, he quit the BJP and joined the Congress, which he represented as a councillor for the Major embarrassment The shifting of a councillor to the BJP so close to the local body elections comes as a major embarrassment for the United Democratic Front (UDF), which has been hoping to make amends for a disappointing show last time around. In August, BJP councillor S. Vijayakumari had shifted to the CPI(M). BJP council party leader M.R. Gopan said that a few more from the UDF were considering a shift to the BJP. “I decided to resign as the UDF has been a failure as an Opposition in the past five years. They failed to take a strong stand against the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist). When I reacted against this within the party, I was isolated. I had quit the BJP and joined the Congress in 2010 owing to some differences with other members. Now I think that was a mistake,” said Mr. Mohanan. He said that he did not quit because he was denied a seat in the upcoming elections. He is also not sure of getting a seat from the BJP, although he is open to contesting from Vellar, which he had represented in the past.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-councillor-jumps-ship-joins-bjp/article33018453.ece
04 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Political hostilities at an all-time high||The campaigning for local body elections is set to unfold when political hostilities appeared to be at an all-time high in the State. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) and its principal opponents, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have accused each other of using the power of the State to target political rivals and their families personally. The Congress has protested against the move on the part of the government to resurrect the charge of rape levelled against its top leaders by the woman suspect in the solar investment fraud case that rocked the Oommen Chandy government in 2014. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the LDF seemed desperate to turn the conversation away from the ongoing investigation against Bineesh Kodiyeri and M. Sivasankar. (The police on Tuesday booked Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran on a charge of misogyny). BJP president K. Surendran said the government, impaired by the gold smuggling scandal, was facing unexpectedly strong political headwinds ahead of the local body and Assembly elections. Central investigations had come awkwardly close to the CPI(M) leadership and the government. The Enforcement Directorate in Karnataka had zeroed in on Bineesh’s businesses and contacts in Kerala.  Government strategy At the same time, the government appeared to have laid the ground for a protracted legal battle over the limitations of Central authority and rights of States. It hoped to find common cause with other non-BJP ruled States, which have accused the Centre of jurisdictional overreach. The LDF is also poised to launch a major campaign to counter the adverse propaganda triggered by the gold smuggling case. It wants to go to the hustings leaning on the developmental achievements of the government and not by contrasting the vilification by the Congress and the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/political-hostilities-at-an-all-time-high/article33017932.ece

04 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Directive on land allotment for Take a Break project||District Collector Navjot Khosa has written to heads of all government departments in the district to convey their decision on handing over land to local self-government institutions for construction of public toilets under the State government’s 12-point programme. The Collector on Friday asked the department heads to make known their decision on allotment of land within two working days. If the departments do not convey either the no-objection certificate or their objection, it will be construed that they have no objection to the allotment of land and accordingly, further action will be taken, the Collector wrote in the letter. Heads of Departments have been authorised to give permission or NOC for use of their land for the public toilets. In the event of any objections, these have to be intimated to the Collector. It is the local self-government institutions that are identifying land for the construction of public toilets. The toilets are coming up as part of the Take a Break project to address the demand for quality facilities, particularly for travellers and women.  2,365 toilets As part of the project, 2,365 high-quality toilets and restrooms will be set up across the State in association with the Suchitwa Mission. These facilities will come up by the side of State or national highways, premises of government or public sector institutions along the side of these highways, premises of local self-government institution offices, commercial centres, bus-stands premises. In the district, the target is for construction or renovation of 174 Take-a-break toilets. However, projects for not all of these have been received. The Suchitwa Mission hopes that 117 toilet projects will be completed by the end of February next year. Forty-five locations for the toilets in the district are under the control of various departments, including Revenue, Public Works Department (PWD) Buildings, PWD (Roads), Education, National Highway (PWD). However, the departments have been reluctant to part with the land despite a government order in July. The order specified that only a NOC was needed; the possession of land would remain with the departments. Earlier, at a meeting with the department heads, the District Collector had given them a week’s time to take a decision on handing over the land. This has now been followed up by a letter. Work has been completed on the toilets in many local bodies such as Nedumangad and Pulimath, while it is under way in Chenkal, Parassala among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/directive-on-land-allotment-for-take-a-break-project/article33018439.ece

Along with the channel called Kalivandi, the more than a century-old school is also starting a Facebook page, Mathrukam. With students learning from home in the wake of school closure, the channel and the Facebook page are an attempt by the school authorities to promote the lower primary students’ innate talents in a fun and interesting manner through stories, poetry, craft, and magic by bringing together the most prominent people in these areas under one umbrella.

04 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Test positivity rate dips to 11.2%||Kerala’s COVID-19 case graph which began plateauing a week ago continued the trend on Tuesday, reporting 6,862 new cases when 61,138 samples were tested in the past 24 hours. The test positivity rate dipped slightly from the 12-14% range, where it had stabilised, to 11.2 % on Tuesday. Epidemiologists had earlier projected that with the effective reproductive number R going below 1, the case graph would begin to plateau in the last week of October with the State reporting between 7,274 and 9,161 cases daily. The average weekly growth rate as well as the doubling time of cases has been down the past week, indicating that while the intensity of disease transmission has lessened, low-level transmission will continue to happen across State. The doubling time which was 17.2 days on October 2 had gone up to 41.1 days as on October 30. It has been a matter of great relief to the Health Department that for the past few days, the number of recoveries being reported in the State has been higher than the new cases reported daily. On Tuesday, 8,802 COVID patients were discharged from hospitals. The steady increase in the number of recoveries has further brought down the State’s active case pool to 84,713 patients. While the cumulative case burden reached 4,51,130 cases, the recoveries till date have reached 3,64,745. COVID-19 deaths, however, do seem to be happening at a consistent pace in the State, pushing toll graph up slowly. On Tuesday, the Health Department released the details of 26 more deaths which entered the official COVID death list, taking the cumulative toll to 1,559. Of the new cases reported, 6,755 cases (98.4%) are locally acquired infections, with 783 cases remaining untraced to any known source of infection. These also includes infections reported in 73 health care workers. Among districts, Thrissur reported 856 cases, Ernakulam 850, Kozhikode 842, Alappuzha 760, Thiruvananthapuram 654, Kollam 583, Kottayam 507, Malappuram 467, Palakkad 431, Kannur 335, Pathanamthitta 245, Kasaragod 147, Wayanad 118 and Idukki 67 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/test-positivity-rate-dips-to-112/article33017929.ece

04 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Farm mechanisation project launched||Mechanisation of agriculture can help save farmers’ time, reduce their work, and increase production, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. He was speaking after inaugurating through videoconference a ‘Sub mission on agricultural mechanisation’ to promote mechanisation in the sector here on Tuesday. The Chief Minister said the government intended to give loans to the tune of Rs. 100 crore this financial year in this manner. The mechanisation project, a joint initiative of the Union and State governments, was aimed at making agriculture profitable, increasing productivity, and attracting the young generation to farming, he said. Lack of labour, increased wages, and land fragmentation were leading to an increase in the cost of production. There was, therefore, need to sow saplings in time, reduce expenses, and take up farm work with ease. Under the mechanisation project, farmers will be given individual benefits to buy machines and use them. Entrepreneurs, recognised farmer groups, cooperative groups, grama panchayats, and farmer producer organisations too will be given benefits to start custom hiring centres for the machines and equipment. Farmer groups It will also be given to groups of at least eight farmers for setting up farm machinery banks. Equipment only from farm machinery inspection centres that have been recognised by the Union and the State governments can be distributed under the project. Women, farmers from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and small entrepreneurs will get individual benefits at the rate of 50% for purchasing the machines, and the other beneficiaries, at 40%. Those setting up hiring centres will get financial assistance of 40% of the project cost. That is, the government will give assistance of Rs. 4 lakh to set up a custom hiring centre for Rs. 10 lakh. This way, custom hiring centres with an investment of Rs. 60 lakh can be set up. However, farmer groups will get 80% subsidy, that is maximum of Rs. 8 lakh as financial assistance, to set up farm machinery banks. Those who complete registration can buy the equipment from recognised distributors on priority basis. The equipment can be used for own purposes or rented out for preparing the land, harvest, food processing and so on. Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar presided over the function.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/farm-mechanisation-project-gets-going/article33017920.ece

The decision to establish a Rs. 53.93-crore facility under the Milma’s Malabar Regional Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union (MRCMPU) comes even as the dairy sector is witnessing a slump in milk consumption amid the COVID-19 lockdown. Dairy Development Minister K. Raju, who convened a meeting here on Tuesday, said the government had decided in principle to implement the project in association with the National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) using the latter’s infrastructure development fund. The Minister said a manufacturing unit for milk powder was crucial for the State as it neared its target of achieving self-sufficiency in milk production. Besides, milk production was at an all-time high, necessitating the need to preserve excess milk as powder. Mr. Raju said the decision to establish a factory was adopted as the existing facility meant for the purpose in the State had remained non-operational for long with outdated technology. Dairy Development Secretary Tinku Biswal, Nabard Chief General Manager Balachandran, Milma managing director Patil Suyog Subhashrao, Director of Animal Husbandry K.M.

04 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KU officials reprimanded for violating RTI Act||The State Information Commission (SIC) has pulled up officials of the University of Kerala (KU) for flouting the provisions of the Right to Information (RTI) Act by denying a former professor the information sought by him. Lashing out at the purported laxity by the joint registrar and the registrar, who are the designated State Public Information Officer (SPIO) and appellate authority respectively, Chief Information Commissioner Vinson M. Paul in his strongly worded order stated that the “SPIO is not an authority to function as a sheer post office”. The reprimand came after the SIC considered a complaint submitted by Immanuel Thomas, former Professor and Head of Department of Psychology, who had sought information under the RTI Act regarding the circumstances that prompted the university to restrict his entry on the Karyavattom campus and also demanded a copy of memo charges that contained the allegations against him, among other documents. The Chief Information Commissioner said the SPIO had furnished copies of irrelevant documents merely to “fulfil the formality of furnishing some sort of a reply”. The official was mandated with ensuring a reply that contained all information sought, unless the information sought was covered under Section 8 or 9 of the Act. Finding the official of acting against the letter and spirit of the RTI Act, the serious lapse warranted penal action under Section 20(1) of the Act. While directing the SPIO to furnish an explanation within 15 days, the SIC found that the appellate authority also erred in its responsibilities by disposing of the appeal filed by the applicant in a casual manner, while it ideally should have held a detailed hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ku-officials-reprimanded-for-violating-rti-act/article33018448.ece

Dr. Singh was speaking online on Monday after releasing the book Kerala and the World Economy published by the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) here to mark its 50th anniversary. “Unless firm and quick measures are taken at the national level to stimulate demand, as we did so effectively in 2008 in the wake of the U.S. sub-prime mortgage crisis, I am afraid still darker times are ahead of us. This is the time to shed economic orthodoxy and take bold decisions that will pull the national economy out of the deep depression,” Dr. Singh said. Downward spiral At the national level, the economy has been on a downward spiral for two years even before the pandemic struck. COVID-19 and its effect on the poor, both in terms of employment and incomes, had further aggravated India’s problems. The growing trend towards protectionism and the hardening of national borders through increasing tariff and non-tariff barriers, steep decline in economic activity, plunging prices of energy sources, growing restrictions on movement of skilled and unskilled labour — all these pose global threats which Kerala had to bravely confront, he said. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac received the first copy. “ Kerala and the World Economy is an important addition to our body knowledge, as it brings together certain recent aspects of Kerala’s interface with the rest of the world such as international trade, commercial agriculture, migration and remittances,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/manmohan-singh-shed-economic-orthodoxy/article33018449.ece

04 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Issue clear guidelines for caste certificates, govt. told||The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has asked the government for clear guidelines on issuing caste certificates to children born in mixed marriages for availing educational and other benefits. The commission said there should be transparency on the guidelines to prove father’s caste and the applicant’s social and cultural status.  The commission was acting on a petition from a student seeking its intervention in helping him secure a caste certificate. The complainant had said that his father and mother belonged to the Hindu Thiyya and the Nair community, respectively. Though he led a life according to the Thiyya community traditions, when he went to the Kannamangalam village officer to seek a caste certificate for a scholarship, the officer misbehaved with him. The village officer also sought a letter from the Thiyya community for issuing the certificate. The village officer, in his report to the commission, said that on investigation it was revealed that the complainant or his father did not live as per the customs or traditions of the Thiyya community, nor did they have any documents to show that the community considered them its members. The complainant’s mother was also a member of the Nair Service Soceity Karayogam and its women’s wing. Court verdicts The commission comprising member K. Nazeer, while citing two court verdicts and a government order, said the caste certificate for children born to mixed marriage couples should be on the basis of the father’s caste and taking into account which community’s traditions they followed. To ensure that special rights given to children born in mixed marriages were not violated or denied, the Chief Secretary and the General Administration Secretary should issue clear guidelines on which documents would attest to the traditions followed by them and their social, cultural, and financial backwardness. The commission also directed that if the applicant submitted documents to prove his social and cultural life was spent as per his father’s caste traditions as per current guidelines, the village officer should issue the caste certificate urgently so that his future opportunities were not affected and his rights were not denied owing to technical reasons. The commission also asked the State government to ensure that there was no delay in issuing certificates or testimonials to students as per law for educational needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/issue-clear-guidelines-for-caste-certificates-panel-tells-govt/article33017919.ece
04 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Bid to destabilise govt.: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday slammed Central law enforcement agencies for using the UAE gold smuggling case as a cover to destabilise the State government. The government would legally and politically counter the jurisdictional overreach of the Central agencies, he said. Mr. Vijayan’s criticism of the Central agencies appeared to be the precursor of a major political campaign to counter anti-government propaganda sparked by the multiple probes. It also signalled the start of a protracted legal battle over the limitations of Central authority and rights of States. The agencies had attempted to usurp the watchdog role of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India by seeking the receipts and expenditure of various flagship programmes. The agencies had impeded governance by asking officials to turn up with records that do not pertain to their investigations. They acted as if they were regulators of State governments. The agencies had sought information on the LIFE Mission and K-Phone projects. The law limited Enforcement Directorate’s authority to investigating money laundering cases.

Out of 679 scheduled RTC bus services, 525 are being operated on different routes. But the hired bus services have not yet been restored. With the restoration of services from the areas where there was a demand, the region topped the State till September-end. In October, the patronage increased manifold with majority of the demand coming from Karnataka, where 110 of the 161 services had been restored to destinations such as Bellary, Bengaluru, Sira, and Pavagada, Regional Manager Sumanth R. Adoni told The Hindu . On Monday, the first day of resumption of operations to Hyderabad, one bus was operated. But on Tuesday, nine services were operated against the 16 permitted as per the agreement. Twenty-four buses were operated from Anantapur to Hyderabad prior to the pandemic. However, only 16 would be allowed now. “If the demand increases, the load will be proportionately shared,” he said. There was a demand for 39 buses in the Kurnool region on Tuesday, said Regional Manager T. Venkataramam. The region used to run 74 services, but the number was cut down to 52 under the new agreement. Demand for Karnataka buses did not increase proportionately as the majority of the employees from Bengaluru were engaged under the ‘Work From Home’ arrangement. The Anantapur region clocked 210.78 lakh km between April 1 and October 31 though there were no services from March 22 to May 21 due to lockdown in the wake of COVID-19. The occupancy ratio till the end of September was 58.41%. It went up to 68.90% in October alone. The earning per km was Rs. 26.23 till September-end, and it went up to Rs. 30.94 in October. Earnings The earnings in the region, which were Rs. 3,860.59 lakh till the end of September, jumped to Rs. 5,827.59 lakh by the end of October. This was possible in spite of 620 permanent employees contracting the virus and four of them succumbing to it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/90-rtc-services-restored-in-anantapur-region/article33018375.ece

04 November 2020||MAREDUMILLI (EAST GODAVARI),ANDHRA PRADESH||Tourism activities to be regulated at Gudisa||The Territorial Wing of the AP Forest Department is all set to regulate tourism activities at Gudisa, the only grassland tourist destination in Andhra Pradesh, 45-km away from Maredumilli town in East Godavari Agency. Located in the reserve forest, the tiny hamlet of Gudisa is surrounded by fields of flowers (Lamiaceae family), which bloom in winter in hundreds of acres on the Gudisa hilltop, and a waterfall, wooing tourists from across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, despite a not-so-safe drive to the hill. This winter, Gudisa hill has been witnessing a huge rush of tourists as tourism activities are slowly returning to normalcy after the seven-month lockdown. Ironically, a majority of the tourists have been found to light campfires by collecting wood from the grassland that is not permissible in the reserve forest, disturbing the unique grassland. Revenue “A check-post will be set up at the foot of the Gudisa hill at Vollangi village, engaging the tribal people to run it and collect fee for entering the grassland. The check-post will help regulate tourism activities, prevent the night stay, apart from generating revenue through tourism,” East Godavari District Forest Officer B. Sunil Kumar Reddy said. Mr. Kumar said that night stay on the grassland was prohibited as it was a reserve forest. The grassland had every potential to become a major tourist attraction in the State. “It is risky to stay for the night on the grassland. We strongly advise to avoid planning the visit to the grassland along with the families as the road to the hill does not support for a safe travel in the night,” said Mr. Kumar. On regulation of the movement of vehicles of tourists, Mr. Kumar said talks were on with the local police to keep an eye on the movement of the tourists to prevent any untoward incidents at the tourist destination. Presently, tourists form into groups and plan an adventure trip to Gudisa by travelling on two-wheelers and prefer to stay for the night to explore the beauty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tourism-activities-to-be-regulated-at-gudisa/article33018387.ece

04 November 2020||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Despite drop in cases, brace for second wave, say health officials||The health officials are keeping their fingers crossed despite a steep drop in COVID-19 cases in October as they are anticipating a second wave. Citing earlier pandemic experience from the Spanish flu, health officials say that such pandemic has a tendency to resurge with vigour after a brief slump. In March 1918, the first wave of Spanish flu was observed and then after a lull, the second wave arrived and it was far more deadlier then the first one. According to Hemalatha from the Department of Microbiology, Andhra University, “so far we have seen how coronavirus spread during the summer and now we have to wait and watch its impact during the winter.” “During summer, the temperature in the city was high and this combined with immunity power of Indians, we have seen high recovery and low death count. Now during winter, the temperature will drop and study says that it may be conducive for its growth,” she said. Winter effect “Till date, the research on the virus is still in its nascent stage. We are yet to understand the virus fully and that is why there is a fear among the scientific community on how it will behave during winter,” she said. ‘Three months crucial’ District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar also shared a similar opinion. “From September, we have been seeing a drop in cases and in October the cases recorded were below 6,000. But the next three months is crucial as well as critical for the health and scientific community,” he said. T. Raghava Rao from the Department of Biochemistry, Andhra University, pointed out that any virus changes its characteristics depending on a number of factors and one being the DNA profile of people of a region and other is climate and environment. “The virus character and mutation were different in Visakhapatnam when compared to those in Hyderabad. We are still learning about it and the next three months (November to January) is important for those who are researching on the Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),” he said. Anticipating a second wave, the experts feel that the best way to beat the virus is by practising hygiene and following the basic protocols of wearing a mask, maintaining social distance, keeping away from crowd and sanitising hands on a regular basis. “In Europe, the second wave has already begun and many countries have imposed lockdown. This is mainly, because people have become complacent after the first wave and we need to tackle this,” said Prof. Sudhakar. “One of the main reasons for the second wave of Spanish flu was complacency among people,” he said. According to a few senior health officials, the government coming under economic pressure has opened up everything, right from schools and colleges to cinemas and from travel to running trains and buses. Strict enforcement “It is important to address the economic issues, but at the same time we need to focus on strict enforcement and people should learn to take care of themselves and stay safe. It is now in the hands of people to address the pandemic by following the norms,” said Dr. Sudhakar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/brace-for-second-wave-say-health-officials/article33018425.ece

04 November 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Go Electric’ campaign gets a big push||In a major push to electric mobility sector, the government has decided to establish 400 charging stations across the State in the first phase. The government plans to attract investments to the sector by stepping up efforts to set up electric vehicle infrastructure, and the move to establish the charging stations is a step in that direction. Performance study A proposal to undertake real time performance study on electric vehicles is actively under consideration. The plan is to provide electric two-wheelers to the ward and village secretariat staff, and establish testing facility for auto components and vehicles and intelligence testing tracks for e-vehicles at a cost of Rs. 250 crore. During a webinar on the ‘Go Electric’ campaign organised with the support of the A.P. State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM), the officials said charging infrastructure would be established at every 25 km along the national highways, and moving forward, more charging stations would be installed. The campaign is launched by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, in coordination with the APSECM and the Non-Conventional and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP), the State nodal agency for establishment of the charging stations. Benefits “Installation of charging stations will boost the confidence of the users of electric vehicles, and this will also encourage companies to launch new brands of e-vehicles,” said Secretary, Department of Energy, N. Srikanth. He said this would help the State take the lead in the emerging e-vehicle sector, increase energy security, control air pollution, and improve air quality. NREDCAP Vice-Chairman and Managing Director S. Ramana Reddy spoke about the MoU entered with the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) for deployment of electric cars, and informed that 300 electric cars were deployed at various government organisations. Mr. Reddy said the corporation had also signed agreements with the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and Rajasthan Electronics and Instruments Limited (RIEL) for charging infrastructure. He further said that 460 chargers would be installed in 83 locations across the State under the Union government-sponsored Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) Electric Vehicles (FAME-II) scheme. Responding to the NREDCAP proposal of real time performance study of the electric vehicles, Hero Electric Private Limited had given four electronic two-wheelers, which were now being used by the village/ward secretariat volunteers in Pulivendula Municipal Corporation, he informed. The corporation had also sent proposals to the AP Pollution Control Board, the Transport Commissioner and the GMR Foundation for providing electric retrofit kits with swappable batteries for three-wheeler high-speed passenger auto-rickshaws in place of the IC engine, he said. “Initially, the retro-fitted electrical activity will start in Visakhapatnam and Tirupati, and later it will be marketed in all the districts headquarters,” Mr. Reddy. Piagio had already started a swapping station in Vijayawada, he informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/go-electric-campaign-gets-a-big-push-in-ap/article33017568.ece

The kutcha road, the laying of which was taken up nearly four months ago, is now nearing completion. The daily routine of the tribals for the past 100-odd days has been to leave home early in the morning carrying crowbars, axes and other implements, to take up jungle clearance to facilitate levelling of the soil. This road connects Arla village of Rolugunta mandal to Jajulabandha of Koyyuru mandal. It is also provides connectivity to Pithrigedda and Peda Garuvu villages. Many challenges “We have been submitting representations for construction of a road for the past several years but no government has bothered to do so. Going to a hospital during an emergency becomes a nightmare. We face difficulty even in getting rations. The absence of a road facility is becoming an obstacle in availing benefits of various government schemes,” said Korra Rajababu of Jajulabandha village. “The State government is spending crores of rupees for the welfare of the socially and economically deprived sections. But what is the use if the benefits do not reach the intended beneficiaries? This is what is happening in some of the remote tribal areas,” he said. “The tribals, mostly women and youths, cleared the bushes and trees over a 7-km stretch, while an earthmover was deployed for digging and levelling of the ground for the laying of the road, which passes through two hills,” K. Govinda Rao of Girijan Sangham told The Hindu . “An amount of Rs. 2,000 was contributed by each tribal household for hiring of the earthmover,” he said. The tribals hope that the government will now lay a pucca road to their village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vexed-tribals-lay-road-all-by-themselves/article33018389.ece

In a letter to Mr. Reddy on October 9, the Railway Minister referred to the former’s special mention in the Rajya Sabha on March 18, 2020, underlining the need for provision of some more Vistadome coaches in addition to the single Vistadome coach provided between Visakhapatnam and Araku. The Vistadome coaches are specially-designed with large glass windows. However, despite its popularity and demand, only one Vistadome coach has been allotted to the Visakhapatnam-Kirandul train so far. Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said that there was a long waiting list for tickets on this coach. “There is, therefore, a requirement of plying at least five more Vistadome coaches between Visakhapatnam and Araku at the earliest. These new coaches would give a further boost to tourism in Visakhapatnam as well as earn revenue for the Railways,” Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy had said.

04 November 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Centre unfairly blamed for Polavaram delay’||BJP State general secretary P. Vishnuvardhan Reddy has alleged that the YSRCP and the TDP are indulging in false propaganda against the Centre for the delay in the execution of the Polavaram project for their selfish political gains. Addressing the media here on Tuesday, Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said though the Centre had announced Polavaram as a national project, the TDP government had converted it into a State project. While the Central government was granting funds and ensuring execution of the project, both the parties were trying to blame it for the delay. Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy alleged that the contractor who had increased the cost of the Pattiseema Lift Irrigation project from Rs. 1,100 crore to Rs. 1,600 crore had made a profit of Rs. 500 crore, and wondered how the contractor was being continued by the YSRCP government. He also wondered why the State government was silent on the Rs. 2,300 crore released by the Centre for the Polavaram project. He wondered why former Union Minister and TDP leader P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, who was a part of the Union Cabinet at that time, failed to raise queries on the project then. He also found fault with CPI leader Ramakrishna for his letter on the project. The Centre had given Rs. 2,300 crore for the project, and anyone having doubts could check with the Polavaram Project Authority. The cost escalations would be taken care of by the project authority, he said. The BJP leader further alleged that the YSRCP government was claiming credit for the Central government schemes by changing the names. He alleged that confusion was being created in the minds of Intermediate students regarding online admissions. This was resulting in many students heading to neighbouring States, he added. He also sought that justice be done to the poor beneficiaries in the TIDCO housing project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/blaming-centre-for-delay-in-polavaram-unfair-says-bjp/article33017764.ece

04 November 2020||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TELANGANA||Public hearings to be held on SCCL projects||The environmental public hearing for the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL)'s project proposal for expansion of Gouthamkhani Opencast Project (GKOC) from the present 2.0 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) to 4.0 MTPA in Kothagudem area will be held in Kothagudem on November 27. The proposed project envisages expansion of the GKOC in 902 hectares with a life of the project estimated at two years (up to 2021-22) and coal reserves of 3 to 3.5 million tonnes under the "violation category." According to sources, the project falls under the "violation category" owing to the excess coal production to meet the burgeoning demand for coal in the past couple of years. Based on the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)'s recent circular, the regional office of the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) has decided to hold a public hearing at the Government Polytechnic College in the coal town at 11 am on November 27. Safeguards The State-owned coal mining company allocated Rs. 17.58 crore towards capital cost and Rs. 3.40 crore per year towards recurring cost for implementing the environmental safeguards. This apart, the company has drawn up a plan to spend Rs. 4.65 crore for environmental protection measures such as development of Eco-park. As part of its ambitious growth strategy, the SCCL mooted conversion of the more-than-six-decade-old Venkateshkhani-7 (VK-7 incline) underground mine at Kothagudem into an opencast project. The continuous miner panel was introduced in the VK-7 incline over a decade ago. With the adoption of the "Bord and Pillar" mechanised mining method using the continuous miner technology, the annual coal production from the VK-7 incline reached 0.843 MTPA, sources said. However, the SCCL has drawn up a plan to stop the underground mining in the 64-year-old VK-7 incline by the year-end and convert it into an OCP for economic viability and ramping up coal production, sources said. The environmental public hearing for the project will be held at the Government Polytechnic in Kothagudem on November 24. The authorities made arrangements for bandobust for smooth conduct of the two public hearings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/public-hearings-to-be-held-on-sccl-projects/article33018434.ece

04 November 2020||DUBBAK,TELANGANA||Rumours rife during Dubbak polling||Fake news and rumours that spread via social media platforms gave anxious moments to main candidates in the fray. Rumour mongers had a field day as the voting for bypoll to Dubbak Assembly constituency commenced on Tuesday. With no untoward incident reported in any of 315 polling stations, the fiercely contested Dubbak byelection passed off peacefully on Tuesday. Incidence of physical violence was nil as a security blanket was thrown over the constituency deploying close to 2,000 police personnel. A couple of Telugu TV news channel lodged complaints with the Cyber Crime police of Hyderabad, alleging that video clips with their logos showing that Congress nominee Cheruku Srinivas Reddy had joined TRS were created and circulated. Congress leaders led by State president Uttam Kumar Reddy met DGP M. Mahender Reddy seeking action against persons circulating false reports that its workers were persuading people to vote for BJP candidate Raghunandan Rao. Congress nominee Cheruku Srinivas Reddy too filed a complaint with Thoguta police alleging that a video clip in the name of a Telugu TV channel falsely claiming that he joined TRS was circulated. “A case was registered. It is under investigation,” Siddipet Police Commissioner Joel Davis said. Police are yet to identify persons responsible for creating the video and spreading rumors. But the fake video clips and misleading reports created ripples though they did not reach majority of the voters spread over in eight mandals. From 7 a.m., Mr. Joel Davis began visiting polling stations. After going round a couple of polling locations in Dubbak headquarters, he went to Bhompally, Narsingi, Chegunta, Ibrahimpur, Daulathabad and Raipole. The Commissioner visited Venkatraopet, Thoguta, Mirdoddi, Kaslabad and Bappapur. To the surprise of officials, Telangana Chief Electoral Officer Shashank Goel also came to the constituency. He went to a couple of polling locations in Chegunta and Dubbak.

04 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS sees lowest daily corona deaths in over four months||Telangana recorded 1,536 COVID-19 cases on Monday, taking the total to 2,42,506. While 45,021 people were examined, results of 617 were awaited. Three more COVID-19 patients died, pushing the death toll to 1,351 in the State. Since June 24, this is the lowest number of COVID-19 deaths that have been reported in a day. Deaths in the State were not recorded on a daily basis till May 17. Thereafter, at least one COVID-19 patient died every day, according to the media bulletins issued by the State Health department. The fatalities steadily rose. In September, eight to 13 patients died every day. However, the daily fatalities started to drop from October 10, staying between four and six. After seven deaths recorded on Sunday, it dropped to just three on Monday. Earlier, Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy had said that early identification of the infectious disease and early treatment is helping them avoid progression of the COVID infection in a patient, thus minimising the fatalities. While the case fatality rate in the country is 1.5%, it is 0.55% in Telangana. Monday update The 45,021 tests conducted on Monday is the highest in a day since October 13. While around 50,000 tests were conducted on a daily average till October 10, it gradually dropped to around 40,000 a day. Of those who got tested on Monday, a total of 43,590 opted for government health facilities, and 1,431 got tested at private labs. The new 1,536 cases include 281 from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation region, 123 from Bhadradri-Kothagudem, 97 from Khammam, 96 from Medchal-Malkajgiri, 92 from Rangareddy, and 81 from Nalgonda. The lowest of seven cases were recorded in Kumaram Bheem Asifabad and eight in Jogulamba Gadwal. Spike in Bhadradri The 123 cases in Bhadradri-Kothagudem is a sharp spike.

04 November 2020||HYDERABAD:,TELANGANA||Non-COVID services at Gandhi not before Dec. 1||It might take three to four weeks if the non-COVID services at Gandhi Hospital were to resume. Since some operation theatres in the hospital have not been used since the past seven months, they have to be repaired and checked for presence of any form of infection. Currently, only COVID-19 patients are admitted at the government hospital. Junior doctors (post graduate students) on Monday stated that they will boycott duties if the non-COVID-services are not resumed by November 11. From Tuesday, they started to sportblack badges as part of a symbolic protest. When COVID-19 cases started to increase from March, Gandhi Hospital was turned into COVID speciality centre. In the past seven months, doctors, nurses, junior doctors, Class-IV employees and others posted there are attending only COVID-19 patients. Members of the Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA)-Gandhi Medical College said that they are losing out on attending patients suffering from other health complications and that will affect their academics. Demanding resumption of non-COVID services, they have threatened to boycott duties. Hospital superintendent M. Raja Rao said he formed a committee comprising heads of all departments and held a meeting regarding the issue on Monday. “We have taken opinions from each department. Since some operation theatres have not been in use over the past seven months, repairs and renovation work have to be taken up. Swab samples have to be collected from there thrice. If everything is okay, we can start using them. All this will take around three to four weeks. Services will be resumed according to the decision of senior officials,” Dr Raja Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/non-covid-services-at-gandhi-not-before-dec-1/article33018255.ece
04 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Sans festival rush, SCR sees dip in passenger revenues||The sight of passengers jostling their way into packed trains during Dasara vacation was missing this year. With South Central Railway (SCR) restricting entry to only those with a confirmed ticket in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers fell drastically, like in the rest of the country. 23 specials run Along with the 18 regular special trains originating and terminating within the zone in the last few months in lieu of the regular train movement, the zonal railways had pressed into service 23 festival specials within its region during the nine-day festivities. Nearly 52,000 passengers made use of the facility. This was up from the figures of 32,500 passengers travelling in the 18 regular special trains ever since the lockdown was lifted. But, passenger revenues of Rs. 13-15 crore during these festival times dwindled to Rs. 2.52 crore this year, informed senior officials wishing to remain anonymous. “In the previous years, if 10.5 lakh passengers used to travel daily by 36 regular trains daily, this used to increase to 13 lakh passengers during the festivals through 46 festival special trains per day. We must take into consideration that the passenger count in reserved coaches was 1.5-2 lakh only. Rest of the passengers were travelling jam-packed in four unreserved coaches,” they pointed out. If the usual sleeper coach with 72 berths carried 10-20% more during festivals despite passengers not having a confirmed ticket, the unreserved coaches saw more than double of the 90-seater capacity as railway officials too were “lenient”. “COVID-19 changed everything. We could not allow such crowding anymore and the loss in passenger revenue was huge,” they said. Freight loading up However, as Railway Board chairman V.K. Yadav had mentioned during a media interaction the previous day, freight loading for October surpassed the freight loading of the corresponding period in the previous year showing continued “positive momentum”. It has recorded freight loading of 8.489 metric tonnes compared to the loading of 8.224 MTs recorded during the same time, despite the pandemic. This is the second consecutive month where the monthly freight loading in the current financial year has surpassed the levels recorded during the last financial year. More importantly, upswing in the growth in freight loading continues to be broad-based with higher levels of loading being witnessed in almost all commodities, except coal. It has recorded a growth of 35% increase in cement (2.7 MTs), foodgrains and fertilizers are growing at the rate of 57% and 32% (0.776 MTs and 0.661 MTs, respectively). Container loading, too, has also increased considerably by 25% (0.116 MTs), said General Manager Gajanan Mallya and complimented the sincere efforts of both zonal and divisional teams on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sans-festival-rush-scr-sees-dip-in-passenger-revenues/article33018258.ece

Sajjanar on Tuesday inaugurated the revamped social media wing. The wing aims at understanding the pulse of the public to improve performance of the police and keep up with expectations of society at large, Mr Sajjanar said. “It is not only about being responsive to the needs of the people but also to create awareness about various offences happening in society. The wing also aims at public participation to prevent offences like cyber crimes, economic offences, crime against women and children by empowering them,” the Cyberabad CP added. The wing was launched in August 2014 to monitor different social media handles of the Cyberabad police to transform Telangana State Police into a citizen-friendly and responsive police force, he said. “It was set up to keep an eye on critical issues which are being discussed regularly among citizens on the internet and to bridge the gap between public expectations and delivery of police services,” Mr. Sajjanar said. The wing comprises five teams — Traffic and Road Safety, Cyber Crime, Economic Offences, Women and Child Safety, and Community Outreach — which will concentrate on their respective area of expertise and strive towards creating awareness regarding various crimes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/social-media-wing-of-cyberabad-police-revamped/article33018261.ece

No casualties were reported. While one coach was completely burnt down, another was partially gutted in the fire. Sources in the South Central Railway said that the staff noticed the flames around 1.45 p.m. and alerted the Disaster Response and Fire Services Department. The fire brigade reached the spot and the blaze was extinguished in an hour. “It was not an electric short circuit, some miscreants must have lit a fire near the coaches and fled. The coaches have been halted at the yard for a long time and power supply was disconnected,” he said. The SCR will launch an departmental inquiry to ascertain the exact reason behind the flames, the officer said. A Jeedimetla Fire Service officer said that a call was received at 2 p.m. from the railway station and two fire tenders were pressed into service.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/coaches-of-parked-train-gutted/article33018272.ece
04 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP will win, says Bandi||President of the Telangana state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Tuesday claimed that the high percentage of voting witnessed in the Dubbak constituency byelection was sufficient indication of the party candidate winning. “People have realised the time has come to put a stop to lies and falsehoods about development taken up in the constituency by the ruling TRS. Their arrogance of being in power will be put an end to from here,” the BJP leader said in an interaction with media on Tuesday evening. ‘Tired of TRS’ “People of TS have become tired of the corrupt and dictatorial rule of the TRS. Our party has the strength and resolve to take it on. Despite lots of money being distributed and misuse of official machinery, we will win because of the popularity of the Modi government at the Centre,” he said. The Bhratiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, also Karimnagar MP, charged the Ministers with resorting to false propaganda about law and order problems in the twin cities. “One of our activists tried to commit suicide as he was aggrieved by the police over zealousness in the Dubbak constituency and we are trying to save our injured activists’ life by providing him with best medicare. But, the Ministers decided to politicise the unfortunate incident and tried to divert people’s attention. The days of winning the election from continuously uttering falsehoods, sentiment and sympathy are over,” he said. Mr. Sanjay Kumar once again accused the police of having played a partisan role during the byelection campaign. He took exception to the charge of Centre not providing adequate funds to Telangana and wondered where was the need for a State government if it wanted Central government to do everything. “People are not ready to accept alms from the paltry compensation being offered for the flood-hit families.

04 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Panel calls for world class eco-system||A three-pronged approach to provide fillip to pure-play innovation, develop a world class life sciences eco-system and have enablers for sustainable growth will be the way forward for Telangana to realise its vision of making the Life Science industry, in the State, to $50 billion in revenues by 2030, according to the Life Sciences Advisory Committee. In its Telangana Life Sciences: Vision 2030 report, released on Tuesday by Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao, the Committee, headed Dr. Reddy's Laboratories chairman K.Satish Reddy, also emphasised the need for accelerated growth of the industry. Revenues of the Life Sciences sector in the State were nearly $13 billion and growing at 12% with pharmaceutical companies contributing to 94% and biotech focused entities and medical devices for the rest. The current growth rate, if it continued till 2030, could lead to a three-fold increase in current size. However, to realize the vision of $50 billion in cluster revenues (and $100 billion ecosystem valuation), the sector would need to to grow around 15%, the report said. Also, it called for efforts to make the State the leading clinical trials destination in India. On creation of life sciences eco-system, the Committee said the proposed Pharma City should be conducive to breed an integrated healthcare ecosystem, including the need to boost equipment manufacturing industry. Leading MNCs should be attracted as anchor tenants, the report said. Towards self-reliance in manufacturing of API (active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediaries), the Committee said Telangana, with Hyderabad already the pharmaceutical hub of India, could take some initiatives to develop a strong API industry. This would help de-risk India’s external dependence for sourcing these materials. One of the measures could be to carve out a dedicated cluster for manufacturing API/intermediaries in the upcoming Pharma City.  Sustainable growth On enablers for sustainable growth, the report called for measures to improve ease of running operations seamlessly for existing industry; financial incentives to foster fresh investments; and setting up of an investment promotion body for the State’s Life Sciences sector. It highlighted the need to devise training and finishing programmes to bridge the State’s talent employability gap. The Life Sciences Advisory Committee served as a structured interface for the government with the leaders of industry and academia to brainstorm on ideas, identify opportunities for the State and provide impetus to Telangana’s growth trajectory, a release said. Mr. Rao said: “our vision is to become one of the top Life Sciences clusters in Asia and a leading cluster in the world by 2030. The report prepared by the Life Sciences committee will give us the strategic direction in achieving this vision.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/advisory-panel-calls-for-world-class-eco-system-in-state/article33018264.ece

04 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Singareni plans to extract 30 mt coal in 5 months||In a bid to make up the loss of coal production due to COVID-19 impact this year (2020-21), the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) has set itself a target of mining at least 30 million tonnes of the fossil fuel in the remainder of this fiscal – about five months – and achieve annual production of about 52 million tonnes. Till October-end, the company could achieve only 60% of the target set for the current year due to the break out of COVID-19 that has impacted the economic sector badly. Against its plans to mine 36.42 million tonnes of coal during the first seven months of the current fiscal, Singareni could mine only 22.03 million tonnes of coal. Similarly, against the target of dispatching 37.13 million tonnes of coal till October-end, the company has dispatched 21.86 million tonnes (59% of the target). “Now, we plan to extract an average of six million tonnes of coal every month during the November-March period”, company officials said adding that they have plans to dispatch higher quantity of coal during the remainder of the year. At virtual review meeting held by CMD N. Sridhar with Area General Managers on Tuesday, he stated that the demand for coal from energy, cement and other industries had increased and it would provide an opportunity to the company to make up loss to some extent during the remainder of the financial year. To make up the COVID-induced loss, it had been decided to extract about 30 million tonnes of coal over the five-month period till the closure of this financial year. At least 13.5 lakh cubic meters of overburden had to be removed, Mr. Sridhar said. Public hearing The environmental public hearing for the SCCL’s project proposal for expansion of Gouthamkhani Opencast Project (GKOC) from the present 2.0 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) to 4.0 MTPA in Kothagudem area will be held in Kothagudem on November 27. The proposed project envisages expansion of the GKOC in 902 hectares with a life of the project estimated at two years (up to 2021-22) and coal reserves of 3 to 3.5 million tonnes under the “violation category.” According to sources, the project falls under the “violation category” owing to the excess coal production to meet the burgeoning demand for coal in the past couple of years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/singareni-plans-to-extract-30-mt-coal-in-five-months/article33018291.ece
04 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Don’t insist on non-agricultural property details: High Court||Telangana High Court on Tuesday instructed State government not to insist that people give details of their Aadhaar card and non-agricultural properties during the ongoing collection of details for Dharani portal. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy also directed the government to stop uploading of these details in Dharani portal. Issuing the instructions after hearing contentions in three PIL petitions, the bench directed the government to file counter-affidavit by November 17. The bench noted that prima facie the government’s decision to gather details of citizens’ Aadhaar card, caste and properties to post on Dharani portal was not backed by any statute. “The information kept in public domain, if accessed by third party, will violate the right to privacy which will be an irreparable loss to persons whose information is fed in Dharani portal,” the bench observed. The government had not come out clearly about the steps taken to safeguard such crucial data of citizens, the bench noted. “It is a scary thing if a third party has access to the property details of people,” the bench said. Only in case of welfare schemes, the government can insist for Aadhar details of a citizen, the bench said citing the Supreme Court verdict. The apex court made it clear earlier that caste details of a person should not be sought except in matters relating to extending benefits, the bench said. How can the State government ask for such information from its citizens, the Chief Justice said. Senior counsel Desai Prakas Reddy, appearing for one of the PIL petitioners, questioned how can the government seek Aadhaar details for Dharani portal when it was not backed by any law. There was no transparency in the government action vis-a-vis Dharani portal barring the oral statement made by the Chief Minister. Advocate General B.S. Prasad, presenting contentions of State government, said Dharani portal was part of extending better governance to people. Firewalls were put in place to ensure mischief mongers did not tinker with the records and access the crucial information of citizens. Uploading details of people’s properties in Dharani portal was to come out with robust Revenue laws and administration while extending welfare schemes to the needed citizens, he said. The CJ, citing an English daily’s report that Dharani portal was hacked, said it looked like the government had not taken adequate measures to protect people’s data. The report said there were four other software applications akin to Dharani portal available in Google Playstore and this was creating confusion among the citizens, he said. The pleas would be heard again on November 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dont-insist-on-non-agricultural-property-details-high-court/article33018278.ece

04 November 2020||Mumbai,||Malegaon blast: victim seeks to intervene in Purohit’s plea||Nisar Ahmed Sayyed Bilal, a victim and father of a man who died in the 2008 Malegaon blast, moved the Bombay High Court on Tuesday to intervene in a plea filed by accused Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit seeking to quash all charges against him. Mr. Bilal was represented by former additional solicitor general B.A. Desai who filed an application to be impleaded as a party in Mr. Purohit’s petition filed in September. Former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi, who was appearing for Mr. Purohit, opposed the application. Mr. Rohatgi argued before a Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik, and said quashing of charges were sought because the National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not seek prior sanction to prosecute him as per Section 197 (prosecution of Judges and public servants) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He said since the plea was on procedural ground it did not warrant any intervention by the victims. Mr. Bilal’s application said that he had lost his son in the blast and therefore, he was an aggrieved party in the case who deserved to be heard. The matter was adjourned to November 25. Mr. Rohatgi had previously contended that Mr. Purohit was an army officer and was discharging his official duty by gathering intelligence. He said sanction to prosecute Mr. Purohit had to be taken before taking cognisance of the offence. Mr. Rohatgi had previously challenged sanction to prosecute Mr. Purohit under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/malegaon-blast-victim-seeks-to-intervene-in-purohits-plea/article33017864.ece

04 November 2020||New Delhi,||‘No posters outside homes of patients’||The city government informed the Delhi High Court on Tuesday that it has instructed officials not to paste posters outside homes of COVID-19 patients. It also said many such posters have been ordered to be removed. The government also said its officials have also not been allowed to share details of COVID-19 patients with their neighbours, resident welfare associations or in Whatsapp groups. A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad following the government’s submission, disposed of a petition, seeking framing of guidelines to do away with pasting posters outside homes of COVID-19 patients. Advocate Kush Kalra had contended that freely circulating the names of patients to RWAs and on WhatsApp groups was “leading to stigmatisation and drawing of unnecessary attention”. The petition said positive patients “ought to be given privacy to cope with and recover from the illness in peace and away from prying eyes. Rather they are being made the centre of public attention...” The petition further claimed that this has resulted in persons “shying away and deliberately choosing not to test themselves” to shield themselves from the “public embarrassment and stigmatisation”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/no-posters-outside-homes-of-patients/article33017841.ece
04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Can give Delhi more ventilators: Centre||The Union Health Ministry has said that it will provide additional ventilators for treating COVID-19 patients if required in Delhi. The move comes after several private hospitals in the Capital indicated a near 100% ICU ventilator bed-occupancy and government hospitals displayed availability of only a few beds. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said: “Though no requirement has been indicated so far, we are in a position to give support if required.” He added that the government is doing a daily review of bed availability in Central government hospitals in Delhi and currently 80 beds in RML Hospital, 140 in Safdarjung and 1,200 in AIIMS are available. “Private hospitals have been asked to display the number of COVID-19 beds and their availability,” he added. Speaking about the rising number of cases in some parts of the country and the need to maintain caution, NITI Aayog (health) member V.K. Paul said: “While we appeal to everyone to wear a mask, we also appeal the older population to stay indoors as much as possible. NCR is an urban conglomerate and hence spike in Delhi, Faridabad, and Gurugram should be seen together in relation with pollution, individual behaviour, surveillance and containment key.”  Private hospitals have been asked to display the number of COVID-19 beds and their availability   Rajesh Bhushan Health Secretary||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/can-give-delhi-more-ventilators-centre/article33017843.ece
04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||On-demand COVID-19 testing facility at IGIA||Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) on Tuesday announced that it would offer on-demand COVID-19 testing facility for domestic and international passengers before their departure from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA). To cost Rs. 2,400 DIAL, in a statement, said that the facility will be beneficial for those passengers who are taking an international or domestic flight but don’t have an RT-PCR test result. “Such passengers can come to the airport around six hours before departure and get the COVID-19 test done at the airport by paying Rs. 2,400 and get the result in 4 to 6 hours,” it said.

04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Make plan to identify encroached waterbodies in U.P.’||Following a plea alleging diversion of waterbodies in Ghaziabad for industrial purposes, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary to prepare a uniform action plan for identification and conservation of such waterbodies. A Bench headed by the National Green Tribunal chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel took note of a report furnished by the Ghaziabad District Magistrate that around 72% of the water bodies had been encroached upon. NGT pulls up SPCB Following this, the Bench observed: “We find that action taken by State Pollution Control Board is neither adequate nor in the right direction. It appears that the officers concerned are not conversant with the law of the land, which is resulting in serious damage to the environment. Waterbodies are the lifeline of the environment for groundwater recharge, storage of water for different purposes, for microclimate, aesthetics and so on.” Stating that there was an “alarming level of encroachment” in Ghaziabad, the Bench said, “This needs attention of the authorities at the State-level and special plan and drive is necessary for identification and conservation of such water bodies for enforcement of rule of law and protection of environment.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/make-plan-to-identify-encroached-waterbodies-in-up/article33017854.ece
04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Look into injunction against construction of drains’||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Integrated Drain Management Cell (IDMC) to consider a plea seeking an injunction against construction of drains in place of sewer lines at Chhatarpur Enclave. The plea had contended that open drains and a lack of proper sewage lines adversely affect public health. A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel noted that the IDMC had been set up under the Delhi Chief Secretary to oversee maintenance of drains and related issues. Calls for action “We are of the view that the issue raised in the application needs to be considered by the IDMC in the first instance. We order accordingly a copy of this order along with application be forwarded to member secretary, IDMC, that is CEO, DJJB for appropriate consideration and action in accordance with law,” the Bench said. The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by petitioner Mahesh Chandra Saxena seeking an injunction against construction of drains in place of sewer lines at Chhatarpur Enclave. Stating that in 1,700 illegal colonies in the city, drains, septic tanks and soaks pits were constructed, the plea said, “This is a source of pollution of groundwater. Rainwater harvesting systems were to be constructed for which directions have been issued by the tribunal but it is not being done. The result is that rainwater is mixing in the wastewater.” It contended, “The Delhi government has started construction of drains instead of providing pipelines for collection of sewage.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/look-into-injunction-against-construction-of-drains/article33017842.ece

The decision was taken after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal convened a meeting with a delegation from the National Restaurant Association of India on October 7. He told several Ministers and top officials of various departments to remove hassles to promote ease of doing business for the restaurant industry.

04 November 2020||Staff Reporter Mumbai,||Political slugfest over Metro car shed site||Maharashtra is witnessing a fresh round of war of words between the coalition State government and the Centre with the latter claiming ownership of the land identified for a Metro car shed in Kanjurmarg. In a letter to the Chief Secretary, the Central government’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)has said the decision to construct Metro car shed on DPIIT’s 102-acre land in Kanjurmarg has caused it severe loss. The letter asked the Chief Secretary to take steps to stop the ongoing construction. While sources in the State government said the letter is not unexpected, they reiterated that all precautions were taken before finalising the site. Quick to react, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar asked, “If the salt commissioner says that the land belongs to it, then how can the government announce construction of car shed on this land?” The NCP and Congress slammed the BJP alleging it was using the central government to stop projects in Maharashtra. “The said land at Kanjurmarg belongs to the State government since 1981. In 2015, under BJP government, the then divisional commissioner had clearly said that the salt commissionerate could not produce evidence that the land belonged to them. The then Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil sanctioned it,” Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. Mr. Sawant said that for last three years, the Salt Department did not bother to challenge the decision in court. “Now that the state government started its Metro work, it has suddenly woken up to claim the land. This is not a coincidence,” he added. “Initially the BJP had said that the land belongs to private individuals. Now, the central government is saying that the land belongs to them. It clearly means that BJP is purposely creating mischief to halt the project,” said Nawab Malik, state’s Minority Affairs minister and senior NCP leader. The State Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “The Kanjurmarg land has always been with the Stateas per revenue records. The Collector, Mumbai Suburban has done due diligence of all land records and all sub-judice matters.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/political-slugfest-over-metro-car-shed-site/article33017862.ece

04 November 2020||Washington,||Americans vote as country braces for unrest||By the time Americans started lining up at the polls on Tuesday, an unprecedented number of their fellow citizens — just under 100 million — had already voted, either by mail or via in-person early voting. Both candidates and their star campaigners dashed across swing States urging Americans to vote and to vote for their vision of the future. Also unprecedented in the modern history of a country that likes to be called the “world’s oldest democracy” was the anticipation of possible violence and civil unrest in the event of a contested election. U.S. President Donald Trump, who wrapped up his campaign on Monday night in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as he had done in 2016, continued to question the legitimacy of some mail-in ballots. Democratic candidate Joe Biden concluded his campaign on Monday where it began — in Pittsburgh. Mr. Biden began Tuesday with a visit to St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church in Wilmington, Delaware, with his wife Jill and their granddaughters, visiting the graves of his late son Beau and his first wife and their daughter. Mr. Biden, then flew to Scranton, Pennsylvania, his birth place, for a “get out the vote” event. Mr. Trump had an interview with Fox News on Tuesday morning followed by a trip to his campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, to thank staffers. Mr. Trump is expected to receive the election results at the White House. Virus continues to rage The U.S. witnessed a record 99,000 COVID-19 cases in a single day (Friday) and the case load was in key swing States like Michigan and Pennsylvania. At a drive-in rally in Pittsburgh on Monday, Mr. Biden addressed black voters, highlighting the fact that COVID-19 has hit blacks and other racial minorities disproportionately and talking about other ways in which the current administration has adversely impacted the African America community. “Tomorrow, we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate across this nation, pouring gasoline on every racial incident in the country,” he said. “It’s going to be very clear what this country is tomorrow,” singer Lady Gaga, who sang at one of Mr. Biden’s Pittsburgh events, said. Over in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Vice-President Mike Pence took the stage before Mr. Trump at a final rally. “Under President Donald Trump, we’re going to defeat the virus and the best is yet to come,” he said. Mr. Trump flipped Michigan in 2016 from the Democrats, beating opponent Hillary Clinton by 0.3 percentage points. Going into the elections, Mr. Biden was leading Mr. Trump in the polls in the State. “We made history together four years ago and tomorrow we’re going to make history once again,” Mr Trump told the crowd at Grand Rapids. Postal ballots On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has criticised the counting of postal ballots received after November 3. He also took to social media to amplify his message. “The Supreme Court decision on voting in Pennsylvania is a VERY dangerous one,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. “It will allow rampant and unchecked cheating and will undermine our entire systems of laws. It will also induce violence in the streets. Something must be done!” The Supreme Court has refused (thus far) to interfere in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision to permit counting of ballots till Friday — providing they were postmarked on or before November 3. Mr. Trump’s post was hidden by a Twitter notice that said the tweet was “misleading”. Facebook also announced that a team would be monitoring attempts on its site to suppress the vote and intimidate voters.“ This team is also tracking other issues that arise, like the potentially dangerous activity we saw with the swarming of Biden campaign buses this weekend. We are monitoring closely and will remove content calling for coordinated harm or interference with anyone’s ability to vote,” Facebook said in a tweet. Facebook (including Instagram) and Twitter will label attempts to declare victory prematurely. Facebook will add a label saying “Votes are being counted” and direct users to agencies like the Associated Press and Reuters. Twitter will permit a candidate to declare victory only after they confirm the results (relying on election officials and verification from at least two major news outlets). They will also use algorithms and people to tackle misinformation spread via bots. Axios reported Mr. Trump as saying he would declare victory on Tuesday night if it looks like he is “ahead”. Civil unrest Local governments, businesses and citizens across the country prepared for civil unrest over a bitterly contested election. In downtown Washington DC, construction teams were seen using plywood to board up the ground floors of several glass buildings in the run up to November 3. The White House built a “non-scalable” fence around its perimeter. Additional fencing has gone up in Lafayette Square — the site of summer protests against racial injustice. Six hundred troops of the National Guard have been put on standby to assist any State or the District of Columbia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/americans-vote-as-country-braces-for-unrest/article33017550.ece
04 November 2020||Doha,||Qatar Emir sets first national election for next October||Qatar’s ruler said on Tuesday that a long delayed vote for the country’s policy reviewing chamber will be held in October 2021, marking the Gulf emirate’s first national election. The currently un-elected Shura Council advises the absolute ruler, Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, on draft laws but does not create its own legislation and can be overruled by a simple decree. October’s vote would be Qatar’s first national election although Sheikh Tamim did not give details on who would be permitted to vote or who would be able to stand. Qataris have previously been able to cast ballots on constitutional reforms and in elections to a nationwide municipal council. “The Shura Council elections will be held in October of next year to strengthen the traditions of the Qatari shura, with wider participation by citizens,” the Emir said in a speech to open the 49th session of the council. Elections to the council, required under the country’s 2004 Constitution, have been postponed repeatedly and the body’s members have instead been directly appointed by the emir. Cautious reform Qatar has undergone cautious reform on issues including democracy, worker rights and representation of women since Sheikh Tamim came to power in 2013. “We are taking an important step in strengthening the Qatari consultative traditions and developing the legislative process with the participation of a wider range of citizens,” Sheikh Tamim said. “We have our solid system rooted in the structure of our society and... it is not a multi-party system, but rather an emirate system based on established traditions of fair and rational governance.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/qatar-emir-sets-first-national-election-for-next-october/article33017556.ece
04 November 2020||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka rescues 120 stranded whales||Pooling their manpower and expertise in a joint overnight operation, Sri Lanka’s navy, coast guard, local volunteers and conservation experts have rescued nearly 120 stranded whales and pulled them back to the deep sea. On Monday afternoon, residents of Panadura — some 25 km south of Colombo on the island’s west coast — reported sighting a school of whales by the shore. Within hours the Sri Lankan navy and Coast guard deployed nearly 70 personnel to the spot. “With conservation experts guiding us and many local volunteers helping, the team was able to pull back the whales into the deep waters, using jet skis,” Navy spokesman Captain Indika de Silva told The Hindu . However, three whales and one dolphin were found dead along the shore, said Dharshani Lahandapura, chairperson of the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), following the unprecedented mass stranding in the country. Timely aid Locals played a crucial part in rescuing the whales, battling crashing waves in the dark, noted Sri Lankan marine biologist Asha de Vos said in a social media post, that likened the whales’ plight to “being stuck in a treadmill”. Sharing updates from the spot, she said: “If they [locals] looked like they were wrestling the animals it is because they were doing everything in their power to manage animals that were between 10-18 feet, weighing in at 1000-3000 kg. The animals were fatigued and stressed, they were smashing their tails around - which was risky for the people in the water.” According to MEPA authorities, the marine mammals were short-finned pilot whales, that are said to be found in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-rescues-120-stranded-whales/article33017560.ece
04 November 2020||Washington,||Both parties race to control the Senate||Control of the Senate is a razor-close proposition in Tuesday’s election, as Republicans fight to retain their majority against a surge of Democratic candidates confronting the President’s allies across a vast political map. Both parties see paths to victory, and the outcome might not be known on election night. From New England to the Deep South, the Midwest to the Mountain West, Republican Senators are defending seats in States once considered long shots for Democrats. Washington’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, the economic fallout and the nation’s uneasy mood are all on the ballot. Stunning amounts of cash have been flowing to Democrats from millions of Americans apparently voting with their pocketbooks; Republicans are tapping deep-pocketed donors to shore up GOP Senators. Securing the Senate majority will be vital for the winner of the presidency. Senators confirm administration nominees, including the Cabinet, and can propel or stall the White House agenda. With Republicans now controlling the chamber, 53-47, three or four seats will determine party control, depending on who wins the presidency because the Vice-President can break a tie. The campaigns are competing across an expansive Senate map as Democrats put Republicans on defence deep into Trump country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/both-parties-race-to-control-the-senate/article33017552.ece

Gunmen barged into the university on Monday, in what was the second attack on an educational institution in the capital in just over a week. Both have been claimed by Islamic State. The two sources told Reuters that most of those killed were students and around 50 more people were wounded, some of them breaking limbs while jumping from windows to flee from the attack during morning classes. Officially the death toll stands at 22 with 27 wounded, according to the Interior Ministry. The country held a day of mourning on Tuesday, with many flags flying at half mast. Around 100 students gathered outside the university in protest. “Although we see these kinds of attacks on a daily basis, there are still ongoing peace talks with them, which is really terrible,” said one protesting student, Zaryab Paryani.

04 November 2020||WASHINGTON,||Election Day shadowed by threats of legal tangles||Even before Election Day, the 2020 race was the most litigated in memory. President Donald Trump is promising more to come. The candidates and parties have enlisted prominent lawyers with ties to Democratic and Republican administrations should that litigation take on a new urgency if a narrow margin in a battleground State becomes the difference between another four years for Trump or a Joe Biden administration. A Pennsylvania case at the Supreme Court pits Donald Verrilli, who was President Barack Obama’s top Supreme Court lawyer, against John Gore, a onetime high-ranking Trump Justice Department official. Mr. Trump said this weekend he was headed to court to prevent Pennsylvania from counting mailed ballots that are received in the three days after the election. On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that as soon as the polls close, “We’re going in with our lawyers.” There’s already been roughly 300 lawsuits over the election filed in dozens of States across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/election-day-shadowed-by-threats-of-legal-tangles/article33017553.ece

Public broadcaster RTHK said officers searched producer Choy Yuk-ling’s home following her arrest. Police confirmed the operation on Tuesday evening, saying Ms. Choy was arrested on suspicion of making an improper application to access car owner details. RTHK drew a direct link between Ms. Choy’s arrest and an investigation, she co-produced into the “Yuen Long attack” — an assault in July last year by dozens of men armed with sticks on people returning from a protest. “The show revealed how police were patrolling the town before the rampage and took no action over the men wielding weapons,” RTHK said in a tweet announcing Ms. Choy’s arrest. In a documentary titled Who Owns The Truth?, RTHK used footage filmed by witnesses and security cameras — as well as public number plate searches and interviews — to piece together what happened that night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-scribe-who-probed-mob-attack-held/article33017554.ece

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||A fragile French republic||The recent series of terrorist attacks have come at the worst possible time for France. For months, the country has been struggling with a surge in COVID-19 cases. The recent lockdown, with its onerous paperwork requirements and sharp restrictions on everyday life, has been greeted with a weary shrug by most French people. This time, they know what to expect. It is much the same with the spectre of terrorism, which has been around for far longer than COVID-19. The French have become grimly accustomed to watching news reports about attacks committed against French citizens in the name of Islam. Even the media carousel has become familiar. There is footage of the crime scene, cordoned off, with the flashing lights of police cars and ambulances. This is followed by a brief period of uncertainty about the cause or the perpetrators, usually accompanied by the sombre faces of politicians. Finally, as information starts to trickle out, the emotions flood in, the chat shows light up, and the public pronouncements begin. The symbol of Samuel Paty Yet, despite the predictable storyline, all but the most cynical observers were taken aback by the assassination of the schoolteacher Samuel Paty. Ambushed and beheaded on October 16, 2020 in a leafy, genteel distant suburb of Paris, Paty stood accused by his assailant of having violated the long-standing Muslim tradition that prohibits representations of the Prophet Muhammad. The attacker was an 18-year-old Chechen refugee who lived 80 kilometres from the scene of the attack. He had heard on social media that Paty had shown in class some of the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, which were published by the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2011 and 2012. More than five years after the first, devastating attack on Charlie Hebdo ’s office in January 2015 — and with the perpetrators currently standing trial — Paty’s assassination was designed to shock the French public and produce a reaction across the Muslim world by reigniting a culture war that had begun to fade in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. But the symbolism went further than spectacular violence. Paty was a history and geography teacher in a French state school. His job, like mine, was to teach young people about the importance of the past. He was leading a class on free speech. By all accounts, he was careful and sensitive in the way he presented his material, including the cartoons in Charlie Hebdo . He was doing what every good teacher does: pushing his students to think differently about the world around them. Paty, then, was anything but exceptional. Every person who has attended a French school in the past century or more has had a history and geography teacher like him. He was — quite literally — a symbol of the everyday life of France. Schools and secularism The powerful reaction to Paty’s assassination was not simply a reflection of the fact that everyone could identify with him. It also had to do with his profession. Since the start of the Third Republic in 1870, teachers have been at the forefront of the French state’s mission to unify its diverse population. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, state school teachers were responsible for converting young people in rural France away from the heavy hand of Catholic dogma, and they spearheaded efforts to “educate” and “civilise” indigenous peoples in the French colonies. In recent decades, teachers have been charged with trying to “integrate” France’s myriad ethnic minority communities. They are seen — and often see themselves — as engines of social unity in a notoriously divided country. Of the many things that teachers are expected to do, one of the most important is to embody the principles of laïcité . Often translated as ‘secularism’, laïcité is better understood as a project of social cohesion and a key component of French citizenship. It encompasses not simply the formal separation of Church and State, but also the evacuation of religious values from the public space and their replacement with secular values such as liberty, equality, and fraternity. Traditionally, teachers have seen laïcité as a progressive idea. But its meaning in contemporary France no longer always matches the lofty principles that underpin it. Indeed, for many people today, laïcité is mainly about Islam. This reflects France’s recent history. The decolonisation of the French colonies in Africa in the 1950s and 1960s brought the problem of Islam into sharp focus, as the French tried and failed to manage Muslims in unprecedented numbers. Subsequently, France was the site of violence that spilled over from the Algerian Civil War in the 1990s. Around the same time, it also experienced a series of public controversies over the wearing of the hijab in state schools and other public places, often spurred on by a far-right party committed to the stigmatisation of immigrants and Muslims. These factors hardened attitudes towards both Islam and laïcité. While it once was a bulwark against Catholic obscurantism, laïcité also came to be used as a rhetorical tool against French Muslims. France thereafter became a prime target in the new wave of global Islamist violence that took off in the early 2010s. Compromise or conflict So how should France respond to the ongoing threat of terrorist attacks in the name of Islam? One way would be to compromise. This would involve acknowledging that laïcité alone cannot fix the country’s social and political problems. It would also require the French state to recognise that France has — almost without realising it — become part of the Muslim world. It cannot stand apart from conflicts over religious practice that have affected countries with much larger Muslim populations, from Morocco to Indonesia. Another way would be to double down on French “values”. This is the path that President Emmanuel Macron has chosen. He and his cabinet have spent a lot of time in recent weeks emphasising the importance of laïcité and denouncing all those who are seen to threaten it. In the light of the most recent attack on a church in Nice — committed by a young Tunisian man who seems to have travelled to France for this express purpose — such a defensive posture makes sense. But Mr. Macron’s strategy is a risky one. For a start, it is almost guaranteed to elicit a hostile response from leaders of Muslim-majority countries, many of whom are keen to find an international issue that can distract from their own domestic problems. More than that, however, the continuous invocation of laïcité risks eroding its meaning. Since the late 19th century, laïcité has been used to integrate different social and religious minorities into the national community, but it has taken on a more exclusionary and anti-Muslim quality in recent years. Paradoxically, this has made it hard for the very people whose job it is to teach these values — people like the late Samuel Paty. In his case, a genuine commitment to freedom of expression — an essential part of laïcité — was manipulated by his attacker to make it appear as if he was intent on pursuing an anti-Muslim agenda. So, while it might seem like a good strategy to use the idea of laïcité as a shield against an amorphous Muslim threat, the danger is that this will strip it of its most positive elements and render it useless as an instrument of social integration. That, more than any terror attack, would be a tragedy for all French people — Muslim or not. Emile Chabal is a Reader in History at the University of Edinburgh.

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Hitting fossil fuel companies where it hurts||One way to undermine activities connected with elite networks of the fossil fuel industry complex is to take aim at their finances. Initial attempts to do this by some environmentalists were ridiculed as being too feeble. But we should recall that the ultimate collapse of apartheid in South Africa was due to hardship caused to the regime by the divestment movement. A committed campaign by various organisations has, over the last decade or more, systematically attacked equity, or investments, and loans, or credit, available to the fossil fuel industry. The campaign’s persistence is finally being noticed for its successes. How much fossil fuel wealth is at stake? Saudi Aramco’s revenue in 2019 was $111.1 billion, Royal Dutch Shell’s revenue was $23.9 billion, and Exxon Mobil’s was $20.8 billion — and these are just three companies. Arguments for divestment do not apply to India at this time. The reason is that India’s contribution to the stock of greenhouse gases is minimal. Even in terms of annual flows, the country’s contribution is less than two tonnes of CO2/capita. But policymakers should take note that the costs of production and storage of renewables are falling precipitously and we therefore need to be poised to make a just transition away from coal in the near future. This process will be complex and necessarily involve many sectors and activities including land restoration, local jobs, and timely transfer of storage technologies for renewable energy, apart from dealing with entrenched vested and political interests. Recent reports from Prayas and the Centre for Science and Environment provide pathways for coal power plants to retire in a meaningful time frame. Pulling the rug A large network of activists including Rainforest Action Network, 350.org, Go Fossil Free, People and Planet, youth protesters, university students and faculty, and committed people have been undertaking systematic organised drives for divestment from fossil fuel companies. Divestment is the process by which money put into stocks and bonds of certain companies is withdrawn. In this case, divestment has been directed against companies that extract, refine, sell and make profits from fossil fuels. The purpose is to restrict fossil fuel companies’ ability to function with no regard for their impact on climate change. The divestment operations targeted large investment funds. These are primarily faith-based, philanthropic, educational, pension, insurance, and metropolitan funds. Noteworthy among those that have divested are the World Council of Churches, large pension funds from France and Australia, the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, New York City, many U.K. universities, the University of California, and Columbia University. Withdrawal from investing has been ‘partial’ (from certain kinds of fossil fuels such as tar sands) or ‘full’ (from all fossil fuels). As of 2019, it is estimated that more than $11 trillion in assets has been committed to divestment from fossil fuels. Targeting banks that provide loans to fossil fuel groups, organisations that are part of this movement have been hitting the bull’s eye quite often. What drew media attention recently was that Goldman Sachs announced that it would, among other things, no longer finance new oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and also not provide capital for some of the worst kinds of coal mines, such as mountain-top mining. According to the 2020 report Banking on Climate Change by the Rainforest Action Network, after the Paris Agreement of 2015, where countries agreed to try to limit average global warming to well below 2oC, global banks continued to finance the fossil fuel industry with $2.7 trillion. The report finds that big U.S. banks dominate this arena with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citi being the world’s top fossil fuel financiers. In other parts of the world, the Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays in the U.K., the Bank of China and MUFG in Japan dominate the scene. The main fossil fuel sub-sectors are oil from tar sands; Arctic oil and gas, for which financing has been increasing; fracked oil and gas; liquefied natural gas; mining of coal, for which financing is dominated by Chinese banks; and coal power financing, again led by Chinese banks. Banks support companies that are expanding fossil fuels, including new kinds of fuel and in new places. A total of $975 billion was the bank financing for 100 key oil, gas, and coal companies between 2016 and 2019. The report uses a point system to assess bank policies on ending financing of fossil fuels and finds that Crédit Agricole performs best even though it makes only about 40% of the possible points. This demonstrates how misaligned the banking sector is with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Having an effect That these efforts are having an effect is seen from statements made in various finance and investment-related documents. According to a recent report of the climate-related Market Risk Subcommittee (a body under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an independent agency of the U.S. government), climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system. Regulators need to assess, understand and act on them. Divestment appears to be putting the squeeze on the industry. On October 6, Daniel Pinto, the co-President of JPMorgan Chase and CEO of its Corporate and Investment Bank, announced that the company would “help clients navigate the challenges and capitalise on long-term economic and environmental benefits of a low-carbon world”. The bank proposes establishing a Center for Carbon Transition and setting “intermediate emission targets for 2030” for its financing portfolio. Companies going bankrupt state that the divestment movement is making it difficult to raise capital. Shell, for instance, considers the movement a “material risk”. When banks and investors begin to shift away from fossil fuel companies because they become risky business, then the campaign must be having an effect. The UC Regents’ Investment Committee Chair said that the University of California was divesting not for ethical reasons but because it considers fossil companies to be risky. The divestment movement against banks is gathering steam. Three members of the Rockefeller family have set up BankFWD, which aims to persuade major banks to phase out financing for fossil fuels. All of these changes are positive steps. Whether these will effectively pull the planet from the brink is unclear.

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||A lifetime of anti-apartheid struggle||“What have we not done for our country? Some of us died; Some of us gave speeches” - Orhavan Veli, Turkish poet and activist: Enuga Sreenivasulu Reddy, who died at 96, on November 1, quoted those lines in an article in Mainstream’s annual number in 1991. In so doing, the former Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations (1983-1985) and long-serving Director of its Anti-Apartheid Centre, was of course laughing at himself. He could laugh at himself. But no one who knew him could miss the importance of his speeches and writings, his lobbying and campaigning on the subject of South Africa’s struggle, that of other southern African nations, and the Palestinian cause as well. Many a leader — Indian, South African, European — have delivered speeches written by Enuga Reddy, to great effect and applause. Unparalleled humility E.S., as I knew and called him over the last four decades and more, took the world body’s responsibilities and its stirring Charter seriously. But never his own contributions to their mandates. In fact, he under-stated his work to the point of obscuring it. “You must write your memoirs, E.S.,” I would urge him, as did many of his friends in India, South Africa and elsewhere. “There are better ways of spending time,” he would always say, “even for a person who has retired.” Not that he had time to spare in his retirement. His wife of over seven decades, Niloufer, knew that well. His apartment overflowed with reams and reams of documents and books. He would donate trolley-full of them to universities and archives. But they would keep piling up. And if asked, which those “better ways of spending time” were, he would say “Researching and documenting the work of un-acknowledged freedom fighters in India and of those who gave their best years to the liberation struggle in South Africa, many dying in the course of their work.” I told him, “There are others who can do that ... but no one other than you can tell the story of how a student in Madras way back in the 1940s got interested in the South African struggle, and how, as a scholar freshly arrived in the U.S., met, at a New York reception, Dr. A.B. Xuma, President-General of the African National Congress, who had come to lobby the United Nations Organisation (UNO), thus beginning a life-long association with anti-apartheid work at the UNO and beyond.” “This self-effacing method of yours,” I ventured, “ may be a good addition to the chronicles of humility, they are not good for our curiosity about the India-South Africa connect”. “Oh…humility! That is a virtue reserved for giants,” E.S. said, reminding me of the famous instance of Golda Meir ticking off a minister in her cabinet: “Don’t be so humble-humble, You are not that great.” So, if you could not remonstrate with E.S. about his humility, you were not allowed to flag it either. If, therefore, the news of his death, or, in fact, his name does not send bells ringing today, there is one person utterly unaffected — E.S. himself. He excelled in working beyond human scales of stamina, perseverance and meticulousness. The books he authored on South Africa and on personalities who interested him are numerous. The books he helped others to author, giving them almost complete, ready-to-print drafts, are even more numerous. To him also goes the credit of strengthening the genre of co-authored books, in which the co-author was that but in name, with E.S. having done most of the work — I being one among those lucky ‘co’s. E.S. helped scholars like no one I knew. No one I know helped E.S. He was entirely self-made. His help to researchers, biographers, writers of papers for journals has not been paralleled by anyone I know. Venu Madhav Govindu, biographer with Deepak Malghan, of J.C. Kumarappa, has this to say: “Fifteen years ago, when he learnt that I was working on a biography of J.C. Kumarappa, he promptly went off to the New York Public Library and painstakingly downloaded every article on J.C. and Bharatan Kumarappa from theNew York TimesandWashington Postarchives. He did this at the age of eighty, for someone he barely knew.” Intimately connected India, South Africa and the UN were the tripod of his political mind. Joining the United Nations Secretariat as a Political Affairs Officer in the Section for Africa and the Middle East as a 25-year-old in 1949, he made it his business to come to know the American Committee on Africa and other organisations supporting freedom for Africa. And by the time he was appointed Principal Secretary of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid in 1963, he had come to know and be valued by Oliver Tambo. “Not Mandela,” E.S. told me more than once, “but Tambo is the South African Gandhi. For Tambo the liberation of South Africa was a call that came from his inner voice. Mandela is more a Nehru-like figure, guided by the force of his intellectual conviction and the strength of reason to do all that he did.” Small wonder that Adelaide Tambo, the great leader's wife, looked upon E.S. as her ‘brother’. This I can say with complete conviction — No Indian I know was acquainted as intimately with Africans from all walks of life as E.S. was. And this broad-sweep statement of mine includes Indians settled in Africa. How and why is that? E.S. had no agenda, either of his own or for India’s diplomacy. He was a product of the Indian freedom struggle’s ethos, and that made him relate instinctively to that of Africa. He was twinned to the idea of human freedom, social justice, and the ending of man’s exploitation of man. This made him “family” to many famous people, like Olof Palme, for instance, and Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, and also to many who may not have that level of fame, but had what E.S. would call “the weight of contribution” — like the Naidoos of South Africa, descendants of Gandhi’s South Africa colleague, Thambi Naidoo. At E.S.’s instance, Thambi Naidoo’s daughter-in-law, Ama Naidoo, and her daughter, Shanthie, were invited to India by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and introduced to India’s political leadership. Ama Naidoo speaking to a small gathering on the South African struggle and being heard with rapt attention by two Indian women revolutionaries — Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and Aruna Asaf Ali — was a long-distance achievement of E.S. Enuga Reddy was India’s un-official High Commissioner in South Africa, and more respected for being un-accredited. But beyond that, he was Asia’s envoy to Africa, and equally, Africa’s Asian delegate to the United Nations. He was the de facto rapporteur in the universe of the non-aligned. Ninety-six is a long enough span to have lived, and yet I cannot but mourn with countless others the passing of a man whose death impoverishes modern political historiography. It breaks the only link of its kind between India, Africa, the U.S., and the world’s political ‘south’, at a time when virulent nationalisms need countering. How one wishes he could have had the pleasure of seeing voters in the United States of America give the democratic world great good news.

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Academia and the free will||India announced its National Education Policy (NEP) on July 29 this year. The policy aims at overhauling the educational system in the country and making “India a global knowledge superpower”, with a new system that is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal-4 (SDG 4). It also emphasises universal access to schools for all children, raising the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER), and ending the spiralling dropout rate in India. The academic community is still debating and weighing the pros and cons of the NEP. However, one of the key disappointments is that the real problem plaguing the educational system in the country and the higher education system, the erosion of academic freedom, is being discussed by nobody. India has scored considerably low in the international Academic Freedom Index (AFI) with a score of 0.352, which is closely followed by Saudi Arabia (0.278) and Libya (0.238). In the last five years, the AFI of India has dipped by 0.1 points. Surprisingly, countries like Malaysia (0.582), Pakistan (0.554), Brazil (0.466), Somalia (0.436) and Ukraine (0.422) have scored better than India. Uruguay and Portugal top the AFI, with scores of 0.971 each, followed closely by Latvia (0.964) and Germany (0.960). The many claims in NEP 2020 The AFI and the accompanying report quantify the freedom of scholars to discuss politically and culturally controversial topics, without fearing for their life, studies or profession — an aspect where India is failing terribly. In such a scenario, it is important to look into what the NEP 2020 has to offer. The NEP 2020 claims that it is based on principles of creativity and critical thinking and envisions an education system that is free from political or external interference. For instance, the policy states that faculty will be given the “freedom to design their own curricular and pedagogical approaches within the approved framework, including textbook and reading material selections, assignments and assessments”. It also suggests constituting a National Research Foundation (NRF), a merit-based and peer-reviewed research funding, which “will be governed, independently of the government, by a rotating Board of Governors consisting of the very best researchers and innovators across fields”. However, the question is whether these promises and offers will be put into practice or remain just a rhetoric. The AFI has cited the ‘Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project’, to suggest that the political tensions in India may have something to do with declining ‘academic freedom’. The police brutality against students at Jamia Millia Islamia University and Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, and their being labelled as anti-nationals, has raised concerns about the state of academic freedom. Rent-seeking culture The AFI used eight components to evaluate the scores: freedom to research and teach, freedom of academic exchange and dissemination, institutional autonomy, campus integrity, freedom of academic and cultural expression, constitutional protection of academic freedom, international legal commitment to academic freedom under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and existence of universities. India has not fared well in components like institutional autonomy, campus integrity, freedom of academic and cultural expression and constitutional protection of academic freedom. Most universities in the country are subjected to unsolicited interference from governments in both academic and non-academic issues. It is common knowledge by now that a majority of appointments, especially to top-ranking posts like that of vice-chancellors, pro vice-chancellors and registrars, have been highly politicised. Such political appointments not only choke academic and creative freedom, but also lead to corrupt practices, including those in licensing and accreditation, thus promoting unhealthy favouritism and nepotism in staff appointments and student admissions. This reflects a ‘rent-seeking culture’ within the academic community. At present, many educational institutions and regulatory bodies, both at the Central and State levels, are headed by bureaucrats. However, the NEP 2020 aims to de-bureaucratise the education system by giving governance powers to academicians. It also talks about giving autonomy to higher education institutions by handing over their administration to a board comprising academicians. This may help de-bureaucratise the education system and reduce political interference to an extent.

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Averting volatile poll outcomes||With the arrival of voting day in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, one thing is clear: the final results are not going to be known any time soon. On the one hand, mail-in voting, absentee voting, and other forms of early voting have attracted voters in numbers that are unparalleled in recent times, and analysts predict that close to 100 million votes would have already been cast by November 3. Simultaneously, incumbent President Donald Trump has, through the blistering heat of the election campaign since the summer, been pouring vitriol on mail-in voting as a fraud-plagued practice that will lead to a rigged outcome, favouring Democrats. The reality is that the rate of voting fraud in the U.S. is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to a 2007 study by the Brennan Center for Justice, among others. In light of the controversy whipped up by Mr. Trump, which has seen social media tech platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, slap ‘Fact Check’ labels on some of his incendiary posts on this subject, the head of the non-partisan Federal Election Commission (FEC), Ellen Weintraub, said, “There is simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud.” The fear in this case is not so much the ignorance about mail-in voting, but rather, in the eventuality that if Mr. Trump loses by a narrow margin, he and his followers may seize upon the rare instance when mail-in voting has led to calls for a vote recount — as it happened in a 2018 North Carolina primary, when a consultant for Republican candidate Mark Harris tampered with voting papers — and escalate to the courts allegations of outright election rigging. Mr. Trump has already suggested that the only victory that his Democratic rival and former Vice-President Joe Biden could enjoy would be a rigged one. Speaking to media in the final hours of campaigning in North Carolina, he said, “As soon as the election is over, we are going in with our lawyers.” In such a situation, it is not inconceivable that the closed-door dispute resolution mechanism including the Congress, the Electoral College and the FEC would sanction the House of Representatives deciding the outcome as a “contingent election”, based on one-State-one-vote, which is likely to improve the odds of the Republican Party. Limited solutions For those concerned about a peaceful transition of power — something Mr. Trump has repeatedly refused to commit to, should he lose — it is worrying that there is considerable room for legal manoeuvres afforded to a disgruntled candidate in a U.S. presidential election. There is a real prospect of civil unrest in these circumstances, given the rise of urban militias, many waving slogans in support of Mr. Trump, but also a few led by African American outfits — all of them potentially clashing violently on the streets in the event of a disputed election. No more proof need be offered that this is not an alarmist concern, than the case of thirteen militia men arrested by the FBI recently for plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and violently overthrow the State government. Only one act by the outgoing Commander in Chief — if indeed he loses the election — could quell what will otherwise become a season of discontent for American democracy: a concession speech. Yet, there is no constitutional provision as such for a public concession, which, in an ideal world, would include a statement of defeat, a call to unite, a celebration of democracy and a vow to fight on. Given this glaring omission in the constitutional guarantees of the U.S., there is only one route to overcoming the risk of chaos in the days ahead, and that is for those on either side of the partisan divide seeking a peaceful transition, to march peaceably in massive numbers for their cause, to eschew violence, but instead take up constitutional due process to express their voice, by also reaching out to their elected representatives. narayan@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/averting-volatile-poll-outcomes/article33017548.ece
04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Bihar blues||More than 54% of voters in 94 seats across 17 districts in Bihar voted in the second of the three-phase Assembly election on Tuesday. The first phase on October 28 had witnessed more than 55% voting in 71 seats. In the third phase on November 7, the remaining 78 seats across 15 districts will vote. In 2015, of these 94 seats, RJD had won 33, the JD(U) had 30, the BJP 20, and the Congress, seven. The Lok Janshakti Party had won in two constituencies, and one seat each had gone to the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and an independent candidate. The JD(U) that came to power in 2015 in alliance with the RJD and the Congress made a somersault later and is contesting this year in alliance with the BJP. Incumbent Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s advantage at the beginning appears to have considerably dissipated as the second phase concludes. RJD’s 30-year-old leader Tejashwi Yadav’s unrelenting campaigning has struck a chord with the voters, particularly the youth. Mr. Yadav managed to put the government on the mat on questions of employment, healthcare, and outmigration from the State. His promise of 10 lakh jobs is resonating well among the swelling unemployed population of the State and the RJD’s alliance with the Congress and the Left is working well on the ground. The BJP-JD(U) alliance banked on development issues and a formidable social coalition of upper castes, Extremely Backward Classes and Maha Dalits. Its claim of ‘double engine’ progress — driven by governments in the State and at the Centre — is weaker this time, due to the mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic by both. Mr. Yadav’s efforts to underplay identity-oriented mobilisation strategies and advance a new vocabulary for politics is laudatory but fraught with risks. The response from the BJP and the JD(U) has already taken shape, ahead of the third phase, which will largely be in the northeastern part of the State. On the back foot on governance questions, both Mr. Kumar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are focusing more on emotive issues that can polarise the voters. Both try to foment fear among voters by warning them of a return of RJD misgovernance that ended 15 years ago; Mr. Modi has cited the Ram temple in Ayodhya and Kashmir policy as the BJP’s differentiators. If this tone dominates the field until the third phase, there will be considerable cost to social harmony and democratic norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bihar-blues/article33017530.ece
04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Uncivil proposal||The astounding proposal by Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to enact a law to curb what they call ‘love jihad’ reeks of a vicious mix of patriarchy and communalism. Propounded by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the detestable idea amounts to legitimising a term that constitutes a blatant slur against inter-faith marriages and relationships in which one of the parties is a Muslim man. The ostensible reason for bringing in such a law seems to be that the “honour” of Hindu women is under threat from zealous Muslim youth seeking to win over girls from other communities for religious conversion in the name of love and marriage. The flaws in the concept are quite obvious: there is no legal sanction to self-serving and political terms such as ‘love jihad’ and there can be no legislation based on an extra-legal concept. In any case, legislative intervention in marriages involving consenting adults will be clearly unconstitutional. The domain of matrimony is occupied by separate laws governing weddings that take place under religious traditions, as well as the Special Marriage Act, which enables a secular marriage, including between couples from different faiths. Mr. Adityanath, who has also threatened those allegedly operating in secret by concealing their identities, and his Haryana counterpart, Manohar Lal, seem to be making the same mistakes: using the term ‘love jihad’ in a communal sense and speaking about marriages as if they were not a matter of personal choice. They would do well to remember that earlier this year, the Union Home Ministry made it clear that the term is not defined in law, while replying to a parliamentary question. Investigation into marriages that purportedly raised such a suspicion also failed to find any substance in the allegations. The immediate context for these leaders to go out on a limb about curbing inter-faith marriages is a recent Allahabad High Court judgment that frowned upon religious conversion solely for the purpose of marriage; and the horrible murder of a 20-year-old woman in Faridabad by a stalker who happened to be a Muslim. By no stretch of imagination can the murder be used to denounce consensual inter-faith relationships. Regarding the court verdict, the High Court had declined to intervene on a writ petition seeking police protection for a recently married couple, noting that the bride had converted from Islam to Hinduism solely for the purpose of marriage. It had found such an expedient conversion unacceptable, citing a similar 2014 verdict in which the court had questioned the bonafides of conversions without change of heart or any conviction in the tenets of the new religion. Although the court strayed from the issue at hand, its objective was to underscore that conversion should not become a device. It is indeed salutary as a principle that inter-faith couples retain their religious beliefs separately and opt for marriage under the Special Marriage Act. However, this principle cannot be used to derogate from personal choice or become a ruse to interfere in the individual freedom to forge matrimonial alliances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/uncivil-proposal/article33017536.ece

04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Exports fall again on global trade woes||India’s merchandise exports slid back into contraction mode in October as struggling global trade continued to face headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic. Outbound shipments declined 5.4% from a year earlier to $24.82 billion, after a brief respite in September when exports had expanded 6% to snap a six-month-long contraction. Imports shrink Imports of goods also declined by 11.5% last month, as per preliminary trade data released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry on Tuesday, taking the overall imports between April to October to $182.29 billion, 36.3% lower than the same period in 2019. Merchandise exports in the first seven months of the current financial year amounted to $150.07 billion, a 19.1% contraction from the year-earlier period. “The trade data shows the recovery is uneven and fragile as exports declined both sequentially and year-on-year, pointing to a sluggish global recovery,” said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research. “The continuous decline in non-oil, non-gold imports are pointing towards very weak domestic demand,” he added. Gems sector flounders Exports of rice (112%), chemicals (73.9%) and drugs and pharmaceuticals (21.8%) recorded the highest growth in October, while transport equipment and petroleum products saw the sharpest declines of (–56.3%) and (-53.3%), respectively. Among employment-intensive sectors, gems and jewellery and leather also reported contractions of (-21.3%) and (-3.8%), respectively, while export of carpets jumped almost 38% and handicrafts grew by more than 11.3%. Calling for a deeper analysis of the reasons behind the decline in exports of major export commodities over recent months, the Federation of Indian Exporters’ Organisations (FIEO) called for “urgent and immediate” action to resolve key issues that led to October’s ‘nominal’ dip. FIEO listed a shortage of containers and an increase in sea freight charges as issues needing attention. FIEO president Sharad Kumar Saraf also attributed part of the decline to farmers’ agitations in some States. Urging the government to release merchandise export incentives due to businesses, Mr. Saraf said exporters were seeing a rise in orders and a further fillip was expected once the U.S. election process concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/exports-fall-again-on-global-trade-woes/article33017514.ece
04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||PM to meet 20 large global investors||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a virtual meeting with 20 large global investors managing assets of more than $6 trillion, on Thursday, to reiterate India’s attractiveness as an investment destination. The virtual conference with the investors, which include several sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, will be followed by one-on-one interactions for each of them with the PM over the next two weeks, Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said. Some of the prominent funds that have confirmed attendance are CDPQ, CPP Investments, GIC, Japan Bank for International Co-operation, Mubadala, New York Life, Qatar Investment Authority, Temasek and U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. “Strong partnerships with international investors form a very important part of India’s economic strategy,” the Prime Minister said in a statement ahead of the meeting. “Our commitment to create an investor-friendly ecosystem and enhance the ease of doing business is unflinching,” he added. ‘First-timers in talks’ “The idea is to have an interaction with the global investors, some of whom have been investing in India, and others who are participating for the first time and are interested to know more so they can take a decision about investments,” Mr. Bajaj said. He said these investors would be represented by chief executive officers and chief investment officers who would be informed about various opportunities in India and the present economic situation. “If they have any concerns, we will also try to answer them. We have been interacting with these funds for the last five or six months,” he said. “A structured interaction had been held during the Vibrant Gujarat programme in 2019 based on which the dividend distribution tax had been done away with and tax exemptions have been given to SWFs and PFs under certain conditions,” he added. Industrialists Ratan Tata, Mukesh Ambani, Nandan Nilekani, Dilip Shanghvi, Deepak Parekh and Uday Kotak will also attend the meeting. India’s FDI flows between April and August had hit a record high despite the pandemic, rising 13% to more than $35 billion, Mr. Bajaj said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pm-to-meet-20-large-global-investors/article33017519.ece
04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Economy is recovering fast, says Secretary Bajaj||India’s economy is recovering fast and should hopefully be back on track soon, a top finance ministry official said on Tuesday, citing a slew of economic indicators showing an upswing in October. “We continue to see the uptick in the economy over the past few months with the opening up,” Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said. “We are seeing an improvement in all parameters and expect further improvements in November,” he added. “This shall continue and, hopefully, the economy should be back on the rails. And it is moving much faster than what had been anticipated by a lot of experts and economists,” Mr. Bajaj remarked. Apart from the PMI for manufacturing signalling a decade-high expansion in October and the 10% increase in GST collections, Mr. Bajaj said an improvement in economic activity was also reflected in a 12.1% increase in power consumption, a 14% rise in rail freight and an almost 120% jump in average daily toll collections. The value of e-way bills generated under the GST regime also rose 19% to Rs. 16.82 lakh crore in October. “Today, some comments have come from industrialists who are saying they are actually facing challenges in the supply chain rather than on the demand side,” Mr. Bajaj remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/economy-is-recovering-fast-says-secretary-bajaj/article33017517.ece
04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Micromax marks return to market with 2 devices||Micromax on Tuesday re-entered the smartphone market in the country with the unveiling of two new devices under the ‘In’ brand as it looks to leverage the current anti-China sentiment in India, along with the push for ‘AtmaNirbhar Bharat’. “In both our new devices, we are giving even better pricing than Chinese players and both are performance-oriented products,” said Rahul Sharma, the company’s co-founder. “We will not be making Rs. 4,000-Rs. 5,000 phones... so the expectation that Micromax will make cheap phones etc... we will not do that,” he added. The company unveiled the ‘IN note 1’ with a starting price of Rs. 10,999, and the ‘IN 1b’ from Rs. 6,999 onwards. Mr. Sharma said 90% of the Indian smartphone market was between Rs. 7,000-Rs. 15,000 and hence the company was entering this segment. However, it will also introduce products in the higher price range (about Rs. 20,000-Rs. 25,000) soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/micromax-marks-return-to-market-with-2-devices/article33017521.ece
04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||PNB halves loan recast target to Rs. 20,000 crore||Punjab National Bank (PNB) on Tuesday lowered the debt recast target by 50% to Rs. 20,000 crore as there was not enough demand for restructuring approved by RBI a couple of months ago. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted one-time restructuring of corporate and personal loans to help entities amid the COVID-19 crisis. “With respect to restructuring, surprisingly, as on today, if you look at [it], not many people have [made] requests. In terms of retail and MSME together, by September 30, we have undertaken restructuring to the extent of Rs. 41 crore. As on today, another Rs. 30 crore request has come with respect to retail and MSMEs. “But MSMEs, we are expecting restructuring to happen to the extent of anything around Rs. 4,000-Rs. 5,000 crore before December 31,” PNB MD S.S. Mallikarjuna Rao said in a virtual interaction with the media. As far as corporates were concerned, he said, the bank has received applications from 15 applicants amounting to Rs. 2,022 crore. It is very important to note, he said, that if the restructuring was undertaken for corporate accounts, their ratings would be under pressure for two years. “That could be one of the reasons why the response has not been very high. “However, when we look at the way the response is coming to us, it may not be even Rs. 20,000 crore by December 31,” he said. This would be less than 3% of the total advances, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pnb-halves-loan-recast-target-to-rs-20000-crore/article33017526.ece

04 November 2020||London,||Leicester powers into second||Leicester swept into second place in the Premier League with an impressive 4-1 victory at Leeds, while Fulham beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0 to finally clinch its first win of the season on Monday. Brendan Rodgers’ side is just one point behind leader Liverpool after winning five of its first seven games in a top-flight season for the first time in its history. Harvey Barnes and Youri Tielemans put Leicester two up before half-time at Elland Road. Stuart Dallas got one back for Leeds but Jamie Vardy’s eighth goal of the season and a late Tielemans penalty wrapped up Leicester’s fourth successive away league win. Capable team After the disappointment of missing out on a place in the Champions League last term, Leicester has shown it is capable of mounting another top four challenge. Even a title push might not be impossible given it has already thrashed Manchester City 5-2. “We were technically brilliant. We had the quality to play when we had the opportunities. I thought we were amazing right across the team,” Rodgers said.  Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa said: “In the first 30 minutes we defended poorly and after we didn’t create enough danger. That is one of the main responsibilities of the manager.”  At Craven Cottage, Fulham avoided its worst start to a season since 1951 thanks to first half goals from Bobby Decordova-Reid and Ola Aina. Scott Parker’s side deservedly ended a run of six games without a win — a dismal stretch including five defeats — since its promotion from the Championship last term. First-half goals Samu Chukwueze and Pau Torres scored first-half goals as Villarreal defeated last-placed Valladolid 2-0 to move to third place in the Spanish league. Unai Emery’s team dominated from the start, getting on the board with Chukwueze’s shot from inside the area in the 21st minute and added Torres’ goal from close range in the 37th. The hosts also had a goal disallowed by video review in the second half after a foul by forward Gerard Moreno before heading the ball into the net. The win put Villarreal one point behind second-placed Real Madrid and two fewer than leader Real Sociedad. Madrid has a game in hand.  The results: Premier League: Fulham 2 (Decordova-Reid 26, Aina 30) bt West Brom 0; Leeds 1 (Dallas 48) lost to Leicester 4 (Barnes 3, Tielemans 21, 90-pen, Vardy 76).   LaLiga: Villarreal 2 (Chukwueze 21, Torres 37) bt Real Valladolid 0.   Serie A: Hellas Verona 3 (Barak 17, 63, Lazovic 77) bt Benevento 1 (Lapadula 56).   Bundesliga: Hoffenheim 1 (Dabbur 80) lost to Union Berlin 3 (Kruse 60, Pohjanpalo 85, Teuchert 90).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/leicester-powers-into-second/article33017679.ece
04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Imperious SRH crushes altered MI to secure final playoff spot||Sunrisers Hyderabad skipper David Warner (85 n.o., 58b, 10x4, 1x6) and fellow-opener Wriddhiman Saha (58 n.o., 45b, 7x4, 1x6) made it a no-contest in the final league match in Sharjah as the duo helped the side overhaul Mumbai Indians’ total of 149 with plenty to spare and help the 2016 champion seal a playoff berth on Tuesday. Facing a depleted Mumbai attack, sans Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah, the aggressive openers accelerated from the word go and scattered the bowlers to all parts with some audacious strokeplay. Earlier, the disciplined Sunrisers bowlers had restricted Mumbai Indians in a do-or-die game after electing to field. The Orange Army — after victories over Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore — kept the Mumbai batsmen quiet in the middle overs after Suryakumar Yadav (36, 29b, 5x4) had threatened to run away with the game. Making a return to the XI after a hamstring injury had laid him low, skipper Rohit Sharma did not fire, falling for just four. He was consumed by a knuckleball from Sandeep Sharma. Quinton de Kock (25, 13b, 2x4, 2x6) hammered Sandeep for a four, six and six before dragging a full toss outside off-stump on to his stumps. Suryakumar and Ishan Kishan (33, 30b, 1x4, 2x6) added 42 for the third wicket, going after Rashid Khan. However, left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem removed Suryakumar, thanks to a superb stumping from Saha. When the Mumbai batsman attempted a drive off a delivery pitched outside off, the ’keeper whipped off the bails in a flash. In the same over, Nadeem dismissed Krunal Pandya for a duck, caught at short mid-wicket by Kane Williamson. Ishan kept the scoreboard ticking along with Kieron Pollard before getting bowled by Sandeep. The West Indian went on to hammer a 25-ball 41 with four sixes and two fours, lifting Mumbai to a total that proved inadequate when Warner and Saha got going.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/srh-storms-into-the-playoffs-with-emphatic-win/article33017618.ece
04 November 2020||MUMBAI,||Rohit’s Australia omission: the plot grows thicker||Hours after BCCI president Sourav Ganguly stated that Rohit Sharma’s omission from India’s tour of Australia was due to the possibility of a recurrence of his “hamstring tear”, Rohit walked out to open the Mumbai Indians innings against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL on Tuesday. Ever since injuring himself during MI’s double-Super Over loss to Kings XI Punjab last month, there have been more questions than answers about Rohit’s fitness status. Hamstring strain: MI While MI referred to it as a “hamstring strain” on October 23, the BCCI, when announcing the squad on October 26, said that Rohit was being “monitored”, without specifying the nature of the injury. “You don’t want him to get injured again. He has a hamstring tear and it will get ruptured again. It will then [take] longer for him to come back. But yes, there are people working with him,” Ganguly told PTI on Tuesday. The BCCI chief added that the MI medical team had been working on Rohit along with Team India physiotherapist Nitin Patel. Second surprise However, the franchise and the batsman sprung a second surprise in as many weeks later on Tuesday when Rohit walked out for the toss against SRH. While he wasn’t asked about his fitness in detail during the toss interview, the decision appeared to be a ploy to test his fitness ahead of the playoffs. Interestingly, hours after the BCCI had announced the squad for the Australia tour last week, Rohit had had a full-fledged net session. Lack of clarity The sequence of events highlights the lack of clarity surrounding the injury management mechanism of centrally contracted cricketers. Despite the BCCI medical team not deeming him fit for international cricket, his franchise may have cleared him for an IPL game since the BCCI fitness protocols are not binding on franchises. It will be interesting to see how much cricket Rohit plays over the next week and whether the BCCI deems that sufficient to include him in its plans for Australia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohits-australia-omission-the-plot-gets-thicker/article33017620.ece
04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Moving from bubble to bubble: added pressures of touring||The latest cricketing term is ‘the bubble’. The bubble has allowed international competitions to be held, much to the joy of players and fans alike, but it might extract its pound of flesh unless we are prepared. The restrictions are beginning to worry and “keeping the head space in a reasonable place”, to quote Steve Smith, is getting more difficult. The IPL final is on November 10; two days later, the Indian team leaves for Australia and will be in the bubble for some ten weeks followed by the quarantine on return home. That’s over 80 days in all. England embark on a tour of South Africa on November 16 for a white-ball series till December 10. When England’s leading bowler Jofra Archer (who spent 87 days in the bubble in the English summer) says he is planning to get a calendar to “cross out the days to make me feel they are going faster,” you understand exactly what he means. But players need more than sympathy as cricket and the mental issues attached to it enter uncharted territory. They will need professional help and a level of understanding few cricket boards have consistently shown in the past. Players opting out of tours, for example, need to be handled with sympathy. That choice should exist without fear of repercussions. Human angle In January next, skipper Virat Kohli will become a father. The final Test ends on January 19 in Brisbane. If it means that Kohli might miss a match or two, so be it. Players are human beings: fitter, sharper, more gifted than most, but human beings nevertheless, and need looking after. The cricket boards of India and Australia must agree to families touring with the team; it will make a difference, and the players certainly deserve that. Smith has said that there is “absolutely no chance” he will be playing in Australia’s Big Bash League commencing in December. It is possible that David Warner and Pat Cummins will stay away too. Living from bubble to bubble is “untenable”, as Eoin Morgan puts it. The West Indies player Jason Holder was home for just two days after the tour of England, then spent a month and a half playing in the Caribbean Premier League, had another break of four days and then was in the UAE for the IPL. Players are discovering that the opposite of constant travel, packing and unpacking, not knowing which city one is in is just as disorienting as its opposite in the bubble: staying in one place over weeks, doing the same things and knowing only too well which city one is in. Cabin fever is a reality. The argument that the T20 leagues are merely domestic tournaments and cricket boards need not react if a player overreaches for monetary reasons shows a lack of understanding of the game’s ecosystem. Player management has become crucial. It has to be a co-operative enterprise — with both the players and the administrators understanding their responsibilities. Already team selections and travel arrangements have changed in the ‘new’ normal. India arrive in Australia with over 30 players, including their own ‘net’ bowlers, in a chartered aircraft. While the physical demands of the new normal are being handled well, the mental strain will first have to be acknowledged and then dealt with. The pressures of a full tour of Australia, at the best of times, can be enormous. Today’s special circumstances make these doubly or triply so. Players will need help to keep their head space in a reasonable space. In recent years, there has a better understanding and therefore greater empathy towards players who have admitted to suffering from mental struggles, whether cricket-induced or otherwise. In their books, former England players Marcus Trescothick and Graeme Fowler have invited both scrutiny and sympathy into some of these issues. Have a psychologist In the past, Indian teams have carried a psychologist — Paddy Upton was one of the best — and a tour like this will require more focused attention by a specialist. In the past too, players have been wary of a psychologist after some of them discovered their personal issues being discussed in the media. Trust has sometimes been lacking, which is unfortunate. The Indian team has asked for a sports psychologist to accompany them, which is a sound move. And necessary too. But building trust might take a while, and the two-week quarantine after the team lands in Sydney will be well spent in doing just this. The bubble’s big drawback is the lack of choice. This, for a bunch of young men in their physical prime, can be irritating. But the mental strength developed out of necessity in the bubble could have a positive impact on performance on-field. It will be a tough tour coming so soon after the IPL, and the players need to be cut some slack.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/moving-from-bubble-to-bubble-added-pressures-of-touring/article33017674.ece
04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||High performance shooting centre comes up in Bhubaneswar||World and Olympic medallist Gagan Narang has set up a high performance shooting centre at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, in collaboration with the Odisha government and the Aditya Birla Group. The centre aims to offer fully funded training scholarship to 200 children in the age group of 11-14 years. After a variety of meta-cognitive and physical tests conducted on 2000 children, 75 kids have already been selected for training. “The focus for this group of children, and the ones joining us next year, is the 2028 Olympics,” said Narang. “I hope that the launching of the 10-metre shooting range at the Kalinga Stadium will produce a large number of shooting champions for the country. Partnership of industries and leading sports persons is indeed a dynamic mechanism for flourishing sports,” said the Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik at the inauguration on Tuesday. “I am sure the centre will provide a pathway to thousands of aspiring sports persons and become a platform where the best of local talent can rise to shine on the international stage,” said Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the Aditya Birla Group. Talent identification The process of talent identification has been followed by the Gagan Narang Sports Foundation for the last seven years, and has resulted in heart warming performances of the trainees at the national and international level. The reigning world No. 1 woman air rifle shooter Elavenil Valarivan was selected through a similar process five years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/high-performance-shooting-centre-comes-up-in-bhubaneswar/article33018213.ece
04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||It’s the turn of the women to storm the desert||Thousands stood outside the Sawai Mansingh Stadium at Jaipur on that scorching summer evening last year. That wasn’t an unusual sight in front of an IPL venue in the pre-COVID period. What was unusual, though, was that it was for a women’s T20 match. Some 15,000 watched Supernovas beating Velocity in the final of the Women’s T20 Challenge. The entire tournament at Jaipur had attracted good crowds. It was further proof that the women’s game was getting more and more popular in the country. Female cricketers, from around the globe, will, of course, have to play before empty stands in the third edition of the Women’s T20 Challenge, which opens at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. They, however, would be relieved that they are getting to play some cricket after all in these troubled times; many of them haven’t got a game for eight months. Important event Within two years, the Women’s T20 Challenge — considered a precursor to the possible women’s IPL — has evolved as an important event on the international calendar. It attracts the best cricketers from around the world and has unearthed fresh Indian talent, like Shafali Varma, who was a revelation last year. She was 15 then, but had impressed with her stroke-making abilities. She is now an integral part of the Indian team and hit the highest number of sixes at the Women’s T20 World Cup last year. She will be one of the players to watch out for in this tournament, too. Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana and Mithali Raj, who lead Supernovas, Trailblazers and Velocity, could also light up the Sharjah stadium with their batting, along with Jemimah Rodrigues. Quality batters From abroad, there are quality batters like Deandra Dottin (West Indies), Danielle Wyatt (England), Chamari Athapaththu (Sri Lanka) and Thailand’s Natthakan Chantham. But because of the clash of dates with Women’s Big Bash in Australia, several big stars, like Sophie Devine, Suzie Bates, Natalie Sciver, Stafanie Taylor, Amelia Kerr, Lea Tahuhu and Hayley Matthews, are missing; they had all played at Jaipur. The teams play each other once and the top two will face off in the final.  The squads: Supernovas: Harmanpreet Kaur (Capt.), Jemimah Rodrigues, Chamari Athapaththu (SL), Priya Punia, Anuja Patil, Radha Yadav, Taniya Bhatia (wicket-keeper), Shashikala Siriwardene (SL), Poonam Yadav, Shakera Selman (WI), Arundhati Reddy, Pooja Vastrakar, Ayushi Soni, Ayabonga Khaka (SA) and Muskan Malik.   Velocity: Mithali Raj (Capt.), Veda Krishnamurthy, Shafali Verma, Sushma Verma (wicket-keeper), Ekta Bisht, Mansi Joshi, Shikha Pandey, Devika Vaidya, Sushree Dibyadarshini, Manali Dakshini, Leigh Kasperek (NZ), Danielle Wyatt (Eng), Sune Luus (SA), Jahanara Alam and M. Anagha.   Trailblazers: Smriti Mandhana (Capt.), Deepti Sharma, Punam Raut, Richa Ghosh, D. Hemalatha, Nuzhat Parween (wicket-keeper), Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Harleen Deol, Jhulan Goswami, Simran Dil Bahadur, Salma Khatun (Ban), Sophie Ecclestone (Eng), Natthakan Chantham (Tln), Deandra Dottin (WI) and Kashvee Gautam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/its-the-turn-of-the-women-to-storm-the-desert/article33017625.ece
04 November 2020||Leipzig,||PSG bereft of attacking trident||Paris Saint-Germain announced on Tuesday that Kylian Mbappe has suffered a hamstring injury and will miss its Champions League game at RB Leipzig. The forward’s last-minute pull-out is a significant blow for PSG with Neymar and Mauro Icardi already ruled out of Wednesday’s game in Germany. Thomas Tuchel’s side takes on Leipzig playing catch-up in Group H after losing to Manchester United in its opening game. Mbappe scored a penalty in the league win over Nantes on Saturday before being withdrawn and heading straight down the tunnel clutching his right hamstring. Volatile performances Meanwhile, the Champions League is providing succour for Manchester United as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer struggles to tame a volatility in domestic performances that has ignited concerns about the team’s identity and direction under its former striker.  Amid a turbulent start to the season, Solskjaer has been forced to change personnel on a regular basis. One week, a player or a system works; the next, it doesn’t.   While much about the team remains a mystery, it is abundantly clear that, under Solskjaer, United is best as a dangerous counter-attacking side. The pace of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Greenwood in behind defences is lethal. It remains to be seen if Istanbul Basaksehir is wise to this fact in its doubleheader against United either side of the international break.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/psg-bereft-of-attacking-trident/article33017669.ece

The ultra-modern academy, which will have 14 courts, was formally launched by Telangana Minister for IT and Municipal Administration K.T. Rama Rao, “I have been to many countries but have rarely seen the kind of sports infrastructure we have in Telangana. “And, I appreciate Jwala and her family for setting up this facility, which can match with the best in the world, on their own,” said the minister while assuring full support. Jwala said that the state-of-the-art complex would also focus on other sports including cricket and swimming. “I feel we need more quality badminton players, I will put in the best efforts to inculcate discipline in those who are keen to make a mark both in sports and in the society,” she said. Excellent facilities The academy also has a seating capacity for 600 spectators, an international standard gym and a yoga centre to serve as a one-stop destination for the young and aspiring athletes, said Jwala. Jwala said she had not taken support from anyone in setting up the academy and is in the process of recruiting about 10-14 coaches, including a couple of foreigners, with the panel headed by her mentor and Dronacharya S.M. Arif. She added plans to conduct a six-month diploma course for coaches was on the cards. “My role will be more of a mentor than a coach and essentially a link between players, coaches and parents,” she said. Telangana sports minister V. Srinivas Goud, Arif and SATS chairman A. Venkateshwar Reddy were among those present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jwala-gutta-academy-of-excellence-launched/article33017663.ece
04 November 2020||RAWALPINDI,||Zimbabwe wins third ODI in Super Over||Paceman Blessing Muzarabani took career best figures of five for 49 as Zimbabwe beat Pakistan in a thrilling Super Over finish in the third and final One-Day International on Tuesday. The actual match finished in a tie after Muhammad Musa hit the final delivery of the 50th over from Richard Ngarava for a boundary to level the scores at 278. But man-of-the-match Muzarabani dismissed Iftikhar Ahmed and Khushdil Shah for two runs on four balls in the Super Over which Zimbabwe scored off just three balls without any loss. Despite the defeat Pakistan won the series 2-1. Skipper Babar Azam, who finished with 125 (125b, 13x4, 1x6) led Pakistan’s chase and stood firm after it was set a daunting target. Earlier, Zimbabwe’s total of 278 for six was built around a fighting unbeaten 118 (135b, 13x4, 1x6) by Sean Williams who helped his team recover from paceman Muhammad Hasnain’s best figures of five for 26. The win broke Zimbabwe’s sequence of ten consecutive defeats and gave it its fifth win over Pakistan in 62 ODIs.  The scores: Zimbabwe 278/6 in 50 overs (Sean Williams 118, Brendon Taylor 56, Sikandar Raza 45, Muhammad Hasnain 5/26) tied with Pakistan 278/7 in 50 overs (Babar Azam 125, Wahab Riaz 52, Blessing Muzarabani 5/49).

04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Rutuja ready to sustain successful start||It has been a remarkably successful return to the professional tennis circuit for Rutuja Bhosale, as she won the singles title in the $15,000 ITF women’s tournament in Egypt. Handling the lockdown with patience, marrying cricketer Swapnil Gugale and training well both physically and mentally have been the secrets of Rutuja’s smart start. “It was very exciting to step into the competitive world again. Everyone had been training during pandemic, and eager to get out, and I got the chance finally,” said Rutuja, from Sharm El Sheikh where she will be parked for a few weeks for more tournaments. With limited options, as many tournaments have been cancelled around the world, Rutuja decided to compete in Egypt as she was familiar with the place. “I have been here before, so thought it should be a decent place to start,.” she said. Key role She had played a key role in India’s progress in FedCup earlier this year. “I was ready to keep going as my shoulder was handling all the load better even in practice. “Then the break after FedCup. But the part where I have been injured so many times has taught me to be patient. So, I think it helped,” she observed. Being an optimist, Rutuja was able to see more positive points emerging out of the pandemic. “I feel that being with family was also needed. It also gave me and my husband the time to think about our future. And we didn’t have to take a break for it,” said Rutuja who married cricketer Swapnil Gugale in August. With cricket not resuming at the national level, Swapnil has been able to help Rutuja, settling into a new house, and being with her during training. Marriage has been an extended family for Rutuja, because of the sporting link. “He is a sportsperson and knows how the schedule can be, even being at home! Overall he is such a happy, cheery person, and keeps the mood happy,” she said. For the next few weeks, Rutuja will try to sustain the success and climb the ranking ladder.

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||DC snaps out of its slump to qualify second||Ajinkya Rahane (60, 46b, 5x4, 1x6) and Shikhar Dhawan (54, 41b, 6x4) returned to form and helped Delhi Capitals seal second spot in Abu Dhabi on Monday. The convincing six-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore was set up by a fine bowling performance that restricted RCB to 152, before Rahane and Dhawan came good with an 88-run second-wicket partnership. RCB too confirmed its place in the playoffs, after making DC bat more than 17.3 overs and ensuring that its net run rate didn’t fall below Kolkata Knight Riders’ in fourth. Dhawan started the chase with four cracking boundaries through the off-side, including an exquisite straight drive off Mohammed Siraj. Rahane was composed, catching the eye with his excellent use of the feet. The two boundaries he hit off Isuru Udana through the covers and past mid-off to round out the PowerPlay were pleasing. After scoring 53 from six overs, the duo consolidated. But in the 13th over, Dhawan was caught at short fine-leg trying a cheeky sweep. Rahane, a little while later, perished trying a cheekier shot, a reverse-sweep. But DC was not to be denied the win.   MI vs DC on Nov. 5  MI and DC, the top two finishers, will meet in Qualifier 1 in Dubai on Nov. 5 RCB will meet either KKR or SRH in the Eliminator in Abu Dhabi on Nov. 6 If SRH beats MI on Tuesday, it will qualify; if it loses, KKR will be through to the playoffs||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dc-snaps-out-of-its-slump-to-qualify-second/article33017614.ece

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Efforts bear fruit||There is a subhashita (a wise saying) that the educated spend their time studying good literature and Sastras, while the uneducated while away their time in sleep or in gossip. Hanuman was well-versed in the Sastras and even Rama remarked on his deep learning when He first met him. Naturally, whatever the task entrusted to him, Hanuman remained focused on obtaining the desired result. And when such a determined person does his best, his effort is blessed by the Supreme One and we see this in Hanuman’s search for Sita, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse. When the monkeys set about searching for Sita, each group went in a different direction. Hanuman was allocated the Southern direction. Despite a month of frantic searching, Hanuman and the other monkeys with him had no clue as to Her whereabouts. The monkeys decided to end their lives. But the arrival of Sampaati changed everything. Sampaati was an eagle who happened to hear the conversation of the monkeys in which the death of Jatayu figured. Sampaati was Jatayu’s brother, and he was anxious to know more about how his brother had met with his death. Angada told Sampaati about Sita’s abduction, Jatayu’s valiant effort to stop Ravana, the subsequent killing of Jatayu, Rama’s misery, and the futile search for Sita. Luckily for the monkeys, Sampaati had seen Ravana taking Sita to Lanka. He said that he saw a young woman being taken by Ravana. She had been screaming out to Rama and even Lakshmana for help, all the while throwing down Her ornaments. It was nothing but divine intervention, which brought Sampaati to the very spot where the monkeys were discussing the events of the past, and it was this that eventually made it possible for Hanuman to locate where Sita was.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/efforts-bear-fruit/article33017611.ece

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||A sonnet for your art||Poetry segues into visual art at Ignite — From Within The Confines, a virtual exhibition curated by Dubai-based visual art blogger Deepa Gopal. Eight visual artists and eight poets from across the world collaborated on the project in pairs — the poet had to find inspiration in the works of the visual artist they were paired with. A culmination of work, which started in September, the show will feature 40 artworks and 40 poems, from November 4 to 12. “It brings together art and poetry from different parts of the world in the form of videos, poem recitals and texts, through a blog, Instagram and YouTube. It is amusing to see how the pairings ignited new amalgamations, conversations and creative symphonies,” Deepa adds. The exhibition focusses on creativity borne out of this pandemic, the reactions and responses to the current state we are in — restricted, isolated and confined. “It’s a ‘conversation’ of the ‘creatives’ trying to overcome, find joy in, forget, annihilate, reveal and/or excel at their current life and state of matters that they are surrounded by in their daily life. All the same, Ignite — From Within the Confines essentially instils hope,” says Deepa.  Excerpts from an e-mail interview.  What led you to curate this show? The objective is simple; I wanted to promote art and poetry, and I was particularly interested in the collaboration. It was experimental and to my surprise, most artistes were as excited as I was when I reached out.  This was one of my pet projects; I had been thinking of such a collaboration for some time. When everything turned online, I saw the possibility of such a show.  How did you get these artists together? Have you worked with them before?  I knew most of them for a long time and have been following their works. I have also worked/participated with a few of them before like German, Ahlam, Liz and Devan sir. German and Ahlam were part of my earlier show, Repercussions, which I curated in 2016 at Durbar Hall, Kochi. I checked with a couple of artist/poet friends regarding the works they did since the pandemic. I got in touch with them, and most of them were immediately on board. How open were the artists, to working within the ‘confines’ of a theme?  I don’t think they gave a second thought about the ‘confines’ since all of them were creating/writing during this time, venting using various forms of expression; not necessarily speaking about the pandemic alone. They were in their zones tapping into their creative energy and producing works that mattered to them. When I paired them, all the poets were excited to see the works and respond. There were no restrictions other than that the poets needed to write at least one to five poems based on the respective artist’s works that I sent to them. Some of us interacted with those we were paired with, some could not and some did not (as they felt that they would be influenced and that would sway the writing). What were the challenges involved?  Everyday has been a learning experience for me. Bringing all participants together under one umbrella has its own challenges. Not everyone thinks alike; since the interaction was virtual, communication was difficult at times. The varying time zones added to the difficulty sometimes.  The show will be inaugurated at https://ignitefromwithintheconfines.blogspot.com/ on November 4, 4 pm. The works will be posted on the following days until November 12 and be subsequently available on YouTube.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-sonnet-for-your-art/article33017829.ece
04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Fist of fury||“A true fighter does not attack; he/she only defends,” says IV Sadiq, a porter at the Palayam market in Kozhikode, who represented India at the Muay Thai Pro Fight World Championship in Thailand in 2015. Muay Thai is a way of life for Sadiq, who started training at 14. A martial art, which has its roots in Thailand, Muay Thai is known for its brute power. While Sadiq transforms into a fighting machine inside the ring, outside it, he says he consciously avoids a fight. For him, the real fight is within — to keep the spirit alive. Sadiq was a regular competitor at national championships and has won medals. “Muay Thai is a combat sport that is extremely demanding,” he says. His rather unusual balancing act — of being a porter and a Muay Thai boxer — has been captured on film by filmmakers Basim A Rahman and Sahis Abdul Sathar. The 10-minute eponymous short documentary traces Sadiq’s life. When Basim, who works as an assistant editor in films and Sahis, who is a video producer, were planning to make a narrative-style documentary, they heard of Sadiq and felt it could be the ideal subject for a non-fiction short documentary.

04 November 2020||November 04 2020 00:00 IST,||Come as you are||Two years ago, when the Supreme Court read down Section 377, decriminalising homosexuality, Sunali Aggarwal had an idea. Realising that mainstream dating apps like Delta, Tinder, Grindr and OkCupid did not really meet the needs of the LGBTQ+ community, she began working on a new app, As You Are (AYA), along with co-founder Aditi Gupta (who has since exited the company). Based in Chandigarh, Sunali (who was also a co-founder of Mobikwik) wondered whether individuals who are yet to come out have avenues to find partners. A small prototype of the app was launched in December 2019 and the team sent out messages within its network. Encouraged by the response (“People are looking for genuine places to find partners,” says Sunali), the app went to development phase. Overcoming challenges like bugs and decreased productivity due to COVID-19, AYA was finally launched in June 2020. Sunali says, “The idea behind the name ‘As You Are’ is to provide a platform for people without any pressure to change; our focus is more on profiles than photographs.” How does AYA work? After users fill in basic details, that include gender, orientation, an email address and a phone number, they have to upload a selfie which is verified by the team. Sunali vouches for their strict verification process, remarking, “The mischievous kind get filtered out early in the system. If 100 people sign in, only 25 get through. We try to create ‘safe profiles’ and a platform where individuals experience some level of comfort interacting with each other.” Users create a personal profile, including hobbies, habits and interests (“Do you like to travel”, “Do you have any food preferences”, “How often do you order in”). The app is in English, and sees 60 people sign up daily with 5,268 downloads to date. Sunali says, “The algorithm initially worked such that we would give matches based on the user’s orientation from the LGBTQ spectrum. Now in the wider spectrum, one can choose the gender one wants to date.” The app’s intent, she says, is clear — dating, and a one-to-one connection while still maintaining privacy. “Here you can stay anonymous; that gives you a sense of security or privacy that may not be available on social media platforms. Verification does happen but the name you are using may not be your real name,” she adds. Yet Sunali points out users also need to take precautions on their personal safety. “Users will meet different kinds of people; they don’t have to divulge a lot of personal info,” she cautions. If someone is reported, the admin asks for KYC or some proof . Going beyond just dating, AYA also hopes to provide a space to make friends within the LGBTQ+ spectrum.  AYA is only for Android phones and is free until November 30. Post that, the free version will come with in-app purchases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/come-as-you-are/article33017826.ece

04 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Celebrate a cracker-free Deepavali: Rai||Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday launched an anti-firecracker campaign in Dehli and appealed to the residents to burst green crackers on Deepavali. The campaign was launched on a day when the 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi was recorded at 302 — slipping back to “very poor” category from “poor” category. Air quality monitoring agencies added that contribution of stubble burning to pollution in Delhi dropped to 10% on Tuesday due to improved wind speeds. It was 40% on Sunday — the highest so far this season. Only green crackers After inaugurating the campaign, Mr. Rai said that according to a Supreme Court directive, normal crackers have been banned in Delhi and only pollution-free green crackers have been allowed this year. “I want to appeal to the people of Delhi that this year, when we are witnessing COVID-19 and pollution at the same time, please avoid bursting crackers,” the Minister said. The Delhi government said that under the campaign, all sub-divisional magistrates and police officers, along with 11 teams of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) have been directed to ensure there is no bursting of polluting crackers across the city. The teams are ensuring effective implementation on ground, checking that the crackers sold must have a ‘green cracker’ logo on them and are manufactured by authorised companies.  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitoring agency, SAFAR, said the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM 2.5 pollution “decreased significantly” due to a change in the wind direction. Stubble fire “Stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and neighbouring areas are significant and stood at 3,068 on Monday.” the bulletin read. It added that Tuesday was an example of high fire count and low impact in Delhi’s air, due to unfavourable transport level winds. SAFAR has forecast that the air quality is likely to deteriorate on Wednesday and Thursday. “A significant improvement from peak AQI value three days ago to current AQI is mainly attributed to increased surface wind speed combined with not so favourable boundary layer winds for fire-related intrusion. However, boundary layer winds are likely to shift to Northwesterly, but with slower wind speed, some increased intrusion and marginal deterioration are expected in the next three days,” the forecast read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/celebrate-a-cracker-free-deepavali-rai/article33018224.ece
04 November 2020||Chandigarh,||Punjab Chief Minister to lead MLAs dharna in Delhi today||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said that as President Ram Nath Kovind had not given time for a meeting, he would lead a ‘relay dharna’ of MLAs in New Delhi on November 4 to highlight the State’s power crisis and critical essential supplies situation amid continued suspension of goods trains by the railways. The Opposition parties, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), termed the Congress’s announcement of the relay protest a gimmick to mislead farmers. Capt. Amaridner said as the crisis triggered by the suspension of goods trains had aggravated, resulting in a complete shutdown of all power plants as well as curtailment of agricultural and vegetables supplies, he had decided to hold a symbolic ‘relay dharna at Rajghat’ in Delhi to bring the State’s grim situation to the Centre’s notice. Since Section 144 was in place in Delhi, Congress MLAs would go from Punjab Bhawan to Rajghat in batches of four only and he would lead the first batch. He appealed to MLAs of other political parties too to join the ‘dharnas’ in the interest of the State which, he said, was facing a dire situation at present with the last of the private power plants also shutting down on November 3. The situation on the ground was grim as the State had run out of coal, urea, DAP and other essential supplies due to the decision of the railways not to ply goods trains even after the farmers eased their blockade to allow such movement. “With its bid for power purchase not cleared for today, the State was facing extreme power shortage, all agricultural and vegetable supplies had been curtailed, and high loss feeders power supply had been cut,” the Chief Minister said, adding that the people of Punjab were staring at a dark festival season. The continued and inexplicable suspension of goods trains was also having serious consequences for Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh, he stated. Senior SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema accused the State government and the BJP-led Central government of playing a fixed match to defame farmers’ organisations and described the Congress’s proposed ‘dharna’ as a gimmick. He said the Chief Minister should meet the Ministers concerned and the Prime Minister if needed and ensure all inbound trains to Punjab were restarted. “If he does not do that and indulges in politics by holding a sham ‘dharna’ in Delhi it will be proved beyond doubt that Capt. Amarinder is not interested in resolving the current crisis.”  ‘Only gimmicks’ AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann termed the Congress’s ‘dharna’ a well thought-out ploy to derail the peasant struggle. “... why Capt. Amarinder Singh is seeking an audience with the President of the country over the contentious laws, while all know that the decision to withdraw the black laws is in the hands of the Prime Minister. He is simply trying to fool the people by resorting to such cheap gimmicks,” said Mr. Mann.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-chief-minister-to-lead-mlas-dharna-in-delhi-today/article33017836.ece
04 November 2020||Guwahati,||Assam govt. seeks NIA probe into man’s death in Mizoram||The Assam government has sought a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the death of a 48-year-old, who was allegedly abducted by miscreants and killed in Mizoram amid an economic blockade by groups in Assam leading to shortage of essentials in Mizoram. The two States have been embroiled in a border dispute since October 17, with Assam accusing Mizoram of encroaching large swathes of land in Cachar and Karimganj districts. Tension along the 164.6 km boundary between the two States escalated on Monday following the death of Intiaz Ali Laskar, a resident of Lailapur in Assam’s Cachar district, in a community health centre at Vairengte in Mizoram’s Kolasib district. A statement from Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s office on November 2 said Laskar was abducted by miscreants. The Mizoram government claimed he was a drug trader who was injured grievously while being chased by a local vigilante group. “We visited the affected areas to assess the situation. We handed over to the bereaved family a condolence message from the Chief Minister besides an ex-gratia of Rs. 5 lakh. The issue is being taken up at the highest level,” Assam Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua told The Hindu on Tuesday evening after visiting the disputed area with Director General of Police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta. Assam Home Department officials said a decision had been taken to hand over the investigation of Mr Ali’s death to the NIA. Mizoram Excise officials allegedly found 420 mg of heroin with the man, registered a case against him and sent him to a community health centre where he died of his injuries. Mr. Ali’s relatives trashed the allegations of the Mizoram officials, saying he was a firewood collector. Assam has asked Mizoram to investigate Mr Ali’s death by following the relevant National Human Rights Commission guidelines applicable in case of custodial deaths. FIR by Assam police Assam Deputy DIG (Southern Range) Dilip Kumar Dey said a FIR in connection with the death was filed at the Dhalai police station in Cachar district. Meanwhile,the Mizoram government has asked Assam officials to protect the stranded Mizos who could be victims of violence as a reaction to the death. “In order to prevent any retaliatory actions by interested parties within Assam especially along the inter-State border, I would like to request you to ensure the safety and security of Mizo communities living within Assam...,” a message from David H. Lalthangliana, Mizoram Home Department’s Deputy Secretary, to Assam’s Home Commissioner-Secretary read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-govt-seeks-nia-probe-into-mans-death-in-mizoram/article33017837.ece

No cloud cover, snowfall The fall in the minimum temperature has been attributed to the absence of cloud cover and snowfall in the upper Himalayas that has blown cold winds towards the region. November is expected to be colder than usual after the mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius. The normal mean minimum temperature for October in the Capital is around 19.1 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature on Tuesday, however, settled one degree above normal at 31.6 degrees Celsius and is likely to stay above 30 degrees Celsius till November 7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mercury-dips-to-10c-imd-may-declare-a-cold-wave/article33018228.ece
