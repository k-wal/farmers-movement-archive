Wind speeds at the time of landfall are expected to reach 120-130 kmph, gusting to 145 kmph. The cyclonic system moved westwards with a speed of 5 kmph and lay about 320 km east-southeast of Cuddalore, about 350 km southeast of Puducherry and 400 km east-southeast of Chennai late on Tuesday. It is likely to intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next six hours and into a very severe cyclonic storm during the subsequent 12 hours, moving west-northwestwards for the next six hours and then northwestwards. With extremely heavy rainfall and gusty winds expected, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami declared a public holiday in the State on Wednesday. Relief camps ready: CM Mr. Palaniswami said 3,344 relief camps have been kept ready and a total of 275 persons from the Ariyalur, Chidambaram, Cuddalore and Vridhachalam areas have already been relocated to nine relief camps. Special attention is being paid to 4,133 places, identified as vulnerable spots, the Chief Minister said. Ambulances, high-power generators, tree-cutting equipment and other necessary machinery have also been kept ready, he added. More than 43,400 persons, including more than 14,200 women, have been trained as first responders and are ready. A total of 5,505 persons trained by the State Disaster Response Force and 691 Home Guards are also involved in the job. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has readied 22 teams — 12 in Tamil Nadu, three in Puducherry and seven in Andhra Pradesh — to handle emergency operations. “All teams have reliable wireless and satellite communications, tree cutters/pole cutters for post-landfall restoration, if the need arises,” the organisation said in a statement. The storm is expected to damage standing crop, trees and thatched rooftops, according to officials from the Meteorological Department, and advisories have been in place since Sunday to fishermen to avoid going out to sea. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said when the cyclone makes landfall on Wednesday, coastal areas could experience widespread rain and many places in interior districts might get moderate rain. The rainfall intensity may be extremely heavy (more than 24.4 cm) in one or two areas in Puducherry, Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Ariyalur, Kallakurichi, Perambalur, Villupuram and Tiruvannamalai, apart from coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema. Nearly 16 districts, including Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Vellore, Dharmapuri, Salem, Tiruchi and Thanjavur, may receive heavy to very heavy rain up to 24 cm, in one or two places. Squally winds at speeds of 120-130 kmph, sometimes gusting up to 145 kmph, are expected in Nagapattinam, Karaikal, Puducherry, Mayiladuthurai, Cuddalore, Villupuram and Chengalpattu when the cyclone approaches the coast. Close watch In Chennai, where the memory of the December 2015 floods is still fresh, water managers are closely monitoring the level in reservoirs, particularly Chembarambakkam. “We are taking readings of the water level every two hours. The water level at Chembarambakkam reservoir stood at 21.32 feet and received an inflow of 648 cubic feet per second (cusecs) till 6 p.m. on Tuesday. If we get around 2,500 cusecs for 24 hours, the water level will reach 22 feet and some amount of water would be released with warning,” said an official of the Water Resources Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-puducherry-on-edge-as-nivar-closes-in/article33173555.ece
25 November 2020||MANGALURU,||Mangaluru University to have its own tabulation system||Mangalore University has decided to have its own marks tabulation system from 2021-22 academic year in view of the shortcomings observed in the existing system, said Registrar (Evaluation), P.L. Dharma on Tuesday. Prof. Dharma told reporters here that the university has taken serious note of errors during the tabulation done by an outsourced agency wherein two degree students whose results were declared as pass were actually found to have failed. This was a technical error, he said and added that notice was issued to the agency in this regard. “It’s a grave error,” Prof. Dharma said and added that the two students were among the eight who were unhappy with the result and were provided an opportunity to examine their scripts in person, seek re-totalling and revaluation. Prof. Dharma said that in keeping with UGC guidelines the university conducted examinations for the final semester students of 16 degree courses between September 26 and October 19. A total of 40,942 students wrote the examinations. Results have so far been announced for eight degree courses. “The problem was seen only with the two degree students,” he said. The firm tabulating the results said that the problem was a result of OMR marking error and manual correction in OMR. “We will conduct a thorough inquiry and safeguard student interests,” he said. To overcome this problem, Mr. Dharma said, the university will have its own evaluation and marks tabulation system from 2021. “We have gained experience in marks tabulation system. We will have our own system for the first semester courses next year,” he said. The new “Pareeksha Bhavan” (Evaluation Centre) coming up on the university campus will give impetus to this exercise, he added. Special exam A special examination will be conducted on December 21 for the final semester graduate and post-graduate students who failed to attend the examinations in September and October because of COVID-19. Apart from centres in the district, the September-October examinations were conducted in centres in Dharwad, Jammu & Kashmir, Manipur, Lakshadweep, Bhutan and Fiji. Students, including six Sri Lankan citizens, will write the special examination at Mangaluru, Madikeri and Udupi, he said. Special Officer (Distance Education) Sangappa and Special Officer from Evaluation Section Ramesh were present.  ‘The university has taken serious note of errors during the tabulation done by an outsourced agency wherein two degree students whose results were declared as pass were actually found to have failed’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mangaluru-university-to-have-its-own-tabulation-system/article33174154.ece
25 November 2020||MYSURU,||Crackdown on drugs will continue unabated: Bommai||The State has launched a war against drug menace and the seizures during the last six months exceeds the quantum of narcotics seized in the last 10 years, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said here on Tuesday. He was speaking at the inaugural function of the Police Commissioner’s office complex. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa inaugurated the new complex in the presence of elected representatives of the region and senior police officers. The Home Minister said the crackdown on drugs would continue unabated until the menace was rooted out. ‘Crime rate down’ He said the crime rate in the State had declined significantly during the last one-and-a-half years of the BJP government but the police and the Home Department would not be complacent. Mr. Bommai said the crackdown against drugs was also concomitant with the tracking down of economic offences and cybercrime. With the growth in technology, incidents of cyber crime, bank frauds, and other economic offences could also see a perceptible rise, and to tackle this dedicated cells had been constituted in all the districts, the Minister added.  With regard to recruitment and filling of vacancies, Mr. Bommai said the State government had started the recruitment process to fill nearly 16,000 vacancies in the Police Department and it was expected to be completed in two years. Mr. Bommai said ‘Police Gruha 2020’ would come to an end in December but the Chief Minister had already announced in the budget that the project would be extended and provided funds till 2025. This would facilitate the construction and completion of 11,000 houses as quarters for the police personnel. Police Gruha is being implemented by the Karnataka State Police Housing Corporation Ltd. and the objective is to provide residential quarters for police personnel. The project receives 25% of the construction cost by way of grant from the State government while the remaining is borne by the corporation through institutional loans. The Home Minister also paid encomiums to the police staff for their role in the war against the COVID-19 pandemic besides maintaining law and order all of which, the Minister said, helped instill a sense of well-being among the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/crackdown-on-drugs-to-continue-unabated/article33173663.ece

The Chief Minister said ponds could overflow due to heavy rains and continuous monitoring should be done and precautionary measures taken. He asked officials to utilise the services of village secretariat employees and volunteers and keep the NDRF and SDRF teams ready. Officials were told to keep ready power poles for immediate restoration in case of power outage. He said control rooms working 24 hours should be set up in each district collectorate and at mandal centres. A booklet outlining the steps to be taken during a cyclone had been made available at all village secretariats and the information should be shared with staff and the public, he said.

The directive was given on a case related to the pollution caused by the discharge of sewage generated from the stadium and commercial establishments into the nearby drains in view of the poor functioning of the sewage treatment plant. The Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta had entrusted a joint committee to submit a report on the samples taken from the inlet and outlet of the plant to check its efficiency. It had also asked for a report on the collection and disposal of waste generated when the stadium and its premises were given for conducting various events. The joint committee informed the tribunal that the plant was operational. But the quantity of effluent reaching the plant was considerably low, which was about 20-25 KLD only against the designed capacity of 750 KLD. The efficiency of the plant needed to be ascertained when tournaments or large meetings were held in the stadium, it said. The committee had recommended the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) that it could ask those using the stadium ground and its premises for various events to utilise the plant for waste disposal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ngt-asks-pcb-corpn-to-submit-report-on-upkeep-of-stadium/article33174130.ece

25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||PM tells States to prepare for vaccine distribution||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday asked the State governments to set up steering committees and block-wise task forces to prepare for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines as and when they are available for disbursal, but spent much of his meeting with Chief Ministers emphasising that the focus should still be on containing the spread of the virus. “Vaccines will be available when they pass all the tests for validation of data and regulatory frameworks. We must keep our focus on making sure there is no unmanageable surge in cases. We don’t know which vaccine will pass the scientific parameters for disbursal in our country and by what date, but I want all States to set up steering committees and task forces down to the block-level for preparing for vaccine disbursal,” he said. Mr. Modi added: “It will be a large scale enterprise looking at the size of our country and keeping in mind our experience with large immunisation campaigns, we want this to be a smooth exercise with great coordination with State governments, who are the best judge of how things are to be done in particular States.” The government was in touch “in real time” with vaccine candidate institutions, manufacturers, international organisations and governments coordinating vaccine efforts and international companies to ensure that information on vaccine availability was up to date, he said. Cold storage facilities While the availability of vaccines was in the hands of scientists and the pricing depended on various factors, as public servants, governments should prepare cold chain spots, and availability of staff for disbursal and also any “adverse events” regarding side effects of the vaccine. “Regardless of everything, whichever vaccine is distributed in our country, rest assured it will have passed all the scientific parameters,” Mr. Modi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-tells-states-to-prepare-for-vaccine-distribution/article33173553.ece

25 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Revenue expenditure on positive side||Despite a fall in own tax and non-tax revenue, a positive growth has been registered in the revenue expenditure across all southern States during the COVID-19. But, only Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have registered a positive growth in the capital expenditure. The composition of the State government expenditure changed during the period with substantial increase in the share of social sector. The highest increase in subsidy expenditure of 67% was also registered in the State. More than 100% hike in revenue and fiscal deficits in all the southern States, except Tamil Nadu (fiscal deficit of 89%), and the corresponding swell in borrowing are the common features of all States during the pandemic period. A comparative analysis of the “State finances of southern States post-COVID-19” done by Anitha Kumary L. and Parma Chakravartti of the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation has found that the fiscal performance of the Kerala is better when compared to States such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana during the first quarter of 2020. Kerala’s finances during April-August 2020 show a remarkable increase in subsidy expenditure (259%) which is a clear indication of the intervention to contain the pandemic by providing social security programmes. The total expenditure, which comprises revenue and capital expenditure, shows an increase in quarter one of 2020 vis-à-vis quarter one in 2019 in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Telangana with no change in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The highest growth is observed in Andhra Pradesh (118%) followed by Telangana (33%). In revenue expenditure, the highest growth is in Andhra Pradesh (113%) followed by Telangana (45%), Kerala (16%), Karnataka (6%) and Tamil Nadu (2%). In capital expenditure, the maximum growth is observed in Andhra Pradesh (160%) followed by Kerala (22%). The fiscal measures to handle the pandemic adopted by Kerala appears remarkable as is evident from components of revenue expenditure and its sector-wise pattern. During quarter I of 2019, the share of social sector expenditure was the lowest in Kerala (30.5%) and highest in Andhra Pradesh (59.5%), whereas the share of general sector expenditure was the highest in Kerala (53.9%) and lowest in Andhra Pradesh (17.8%). One of the key features of expenditure observed in Kerala is the fall in share of general sector expenditure from 53.9% to 40.5%. This is an indication of strong response in addressing the pandemic. Revenue receipts, which comprise State’s own tax revenue, non-tax revenue, share in Central taxes and grants-in-aid, show a negative growth in all States, except Andhra Pradesh (35%). Lockdown shock The shock of the lockdown is still reflected in the own tax revenue collection. The negative growth in the own tax revenue collection has resulted in huge growth in the borrowings in quarter one of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 with a highest borrowing of 478% in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh (256%), 180% in Telangana, 113% in Kerala and 89% in Tamil Nadu. The comparative analysis of the deficit indicators suggests that revenue deficit increased by more than 100% in all States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/revenue-expenditure-on-positive-side/article33173765.ece
25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Farooq, Omar on land grab list||The Jammu and Kashmir administration has posted on its website details of 0.9 acre of government land in Jammu that has been allegedly encroached by former Chief Ministers Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah for “residential” purpose. The details of the property — Khasra no 4, 5 and 6 in Sunjwan village of Bahu tehsil in Jammu district registered in the name of the Abdullahs — has been included in a list that says “encroached State land (physically encroached but not shown in revenue record) — Other than Roshni.” The list published on Tuesday includes details of properties belonging to two other persons — Mushtaq Chaya, a businessman, and Ashfaq Mir, son of a retired judge. The list comprising names of National Conference politicians Syed Akhoon, Aslam Goni, Haroon Chowdhary, Sujjad Kichloo, Abdul Majid Wani and M.Y Khan, former J&K Bank chairman, who are alleged to have encroached on government land in Sunjwan village, was published on Monday. The “quantum of State land occupied illegally (physically) approx” by Abdullahs stands at 7 kanals (0.875 acres) and 7 marlas (0.043 acre). A senior government official claimed the land “encroached” by the former Chief Ministers is “forest land”. The list of beneficiaries of the Roshni Act include Suraiya Mattoo, Farooq Abdullah’s sister. The list also claimed that Sher-e-Kashmir Bhavan, the building housing the office of National Conference in Jammu, and the office of Nawai-Subah Trust of NC in Srinagar was also allotted under the Roshni Act. The National Conference said in a statement that the “news attributing to sources that party President and MP Srinagar Dr. Farooq Abdullah is a beneficiary of the Roshni Scheme is completely false and is being spread with a malicious intent.” “Dr. Farooq Abdullah has NOT availed of the Roshni Scheme for either his residence in Srinagar or in Jammu and anyone who says otherwise is lying. The fact that they are using sources to plant this story shows that it has no legs to stand on,” the statement said. The Jammu and Kashmir High Court in an order on October 9 had directed that details of “State land in unauthorised occupation” shall be disclosed on the government website.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farooq-omar-on-land-grab-list/article33173512.ece
25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. to track vaccine reactions||The Health Ministry has written to the State governments and the Union Territory administrations to put in place a robust system for the reporting and gathering of information on the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines once they are rolled out. The Ministry has identified initiatives to strengthen the reporting of Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI), said a letter by Manohar Agnani, Additional Secretary, Health Ministry. The States and the Union Territories have been requested to implement the steps. The Ministry has asked that more medical specialists be part of the AEFI committees. “COVID-19 vaccination will be given to adults many of whom may have co-morbidities. Events due to pre-existing co-morbidities (stroke/heart attacks, etc) may be reported as AEFI following COVID-19 vaccination. Membership of State AEFI committees should be revised to include neurologists, cardiologists, respiratory medicine specialists who can recognise such events and differentiate them from events related to vaccine and vaccination. Similarly, direction may be issued to districts to include medical specialists (neurologists and cardiologists) in district AEFI committees,” the letter said. Case load Delhi again reported the highest daily number of new COVID-19 cases at 4,454 and casualties at 121. Maharashtra followed with 4,153 new cases. At least 480 case fatalities have been reported in the past 24 hours, and 10 States and Union Territories account for 73.54% of new deaths, noted a release issued by the Health Ministry on Tuesday. “Delhi has also reported the maximum number of single day recoveries with 7,216 newly recovered cases. 5,425 people recovered in Kerala followed by 3,729 in Maharashtra. 77.04% of the new cases are from 10 States and UTs. The recovery rate has also increased to 93.76% and the recoveries currently stands at 86,04,955. 75.71% of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 States/UTs,” it said. The release noted that India had registered fewer than 40,000 daily new cases after six days. The number of daily new cases was 37,975. For the last 17 days in a row, daily new cases had been below the 50,000 mark. Giving details of India’s testing infrastructure, the Ministry said the country currently had 2,134 labs. “10,99,545 samples were tested in the last 24 hours. An average of more than 10 lakh tests conducted daily has ensured that the cumulative positivity rate is sustained at low levels and is presently following a downward trajectory,” the release said. The cumulative national positivity rate stands at 6.87% currently as per the Ministry and the daily positivity rate is 3.45%. “Higher volumes of testing eventually lead to low positivity rate. The tests per million (TPM) has increased to 96,871 tests. There has been a sustained decrease in the number of active cases over the past few weeks. 42,314 cases recovered and discharged in the last 24 hours. The active case load has fallen to 4,38,667. The present contribution of active case load to India’s total positive cases stands at 4.78%, following a declining curve,” the Ministry added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-to-track-vaccine-reactions/article33173514.ece
25 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala to withdraw amendment||A special meeting of the Kerala Cabinet on Tuesday decided to request Governor Arif Muhammad Khan to promulgate a “withdrawal” ordinance to revoke the controversial executive order that sought to empower the police to prosecute persons disseminating defamatory content. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who chaired the meeting, said different quarters supportive of the government had expressed alarm that Section 118-A of the amended Kerala Police Act (KPA), 2011, bestowed unfettered powers on the law enforcement to curtail free speech and media freedom. The government factored in public anxiety about the law. It acted with perceptiveness and annulled it, Mr. Vijayan said. The government had introduced the amendment in good faith. It sought to give more teeth to the police to crackdown on vile and hateful social media messaging that targeted women, children, transgender people and other vulnerable sections of society. Moreover, such attacks had led to acts of vigilantism that threatened public peace and social order. It was widely felt the existing law was inadequate to deal with the legal challenges posed by the new media. The ordinance targeted defamatory social media posts and online content. Its intent was not to curb reportage, political satire, opinion, free speech, impartial journalism or commentary, Mr. Vijayan said. The government was unlikely to revisit the law. The government would place any future revision to the law, if at all, in the Assembly to evolve a political consensus before enactment. The government had come under criticism from the Opposition parties, civil rights activists and journalist bodies for promulgating a “black law” that threatened free speech. They claimed the law accorded untrammelled power to the police to scour published and aired content for libellous material. The amendment also empowered the police to initiate prosecution on their own and even in the absence of a specific complaint. Moreover, the Opposition parties argued the law did not distinguish between social and online media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-to-withdraw-amendment/article33173487.ece
25 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala records a flat case graph||Kerala reported a slight drop in test positivity rate for COVID-19 on Tuesday, at 9.04%, and added 5,420 new cases of infection. The State tested 59,983 samples. Total new cases – 37,609 – registered between Nov 15-21, was lower than the previous week (Nov 8-14), which was 40,592.

25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Sputnik V shows interim efficacy of 91%, says RDIF||The Russian COVID-19 vaccine candidate Sputnik V has shown an interim efficacy of 91% based on analysing results from nearly 18,000 volunteers, some of whom got the actual vaccine and others a placebo, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Tuesday. The vaccine candidate is also being tested on human volunteers in India and will cost “less than $10 [Rs. 700] for international markets”, the RDIF said in a statement. The latest trial data do not include those of Indian volunteers. While the interim vaccine efficacy numbers are in same range as trial data reported by biotechnology and pharma companies such as Pfizer-BioNTech (95%), Moderna (94.5%) and Oxford-AstraZeneca (with an efficacy of 70%), Sputnik V appears, so far, to have relatively lower protectivity. For instance, according to the clinical trial protocol, there were three volunteers who got the vaccine for every one who got the placebo. Of the 14,095 who were inoculated with the actual Sputnik V vaccine, eight later tested positive and of the smaller placebo group, of 4,699 nearly four times as many — 31 — tested positive. From this, is derived the efficacy rate of 91%. This also translates to 1:4 protectiveness odds. By comparison, of the 95 cases Moderna analysed, 90 were observed in the placebo group versus 5 in the mRNA-1273 group — that is a 1:18 ratio. Of the 170 cases of COVID-19, as specified in the Pfizer-BioNTech study protocol, 162 cases were observed in the placebo group versus eight in those vaccinated — a 1:20 ratio. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, being tested by the Serum Institute of India, relied on 131 positives but a break-up of placebo and vaccinated volunteers was not available. “Sputnik V relies on only 39 cases and that is too low a number for an efficacy evaluation. That said this is an interim result — like the others — and we should wait for the full data. The positive side is that like the other vaccine candidates, this too is successfully attacking the spike protein and hence shows protection,” said Shahid Jameel, virologist and Head, Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University. The latest results, which are yet to be announced in a medical journal, were gleaned from ongoing double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials in Russia involving 40,000 volunteers. Of these, only 18,794 got both doses of the trial vaccine that are being administered 21 days apart. The analysis was done a week after the second dose was administered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sputnik-v-shows-interim-efficacy-of-91-says-rdif/article33173518.ece
25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Poshan Abhiyaan needs a boost: study||The National Nutrition Mission or the Poshan Abhiyaan, the world’s largest nutrition programme for children and mothers, must be stepped up to meet the targets set by the Centre to reduce stunting, wasting and anaemia by 2022, says a report by NITI Aayog. The review report drafted in March does not factor worsening poverty and hunger levels over the past seven months due to COVID-19, which is expected to dent strides made since 2018 to achieve nutritional targets.  Health survey The government’s flagship programme to improve nutritional outcomes for children, pregnant women and lactating mothers was launched in 2018 with specific targets to be achieved by 2022. It aims to reduce stunting and wasting by 2% a year (total 6% until 2022) among children and anaemia by 3% a year (total 9%) among children, adolescent girls and pregnant women and lactating mothers. More than a third of the children under five face stunting and wasting and 40% aged between one and four are anaemic. Over 50% of pregnant and other women were found to be anaemic, said the National Family Health Survey 4 released in 2016. The government’s policy think tank warns, “We need to now accelerate actions on multiple fronts. We need to quickly graduate to a POSHAN-plus strategy which apart from continued strengthening the four pillars of the Abhiyaan also requires renewed focus on other social determinants in addition to addressing the governance challenges of NHM/ICDS delivery mechanisms,” notes the NITI Aayog’s third progress report on the Nutrition Mission. The report calls for a need to lay as much emphasis on complementary feeding as it does on breastfeeding, which it points out can help avert 60% of the total stunting cases in India. On stunting, the review says that India’s targets are conservative as compared to the global target defined by the World Health Assembly (WHA), which is a prevalence rate of 5% of stunting as opposed to India’s goal of reducing stunting levels to 13.3% by 2022. The target of reducing prevalence levels of anaemia among pregnant women from 50.3% in 2016 to 34.4% in 2022 and among adolescent girls from 52.9% in 2016 to 39.66%, is also considered conservative. Rising poverty Significantly, the report was prepared before COVID-19 spread rapidly across the country, but was released only last month. Experts warn that deepening poverty and hunger may delay achieving the goals defined under the Nutrition Mission. “The projections are optimistic, and will need to be re-adjusted for the COVID-19 disruptions to health and nutrition services,” says Purnima Menon, Senior Research Fellow at International Food Policy Research Institute, which provided technical support and data to NITI Aayog for the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/poshan-abhiyaan-needs-a-boost-study/article33173520.ece
25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Kerala moves SC on airport takeover||The Kerala government on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court against the Centre’s “illegal” move to hand over the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport to the Adani group. The State government, represented by advocate C.K. Sasi, sought an interim stay on a decision of the Kerala High Court on October 19, allowing the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to let Adani Enterprises Limited take over the “operation, management and development” of the airport. The State said the preference given by the Centre to a private concessionaire like Adani, which has no experience in the field of managing airports, smacks of arbitrariness. The High Court favoured the handover of a vital facility to a private entity though it was not in the interest of better management of the airport. The entire proceeding, including the tender process, was in violation of the provisions of the Airports Authority of India Act, 1994, the State said. The concession was given to the Adani group despite a proposal from the Kerala government to form a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to run the airport on a revenue-sharing basis, the appeal said. The Chief Minister had even offered to take up the project at the rate on a par with what was quoted by the Adani company, it said. The appeal said the State had given the AAI land free of cost for airport construction on the assurance that it would be involved in the forming of an SPV. This was a “legitimate expectation”, it said. “The Chief Minister, on November 21, 2018, wrote to the Civil Aviation Minister, informing that the State government has been actively associated in transferring land to the AAI, without having any legal obligation to do so, on the explicit understanding that Kerala would be associated by forming an SPV whenever the AAI felt the need to transfer the management of the airport to any entity,” the State argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-moves-sc-on-airport-takeover/article33173492.ece
25 November 2020||Lucknow,||Jail term, fine for ‘unlawful’ religious conversions in U.P.||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave its nod to an ordinance that makes religious conversion a non-bailable offence inviting penalties up to 10 years in prison if found to be effected for marriage or through misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or other allegedly fraudulent means. The U.P. Unlawful Religious Conversion Prohibition Ordinance, 2020 was cleared by the Cabinet weeks after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath promised to bring an “effective law” against “love jihad”, a legally unrecognised term. Violation of the provisions of the law would invite a jail term of not less than one year extendable to five years with a fine of Rs. 15,000. However, if a minor woman or a woman from the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribes communities was converted through the said unlawful means, the jail term would be a minimum of three years and could be extended to 10 years with a fine of Rs. 25,000. The ordinance also lays down strict action, including cancellation of registration of social organisations conducting mass conversions. Mass conversions would invite a jail term of not less than three years up to 10 years and a fine of Rs. 50,000, reads the operative statement on the ordinance. In case of conversion done by a woman for the sole purpose of marriage, the marriage would be declared null and void.  The ordinance further said that the burden to prove that a conversion was not done through misrepresentation would be on the person converting or those who facilitated it. A person seeking to convert to another to another religion for marriage would have to inform the district magistrate two months prior to it through a prescribed form.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jail-term-fine-for-illegal-conversions-in-up/article33173510.ece
25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Farmers set out for ‘indefinite siege’ of Delhi from tomorrow||The Union Agriculture Ministry has invited Punjab farmer leaders to come to Delhi for continued talks on December 3, even as all-India farmers groups gear up to launch an “indefinite siege” of the capital from November 26, in protest against the three controversial agricultural reform laws and a proposed Electricity Bill, 2020. Over one lakh farmers from Punjab alone are expected to come to Delhi with their tractors and will stay until their demands for repeal of the three laws have been heard, said leaders of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee at a press conference on Tuesday. “After the extended discussion on the problems of farmers held on November 13, it was decided that this dialogue would be continued. The Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, again invites you for the next round of discussion at 11 a.m. on December 3 in Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi,” read the invitation sent to 32 protesting groups by acting Agriculture Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey on Tuesday. The round of talks held earlier this month ended inconclusively, but most farmers groups later agreed to end their rail roko protest. However, when the Railways resumed services, one farmers group continued to block the tracks on Tuesday, preventing a passenger train from plying, potentially returning to the stalemate in the State. “In principle, Punjab farmers groups are not against talks with the government. But it needs to be held in a congenial atmosphere. We condemn the crackdown of the Haryana government against farmer leaders there,” said Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal, who is also a member of the AIKSCC’s national working group. “Our participation in the talks will depend on what happens on November 26 and 27.” The AIKSCC, a platform of more than 300 farmers groups, along with the 32 Punjab groups, had issued a call for “Delhi Chalo” to demand the repeal of the three new laws, which they feel will dilute the system of government procurement of farm produce at minimum support prices, and benefit corporates rather than small farmers. The Centre says the laws will reform the agricultural marketing system and provide new choices and opportunities for farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-set-out-for-indefinite-siege-of-delhi-from-tomorrow/article33173523.ece
25 November 2020||Omar Rashid LUCKNOW,||Won’t interfere in personal relations, says Allahabad HC||The right to live with a person of his or her choice irrespective of religion is intrinsic to the right to life and liberty. Interference in a personal relationship would constitute a serious encroachment into the right to freedom of choice of two individuals, the Allahabad High Court has said. The court made the observations while quashing an FIR against a Muslim man and his family from Kushinagar district by the father of his Hindu wife. A Division Bench of Justices Pankaj Naqvi and Vivek Agarwal also stated that a recent single-judge order of the court dismissing a writ petition filed by an inter-faith married couple seeking police protection on grounds that the conversion just for the purpose of marriage was unacceptable, was not laying good law. In the Kushinagar case, petitioner Salamat Ansari filed a writ seeking the quashing of an FIR against him under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Mr. Ansari submitted that the couple were adults and had performed nikah on September 19, 2019, as per Muslim rites and rituals. The girl, Priyanka Kharwar, renounced her Hindu identity and embraced Islam and the couple had been living together peacefully for the past year. Mr. Ansari also said that the FIR was lodged at the Vishnupura police station by his father-in-law out of “malice and mischief,” only with a view to bring an end to their marital ties. Counsel for the government and the informant opposed the submissions on grounds that conversion just for contracting a marriage was prohibited and that such marriage had no sanctity in law. They cited a single-judge judgment in the 2014 case of Noor Jahan Begum alias Anjali Mishra and its recent reiteration in the Priyanshi alias Shamreen case on September 23. In both cases, the girls had converted before marriage. The High Court quashed the FIR against Mr. Ansari and his family and stressed that the courts and the constitutional courts in particular were enjoined to uphold the life and liberty of an individual guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. “We do not see Priyanka Kharwar and Salamat as Hindu and Muslim, rather as two grown-up individuals who, out of their own free will and choice, are living together peacefully and happily,” Justice Naqvi said. “We fail to understand that if the law permits two persons even of the same sex to live together peacefully, then neither any individual nor even State can have objection to relationship of two major individuals who out of their own free will are living together,” he added.  If law permits two people of same sex also to live together ... no one can object to relationship of two adults Justice Pankaj Naqvi||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wont-interfere-in-personal-relations-says-allahabad-hc/article33173526.ece
25 November 2020||Bengaluru,||Adhere to COVID-19 norms in rallies: HC||Taking note of a call given for a Karnataka bandh on December 5 to oppose the creation of the Maratha Development Board, the High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday ordered notice to the Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha, which has given the bandh call. The court also ordered issue of notice to the BJP, the Congress, the Janata Dal, and the CPI (Marxist) asking them whether they are willing to ensure that their members and workers don’t violate COVID-19 norms of wearing masks and maintaining social distance during political rallies/campaigns. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Letzkit Foundation, Bengaluru, on COVID-19 norm violations by celebrities, political leaders, and elected representatives. When brought to the court’s notice the call given for bandh, the Bench said there is every likelihood that COVID-19 norms would be set at knot. Take responsibility The Bench observed that the “time has come for political parties to take responsibilities to ensure strict adherence to norms of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing during rallies” while pointing out that a large number of instances of violation of norms were by political parties during the recent bypolls to the State Assembly and other political rallies. Pointing out that the State government for the “sake of taking action” had taken belated steps against some of the party leaders and workers for violation of norms, the Bench said it is the responsibility of all political parties to join hands with the State government to ensure that the norms are strictly implemented during political rallies. Violations galore The Bench decided to make political parties as respondents in the proceedings after noticing a large number of violation of norms and actions initiated by the State government only after the court took cognisance of such violations brought to its notice by the petitioners. Meanwhile, the government counsel told the Bench that the amendment to rectify the error in the Karnataka Epidemic Disease Act, 2020 would be carried out during the forthcoming winter session of the State Legislature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adhere-to-covid-19-norms-in-rallies-hc/article33173478.ece
25 November 2020||KOCHI,||‘Sivasankar abetted gold smuggling’||Swapna Suresh, second accused in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, has given a statement that M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, had abetted the gold smuggling activities and was “in the know of things,” claims the Cochin Customs. The Customs revealed the reported role of Sivasankar in the smuggling case in his remand report and custody application which was filed before the Economic Offences Court, Ernakulam, on Tuesday. It was after formally recording the arrest of Sivasankar at the district jail in the morning that the Customs officials approached the Economic Offence Court seeking his custody. Swapna’s statement The Customs recorded the statement of Swapna under Section 108 of the Customs Act. The statements made under Section 108 would be treated as an evidence against those who made it and against those who were referred to in it. Customs officials submitted that they had interrogated Swapna on November 18 at the Women’s Jail, Attakkulangara, Thiruvan- anthapuram. Swapna had also admitted before the Enforcement Directorate that Sivasankar had used his influence in clearing the smuggled gold, it pointed out. The Customs officials said they had obtained direct incriminating materials against “Sivasankar of his involvement and being concerned in smuggling of gold illegally, which is an offence under the Customs Act, 1962.” Non-bailable offence As the value of the gold seized in the case exceeded Rs. 1 crore, the offence committed by Sivasankar was non-bailable, they submitted.  The agency sought 10 days of departmental custody of the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sivasankar-abetted-gold-smuggling/article33173482.ece
25 November 2020||MYSURU,||‘Vaccine likely in four to six weeks’||Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has claimed that there were indications of the vaccine against COVID-19 becoming available in about four to six weeks. Speaking to reporters after his arrival in Mysuru on Tuesday, Mr. Yediyurappa referred to the virtual meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi had with Chief Ministers of different States earlier in the day and said the Prime Minister had asked States to prepare themselves for distribution of the vaccine in all the districts. He said the Prime Minister had asked the Chief Ministers to establish a system for proper distribution of the vaccine, which can take about four to six weeks. When asked about the possibility of a fresh lockdown in view of indications of a possible second wave of COVID-19 infections, Mr. Yediyurappa nodded in the negative and walked away.  Meanwhile, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai told presspersons that the government had decided to constitute a State-level steering committee headed by the Chief Minister to monitor vaccination for COVID-19. Similarly, Deputy Commissioners and tahsildars will head steering committees at the district and taluk levels, he said. Mr. Bommai said the government is planning to follow arrangements made during elections to administer the vaccine to the general public. “Vaccination centres would be formed and workers will be trained for the exercise,” the Home Minister said. A digital platform would be developed to collate inoculation data, as people who are vaccinated might require two or three doses to achieve resistance, Mr. Bommai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-likely-in-four-to-six-weeks/article33173488.ece

Ranganath, the then Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru North sub-division, on the allegation of illegally granting government gomala land worth hundreds of crores to private persons. Also, the court directed the government to inform the action taken based on an inquiry report, submitted in July by the Principal Secretary (Revenue Department), in which illegalities committed by Mr. Ranganath were pointed out while recommending initiation of disciplinary action against him. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty issued the direction on a PIL petition filed by Krishna Ramaiah, a resident of the city. The petitioner has sought a direction from the court to entrust the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The inquiry report of the Principal Secretary had pointed out that Mr. Ranganath, who served in the post between March 26 and June 26, 2020, had passed several orders of which 15 were related to claims by private parties on about 37 acres of government gomala land. It said that Mr. Ranganath had passed the orders in favour of private persons without examining the original records.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-seeks-update-on-official-accused-of-allowing-land-grab/article33174025.ece
25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||A year on, South Asian University still headless||At a time when the Union government is trying to encourage international education in India, an existing international institution is facing a crisis of leadership. The Delhi-based South Asian University, established by all eight SAARC countries, has not had a president for over a year, while its executive council and governing board have not met for almost two and three years respectively. After a decade of existence, the university has yet to appoint a non-Indian president, despite rules stipulating a rotation among the member countries. Faculty members have now written to the chair of the Board, currently held by Nepal, and to the acting president of the university, complaining about interference by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and a dilution of the university’s international nature. Acting president Ranjan Kumar Mohanty told The Hindu that the MEA’s involvement was justified as India is the biggest funder of the institution. “One of the reasons for the uniqueness of this University is its mandate, as reflected in its Rules and Regulations, for a South Asia-wide representation among all the constituents of the University, with the President being appointed in accordance with Rule 5 of the SAU Rules,” said a letter dated November 17, sent by the South Asian University Faculty Association to Bhim Prasad Subedi, chairman of the governing board who also heads Nepal’s University Grants Commission. Out of a faculty strength of 58, only six are not from India, although half the student strength is from the other SAARC countries. The two letters were signed by 42 faculty members, who also raised concerns that the lack of a full-time president has led to administrative apathy, with salaries and promotions frozen, and research grants suspended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-year-on-south-asian-university-still-headless/article33173529.ece

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||T.N., Puducherry on edge as Nivar closes in||Nearly 16 districts, including Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Vellore, Dharmapuri, Salem, Tiruchi and Thanjavur, may receive heavy to very heavy rain up to 24 cm, in one or two places. Squally winds at speeds of 120-130 kmph, sometimes gusting up to 145 kmph, are expected in Nagapattinam, Karaikal, Puducherry, Mayiladuthurai, Cuddalore, Villupuram and Chengalpattu when the cyclone approaches the coast. Close watch In Chennai, where the memory of the December 2015 floods is still fresh, water managers are closely monitoring the level in reservoirs, particularly Chembarambakkam. “We are taking readings of the water level every two hours. The water level at Chembarambakkam reservoir stood at 21.32 feet and received an inflow of 648 cubic feet per second (cusecs) till 6 p.m. on Tuesday. If we get around 2,500 cusecs for 24 hours, the water level will reach 22 feet and some amount of water would be released with warning,” said an official of the Water Resources Department. Until early Tuesday, meteorologists had forecast a ‘severe cyclone’ but now say it will intensify further to be labelled a ‘very severe cyclone’. This is just a step below the strongest possible classification of an ‘extremely severe cyclone’. After remaining stationary for a few hours on Tuesday morning, the weather system resumed its westwards track with a speed of 5 km per hour. It may be recalled that the system was moving at an average speed of 20 km per hour on Monday. It is very likely to intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during next 12 hours and into a very severe cyclonic storm during subsequent 12 hours. It is expected to move west-northwestwards once it intensifies into a severe cyclonic storm and then northwestwards. M. Mohapatra, Director General, Indian Meterological Department, said at a press briefing that that tidal waves as high as 1-1.5 metres were expected to inundate low lying areas of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry near the place of landfall. He told The Hindu that the storm was characteristic of what was usually observed from October-December in the seas around India. Authorities in Andhra Pradesh are on high alert ahead of cyclone Nivar’s landfall, and helplines have been set up in all districts to disseminate information. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy held a review meeting with District Collectors and SPs, and asked the officials to be on high alert when the storm crosses the coast. Fishermen in Nellore and Prakasam disticts, who had ventured into the sea, rushed back as squally wind conditions prevailed. Sea water advanced up to 100 metres in the coastal mandals. NDRF and the SDRF teams were rushed to the coastal areas. Officials in Chittoor district are focussing on areas prone to water-logging and tree falls. Vigil has also been mounted at Araniyar reservoir and rivulets and causeways. In Guntur district, 16 multi-purpose rehabilitation centres were being set up in coastal mandals to evacuate in case of emergency. The Meteorological Centre, Bengaluru, has issued a Yellow Alert for districts in South Interior Karnataka including Bengaluru city, for November 25 and 26.

25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Three more FIRs linked to land scam registered||Three more FIRs linked to the Rs. 25,000-crore Roshni land scam have been registered by the CBI against Revenue Department officials and others in Srinagar district of Jammu and Kashmir, taking the number of cases to eight so far. One Sajad Parvez has been named in the first case, apart from unknown Revenue officials. In 2007, an empowered committee under the now repealed Roshni Act had granted ownership rights of State land measuring seven ‘kanals’ and seven ‘marlas’ to him under commercial category, at the rate of Rs. 45 lakh per ‘kanal’. A vigilance inquiry later found that under the Act, Mr. Parvez was not an occupant and could not have been given the ownership rights. The second FIR is against unknown public servants and others and pertains to the instances where proper procedure was not adopted while disposing of cases of illegal occupants for vesting ownerships in Srinagar. Unknown public servants and private persons are also under the scanner in the third case which mentions an audit report alleging irregularities in the transfer of land. It revealed abuse of official position in conferring undue pecuniary benefits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/three-more-firs-linked-to-land-scam-registered/article33173500.ece
25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Politically connected firms will benefit: Cong.||The Congress on Tuesday strongly opposed a proposed move of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow corporate houses to enter the banking sector and set up banks. Former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said it would “reverse” the gains made in the past 50 years. At a virtual press conference, Mr. Chidambaram and party general secretary Randeep Surjewala accused the Union government of “pushing” its agenda through RBI, and appealed to other political parties and trade unions to join the Congress in opposing the move. The party asked the government to “unequivocally” declare that it had no intention to pursue the proposal. Mr. Chidambaram said everyone knew which “politically connected corporate houses will get the first licence” if the proposal went through. “It is not the RBI’s idea. The RBI is used or misused to push the government agenda... The opaqueness leads us to believe it is entirely Mr Modi ji idea”, he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/politically-connected-firms-will-benefit-cong/article33173506.ece
25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||PM tells States to prepare for vaccine distribution||He added that it was not even certain whether the vaccine would be a single shot one or would require two or three shots. While telling the State governments to keep logistics ready for vaccine roll-out, Mr. Modi said the primary focus should still be in containing the spread of COVID-19, especially after the post-festival surge being seen in several States. He held a separate videoconference with Chief Ministers of eight States — Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Gujarat and Kerala — where cases have surged recently. “We must focus on bringing down the positivity rate below 5% and the fatality rate below 1%,” Mr. Modi said. “We have seen four stages of how people in the country have reacted to corona. In the first stage there was fear and panic of the unknown, there were cases of suicide upon diagnosis. In the second stage we found fear and suspicion of others in society as possible carriers of the disease. The third phase, when more information was available and recovery rates increased, was of acceptance and alertness. The fourth stage especially looking at the festival season was a bit of complacency and carelessness, the results of which we are seeing currently,” Mr. Modi said. He asked the State governments to emphasise that while the vaccine may arrive whenever it does, behaviour that would discourage the spread of COVID-19 should be emphasised and insisted upon. Chief Ministers who spoke during the meeting said they were fully ready to co-ordinate logistics with the Central government on the disbursal of the vaccine, with Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray stating that he was in touch with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India chief Adar Poonawalla on vaccine issues. Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said his State had already set up 630 cold chain points, with 80 more to be set up with a capacity of 85,000 litre storage. His State had also put in place 8,192 vaccinators and 27,931 spot workers for the endeavour. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said figures in her State reflected the fact that hers was a border State with patients coming in from Bangladesh and Bhutan and also from other Indian States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-tells-states-to-prepare-for-vaccine-distribution/article33173493.ece

They said the announcement was more optics than substance. In fact, they said, only less than 50% of the women officers have been actually granted PC. They stated that the actual number of women officers “granted” PC would come to 277 — less than half of 615 — women officers spread across 31 batches in 10 Arms/Services of the Army. Compared to this number, 90% male officers have been cleared for PC in the Army. “The exercise for grant of PC has been carried out more in optics, than in substance, rendering itself to be yet another instance of lip-service, adding to the long unfortunate chain of symbolic and Pyrrhic victories,” said the women officers, represented by lawyers Chitrangda Rastravara and Archana Pathak Dave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/permanent-commission-army-officers-move-sc/article33173501.ece

She was shocked and saddened to see the levels of pollution in the nation’s capital. Later, Licypriya moved to Bhubaneswar, where she saw first hand the devastating impact of cyclones on people’s livelihoods. “Coming from a State filled wit lush green mountain ranges, I was disturbed. These incidents turned me into a climate activist,” said Licypriya, who is the recipient of this year’s T.N. Khoshoo Memorial Award. Compulsory subject These events only spurred Licypriya, now 9, to work towards protecting, preserving and nurturing the environment. “I have been fighting hard to make climate change a compulsory subject in the school curriculum. States including Sikkim and Rajasthan have responded positively,” she said. The award includes a cash prize of Rs. 100,000, which Licypriya said she will use to help victims of armed conflict across the world. The award — named after the late environmental scientist and academic Triloki Nath Khoshoo — was constituted by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) in 2004. The year’s theme was ‘The science and art of outreach for environment’. Through music Grammy-winning musician and environmentalist Ricky Kej, who delivered the memorial lecture, spoke about bridging the gap between art and science, and the power of the performing arts to spread awareness. “Music can be a catalyst to inform, inspire and encourage people from awareness to action. The emotional reach of music can change hearts and minds,” he said. He stressed on the importance of educating children on issues like climate change.

25 November 2020||Bengaluru,||Karnataka varsities adopt govt. schools||A total of 34 government and private universities in Karnataka adopted government schools for development of infrastructure. Vice-Chancellors received adoption letters from Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Mr. Yediyurappa adopted 10 government schools in his Shikaripura constituency while Deputy Chief Minister Govind M. Karjol, Social Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu and Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar adopted five schools each in their constituencies. Constituency fund In the 2020-21 State Budget, the Chief Minister suggested that legislators adopt at least three schools in their constituencies to develop infrastructure using their constituency fund. Of the 53,000 government schools in the State, more than 1,400 have been adopted so far. Those who adopted schools provided necessary infrastructure such as classrooms, toilets, drinking water, playgrounds, etc. The Primary and Secondary Education Department organized a function to handover school adoption certificates to various universities, institutions, colleges, and legislators. Mr .Yediyurappa welcomed the initiative and said it was a good sign that many legislators, philanthropists, universities and private institutions were coming forward to adopt government schools to provide quality education. Delhi model Citing examples of success in school adoption programmes, Mr. Kumar said the adoption of a school at Daddalakadu in Bantwal taluk by locals helped increase students’ strength from 45 to 650. He said the State cannot follow the Delhi model since the number of schools in the national capital was only 4,000 against the 53,000 in Karnataka. M.R. Doreswamy, Adviser, Education Reforms, said that many educational institutions in the private sector responded to the school adoption initiative under their corporate social responsibility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-varsities-adopt-govt-schools/article33173479.ece
25 November 2020||Hyderabad,||‘KTR should grill Akbar on his hatred for Hindus’||Former MP and Congress leader Vijayashanti, who is all set to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), questioned the ‘selective silence’ of TRS on its friendship with MIM, particularly about MIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi’s comments on the Hindu community. “Municipal Minister K.T. Rama Rao has questioned ‘why such hatred towards Muslims’, referring to a party, but why is he not questioning his MIM friends on the unpalatable remarks made against Hindus by Mr. Owaisi,” she asked in a statement here. “Why didn’t Mr. KTR ask Mr. Owaisi why he hates Hindus so much,” she asked while recalling Mr. Owaisi’s widely circulated statement that Muslims would bring Hindus to their population strength if they were given 15 minutes of freedom in the country. He made similar ‘ridiculous’ comments on the Bhagyalakshmi temple under Charminar apart from insulting Hindus’ respect towards cows,” she said. The former MP pointed out that TRS leaders were very vocal about their friendship with MIM but are now, trying to distance themselves from it for votes in GHMC elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ktr-should-grill-akbar-on-his-hatred-for-hindus/article33173668.ece

25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Gandhi statue at Parliament to be moved out||The seated statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Parliament is set to be shifted to a temporary location to make way for the construction of a new Parliament building and would eventually be given a prominent place once the project is completed, government officials said. The construction of the new Parliament building adjacent to the existing heritage structure is scheduled to start in December. But before the work starts, the Gandhi statue would have to be moved from its existing location opposite Gate Number 1 of Parliament House, officials of the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) and Central Public Works Department (CPWD) said. Walled off A senior official said the construction site would be walled off and the statue was in the way of the boundary. The site would be sound-proofed as well, to allow Parliament to function during the 22-month construction of the new building, the official said. The eventual location of the statue in the new “legislative enclave” had been decided, the official added. Another official said the decision on where to relocate the statue temporarily would be taken by the Lok Sabha Speaker and that construction would only start after the statue is moved. The iconic 16-foot high statue of Gandhi greets visitors to Parliament House and is the site of gatherings, protests and press interactions by MPs. “The statue of the Mahatma in a meditating posture, sculpted by Ram Sutar, was unveiled by the then President of India, Dr. Shanker Dayal Sharma on October 2, 1993. The statue was donated by the Ministry of Urban Development,” according to the Rajya Sabha website. As a part of the Centre’s redevelopment of the nearly 3-km-long Central Vista from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate, a triangular parliament building is set to be constructed. The CPWD awarded the construction and maintenance contract to Tata Projects Ltd. for Rs. 861 crore in September. The redevelopment also includes the construction of 10 new office buildings for the Common Central Secretariat and revamping of Rajpath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gandhi-statue-at-parliament-to-be-moved-out/article33173516.ece

25 November 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Several subways inundated||As the monsoon’s first heavy and prolonged rains lashed the city on Tuesday, life came to a standstill for a few hours in various parts at different points of time due to water stagnation. Towards early evening, waterlogging at important stretches gave way to traffic snarls. Ahead of the Cyclone Nivar crossing the Tamil Nadu coast, several parts of the city received significant rainfall overnight with some reporting waterlogging in the morning itself. On Tuesday morning, Mambalam and Alandur had received 82 mm and 70 mm rainfall respectively. Throughout the day, the rains continued to lash the city. The spell was severe in the heart of the city during the afternoon. Several subways, including the Nungambakkam subway on Nelson Manickam Road near Loyola College, were completely inundated. Vehicles had to take alternative routes. The RBI subway too had water stagnation after a spell of heavy rains. Residents of R.K. Shanmugam Salai at K.K. Nagar said that despite rains lessening for a while in the evening, the water level did not recede on the roads. Several smaller streets were temporarily inundated after the sharp, heavy spells. Pavements submerged Footpaths that are under construction in parts of Raja Street in T. Nagar were submerged after half-an-hour of rain. At many places along the street, slabs for footpath work were piled up. Water slowly drained out when the rains ceased for thirty minutes. Santhome was flooded and the traffic police diverted smaller vehicles through the Marina loop road and Marina service road briefly. Flow of water at Vepery junction near Police Commissioner’s office and adjoining areas on Poonamallee High Road was slow and temporarily affected traffic movement. “Water from Purasawalkam and Vepery gather at that point since the culvert beneath the railway tracks is very small. The water has to cross Poonamallee High Road, then enter the culvert beneath the tracks and reach Buckingham Canal. At that point alone we have four pumps and a tanker removing water. But the volume is so huge that these machines are unable to pump out as quickly as needed,” said an official in the Highways department. A total of 55 pumps have been deployed across arterial roads in the city by the department. Liquefied Petroleum Gas cylinder delivery did not happen in many places. A distributor in West Chennai said that of 550 cylinders sent out on Tuesday, 220 were returned to the godown since delivery personnel could not access the houses of customers. Traffic congestion Traffic snarls were witnessed on arterial roads in the evening as motorists struggled to cross the stretches with the rain water flooding the roads. There were traffic hold ups on Anna Salai, GST Road, Kamarajar Road and EVR Road owing to the temporary flooding at some stretches. “From the morning, intermittent traffic snarls were reported from parts of the city as heavy rain caused flooding on the road. The width of these roads too had shrunk due to water stagnation and motorists had to navigate these stretches cautiously,” a senior police officer said. As several offices in the north of the city were closed at around 3.30 p.m, traffic congestion was reported from Broadway till Teynampet in the evening. N. Kannan, Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic, and his team made spot assessments and expedited relief works at Guindy and a few other areas. There was similar traffic congestion on GST road from the Kathipara grade separator and police officers said that traffic movement became smooth after 6.30 p.m. Roads were, however, deserted along the East Coast Road and Rajiv Gandhi Salai as the State-run buses were not operated and motorists avoided the road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/several-subways-inundated/article33174057.ece

He later expressed satisfaction over the meeting. “We are satisfied with the reply of the Governor,” Mr.Stalin told reporters after the meeting but did not elaborate on what Mr. Purohit told him.

We also told him that Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convicts should be approached from a humanitarian angle, since they have been in jail for 29 years,” Mr. Stalin said. He said the struggle of Arputhammal for the release of her son Perarivalan, one of the convicts, was also brought to the attention of the Governor . “The CBI has already told the Supreme Court that it has no power on deciding their release.

With meteorological experts warning that Cyclone Nivar, located 450 km southeast of Chennai, was likely to intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm in the next 24 hours, Director-General of Police J.K.

25 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cyclone casts shadow over crisis-hit Mamallapuram||The once bustling tourist town of Mamallapuram now resembles a ghost town, with hardly a few seen out on the roads and only a few shops open. The tourist-dependent town had already taken a hit due to the COVID-19-induced lockdown. The arrival of Cyclone Nivar, which is expected to cross between Karaikal and the tourist town on Wednesday, has forced its residents to scurry to safety. The pristine beaches located around Mamallapuram, which would have normally been filled with tourists, almost seemed menacing because of the rough waves caused by the heavy rain on Tuesday. S. Marimuthu, a fisherman in Kokilamedu village, said they had not ventured into the sea for the past two days due to the cyclone and had parked their boats on higher ground, based on the advice of officials at the Mamallapuram Special Town Panchayat that falls under Chengalpattu district. At the Thirukazhukundram Road junction, which is the heart of the town and is where the panchayat office is located, a few shops were opened with not many customers. Several stone sculpture shops and gift shops, located around the Mada streets, have remained shut for several months. V.A. Balan, a resident of T.K.M.

25 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cyclones moving west-northwestwards yield good rain||As Tamil Nadu braces for Nivar that is expected to cross its coast as a very severe cyclonic storm, records over the past two decades show that many of the storms that moved west-northwestwards had yielded a good amount of rain at the time of their landfall. Senior meteorologist Y.E.A. Raj said nearly 13 systems crossed the Karaikal-Mamallapuram belt in November and December during the period from 1971 to 2019. A cyclonic storm in 1994 originated in the same location as Cyclone Nivar and yielded a good rainfall. Nivar will be a rain-filled storm, too, and is likely to cross south of Chennai, around Puducherry. There were exceptions like Cyclone Nilam that made a landfall close to Kalpakkam at the end of October 2012, with a lesser intensity and causing less damage, Mr. Raj said. Meteorologists and weather bloggers draw a parallel between the current cyclone and Cyclone Nisha that crossed the coast close to Nagapattinam, taking a similar direction. Nisha had formed on November 25, 2008, and brought heavy rain in some districts — Nagapattinam, 57 cm, and Cuddalore, 44 cm — until November 28. Weather blogger R. Pradeep John, who runs the popular Tamil Nadu Weatherman blog, said slow-moving cyclones had given good rain in the past. Cyclone Nisha had moved northwestwards, like the present system, and gave 40 cm of rain to Chennai. The city has already received close to 20 cm over the past two days from Cyclone Nivar. Though Cyclone Vardah (December 2016) that made a landfall close to Chennai as a very severe cyclonic storm is remembered for its extensive wind damage, it did bring good rain to some areas on the city outskirts and interior areas like Vellore, he said. The bloggers pointed to the other very severe cyclonic storms that passed by the Tamil Nadu coast. K. Srikanth of the Chennaiyil Oru Mazhaikalam weather blog said Cyclone Ockhi, which formed on November 29, 2017, damaged rubber plantations and banana crops in Kanniyakumari and left several fishermen missing. Similarly, very severe cyclonic storm Gaja (November 2018), which had a devastating impact on the delta region, battered such interior areas as Tiruchi, Dindigul and Kodaikanal, he said. As Nivar drew closer on Tuesday, several areas in and around the city received steady rain. Nungambakkam received a heavy rainfall of nearly 11 cm between 8.30 a.m. and 7 p.m.  The Water Resources Department is closely monitoring the storage in city’s four reservoirs. The level in the Chembarambakkam reservoir was at 21.38 feet, against the full level of 24 feet, at 10 p.m. It had increased by 0.06 feet from the level recorded at 6 p.m. The lake received 729 cubic feet per second (cusecs) and the storage was at 2,955 million cubic feet (mcft) against its capacity of 3,645 mcft. The other three major waterbodies still need nearly 1,000 mcft each to fill up. In Kancheepuram and Chengalpettu districts, of a total of 909 tanks, nearly 134 tanks, including Sembakkam and Nanmangalam, have filled up. A total of 231 tanks touched 75% of their storage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cyclones-moving-west-northwestwards-yield-good-rain/article33174048.ece

25 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tribunal cuts compensation citing drunk driving||The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Chennai, has cut compensation by 10% to a person injured in a road accident, for driving his motorcycle under the influence of alcohol. In his petition, P. Selvam said on September 18, 2015 he was driving his motorcycle on the Salem to Sankagiri Main Road and his vehicle was hit by another motorcycle and he sustained injuries. The petitioner alleged that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the rider of the other motorcycle and sought compensation. The petitioner named R. Kadhirvel owner of the motorcycle and its insurer Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd as respondents. In its response, Reliance General Insurance said the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the petitioner since he was under influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. Rash driving Based on the available evidence and other records, the tribunal ruled that Selvam sustained injuries in the accident because of the rash and negligent riding of the other motorcycle rider and that he was entitled for compensation. However, it noted that since the petitioner was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident and he had also contributed to the cause of this accident, his contribution has to be cut by 10%. The tribunal directed the insurance firm to pay the petitioner compensation of about Rs. 1.05 lakh, after deducting 10% on total compensation of about Rs. 1.17 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tribunal-cuts-compensation-citing-drunk-driving/article33174217.ece

25 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ban on online gaming is disappointing: TORF||The Online Rummy Federation (TORF) has termed the Tamil Nadu government’s decision to ban online rummy a disappointing development. The government had promulgated an ordinance banning online gaming after at least half a dozen persons had ended their lives after falling into a debt trap due to gambling. Petitions were also filed in the Madras High Court seeking a ban on online rummy. According to TORF, the ordinance sends a very bad signal to foreign investors that have invested close to half a billion dollars in the skill gaming space in India. “This is a very disappointing development. We reached out to the Tamil Nadu government and proposed regulation as a significantly better alternative to a ban. Regulation would protect players and also generate meaningful revenue for the State,” said Sameer Barde, CEO, TORF. According to him, TORF is an independent body which acts as a self-regulator for the online rummy industry. It has worked over the last two years to set up a self-regulatory framework in the form of a code of conduct, based on similar regulatory frameworks in regulated markets internationally. All leading online rummy operators currently follow this code of conduct and are audited for it by one of the big four auditing firms, he said. Mr. Barde pointed out that the gaming laws in Tamil Nadu, prior to the ordinance, made a clear exemption for games of skill. It is this clarity in law that brought significant foreign investment into the skill gaming space, which is generating over Rs. 1,500 crore in GST revenue every year and could be generating over Rs. 10,000 crore by 2025, he added. Ankush Gera, founder and CEO of Junglee Games, said rummy operators operate ethical manner. Data collated from various online rummy forms show that there are over two lakh registered rummy players from Tamil Nadu (players playing on legitimate sites). Small-time players on an average shell out Rs. 200-Rs. 500 per day on the game, while players who are addicted to the game spend over Rs. 10,000 per day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ban-on-online-gaming-is-disappointing-torf/article33173587.ece

According to Vanitha Mohan, Managing Trustee of the NGO Siruthuli, the Coimbatore Day is being celebrated since 2003, the year Siruthuli was founded. “We felt that as Coimbatoreans, we needed to come together,” she told The Hindu .

25 November 2020||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Boat detained near Minicoy Island released||The mechanised boat from Tharuvaikulam near here, which was detained by the Indian Coast Guard near Minicoy Island recently with 10 fishermen, has been released following intervention by the State Government. When the mechanised boat of Maria Gunasekaran alias Thangasamy entered the waters close to Minicoy Island on November 17 after leaving the Tharuvaikulam fish landing centre on November 5 for multi-day deep sea fishing, the vessel was detained by the Indian Coast Guard for having entered the ‘prohibited zone’. While the ICG claimed that the boat was fishing in the prohibited waters, Mr. Thangasamy said the fishnet got entangled around the propeller even as the boat was fishing far away from the prohibited zone. As the boat could not be operated after the entangled fishnet stopped the propeller, the vessel got drifted away by strong winds towards the prohibited zone from where the ICG detained the boat. As the families of the detained fishermen and Mr. Thangasamy sent a memorandum to Minister for Information Kadambur C. Raju and Collector K. Senthil Raj seeking the early release of the fishermen and the boat, the issue was taken up with Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. Subsequently, State Government officials were in touch with the ICG top brass, who ordered the release of the fishermen and the boat, an official statement said. As the boat with the 10 fishermen was released on Monday afternoon, they are expected to reach Tharuvaikulam latest by Wednesday afternoon with their catch – tuna, Mr. Thangasamy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/boat-detained-near-minicoy-island-released/article33174274.ece

25 November 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Initiative for educated rural women||Capgemini has invited economically weak rural women graduates or postgraduates in technical streams, largely freshers or with few years of experience, to avail the utility of ‘Sakhi Drishtikon’, a digital vision that envisages training and hiring them by overcoming location mobility challenge. The initiative aims to tap into the potential of educated rural women who are not able to reach out to opportunities, unlike their urban counterparts, a press release said.  The initiative, meant to bring women from rural India into the mainstream workforce, begins with the selection of the candidates by Capgemini-enlisted NGO partners. This is followed by a four-week foundation training by Capgemini’s Digital Academy, a 12-week technical training by Capgemini’s CIS (Cloud and Infrastructure Services) Academy, and a four-week job shadowing where trained resources will be assigned to each candidate as technical buddy. The technical training, soft skill lessons and effective on-the-job training offered to these candidates will help them become platform-agnostic full-stack engineers who can easily thrive in the digital mainstream. Post-training the selected candidates will be hired by the CIS team at Capgemini. The candidates will be assigned to work on datacenters, cloud, cyber. The hired candidates will also go through a structured mentor program during their first year of employment to get acclimatized in Capgemini, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/initiative-for-educated-rural-women/article33173585.ece
25 November 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Mother sets herself ablaze after police recover stolen property from house||A woman allegedly committed suicide in the early hours of Tuesday by setting herself ablaze even as the police were recovering the booty from her house near Suththamalli here following the confession given by her son, a habitual offender. Son confesses The police said D. Pradeep, 22, of Sathya Nagar under Suththamalli police station limits near Tirunelveli Town, was arrested a few months ago under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act for sexually harassing a teen from the same area. On coming out of jail, Pradeep was reportedly involved in a case of burglary nearby Gomathi Nagar with the help of his friends on November 3 last. The police registered a case and arrested Pradeep, his associates Anburaj and Arulraj, all from the same area. As Pradeep told the investigators that he had kept the booty, including a laptop, in his house and in the house of his uncle, the police took him to his house at Sathya Nagar on Tuesday. When the police reached the house, Pradeep’s mother Sahunthala handed over the laptop to the police. Even as the police were taking Pradeep to his uncle’s house, 100 metres away from his house, Sahunthala sprinkled kerosene all over her body and allegedly immolated herself. Though the police doused the flame and rushed her to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, she died on the way. Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan, who came to the Suththamalli police station immediately, said the woman, after locking the door of the house from inside, immolated herself. Further investigations are on, he said. When a group of relatives of the deceased gathered near the police station around noon, Additional Superintendent of Police Subburaj and ASP, Cheranmahadevi, Pradeep, held talks with them, saying that the “unfortunate incident” had happened when the police went to the house of Pradeep to recover the laptop, the stolen property. Charge by relatives However, the relatives said the youth, who was booked under POCSO Act, was not involved in any burglary. “As Pradeep had taken photos along with the girl and stored them on his laptop, the police came to his house in the early hours to confiscate the gadget for erasing the photos. But Sahunthala immolated herself as she was unable to bear harassment of the police. Only after the unexpected shocking development, Pradeep was included in the burglary case along with two other accused – Arulraj and Anburaj,” the relatives charged but the police denied the charge. The body of Sahunthala was handed over to the relatives at 2.15 p.m. after the post-mortem at Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital. Those in distress or having suicidal tendencies could seek help and counselling by calling State’s health helpline 104 or Chennai-based Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mother-sets-herself-ablaze-after-police-recover-stolen-property-from-house/article33174275.ece

25 November 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||MTR generates ecological services worth Rs. 14,650 crore a year||The Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) is priceless, due to its rich, varied and unique biodiversity. However, the economic value that the ecological services the forests provide has been estimated for the first time, and has been pegged at more than Rs. 14,650 crore a year. The economic evaluation of the ecosystem services that MTR provides was carried out by U.Srinivasan, Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) trainee from the Central Academy for State Forest Service (CASFOS), Burnihat, under the guidance of the Field Director of MTR, K.K.Kaushal. “Ecosystem services can be defined as benefits in terms of goods or services provided by nature which are of fundamental importance to human well-being, health, livelihoods and survival,” said Mr. Srinivasan, who added that the ecological services forests provide are not limited to just the regions where they are located, but globally as well. The tiger reserve generates benefits in the form of employment for local communities, fodder, non-timber forest produce (NTFP), fuel wood, while also offering non-tangible services such as gene-pool protection, carbon sequestration, water-provisioning, soil conservation, nutrient retention, habitats for wildlife, biological control, pollination, as a space for recreation, gas and climate regulation. By extrapolating available data from the tiger reserve and applying pre-established models used to put a monetary value to the ecological services provided by the reserve, the MTR management has valued the cost of ecological services rendered by the reserve at Rs. 14,654 crore. “The value of climate regulation alone has been estimated to be of benefit worth Rs. 932.10 crore per year, while the estimated worth of the forests for human health and well-being was almost Rs. 7,000 crore,” said Mr. Srinivasan. Mr. Kaushal said that by putting a monetary value to ecological services rendered by the reserve, a scale can be established, so that people can get a general idea about how valuable our forests are. “A proper understanding of these benefits generates awareness and assists in assessing the trade-offs and strengthens the case for conservation. These evaluations also help people understand the value of tiger reserves not just as habitats for wildlife such as the endangered Asian elephant and the tiger, but as having real-world benefits that benefit local communities as well as humanity as a whole,” said Mr. Kaushal.

Though the exact tract and location of the landfall is yet to be clearly determined, it is said that the impact of the cyclone would be felt in coastal districts including Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur and Pudukottai. In addition, Ariyalur district is also expected to bear the brunt of the impact. Power poles are likely to be damaged or uprooted due to the fury of the cyclone, officials said. “We have sounded a high alert along coastal areas. Men and machinery have been put on standby to carry out measures in the pre and post cyclone period,” M. Valarmathy, Chief Engineer, Tangedco, Tiruchi circle, told The Hindu . She said about 50,000 electricity poles in different sizes had already been kept at strategic locations including Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Mayiladuthurai, Ariyalur and Thanjavur. Further, nearly 200 transformers and line materials, including high tension and low tension power cables, had also been moved to different places of the circle. The Tiruchi Circle had been divided into 40 divisions to launch power restore operations in their areas. Superintending Engineers of each district would oversee the operations. Ms. Valarmathy said control rooms had been set up in all eight districts in the circle. They would function round the clock up to November 27. She said that the situation was under control at the moment. “I have received field inputs of rain in Ariyalur and Sirkazhi, and have asked the Superintending Engineers to send hourly reports. Instructions hved been given to field officials to switch off power supply from the afternoon of Tuesday. However, it will depend upon the rain and windy conditions. It is aimed at preventing loss of human lives if the cyclone brings destruction to the power infrastructure.” She said the experience of Gaja cyclone would be of help in post-cyclone reconstruction works. More than three lakh power poles were replaced in Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts. The services of workers involved in the reconstruction works would be utilised, if needed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-gears-up-for-post-cyclone-reconstruction-work/article33173593.ece

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Consumer outfits cautions govt. against supporting traders||The Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations has urged the State government to desist from supporting wholesale vegetable traders at Gandhi Market and to let the High Court to decide on the issue of opening the market in the interests of the general public. At a meeting on Monday chaired by its president M. Sekaran, the council sought to remind the government that the interests of the public ought to be of paramount importance and pandering to the demands of the wholesale traders was bound to cause loss of goodwill. The government must realise that the proposal to shift the wholesale traders from Gandhi Market to decongest vehicular traffic was taken by the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. It was unjustifiable on the part of the wholesale traders to dig their heels in now after having sought a year’s time to start their own market at a meeting with former Collector T. Rajamani. ‘Great disservice’ The government's petition to the High Court to vacate the stay on opening Gandhi Market would be a great disservice to the people, Mr. Sekaran said. Shifting wholesale traders out of Gandhi Market was a proposal that was given shape by the late Chief Minister after contemplation for 20 years. The act of the wholesale traders to pressure the government to reopen Gandhi Market with threats of trade boycott and obstruction, coinciding with the hearing of the case in the High Court, was deplorable. It must be borne in mind that Gandhi Market was closed to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Wholesalers were accommodated in G.Corner grounds and retailers at different places spread across the city. It was unreasonable on the part of wholesalers to complain of inadequacies in G-Corner even while refusing to shift to Kallikudi Market. The district administration must necessarily take the opinion of consumer and welfare organisations before deciding on the Gandhi Market reopening issue, Mr. Sekaran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consumer-outfits-cautions-govt-against-supporting-traders/article33173584.ece
25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Ryots rush to pay premium before landfall of cyclone||About 40% of samba / thaladi paddy crop in Thanjavur district is understood to be covered under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (crop insurance). As on November 23, nearly 50,000 out of 1,24,524 hectares on which samba / thaladi paddy cultivation was taken up by farmers have been insured under the PMFBY scheme, official sources said. Though the last date for insuring the crop – Paddy-II in Rabi season – has been fixed as December 15, farmers queued up at e-service centres in the district for the last two days after learning that it will not be possible for them to insure their crop it gets affected in the heavy to very heavy rain predicted by the Meteorological Department on November 24-26 due to Cyclone Nivar. Claiming that request for crop insurance from non-loanee farmers is being turned down by Primary Agriculture Cooperative Credit Societies and empanelled banks, Sundara Vimalanathan, general secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, points out that server problems at several e-service centres compounded the issue. Meanwhile, G. Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam near Ayyampettai, a progressive farmer, claims that most of the financial institutions refuse to entertain requests for insuring plantain, sugarcane and vegetables under PMFBY. Though it is not mentioned in PMFBY that Paddy-II alone can be insured during Rabi season, financial institutions extending farm loans do not entertain requests for insuring horticulture crops by pointing out that provisions for insuring crops other than Paddy-II are not available in the system. In reality, however, RBI is said to have issued circulars to banks and other financial institutions containing the list of horticulture crops that should also be insured during Rabi season, he says. Stating that it will be impossible for farmers to get the entire cultivated area insured within a day or two, Mr. Srinivasan suggests that the State government can at least consider the option of adding the insurance premium to the loan amount of farmers and remit the same to the insurance company for the season considering the ground realities in the context of Nivar Cyclone. Such a measure will be of immense help to farmers, particularly the small and marginal group, who have taken up samba / thaladi cultivation by availing crop loan as they find it difficult to get the insurance formalities completed on time and before the landfall of the cyclone, he adds.

The State government has tied up with Toyota Kirloskar in forming GTTC courses and absorbing the graduates.

They are worried that this will ultimately lead to eviction of at least a few of them. The board plans to take up resumption of grants. “That could mean some of us may be asked to leave and the grants will be renewed in the names of others. Hence, the resumption of grants should be dropped,” they said in the memorandum. Meanwhile, Board Chief Executive Officer P.K. Barchaswa told journalists that the proposal for resumption was dropped after opposition from board members. This was discussed at a monthly meeting of the board and the resumption proposal was dropped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/survey-opposed/article33173671.ece
25 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Medical students demand postponement of January exam||Medical students in Karnataka have demanded that the examinations scheduled in January 2021 be postponed. Students say that online classes conducted this year were not effective as they did not have any clinical practice. Although medical and dental colleges in the State are set to reopen from December 1, they pointed out that practicals for just a month and a half before the examinations would not be adequate or make up for the lost time. The All-India Democratic Students Organisation Medical Students’ Struggle Committee conducted a survey among 9,500 MBBS students in Karnataka where an overwhelming majority of respondents - 97.6% of those surveyed - said they were not ready to appear for the examination in January. Students on Tuesday took to various online platforms to protest. In some districts, they held physical protests and submitted memoranda to the deans or principals of their respective medical colleges. Ajay Kamath, State Secretary of AIDSO, in a press note has said that students want all stakeholders to be consulted before the university announces the examination timetable. Considering the extraordinary situation and challenges posed due to the pandemic, the examination should be postponed, the press release stated and added that the postponement policy should be devised as per the requirements of students in each year addressing specific issues. Officials at Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, which conducts the examination, were unavailable for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/medical-students-demand-postponement-of-january-exam/article33173690.ece
25 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Over 71% of those who succumbed to COVID-19 in State are men||COVID-19 deaths in the State reported among men outnumber those in women by a ratio of 2.5:1. Although the recovery rate among both genders is almost the same, over 71% (8,382 of the 11,678 deaths reported till November 23) are men, according to the State’s COVID War Room data. Of the total 5,38,674 men who tested positive in the State, 5,18,554 have recovered, registering a recovery rate of 96.2%. Of the 3,35,881 women who tested positive, 3,19,596 have recovered, a recovery rate of 95.2%. The high mortality in men points to better immune response among women, but some doctors say that it is only proportionate to the case positivity among men. For both the genders, more than half of the deaths occurred in the age group of 50-60 years and 60-70 years. Better immune response Doctors said the apparent gender differences in favour of women in the risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 could be due to a better immune response in them. Such trends have also been observed in previous epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), they said. Hema Divakar, consultant gynaecologist/obstetrician, said genes are likely to play an important role. “Women tend to have a more responsive immune system compared to men. Several research studies have shown that estrogen, the dominant female hormone, could influence the response to infection as it exhibits antiviral properties,” she said. Stating that the outcome and survival rates from infections or sepsis are often better in women than in men, Dr. Divakar said an article written by Issac Mayonda from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at St. George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, U.K., had explored whether estrogen protected women from COVID-19. “The X chromosomes, of which women possess two, contain the largest number of immune-related genes of the whole human genome, theoretically giving women double the advantage over men in mounting an efficient and rapid immune response,” she said quoting the article. Comorbidities C.N. Manjunath, director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, who is also part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said women generally make healthier lifestyle choices as compared to men. “Women do not smoke or drink as much as men, and they have a lower burden of lifestyle diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes, hypertension or chronic lung conditions). This factor could be the reason for the high mortality among men,” he explained. However, Anoop Amarnath, member of Karnataka’s COVID critical care support unit, who heads the department of Geriatric Medicine at Manipal Hospitals, said the mortality is proportionate to the case positivity among men. Stating that comorbidities may not explain the gender difference, he said: “One potential reason could be the fact that exposure to the virus is high in men compared to women. We need to do a complete analysis regarding this,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-71-of-those-who-succumbed-to-covid-19-in-state-are-men/article33173686.ece
25 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BDA withdraws ‘controversial’ note||The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) on Tuesday told the Karnataka High Court that it has withdrawn the office note, through which it had asked its staff not to hand over records or participate, without prior permission of the Commissioner, in the investigations conducted by agencies like Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB). Following this submission, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty disposed of the petition, which had questioned the legality of the controversial office note issued by the BDA Commissioner on July 8, 2020. Files missing The Commissioner had contended that the note was not intended to interfere with investigations by agencies like the ACB, but to make the authority’s staff accountable as many important files had gone missing from the office, affecting the functioning of the BDA, and the staff claiming that files were submitted to investigation officers of the ACB and the Bangalore Metropolitan Task Force. During an earlier hearing, the bench had pulled up the BDA while pointing out that the manner in which the note was worded prima facie amounts to interference in investigations by statutory agencies like the ACB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bda-withdraws-controversial-note/article33174032.ece
25 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘We’re set for vaccine delivery’||Following directions from the Centre, Karnataka has initiated measures for COVID-19 vaccine delivery, distribution and administration, with the State’s task force also deliberating on the issue, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said on Tuesday. The Minister said the government has identified 29,451 session sites (vaccination sites) and 10,008 vaccinators as per the norms of the Universal Immunisation Programme. Health Care Workers data has already been compiled for all the government facilities. A total of 80% of the private health facilities have also shared their data. Compilation of data for the remaining 20% private facilities is likely to be completed in a week’s time, the Minister said in a statement. Cold storage facilities The State has around 2,855 cold chain points for storage and distribution of vaccines. With a view to have a better supply chain network and distribution of vaccines in a timely manner, three new regional vaccine stores – Bengaluru Urban, Shivamogga and Ballari have been proposed. These newly proposed regional vaccine stores will also require additional Walk-in-Coolers and Walk-in-Freezers to be supplied, the Minister said. “The Union Health Ministry is going to supply three Walk-in-Coolers and two Walk-in-Freezers for which necessary civil work is being initiated. In order to have an exact assessment of the cold storage capacity required for COVID-19 vaccine programme, we first need to assess the number of doses in each vial, the volume of a vial etc. We have already requested the Union Ministry to share this information,” he said. On dry storage facility, Mr. Sudhakar said that State has begun the process to assess the requirements. Regarding usage of Animal Husbandry Department’s facilities, the Minister said that in order to have adequate capacity the cold storage facilities under the department are also being compiled.  BBMP makes preparations  The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has till date registered 95,011 health workers in the city. Most of the government healthcare facilities and medical and paramedical colleges have registered those working or studying there. However, only 1,450 of 4,275 private healthcare facilities in the city have enrolled their employees. According to BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, the existing infrastructure — storage capacity of 23 lakh vaccine vials, 500 enrolled vaccinators and over 4,000 centres that have earlier administered polio and measles vaccines — is more than enough for the immunisation drive for health workers in the first phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/were-set-for-vaccine-delivery/article33173682.ece

25 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Nine activists demand inquiry into Akshaya Patra||Nine activists have written to the Chief Secretary of Karnataka urging the State government to initiate an inquiry against the Akshaya Patra Foundation, which has come under fire over alleged ‘serious governance issues’. They have demanded that the government constitute an impartial inquiry and said that if the charges of diversion of government resources and misuse are found to be true, criminal proceedings should be initiated against the organisation. ‘Cancel contracts’ Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor, said that pending inquiry, all contracts of the foundation should be cancelled and disbursal of government resources or funds under any scheme should not be permitted. The foundation is a subsidiary of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), and is one of the NGOs roped in by the State government to provide midday meals to lakhs of students. Concerns raised Whistleblowers had raised concerns over the alleged diversion and misappropriation of funds, among other governance issues. Non-executive independent trustees had differences with the temple trustees on the board of the foundation over the audit into these allegations. This had led to three independent trustees, including Infosys co-founder Mohandas Pai, resigning from the board. Following these allegations, the foundation had constituted a two-member committee headed by former Central Vigilance Commissioner K.V. Chowdary to look into the allegations. However, activists said a mere internal audit would serve no purpose and amounts to conflict of interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nine-activists-demand-inquiry-into-akshaya-patra/article33173828.ece

25 November 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Make the maximum preparations to beat competition, aspirants told||“Civil Services examinations are very tough. In school and college examinations, you know your competitors and their level of preparedness and also you can interact with your competitors and take their help. But, in the Civil Services examinations, you don’t know your competitors and their preparedness. A person who is studying silently at home somewhere in a remote part of the country might be your competitor. It is like groping in the dark. You, therefore, need to make the maximum preparations for beating the unknown competitors with their unknown preparedness,” D. Roopa Moudgil, a 2000 batch Indian Police Service officer, told aspirants for Civil Services, advising them to keep one full year exclusively for preparing for the Civil Services examinations taking it as penance. She was addressing a webinar titled Train the Brain to be a Civil Servant organised in Bidar on Tuesday. The event was jointly organised by The Hindu and Gnyana Sudha Civil Services Academy, an initiative of Gnyana Sudha Vidyalaya, Bidar. Terming the social media a major distraction in today’s world, Ms. Roopa advised Civil Services aspirants to be away from it so that they could focus on their studies. “In those days when we cleared the Civil Services examinations, we didn’t have the social media menace. Now, it is a major distraction. You may go to Facebook thinking that you will spend only five minutes there. But, you won’t come back after five minutes. You will scroll down curiously seeing who posted what and spend your valuable time in going through the posts and reacting to them. I advise you to avoid social media and televisions at least for one year and focus on your studies,” she said. Elucidating the process of UPSC examinations and the long time it would take, Ms. Roopa stressed on the importance of being patiently working hard and waiting for an uncertain result. “The whole process of the UPSC examinations would take around one-and-a-half years to complete. You don’t know whether you will succeed or not. You continue to work hard staring at an uncertain end. Seeing upon your friends and colleagues settling in some good job, you may sometimes feel that you are wasting your time. At other times, you may get frustrated. You need to continue to work hard with a lot of patience. If you don’t succeed in one attempt, you continue to patiently try as many attempts as you are permitted to. The patience you learn and adapt during your preparations for the examinations would be very helpful when you once join the Civil Services,” she said. Dismissing the belief that a particular subject would fetch better scoring, Ms. Roopa said that the belief was purely subjective having no objectivity. “There is no guarantee that a particular subject would always help one score more marks. In one year, many candidates from one subject might be successful. In the next year, it might be true with the other subject. It is, therefore, better to choose the subject that you are good in,” she said and advised the aspirants to get engaged in knowledge-enhancing activities such as debate and quiz competitions to improve general knowledge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/make-the-maximum-preparations-to-beat-competition-aspirants-told/article33173675.ece
25 November 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Nearly 1,400 sites for building vented dams||Minister for Minor Irrigation J.C. Madhuswamy on Tuesday said that the government has identified nearly 1,400 locations across the three coastal districts where vented dams can be built to facilitate irrigation and drinking water supply. “An estimated Rs. 3,986 crore were required to build these dams in a span of five years and the government is committed to providing water to all,” Mr. Madhuswamy said, after laying the foundation stone for a Rs. 75-crore vented dam at Paduvari near Byndoor to be built across the Sumanavathi in Udupi district. “The government is not doing any favour; but it is repaying the debt of the people of the coastal region who have elected BJP legislators in large numbers,” the Minister said and added that the Byndoor region was bound to prosper in the coming days. Mr. Madhuswamy said that instead of spending over Rs. 24,000 crore to derive 24 tmcft water from the Netravathi through Yettinahole Water Diversion Project, it was just to spend Rs. 1 core to Rs. 2 crore to build a vented dam that could irrigate a couple of hundreds of acres of land and also provide drinking water to people around. There was no need for the Yettinahole project as treated sewage from Bengaluru was being supplied to the parched Kolar and Chikkaballapur region where greenery has resurfaced, the Minister said. Mr. Madhuswamy said that 446 locations were identified in Dakshina Kannada, 424 in Udupi and 466 in Uttara Kannada for the construction of these vented dams. The government would build dams in phases. The Cabinet recently approved two vented dams each with an estimated cost of Rs. 35 crore for Udupi district, he said. The government was also planning to build vented dams across rivers in Uttara Kannada district in such a way that those dams could also facilitate shrimp and prawn cultivation. He urged Shivamogga MP B.Y. Raghavendra, who was present, to ensure the Centre’s participation in the project for which the government has approached the World Bank for assistance. Byndoor MLA B.M. Sukumar Shetty, Karnataka Coastal Development Authority chairperson Mattar Rathnakar Hegde and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nearly-1400-sites-for-building-vented-dams/article33174161.ece

25 November 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Will tour State to hear grievances of backward groups: Hegde||Newly appointed Karnataka State Permanent Backward Classes Commission chairperson K. Jayaprakash Hegde(in picture)plans to tour the State to hear grievances of people of deprived classes who are yet to be included in the OBC list. Mr. Hegde told The Hindu on Tuesday that he has been hearing that many backward communities are still out of the list. “I will go to people to know their status. My appointment is an opportunity to help people in need, those who really deserve reservation,” he said. He also plans to meet his predecessors to know more about the work done by the commission so far. “Their expert views were required for the commission to continue its work for upliftment of backward classes. I will go through reports submitted by the commission,” he said. On his take on the caste census report, prepared when H. Kantharaj was the chairperson of the commission, Mr. Hegde said he does not have complete details as of now. “I will discuss it with officials of the commission. If the report was submitted to the government, the commission has little say on it now.” Social Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu on September 21 stated that the government had not received the report prepared by the commission in 2015 spending Rs. 161 crore. On the issue of people belonging to certain categories in the OBC list demanding their inclusion in other categories where there was less competition for reservation, Mr. Hegde said he will have to examine the issue before recommending anything. Mr. Hegde also said the commission was not concerned about different corporations being constituted by the government for the development of different castes. “The commission can only study the ground situation and make recommendations to the government on the steps to be taken. Finally, everything has to be done through departments concerned,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-tour-state-to-hear-grievances-of-backward-groups-hegde/article33173827.ece
25 November 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Need for balancing reservoir for city under study||Minister for Minor Irrigation J.C. Madhuswamy on Tuesday said that the department was examining whether Mangaluru needs a balancing reservoir for drinking water supply in addition to the existing Thumbe vented dam and the Harekala-Adyar vented dam-cum-bridge which is under construction. Speaking after laying the foundation stone for a vented dam near Byndoor in Udupi district, Mr. Madhuswamy said that the department has identified three more sites along the course of the Netravathi for constructing vented dams. The Harekala-Adyar vented dam being constructed at a cost of Rs. 174 crore would not only ensure drinking water supply to Mangaluru Assembly Constituency but also it would irrigate about a hundred acres of land, he said. Inspecting the Harekala dam site near Mangaluru earlier in the day, Mr. Madhuswamy said that the dam besides preventing saline water ingress into the upper areas of the Netravathi would provide a 10-m-long bridge connecting the southern bank with the northern bank along which the Mangaluru-Bengaluru National Highway runs. The 520 m long dam with 52 vents could store 661.54 mcft water and will serve many other purposes, the Minister said. The groundwater table along the backwater too would considerably increase, he said and added that the economic condition of the residents of the area would also improve. Secretary to government, Minor Irrigation Department, Mruthyunjaya Swamy, Executive Engineer Gokuldas and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/need-for-balancing-reservoir-for-city-under-study/article33174160.ece

25 November 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Police commissionerate gets new office||The inauguration of the imposing building of Mysuru City Police Commissioner’s office on Mirza Road on Tuesday by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa comes a good 31 years after the Mysuru City Police Commissionerate was set up. The Commissionerate, which was carved out of Mysuru district police in 1989, had begun functioning from the premises of Mounted Police or Karnataka Armed Reserve Police (KARP) Mounted police headquarters on Lalitha Mahal Road initially. Participating in the inaugural programme on Tuesday, Director General of Police Praveen Sood, who had earlier served as the Commissioner of Mysuru City Police, recalled that thePolice Commissioner did not have an office or a house when the Commissionerate was set up 31 years ago. However, the public found it difficult to visit the Commissioner’s office and a decision was taken to shift to Band House, a heritage building on Mirza Road, in 1997. Though the Band House was a heritage structure, it was found to be inadequate to house the City Police Commissioner’s office and the other establishment offices coming under the Commissionerate. Hence, a decision was taken to construct the new building in the space adjacent to the Band House, keeping Mysuru’s history and architecture in mind. Mr. Soodso recalled that he was the Managing Director of Karnataka State Police Housing Corporation when the foundation stone was laid for the construction of the new building. Though the new building was completed months ago, its inauguration was delayed due to legal hurdles. A public interest litigation against the building was pending in the High Court. The matter, however, was cleared in August 2020 and the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) issued a completion certificate for the building in September 2020. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who was present during the inauguration, appreciated the building for its magnificence. Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar, MLAs S.A. Ramdas, Nagendra, Tanveer Sait, G.T. Deve Gowda, and Harsha Vardhan, besides MLC Dharma Sena, MP Pratap Simha, Mayor Tasneem, Mysuru Zilla Panchayat President Parimala Shyam and incumbent City Police Commissioner Chandragupta were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-commissionerate-gets-new-office/article33173820.ece

The reconstruction will commence after the Panchalinga Darshana scheduled to be held from December 10 to 19. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will lay the foundation stone for the reconstruction work on Wednesday. H.B. Natesh, Executive Officer, Sri Vaidyanatheshwara and Group of Temples, told The Hindu that the cost of the temple repair has been pegged at Rs. 16 crore against which the State government has sanctioned Rs. 5 crore. In addition, a grant of Rs. 6 crore for development works sanctioned during the 2013 Panchalinga Darshana had remained unutilised and hence it was decided to channelise this amount for temple reconstruction and redevelopment works. The rest of the amount will accrue by way of donations from devotees. The major portion of the amount will be utilised for the construction of the rajagopuras on the four sides. At present the temple is rather plain with only the main vimana or the tower at the entrance. But even this is in a dilapidated condition and will be replaced. Mr. Natesh said it will be rebuilt entirely of stone and the retaining walls surrounding the temple will also be reconstructed. The work on the four rajagopuras is part of the long-term development plans. The ‘vimana’ and the rajagopura will be designed by Rajashekar Hebbar of Udupi, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mudukuthore-temple-to-be-embellished-with-four-towers/article33173817.ece

This, despite the fact that the Department of Primary and Secondary Education is yet to give permission to school managements to collect fees for the second term. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said that schools that do not have a large corpus were unable to pay their staff. “The Association has time and again requested the government to issue an order asking all parents to pay the fees, without which schools say they will not be able to conduct online classes,” he said. After a request from managements, the State government had allowed schools to collect fees for the first term. However, many private schools claim that less than 30% of parents paid up. In some schools, parents have reportedly given only Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 as registration fees to complete the admission process. “Schools have been conducting online classes without collecting fees. From December onwards, we will stop classes for those students who have not paid the fees. Many parents have not even paid for the previous academic year,” Mr. Kumar added. Many of the parents have raised objections to this ‘threat’ and said that they will not pay the entire fees for this year until physical classes resume. “The cost of running the school and merely conducting online classes is not the same. School managements should reduce the fees,” said Sandesh R., whose children study in a private school in Bengaluru.  Schools have been conducting online classes without collecting fees.

After the last day for the withdrawal of nomination papers, 5,330 candidates are in the fray in the district for the polls to be held on December 8. A total of 1,565 seats are up for grabs in the local body polls in the district. Eighty-two candidates, including 43 men and 39 women, are seeking people’s mandate from 23 divisions of the Alappuzha district panchayat. The number of people contesting elections for 215 seats of six municipalities is 789. They include 403 males and 386 females. A total of 508 candidates, including 277 women and 231 men, are in the fray from 158 wards of 12 block panchayats. As many as 3,951 people are seeking people’s mandate for 1,169 wards of 72 grama panchayats. They include 2,167 women and 1,784 men. Although the electioneering has gained momentum, political fronts fear the presence of rebels could play spoilsport in a number of seats. Besides, in Ward 8 of Muhamma and Ward 9 of the Punnapra South grama panchayats, Congress and Indian Union Muslim League candidates, both constituents of the United Democratic Front (UDF), are pitted against each other. In Ward 10 of the Chunakara grama panchayat, candidates of the CPI(M) and CPI, constituents of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), are contesting against each other. In 2015 polls In the 2015 polls, the LDF bagged the district panchayat, 10 block panchayats, 48 grama panchayats and two municipalities - Kayamkulam and Mavelikara. The UDF won four municipalities - Cherthala, Alappuzha, Haripad and Chengannur, two block panchayats and 23 grama panchayats. Although the BJP emerged the single biggest party in the Thiruvanvandoor grama panchayat, they were later ousted from power with the support of the UDF and the LDF. While the LDF looks to repeat the good show of 2015, the UDF is hoping to tear into some of the red bastions. Giving them a tight fight will be the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/triangular-contest-in-alappuzha/article33173769.ece
25 November 2020||IDUKKI,KERALA||Tourists start flocking to Munnar again||With mercury falling to around five degrees Celsius, another winter season has arrived in Munnar. The lowest temperature so far this season was recorded on Sunday with the temperature dropping to 6 degrees Celsius at Nallathanni, Mattupetty and Chokkanad while the remote plantation areas of Thenmala, Chenduvarai, Gundumalai and Lakshmi recorded 4o Celsius. Lowest temperature The lowest temperature recorded on Tuesday was Nallathanni 11o C, Chenduvarai 10o C and Mattupetty 11o C. The increase in the lowest temperature level on Tuesday was attributed to the depression in the Bay of Bengal. The temperature has been slowly falling for a week, according to the weather data at different stations in Munnar. With the destination reopening, there has been an increase in visitors to Munnar, especially on weekends. According to tourism stakeholders, tourists prefer one-day trips and return the same day. There has been an increase in the number of visitors from Tamil Nadu, a sign that interstate travellers have started arriving in Munnar. Winter is the busiest season in Munnar and the tourists, especially foreigners, reach here from December to February. “The mercury dips to the lowest during the first week of January and many visitors prefer to visit Munnar when there is light to moderate snowfall,” said an official of the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) at Munnar. He said the majority of the visitors now was from north Kerala, in addition to those from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The tourists preferred short stays and some of the hotels had an occupancy of 50%, he added. With a blanket of frost covering the tea plantations, more people would arrive, he said. Main spots The main tourism spots in Munnar are Rajamala in the Eravikulam National Park, Mattuppetty and Kundala dams, Top Station, Echo Point, tea museums and Attukal and Lakkam waterfalls. Tourists also visit the dolmens and rock art in Marayur and vegetable farming in Kanthallur or Vattavada nearby. The snowy mountain scape is the most attractive view in Munnar. The DTPC officials said that there had been a change in the season of the lowest temperature for the past few years. Munnar used to experience the lowest temperature in the first or second week of January. However, in 2019, the sub-zero temperature was recorded in February end and the first week of March. Rajamala Range officer Job J. Neriyamparambil said that there was a clear sign of tourism returning to normalcy in Munnar. He said that nearly 1,500 people visited Rajamala on the weekends. On Monday and Tuesday, the number of tourists who visited Rajamala was 749 and 650 respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourists-start-flocking-to-munnar-again/article33173776.ece

The big cat was sighted at the Adumari tribal hamlet under the Begur forest range in the North Wayanad Forest Division in the early hours after it killed a domestic animal. On receiving information, a team of forest officials led by Begur Forest Range Officer V. Ratheesan rushed to the spot. Domestic animals killed The animal had triggered panic at Vellanchery, Alathur, Erurkunnu, Panavally, and Magistratkavala, nearly four km from the Adumari hamlet, for the past fortnight, villagers said. It had killed as many as five domestic animals in the area in a week, they said. The villagers of Panavally had detained forest officials a few days ago after it killed two cows, seeking protection to life and property. Though the Forest Department had installed 10 surveillance cameras in the villages, no image of the animal could be captured yet. “As the animal is wandering over a large area, it is difficult to spot it. Moreover, during daytime, it is hiding in bushes in coffee plantations in the area making it difficult for the officials to identify the animal,” Mr. Ratheesan said. “We cannot say that the same animal has been sighted at different places as we are yet to get any image,” he added. Chased into forest However, officials managed to chase the tiger into the Oliyodu reserve forest under the Begur forest range around 5.30 p.m. after nearly seven hours of chase. As many as 40 forest personnel, including members of the rapid response team of the department, participated in the search. A 20-member team, from four forest ranges, has been deployed for patrolling in the area and they will work in four shifts, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tiger-on-prowl-triggers-panic-in-wayanad/article33173789.ece
25 November 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Renovated Marine Drive stretch to be opened soon||With 50% of work to renovate the 2.4-km-long Marine Drive walkway over, efforts are under way to commission the stretch at the northern end from Kettuvallom Bridge to the area that abuts the first Goshree Bridge in December. The southern portion of the backwater-facing walkway will be ready for commissioning by March 2021, official sources said. Although owned by GCDA, the walkway is being renovated at a cost of Rs. 7.85 crore by the Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) as part of efforts to improve pedestrian zones and open spaces in Kochi. Almost the entire portion on the northern side (the new walkway which was commissioned in 2012) had to be renovated since tiles had been improperly laid and water sprang up when people walked over them. Subsequently, the tiles had to be removed and the entire process redone. Drains have been built and the walkway levelled. Installation of tree guards is almost over, while work on laying tiles will begin in a week, sources said. Aimed at making the walkway disabled-friendly, tactile tiles (to guide visually-challenged people) will be laid on the entire length. Adequate number of lights, garbage bins and a few pay and use toilets within container spaces too will be readied. This will be apart from CCTVs that will be installed on the entire waterfront to deter drug peddlers and other anti-social elements, they said. The project includes a scheme to ensure operation and upkeep of the 2.4-km stretch for a year. Slack maintenance had caused considerable damage to a kiosk beneath the Kettuvallom Bridge, which thus became a den for criminal elements. There were also complaints that the agency which had been entrusted with the upkeep of the walkway on the southern side was not maintaining it, although it got revenue from advertisements placed there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/renovated-marine-drive-stretch-to-be-opened-soon/article33174137.ece
25 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Controversial Padmasarovaram project key poll plank in Elamkulam||The contest in Elamkulam, division 54 of the Kochi Corporation, is likely to be closely fought between two councillors contesting for a second consecutive term — LDF candidate Poornima Narayan and the UDF’s Antony Painuthara. Ms. Narayan, who represented Gandhinagar in the outgoing council, was the chairperson of the Standing Committee for Education and Sports. “Housing projects like the LIFE Mission have hardly been implemented in the division,” she said. In the last five years, the division, represented by Mayor Soumini Jain, had seen some development since funds were sufficiently allotted, Mr. Painuthara said. He had represented Panampilly Nagar in the outgoing council. The UDF had lost the Elamkulam seat for several years till 2015, when Ms. Jain contested here and won, Mr. Painuthara said. “Candidates of other UDF partners don’t fare well in Elamkulam. The division had been allotted to Kerala Congress (Jacob) earlier. But if the candidate is contesting on the Congress symbol, we should be able to win, as demonstrated last time,” he said. The civic administration’s controversial Padmasarovaram project has been finding a mention in the poll campaign in the area. A temporary bund was constructed in the Chilavannoor Lake to implement the Padmasarovaram walkway and cycle track project under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. “The Padmasarovaram project inundated homes of residents in the area. It is definitely on the minds of people here,” Ms. Narayan said. Cheshire Tarzan, an activist who had filed a petition against the project with the Vigilance Court and a complaint with the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority, is contesting as an Independent candidate from the division. “No progress has been made in resolving waterlogging issues here or removing encroachments. The construction of the bund has aggravated waterlogging in the area,” he said. Fronts slammed Nipun Cherian, V4 Kochi’s campaign controller, said that in the campaigns in the area, they had been referring to the Revenue Department report that the Padmasaravoram bund was responsible for waterlogging in October 2019. “None of the LDF councillors opposed it when the project was proposed by the UDF, which means voting for the LDF is also a wasted vote,” he said. The Padmasarovaram project was not on residents’ minds in Elamkulam since the project site itself was a little away from the border of the division, Mr. Painuthara, said. “It is not a subject of discussion since people are neither aware of it nor bothered about it,” he said. Thankam Velayudhan, a resident of the Kudumbi Colony in Elamkulam, does not agree. High tide combined with rain often brings water to their doorsteps, and contaminates water in the underground tank, she says. “The first time the area flooded was in October 2019. When it comes to waterlogging, the role of the bund in the Chilavannoor Lake cannot be ruled out,” she said. The BJP candidate contesting from Elamkulam is K. R. Venugopal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/controversial-padmasarovaram-project-key-poll-plank-in-elamkulam/article33174132.ece
25 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Online taxis, autos start scaled-down operations||Online taxi cars and a smaller number of online autorickshaws have resumed operation in the city in a scaled down manner, even as a considerable number of people have sold their taxi cars or have ventured into roadside vending following the pandemic. “A whole lot of drivers sold their cars, unable to remit monthly loan instalment. Still, over 50% of our fleet of cars is back on the roads, since demand is increasing at a slow but steady pace,” said sources in an online taxi aggregator firm. “Online autorickshaws too are back on the road and, just like cars, have slashed their fare. They too are having takers, including trips from the city to the airport which has been priced Rs. 400 to Rs. 450,” they added. “Most customers are individuals or people who are venturing out of their houses to do shopping in bulk. Only two passengers are permitted, that too in the rear of cars, which is separated by a transparent screen. A few car models which have rear AC vents have many takers. Passengers in other cars are willing to travel with window glasses pulled down. Drivers have been instructed to cancel trips of customers who are unwilling to wear mask or resist COVID SOPs, and report these incidents,” they added. Fleecing The demand for online autos comes in the wake of complaints about many drivers of regular autos fleecing customers and charging over double the permitted fare. The advantage of online autos is that the app has fixed the fare, which is in sync with the government-approved fare. A nominal amount is charged as conveyance fee, since passengers are picked from their doorstep. The coordinator of city-based Yellow Taxi Shajo Jose, who is also the secretary of Online Cab Drivers’ Association, hoped that demand would pick up in December-January, when tourist arrivals increase. “Currently, around 30% of our drivers are operating. Many had to sell their cars, unable even to pay the annual insurance amount. The Motor Vehicle Department’s insistence on speed governor and GPS when cars appear for annual fitness test has added to the woes. They together cost about Rs. 24,000,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/online-taxis-autos-start-scaled-down-operations/article33174139.ece

But those who have known him for some time do not agree. Chothy Maash is not a regular graffiti artist. He worked as an art teacher in a school near Pallikkara from 1968 to 2000. But he has remained a staunch and committed supporter of the Left all these years. “The relation is long and strong,” he says. “We were landless until we got tenancy rights over the 10 cents of land we possessed, in the 1970s. We were cultivating paddy on someone else’s fields in Amballoor, but subsequently came to purchase that too. I remained part of the Kerala State Karshaka Thozhilali Union till 2000,” recalls Chothy Maash, whose art schooling was at RLV College of Music and Fine Arts. During the Emergency, he drew a caricature of Indira Gandhi, but as people got to know about it, fear got the better of him and he went into hiding after tearing off the work. “But that was when I started doing political graffiti,” he recalls. “A couple of acquaintances near Chottanikkara shielded me,” he recalls. He has done election graffiti ever since and won the election to the local body on CPI(M) ticket, first in 1988 and then in 1995 representing ward No. 8 of Thripunithura municipality before it was reorganised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/veteran-artist-wields-the-brush-for-poll-graffiti/article33174134.ece

The Bench of Chief Justice S.Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali issued the directive while disposing of a batch of public interest litigations seeking a directive to strictly implement Motor Vehicles Rule 151A making installation of the tracking devises mandatory for all public service vehicles. Strict implementation of the rule was necessary to ensure safe travelling of women and children, especially girls, in public passenger transport vehicles. The petitioners pointed out that by an order dated October 2, 2020, the time limit for installation of the VLTDs for goods vehicles had been extended till December 31, 2020. Thus, the government was diluting the implementation of the rule. The government submitted that the installation of the VLTDs has been completed in all vehicles owned by educational institutions. Modal officers had been appointed for monitoring the installation of the VLTDs and emergency buttons. Tendering process The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation had stated that the tendering process for purchasing the first phase of VLTDs was in the final stage.

25 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Three-cornered contest likely in Thripunithura||Thripunithura municipality, a known Left-bastion having favoured the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in three out of the last four local body elections, is all set for a stiff three-cornered battle with rebels from the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) kicking up a lot of dust. In the last election, the LDF managed a simple majority in the 49-member council while the UDF not just lost power but ceded the principal opposition position to the BJP. Five years later, the electoral fray appears as muddled though the LDF claims to be in a more formidable position with little rebel menace and having managed a head start in the declaration of candidates and campaigning. The CPI(M) has fielded 41 candidates, including Independents, while the CPI has four candidates, the NCP and Jose K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress have one each. “The BJP will not be the same force as they were in the last election when the Modi wave still swayed a section of voters. Besides, both the Congress and the BJP are facing rebel menace,” said C.N. Sundaran, former municipal chairman and CPI(M) district committee member. On a sticky wicket While accusing the CPI(M) and the BJP of having reached a tacit understanding, the UDF leadership remains on a potentially sticky wicket by choosing not to field a candidate against V.R. Vijayakumar, the opposition leader till the last year before he left the BJP camp and is now contesting as an Independent from Ambalam ward. “Such a move is expected to serve our purpose of defeating both our rivals,” reasoned C. Vinod, president of the Congress Thripunithura Assembly constituency. The Congress has fielded 46 candidates, including four Independents, while assigning one seat each to Jacob and Joseph factions of the Kerala Congress. The BJP finds the environment conducive for finally wresting the power by mobilising the Hindu majority electorate in the municipality. “This time, our focus is on 32 wards, including 13 which we won and 17 in which we emerged second last time. Unlike the other two fronts scared to field candidates in their official symbol, we have fielded 47 candidates on our symbol,” said Dileep G. Menon, BJP media cell, Thripunithura. The BJP, however, will have to deal with rebels in ten wards by the faction owing allegiance to Mr. Vijayakumar. “Our objective is not just to hurt the BJP but to win all 10 seats,” said Mr. Vijayakumar||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/three-cornered-contest-likely-in-thripunithura/article33174138.ece

25 November 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||High Court disposes of PIL on LSGI audit||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday disposed of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala challenging the order issued by the Director, Kerala State Audit Department, temporarily stopping the auditing of the accounts of local bodies for the financial year 2019-20. The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali observed that there was no wilful intention on the part of the government to stop auditing of the accounts of local self-government institutions for the financial year 2019-2020. Software issue But, owing to the software issue, it was temporarily stopped and after discussion with the Union Ministry of Panchayat Raj (MoPR), auditing of accounts of LSGIs (Grants) was being done for the financial year 2019-20. The government submitted that the auditing had to be stopped temporarily because there were some difficulties in integrating the software of the Central government and the one used by the local self-government institutions (LSGIs). In fact, the audit had already been completed for the year 2018-19, except in certain municipalities, Corporations, and district panchayats, and it was likely to be completed by the end of November 2020 by strictly adhering to the COVID-19 protocol. The statutory audit in respect of 2019-20 had already commenced, the government told the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-disposes-of-pil-on-lsgi-audit/article33173805.ece

25 November 2020||KOLLAM,KERALA||A first-timer hopes to oust a UDF veteran||The Thalavoor district panchayat division, a Left bastion for years, is all set for an interesting battle. While it is the maiden contest for 24-year-old Anandu Pillai, the youngest candidate fielded by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the district panchayat, United Democratic Front’s G. Radhamohan has been a public representative for the past 32 years. The district secretary of the Students Federation of India (SFI), Mr. Pillai is one of the popular young faces launched by the LDF as part of its new strategy. Positive vibes “I have been getting only positive vibes during the campaign and for many voters I am more like a family member. Thalavoor has remained a red fortress since the division was formed and this time also there will be no change in the trend. As the campaign moves ahead, we feel more confident,” he says. Mr. Pillai says the current political ruckus is not strong enough to sabotage the goodwill generated by the ruling LDF. “The voters are well aware of how the government supported them, so there is no point in believing that the political controversies will influence them.” He points out various welfare schemes launched by the government, including the distribution of free ration kits during the pandemic. “Each family you visit is a beneficiary of one scheme or another. And when it is the time to elect their representative, they think about all these and not the so-called scandal.” Meanwhile, the UDF has set its poll hopes on a veteran, a prominent Congress leader with a formidable track record of never losing an electoral battle. “I have been a member of grama and block panchayats for several years. I have been a full-time politician for over four decades and people know me. This time there will be a change and the UDF will wrest power in the division,” says an equally confident Mr. Radhamohan. The candidate also feels many factors, including the poor performance of the Kollam district panchayat, are in favour of the UDF. “The division has been lagging behind in development and the LDF has failed to address some serious issues. During the campaign I could sense that the public wants a change.” He adds that the LDF playing the youth card can cause no major trouble. “The district panchayat is an important agency of governance and in a place like that what counts most is experience. I am sure that the voters will choose wisely,” he says. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance candidate is Vadakode Balakrishnan. A total of 46 grama panchayat wards come under the Thalavoor division, including all wards in Thalavoor and Vilakudy along with four wards in Pattazhy and two wards in Piravanthoor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-first-timer-hopes-to-oust-a-udf-veteran/article33173780.ece

25 November 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Posting: HC may check minutes of meeting||The Kerala High Court is expected to examine the agenda and minutes of a Syndicate meeting of Calicut University held two months ago and the action taken report on them during the hearing on a petition that challenged the appointment of the Registrar on Wednesday. The Single Judge Bench of Justice Devan Ramachandran on November 17 asked the university authorities to submit the documents after it examined a fresh affidavit submitted by Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj. After going through the affidavit, the court pointed out that the Syndicate appeared to have arrived at some kind of a view that the extension of deputation given to the Registrar was not in order, after “deliberations”. The Vice Chancellor, however, shied away from saying so in the affidavit. The court wanted to determine the nature of the “deliberations” and “discussions” of the meeting held on September 9, if the view gathered in it was that the extension of deputation to the Registrar was not proper and a permanent appointment was required to be done. If such a view led to the argument put forward by the Vice Chancellor in his affidavit, the court would not have to consider the arguments of the petitioner on its merit, the Bench said. Another affidavit filed by the university in the meantime said that the proceedings of the meeting had not been recorded. The court said that the above scenario led to a prima facie inference that “there was more than meets the eye”. The petition filed by Senate member N. Rajesh had questioned the Registrar’s appointment, alleging that the university authorities had provided incorrect information to the court. The statement filed by the university had said that “... the Syndicate in its meeting held on 09/09/2020 discussed the entire issue and authorised the Vice Chancellor to take action in the matter and based on the discussion in the Syndicate, the Vice Chancellor has issued an office order to take necessary action to notify the post of Registrar, Controller of Examinations, and Finance Officer on a permanent basis...” The petitioner pointed out that the Syndicate had not discussed the appointment to the above posts and that the Vice Chancellor had not been authorised to take a call on it. Those posts had fixed tenures and the Syndicate did not have the power to make appointment to them, the petitioner had claimed. Later, the Vice Chancellor was asked to submit the fresh affidavit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/registrars-appointment-hc-likely-to-examine-minutes-of-meeting/article33173713.ece
25 November 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Young voters want to hold candidates to their word||“We expect them to keep their word. Nothing more,” was how a young voter from Meppayur responded when asked about the candidates in the forthcoming local body polls. These youngsters are rather new members of the electorate but they are aware of the local issues or try to study them before casting their vote. The youngsters’ demands from their representatives in the local bodies mainly revolve around infrastructural development, mostly roads. “The road I regularly use is in a deplorable condition and has been remaining so for the last decade or so despite the repeated offers to repair it by several candidates,” Aishwarya Anilkumar, a young voter from Balussery said while Arjun A.R. from Meppayur was complaining about a road that had not been tarred for the past 30 years even though every candidate who passed through it had promised to get it done all these years. “We are new voters. But we make it a point to collect information from our parents about the promises kept and neglected by previous panchayat members,” said Krishnapriya M.P., a 19-year-old voter from Kaduppini in Olavanna panchayat. Aishwarya is worried about the pollution caused by the nearby quarry and the vehicles to the quarry ruining the road, while Krishnapriya is worried about the flooding of their house and nearby areas as water rises in the Mampuzha. “The water crisis peaks in our locality every summer. But the authorities are not taking steps to keep the public wells clean,” Arjun complained. They are concerned about more serious issues too. Nahja T.T. from Omassery feels that the local bodies should take more steps to improve the standard of local schools and hospitals and for the empowerment of women. Most of the new generation does not look for the party symbol while they cast their votes, especially in the local body polls. “These are people we see in our daily lives and know our problems directly. Hence, the attitude and personality of the candidate is what matters most,” Aishwarya said, echoing the opinions of several others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/young-voters-want-to-hold-candidates-to-their-word/article33173719.ece
25 November 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Merchant bodies demand withdrawal of national strike||The Malabar Chamber of Commerce and the Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry have requested the trade unions to exempt merchant outlets from the nation-wide strike declared to be held on Thursday. They also requested the unions to consider withdrawing the strike. The Malabar Chamber pointed to the dire situation faced by merchants in general due to COVID-19, floods and several other factors for the past few years and requested the unions not to go ahead with the strike. The COVID-19 lockdown and the subsequent declaration of containment zones had taken a toll on business in general and the strike would add to it. Daily wage workers, who had lost quite a large chunk of their income due to COVID-19, would once again lose a day’s wage due to the strike, the chamber said in a press release. The Calicut Chamber said that though “bandh” had been banned, the phenomenon took place in different names and was always caused trouble to the business community and the general public. This would bring down the domestic production rate of the State and cause loss of working days. “It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that public life is not disrupted in such strikes,” Calicut Chamber president Subair Kolakkadan said in a press release. The national strike has been declared by 10 trade unions in the country against the Central government’s policies such as privatisation of public sector units and new labour and farm laws. Several organisations of government and non government employees have expressed solidarity with it. Strikes usually have very little effect in other States but often turn into a complete lockdown in Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/merchant-bodies-demand-withdrawal-of-national-strike/article33173697.ece

25 November 2020||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Rebels give the jitters for fronts in Palakkad||Rebel threat is haunting both the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the elections to several local bodies in Palakkad. Although many withdrew their nominations at the last minute yielding to the district-level leadership’s intervention, some others remain in the fray jeopardising the chances of the respective fronts they represented till now. The UDF heaved a sigh of relief in the Chittur Thathamangalam municipality when the Congress rebels withdrew on Monday. The issue was resolved when the Congress leadership yielded to the demand of a section by allowing former chairman K. Madhu to contest under the official banner. Youth Congress rebel candidates withdrew their nominations along with the official Congress candidate Gopakumar in Chittur. The Congress leadership’s denial of seat to Mr. Madhu on the basis of the party’s decision to bench four-timers had caused the issue there. But in the Palakkad municipality, all eyes are on Kallepully South (Ward 11) where former Congress municipal party leader K. Bhavadas is contesting as a rebel. He too was denied seat based on the rule. Mr. Bhavadas is now the UDF’s main rival in Ward 11, where the fight is four-handed with the LDF, the BJP and the UDF official candidate P.G. Jayaprakash also contesting. In the Pattambi municipality, the UDF has rebels in seven wards. The Indian Union Muslim League too has rebels in several civic bodies. CPI contesting alone In the Mannur grama panchayat, the CPI, a major constituent of the LDF, is fighting it alone. The CPI-CPI(M) difference has made the CPI go it alone in most wards in Mannur. Both parties are contesting under their respective party symbols. The CPI is contesting alone in six wards in the Vallapuzha panchayat, six wards in the Mannarkkad municipality, eight wards in the Nellaya panchayat, three wards in the Kottopadam panchayat, and six wards in the Kumaramputhur panchayat.  The BJP is also facing rebel threat in several local bodies in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rebels-give-the-jitters-to-fronts-in-palakkad/article33173707.ece

25 November 2020||PATHANMAMTHITTA,KERALA||It’s three-way battle in Pathanamthitta||As electioneering in Pathanamthitta gathers pace, it is an exceedingly close three-way contest to the district panchayat that is on the cards with no overarching trend discernible. With 16 candidates withdrawing their nominations on the final day, 60 people, including 26 women, will now be contesting in the 16 divisions of the local body. Of this, Ranni has the highest number of candidates with seven persons while the three major coalitions – United Democratic Front, Left Democratic Front and National Development Alliance -- will battle it out directly between themselves in as many as eight divisions. Five divisions, including Angadi, Konni and Pramadam, have four candidates each while the Enathu division has five contestants for the polls. During the previous election in 2015, the UDF scored a clear victory with 11 seats against the five won by the LDF . However, the split in the Kerala Congress (M) -- the second biggest party in the Congress-led coalition -- and the subsequent changes in the coalition equations have raised hopes for the LDF this time. Interestingly, the rival groups of the Kerala Congress led by Jose K. Mani and P.J. Joseph are clashing with each other in two divisions, namely Pulikeezhu and Ranni. Meanwhile, the presence of senior figures such as Robin Peter of the Congress, Ashokan Kulanada of the BJP and R.Ajayakumar of the LDF have made exciting the battles in a couple of other divisions such as Pramadam and Kulanada. Despite being the traditional favourite, the UDF had been initially busy fending off the rebel menace but managed to quell the dissenting voices to a considerable extent In Ranni, however, former Congress block committee president Benny Puthenparambil is contesting as an Independent against the candidate fielded by the Joseph group . Bolstered by the induction of the Mani group, the LDF hopes to turn the tables this time and take the lead in the local body for once. Resurgent NDA A resurgent NDA, meanwhile, counts on an unusually strong candidate and the sharp increase in its vote share during the previous Parliament election and Assembly bypolls to stage an upset and open the account.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/its-three-way-battle-in-pathanamthitta/article33173772.ece

25 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Govt. will defend KIIFB at all costs, asserts CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday accused the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of joining ranks with Central agencies to wreck Kerala's developmental activities by targeting the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). KIIFB has helped the State fast-track the development in the face of crippling crises. Kerala could ill-afford to give a holiday to development because its revenue streams had dwindled and the budget was deficient. Kerala government would defend KIIFB at all costs. It would protect its credibility, which was paramount to attract funds from the open market for development. Damaging observations “Let no one think that Kerala government is a helplessly mute statue and it will silently soak in the assaults on KIIFB,” Mr. Vijayan said. Mr. Vijayan slammed the CAG for terming KIIFB’s bid to raise funds for development from foreign market as unconstitutional. The CAG had made some damaging observations without giving the government the right to reply to its audit queries. “Even after the audit exit meeting, the government had given the CAG full access to KIIFB files and accounts,” he said. Entities and persons that attempted to tarnish the global standing of KIIFB by casting aspersions on its role were “enemies of the people”. They wanted to dash the developmental hopes of the State and push the polity back to stasis. The government would not bend to the will of powers that seek to cut the ground under KIIFB and render it impotent. KIIFB was a construct of the 1999 Left Democratic Front government. The body was dormant for a long time. When the incumbent government assumed power in 2016, it streamlined KIIFB’s functioning. It empowered it to raise funds from the international financial market to spur the State’s development. The Opposition had supported the move in the Assembly. United Democratic Front legislators had benefited from KIIFB funded projects in their constituencies. KIIFB hoped to pay back the loans from the revenue from fuel cess and a portion of the motor vehicle tax. Independent board KIIFB worked under the leadership of an independent board populated by financial experts, able administrators, and government officials. The Securities Exchange Board of India and the Reserve Bank of India regulated its functioning. KIIFB accounts were open to audit by the CAG. The government allowed KIIFB to park funds in profitable accounts to ensure that it was not fruitlessly diverted for meeting everyday government expenses. Former CAG of India Vinod Rai headed the fund trustee advisory committee of KIIFB. The Chief Minister and Finance Minister were its chair and vice chair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-will-defend-kiifb-at-all-costs-pinarayi/article33173795.ece

Indian Oil-Adani Gas Pvt. Ltd (IOAGPL), which is implementing the City Gas Distribution (CGD) project, will set up 70 CNG stations in Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod districts by March 2021 and another 100 annually in the next five years to create the green corridor. “These 70 stations will be the first step for the green corridor along the National Highway and will kick off a CNG revolution in the State,” Bhashit Dholakia, senior vice president, Adani Gas Limited, and Chief Operating Officer, IOAGPL, told The Hindu . Ernakulam already has nine CNG stations and six more stations are expected by March 2021. Work for the construction of a steel network in Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod has begun. Recently, three CNG stations were commissioned in Thrissur and another three more will start operations soon. The construction of two CNG stations in Malappuram, four in Kozhikode and two in Kannur have also commenced. More than 8,000 vehicles are using CNG in Ernakulam and the numbers are steadily increasing, Mr. Dholakia said. New policy IOAGPL is to come up with a policy on the lines of oil majors in January 2021 to create a network of private dealers/franchisees for running CNG stations. The station will be of 1,200 sq m and the dealer can recruit the staff. The equipment will be provided by IOAGPL. “These stations will function round the clock and we are planning to provide elite services,” Mr. Dholakia said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/400-km-green-corridor-to-promote-cng/article33173808.ece

The State Election Commission (SEC) is also preparing 29,322 electronic voting machines (EVMs) for the three-tier panchayats and 5,388 EVMs for Corporations and municipalities. Another 12% of the EVMs will be kept as reserve for panchayats and 30% for urban local bodies. Manufactured by the Electronic Corporation of India Limited, the multi-post EVMs feature three ballot units and one control unit. The SEC has a stock of 37,551 multi-post EVMs. Urban local bodies will use single-post EVMs for polling. The Central Election Commission has despatched 11,000 such machines for use in the elections in Kerala. Block panchayat secretaries will be in charge of the distribution of EVMs in panchayats while electoral registration officers will play the role in urban local bodies.  Limits on vehicles Meanwhile, the commission has issued an order limiting the number of vehicles that can be used for electioneering. In grama panchayats, a candidate can use only one vehicle while in block panchayats, three vehicles will be permitted. Candidates in district panchayat divisions and Corporation can use four vehicles. In municipalities, two vehicles will be allowed.

25 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Govt. mulls reopening higher classes||Now that the number of new cases in the State has been coming down steadily, the government will consider whether it will be feasible, practical and safe to reopen educational institutions for higher classes. This would however not be an immediate concern or priority and if new COVID-19 cases continue to decline in the State, the government would consider it after consultation with experts, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Tuesday. However, he made it clear that reopening schools for smaller classes in this academic year would be a near-impossibility. With new COVID-19 cases going down steadily in the State, the Disaster Management Department issued orders on Tuesday further relaxing the restrictions imposed on training institutions, except technical education institutions and schools. The order said vocational training institutes, private tuition centres, computer centres, and dance schools could start functioning now, provided the number of students at a time inside the institute was a maximum of 100 persons or half the room/hall’s capacity. The Chief Minister said while the case numbers were going down, this was the time there should be maximum alertness against COVID-19. Mr. Vijayan said that laxity in maintaining physical distancing during election campaigning could turn out to be a disaster for the State. Utmost care should be taken to ensure that the elderly was protected and that they were not interacting with too many people from outside.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-mulls-reopening-higher-classes/article33173793.ece
25 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||All set to ensure a smooth poll process||As election fever catches on, the district administration has put in place steps to ensure that the enthusiasm does not go overboard. Squads to ensure that the model code of conduct for the polls is being strictly observed have started criss-crossing the district. District Collector Navjot Khosa who is also the District Electoral Officer has appealed to candidates and political parties to cooperate so that the State Election Commission’s direction for monitoring candidates’ poll expenses to their campaign is implemented in a model manner. With the list of candidates in the fray finalised after withdrawal of nominations, campaigning at the ward level has picked up pace. The Collector, at a meeting of the model code of conduct monitoring cell, urged those in the fray to strictly follow the COVID-19 safety protocols while adhering to the model code. Crowding should not be allowed during public functions. For indoor programmes, 50% of the total capacity of a hall, subject to a maximum of 200 people, and for outdoor events, half the total number of people who can fit in the area are allowed to take part. Permissions for using microphones and vehicle permits should be taken in advance. The Collector appealed to candidates to avoid mudslinging at the opposition. Any criticism of political parties or coalitions should be limited to policies. Places of worship should not be used as venues for campaigning. Seeking votes while exploiting caste or religious considerations was liable to punishment, the Collector said. The SEC had fixed limits for election expenses, she said. In grama panchayats, a candidate could spend a maximum of Rs. 25,000. For block panchayats, it would be Rs. 75,000, for municipalities, Rs. 1 lakh, and for district panchayat divisions and Corporation wards, it would be Rs. 1.5 lakh. Expenditure observers too had started their work, she said. Anti-defacement squads had removed 1,998 illegal election materials so far. The sqauds would also remove campaign advertisement boards put up in violation of the order and charge the candidates for their removal. Seven such squads were functioning at the taluk level. The Collector said one policeman/woman would be posted to squad to strengthen its functioning. The Collector also directed that a decision on applications for conducting campaign programmes in places, halls, or parks under the government, or organisations under the government, or local self-government institutions should be taken within 24 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/all-set-to-ensure-a-smooth-poll-process/article33174254.ece

He alleged that the government, at the behest of the “discredited” M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, had roped in an internationally blacklisted firm as a consultant for the non-starter project. The same was the case for other mega projects. Those at the helm of the government enlisted pricey international consultants for quixotic projects and received a commission in return. The Centre had told the State that it could only allow an elevated rail corridor. The Revenue Department had refused sanction for land acquisition for a project that did not have the Centre’s nod. Without Central backing, the State was clueless from where to raise funds. The government was pushing ahead to displace 20,000 families and 50,000 traders to acquire land for the high-speed corridor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chennithala-questions-feasibility-of-silver-line/article33174251.ece
25 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||IFC green bonds not foreign loan: Isaac||Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said the issuance of green bonds from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) cannot be considered a foreign loan. With the assistance being sanctioned from within the country, the prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will not be required. Participating in ‘Vottukaryam’, a meet-the-press programme organised by the Kesari Memorial Journalists’ Trust here on Tuesday, Dr. Isaac was reacting to allegations levelled by various quarters regarding the efforts made by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) to raise funds to the tune of Rs. 1,100 crore from the sister organisation of the World Bank. According to him, the IFC will be required to obtain the nod of the Finance Ministry to fund green projects undertaken by KIIFB in Kerala and not vice versa as was being propagated. While approvals are generally sought by States for World Bank aid, the norm does not apply for KIIFB that is perceived to be a body corporate or a sub-sovereign entity in the global market. Green loan Dr. Isaac said efforts were on to seek the issuance of green bonds or green loan for various projects. The endeavours that were being showcased for the financial instrument are the second package of the Kuttanad ecorestoration programme, carbon-neutral Wayanad, coastal conservation and rehabilitation, CNG and electric buses and green buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ifc-green-bonds-not-foreign-loan-isaac/article33173797.ece
25 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||5,420 new cases, 5,149 recoveries in State||Kerala reported 5,420 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday when 59,983 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, taking the State’s cumulative case burden to 5,71,872 cases. Test positivity rate dropped to 9.04%. Bucking the trend of the past 15 days, the number of recoveries reported on Tuesday was fewer than the new cases reported at 5,149. The active caseload of the State thus went up slightly than Monday’s figure to 64,412. The total recoveries till date is 5,05,238. The weekly report of the State shows that the new cases — 37,609 — registered between November 15 and 21 is fewer than the cases registered in the previous week (November 8-14), which was 40,592. However, the number of recoveries, deaths, and tests conducted during these two weeks is not very different. The doubling time of cases has, however, gone up from 59 (November 8-14) to 69 days in the November 15-21 week. The doubling time has come down from 67 days in the previous week to 61 days in Malappuram now, but in all other districts, the doubling time has been up. Also worrying is the fact that Malappuram remains the sole district where the test positivity rate has gone up from 15% (Nov 8-14) to 17.1% (Nov 15-21) The addition of 24 more deaths to the official COVID death list on Tuesday has taken the State’s COVID toll to 2,095 cases.  Of the 5,420 new cases reported on Tuesday, 5,337 are locally acquired infections, with no epidemiological link established in the case of 592 new infections. The number of health-care workers who contracted COVID is 52.

He said that the stiff competition being witnessed between LDF and NDA in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation mirrored the scenario that unfolded in most parts of the State. “The BJP will win the most number of wards across local self-government institutions despite unholy arrangements made by the rival coalitions in many parts,” he said while participating in the ‘Vottukaryam’ meet-the-press programme organised by the Kesari Memorial Journalists’ Trust here on Tuesday. Accusing the LDF and the UDF of covering up each other’s wrongdoings, Mr. Surendran alleged that the deep-rooted corruption that has affected various spheres of governance has tarnished the State’s image. “Besides the fallout the bar bribery and gold smuggling scams, we have been hearing reports of prominent UDF and LDF leaders of owning benami properties in other States. They have come under surveillance by the Enforcement Directorate,” he said. Mr. Surendran also rubbished reports of infighting in the BJP’s State unit. Dubbing such claims as ‘mere media creation’, he said that the party did not face rebel menace in any local body in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-will-gain-ground-during-polls-surendran/article33173701.ece

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,KERALA||State to withdraw KPA amendment||The government had introduced the amendment in good faith. It sought to give more teeth to the police to crackdown on vile and hateful social media messaging that targeted women, children, transgender people and other vulnerable sections of society. Moreover, such attacks had led to acts of vigilantism that threatened public peace and social order. It was widely felt the existing law was inadequate to deal with the legal challenges posed by the new media. The Ordinance targeted defamatory social media posts and online content. Its intent was not to curb reportage, political satire, opinion, free speech, impartial journalism or commentary, Mr. Vijayan said. The government was unlikely to revisit the law. The government would place any future revision to the law, if at all, in the Assembly to evolve a political consensus before enactment. The government had come under criticism from Opposition parties, civil rights activists and journalist bodies for promulgating a “black law” that threatened free speech. They claimed the law accorded untrammelled power to the police to scour published and aired content for libellous material. The amendment also empowered the police to initiate prosecution on their own and even in the absence of a specific complaint. Moreover, the Opposition parties argued the law did not distinguish between social and online media. Its implementation was left open to broad and subjective interpretation by the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-to-withdraw-kpa-amendment/article33173787.ece

Vice-Chairman and Managing Director S. Ramana Reddy has said. The government has identified seven locations in three districts for promoting projects under its Renewable Energy Export Policy - 2020. Kadiri, Obuladevucheruvu and Yadiki in Anantapur district, Chakrayapeta, Badvel, Kalasapadu, Mylavaram and Peddamudiyam in Kadapa district and Owk and Kolimigundla in Kurnool district account for 17,800 MW capacity potential, Mr. Ramana Reddy told The Hindu . Slow growth in the demand for renewable energy in the country has prompted the Centre to consider imposing penalties on States and power distribution companies which do not meet the renewable purchase obligations (RPOs). The Centre has an ambitious target of 170 GW of installed RE projects and 400 GW by 2030, which is bound to give a big push to the sector, opined Mr. Ramana Reddy. Large electricity consumers are bound to purchase a certain percentage of their requirements from renewable energy sources. Current norms prescribe no inter-State transmission system (ISTS) charges as the Ministry of Power (MoP) has waived charges and losses on all solar and wind projects commissioned before June 30, 2023. This would apply to solar, wind and hybrid projects with or without storage. Site visit Mr. Reddy visited the Kambadur area in Anantapur district on Tuesday to inspect land for the proposed Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Park. “The district is most suitable for wind power turbines and we are testing the efficacy of the turbines set up at 150 metre level so that each unit could produce 3.5 MW. Permission has been sought for setting up wind masters for a year-long study at Amaduguru, Kadiri, and Puttaparthi,” he revealed. There is a 1,000 MW potential in the Rapthadu-Kambaduru belt in the district. Project reports Meanwhile, Detailed Project Reports are being prepared for seven locations out of 29 identified as potential ‘Pumped Storage Hydro Projects. The Tata Consulting Engineers Limited (TCE), Australia-based SMEC Holdings Limited, PSE Water and Power Consultancy Services (WAPCOS), and another firm have been given a 3-year contract to come up with the DPRs at Kurukutti and Karrivalasa in Vizianagaram district, Yerravaram in Visakhapatnam, Chitravathi in Anantapur, Somasila in Nellore, Owk Reservoir in Kurnool and Gandikota in Kadapa district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-has-potential-to-generate-35000-mw-solar-power/article33174204.ece
25 November 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Why re-lay foundation of old project, TDP to govt.||The Telugu Desam Party(TDP) has questioned the re-laying of the foundation for the expansion (up-gradation) project of 31 hospitals in the State by Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana and R&B Minister M. Sankaranarayana at Rayadurg and Kalyandurg on Monday. TDP Polit Bureau member and Anantapur district president Kalava Srinivasulu on Tuesday criticised the YSR Congress government for not spending a single penny for developmental works in the State and was critical of the Ministers who wasted time and money of government officers for conducting a foundation-laying ceremony for an ongoing project. The State government did not sanction a single rupee for the project and money was given by the Central Government, said Mr. Srinivasulu. The Centre had sanctioned Rs. 250.96 crore for the construction of the buildings and maintenance in addition to providing administrative sanction for 532 regular posts and 433 on outsourcing basis. Bhoomi puja The TDP government had issued the G.O. and the then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had laid foundation for those works with local MLAs and other functionaries attending the bhoomi puja, but the present government just tried to cash in on the old projects and get some cheap publicity, he alleged. “Instead of speeding up the projects, the Ministers tried to give a picture as though Chief Minster Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had sanctioned them and that it was their achievement,” Mr. Srinivasulu observed.  Water scheme Even the Kalyandurg Water scheme was sanctioned on 29 February 2019 with an outlay of Rs. 22.19 crore, but the Ministers chose to lay foundation a second time, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/why-re-lay-foundation-for-old-project-tdp-asks-govt/article33174175.ece

Officials say the impact could be felt more in the eastern mandals of Varadaiahpalem, Satyavedu, Srikalahasti, Puttur and Nagari that are close to the Bay of Bengal. The revenue, police and fire department personnel in the eastern mandals have been put on alert, with focus on areas prone to water-logging. During cyclonic storms, Chittoor district witnesses uprooting of trees along the highways and casualties due to swirling waters at causeways and rivulets. Disaster management teams are extra cautious as three people were washed away in rivulets in October near Chittoor and Palamaner due to monsoon rains. Vigil has also been mounted at Araniyar reservoir in Pichatur mandal, where a fisherman drowned when his boat capsized after being caught in heavy rain last month. Personnel on alert Assistant Fire Officer (Chittoor) V. Adinarayana Reddy told The Hindu that 300 personnel of the 15 fire stations have been put on alert to face any eventuality due to Nivar. “During cyclones, the eastern mandals generally receive heavy rains. Our personnel are ready with lifebuoys and jackets. The chances of drowning are remote, but we are more worried about people trying to cross rivulets and causeways in spate. “All the stations are equipped with the cutters to clear roads immediately in case of tree-fall,” the official said. Mr. Reddy said disaster management team members would be posted at the bridges and causeways prone to overflowing to prevent people negotiating the risky spots. Meanwhile, the sky remained overcast in several parts of the district from Tuesday, with intermittent showers. Gates lifted Irrigation officials had lifted the gates of Araniyar project and released 1,000 cusecs of water on Tuesday evening, in view of heavy rain prediction. “We will constantly monitor the water levels in the reservoir,” Assistant Engineer Lokeshwar Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chittoor-district-braces-for-impact/article33174190.ece

25 November 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘High cancer mortality due to low awareness’||Better awareness on the risk posed by cancers and regular annual check-ups will help identify many cancers at an early stage and bring down death rates, said Karthik Tanneru, a robotic oncologist hailing from Guntur who is now working at the Medical University of South Carolina in the United States. “Most deaths linked to cancer are due to lack of awareness regarding basic symptoms,” Dr. Tanneru said. “Cancers like prostate cancer, commonly seen in men above the age of 60, present symptoms like obstruction in urine flow, urinary tract infections and blood in urine. Early detection of prostate cancer can be done by examination of the prostate by a doctor, and a blood test prostate specific antigen (PSA) can help detect the cancer,” he said.  Dr. Tanneru said treatment options include surgical removal of prostate by open surgery, minimally invasive surgery, robotic assisted surgery or radiation therapy. The benefits of robotic surgery include lesser blood loss, lesser pain, shorter hospital stay and an early return to one’s daily lifestyle. Robotic surgery allows the surgery to be done with precision under magnified vision.  Advances in technology Previously, most of the cancers were detected only in advanced stages, leading to instances where the entire kidney needed to be removed. But with early detection, only the tumour can be removed leaving behind the kidney, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/high-cancer-mortality-due-to-low-awareness/article33173559.ece

On November 18, the body of Arul Mozhi Vinoth Kumar (27), a native of Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu and working as cab driver in Chennai, was found wrapped in a tarpaulin cover and dumped on the roadside near Nallaguttapalle village in Ramapuram police limits of Rayachoti sub-division. The accused Vinod Kumar Venkatesan (26), a daily money collection agent of Kancheepuram, walked into the police net on Monday, reportedly out of his curiosity to check the latest updates in the case. Arul had allegedly taken private pictures of the accused Vinod Kumar’s bride-to-be and had been reportedly blackmailing her for some time, with the intention of marrying her. Vinod allegedly hatched a plan along with the girl’s brother-in-law Vinayagam (36) and father Narayanan (61) and reportedly roped in professional killers Dilli Babu (33) and Magesh (35) for the task. Barring the groom Vinod, the other four allegedly kidnapped Arul from his residence, killed him and dumped the mutilated body in Kadapa district. Four days later, a curious Vinod visited Ramapuram to notice the progress in the case and was moving suspiciously in the vicinity of the crime spot, when he was rounded up by the police.

25 November 2020||Nivedita Ganguly,ANDHRA PRADESH||Golf tourism: city looks to tee off||The 136-year-old East Point Golf Course (EPGC) is a big splodge of green in Visakhapatnam’s growing urban sprawl. Andhra Pradesh’s only golf course is set to become an 18-hole category A course spread over 86 acres. The newly-designed and renovated golf course is expected to draw professional golfers from across the globe and also drive tourism to this part of the country. “The total cost of the redesigning project is about Rs. 20 crore. The works began in February last year and already 14 holes have been completed. The last phase of work will be done in a month’s time, following which by early next year it will ready to host tournaments,” EPGC secretary R.V.S. Rudraraju told The Hindu . Previously, the golf course was in category B and measured 72 acres. The freshly designed golf course has more challenging fairways with new water bodies and sand bunkers. “Once the new course is completed, we plan to host national and international level tournaments. We are already in talks with professional golf agencies for this. The aim is to host four to five professional golf tournaments,” he said. EPGC also has a new driving range for its training academy. “We are running a special junior golf programme for the age group of six to 18 years and it is open for the public. Under this, there are three programmes — beginners, advanced and elite. At present, 12 children are being trained under the junior golf programme,” said P.K. Raju, a golf coach at EPGC. “We are reaching out to schools with packages as well,” said Mr. Rudraraju. Avid golfer Seshagiri Mantri, who has been in the hospitality industry for several years now, said, “This uniqueness of the EPGC will put Vizag in the top of the international golfing map. The upgradation of the golf course will help to showcase Vizag as a golf tourism destination.” The club was started around 1884, primarily for the relaxation of the British. Originally, the golf course was located in the area where the VUDA Park and The Park stand today. It moved to its present location at Mudasarlova in 1964, thanks to the efforts of Raja PV Gajapathi Raju of Vizianagaram and other avid golfers then. Over the years, with some efforts, golfing in the city received an accelerated push; as a result, today the club has 1,500 members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/golf-tourism-city-looks-to-tee-off/article33174291.ece

25 November 2020||RAJAMAHENDRAVARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Polavaram cofferdam work will begin in April next, says official||Polavaram project Superintendent Engineer Medapati Nagireddy has said that supply of water from the Godavari will be stopped from March 31, 2021 as work on cofferdam will commence in April. At a joint meeting of the Irrigation Advisory Boards (IAB) of East and West Godavari districts held here on Tuesday, Mr. Nagireddy said construction of cofferdam in the Cap-3 (300 meter length) would begin in April and complete by June as it was proposed to complete the project by December 2021. “A maximum of 9,000 cusecs of water per day can be supplied till March 31. Farmers have to go for the 90-day duration crop varieties of paddy instead of 120 or 130-day crop varieties in the rabi season. We do not have any alternative way to manage the schedule as per the plan of the Polavaram Project Authority,” said Mr. Nagireddy in response to a request for release of water till mid-April to save the rabi season crops undertaken in the Godavari delta. The authorities of East and West Godavari districts have been asked to manage the situation by storing water in various sources including ponds to meet the water needs for drinking and livestock. Crop acreage In the rabi season, the normal acreage under the paddy cultivation is 4.36 lakh acres in East Godavari and 4.60 lakh acres in West Godavari in the Central, Eastern and Western delta of the river Godavari. East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy said: “About 75% of harvesting of paddy in the kharif season is yet to be completed. In rabi season, the crop duration of the paddy varieties preferred in the district is 120-130 days, needing water after March. The Konaseema region will be the most affected if the water supply is stopped from April 1.” Water management Speaking on the occasion, Agriculture Minister Kurasala Kannababu observed that keeping in view the priority of the Polavaram irrigation project, the management of water was crucial and the departments of agriculture and irrigation should work in tandem for it. The Polavaram cofferdam closure period -- March to June 2021-- should be dedicated for modernisation and maintenance of the irrigation systems. An action plan for it should be prepared, said Mr. Kannababu. East Godavari In-Charge Minister D. Krishna Das, Social Welfare Minister P. Viswarup, West Godavari Collector Revu Mutyala Raju, and irrigation officials were present in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/polavaram-cofferdam-work-will-begin-in-april-next-says-official/article33173669.ece

The Minister was speaking at the joint meeting of Irrigation Advisory Boards of East and West Godavari districts here. Agriculture Minister Kurasala Kannababu and Social Welfare Minister P. Viswarup directed the irrigation authorities to depute the senior officials to manage the water crisis during the rabi season. “Each delta -- eastern, central and western delta -- should have a dedicated officer to monitor the irrigation situation till June,” said Mr. Kannababu and Mr. Viswarup. As water would not be available after March 31, farmers have to go for direct sowing of paddy varieties with the 120-day crop duration from December 17 in the Central delta. In the Eastern delta, farmers should go for the direct sowing from December 1, said District Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy. West Godavari District Collector Revu Mutyala Raju said that an action plan would be prepared on November 26 to overcome the crisis. “Nearly 60,000 acres in the rabi season will be hit due to non-availability of water in the 2020-km length of irrigation canals in the Western Godavari delta," said Mr. Murtyla Raju.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-urged-to-cooperate-with-govt/article33174192.ece

25 November 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Our victory in State will begin from Tirupati’||The BJP has exuded confidence that the ensuing by-election to the Tirupati (SC) parliamentary constituency will be its springboard to success in Andhra Pradesh. Party State president Somu Veerraju, along with co in-charge (Andhra Pradesh) Sunil Deodhar, was speaking after a constituency-level review meeting here on Tuesday. “Our party’s victory juggernaut in the State will start from Tirupati,” they said. The meeting, attended by Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, national secretary Y. Satya Kumar, MLC Vakati Narayana Reddy and State general secretary Vishnuvardhan Reddy, took stock of the situation ahead of the elections. The leaders announced that the BJP and Jana Sena combine would win the election hands down by taking the development agenda to the public. Breathing fire at the ruling YSRCP, Mr. Veerraju asked the State government to go to the public seeking votes by showing at least one project that had not been funded by Centre. “Be it the IIT, IISER, Indian Culinary Institute, Smart city or AMRUT, development of Tirupati could not have been possible without the central support,” he asserted. He alleged that the TDP and YSRCP were trying to take credit for all the projects, without giving the Centre its due. “Though the successive State governments tried to hide the fact, the people know this very well,” he said. Taking a dig at Leader of Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu for his continued stay in Hyderabad, Mr. Narasimha Rao dubbed him as NRA (Non-Resident Andhrawala) and urged the public to confront him. Flaying the two ‘corrupt’ regional parties of having done more harm than good to the bifurcated State in its formative years, he said the people, waiting for a change, would certainly vote the BJP-Jana Sena alliance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/our-victory-in-state-will-begin-from-tirupati/article33174196.ece

25 November 2020||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Streamlining finances of power sector: Energy Secretary||The finances of the power sector, especially the loan burden post bifurcation and the dip in revenues owing to COVID-19, are a major concern but the government is taking all steps to streamline it, says Energy Secretary and CMD of AP Transco N. Srikanth. It’s a whopping Rs. 70,500 crore loan outstanding and Rs. 7,000 crore interest and debt servicing per annum which the State is expected to manage, according to him. In an exclusive interaction with The Hindu , Mr. Srikanth said, the outstanding loan immediately after the bifurcation was to the tune of Rs. 31,000 crore. It had now grown up to Rs. 70,500 crore due to the difference between the income and expenditure and other factors. “There are a bunch of reasons for the debt burden. Post bifurcation, the subsidy arrears from the government, about Rs. 1,000 crore per month, have not been paid and they are accumulated over a period of time. We’ve lost coal mines to Telangana and are forced to buy coal and transport it to plants here from far away locations which resulted in about Rs. 3,000 crore burden per annum. In addition, about Rs. 1,500 crore burden is added in the form of funding new projects,” Mr. Srikant said.  Burden of new plants  The State is adding 3,700 MW to its production capacity – 800 MWx3 at Krishnapatnam, 800 MW at VTPS and 500 MW in the Rayalaseema Thermal Power Project. Usually, it costs about Rs. 5.5 crore per MW but due to time and cost overruns, the capital expenditure has gone up to Rs. 9 crore per MW, which is about Rs. 1,500 crore additional cost a year, according to government sources.  COVID loss, dues  Losses due to COVID-19 scenario and long pending receivables from panchayats are also believed to be another Rs. 6,700 crore burden. In the current financial year, there is a deficit of Rs. 2,000 crore due to COVID and resultant dip in industrial activity. “Panchayat dues on street lighting etc. are about Rs. 1,200 crore per annum and the total accumulation till date is Rs. 4,700 crore. Industrial and commercial consumption fell by 30-40%. It has come to normal from October. The State government, on its part, is making arrangements to handle the payments till date,” said Mr. Srikanth. This apart, the power department is also burdened with wind and solar adequacy cost which is about Rs. 3,000 crore per annum. The Rs. 600 crore gap between monthly income and expenditure is another major factor in debt burden.  Solutions  New loans, Central support and State payments are actively used to reduce the debt burden, said the CMD. “We can’t pass on the burden to the consumer as per regulations. So, we are taking new loans, using Central schemes and State funds for the repayments. Last year, the State released Rs. 17,900 crore arrears of power dues which has reduced the current due at Rs. 10,800 crore. We are also accessing the Central government’s Atmanirbhar loans to the tune of Rs. 6,600 crore to pay arrears of power purchase firms and debt servicing,” said Mr. Srikanth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/streamlining-finances-of-power-sector-energy-secretary/article33174201.ece
25 November 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||SRM-AP students’ start-up on a roll||Sourav Sanyal, Miran Junaidi and Saurabh Ghanekar, final year students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at SRM University’s AP campus, have turned entrepreneurs by launching OurEye.ai, an automated end-to-end video intelligence solution for enterprises to monitor surveillance camera recordings and leveraging pre-existing CCTV-IP infrastructure. “At SRM, the active learning pedagogy helped us evolve and think out of the box with an approachable management ready to help us in every possible way at all times,” said Miran, informing that they had roped in six more students from the campus for part-time roles in their venture. Next Tech Lab, a student-run technological club of SRM-AP, infused the confidence in the team to float a company. “I met my batchmates and co-founders of OurEye.ai at the lab, we sat over long sessions, explored new areas, played with technology and built innovative ideas. Mentors Aditya and Anshuman, founders of the Next Tech Lab, were of great help, motivating us to demystify all our curiosities,” he said. Besides sponsoring five international conferences, the SRM management enables brilliant students to study a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, as part of the ‘semester abroad’ programme to help them broaden their horizons. Miran recalled that the idea of the start-up happened when they were pursuing their semester at UCB. He had lost his mobile phone in a park and they had to wait for 10 days for the CCTV supervisor to analyse the cameras. The trio realised that the capital expenditure on installation of the cameras was huge but the returns on the investment was low. This thought encouraged them to ideate a platform that could send real-time notifications to the supervisors through embedded Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technology. OurEye enables businesses to deploy a remote auditor/quality controller though existing cameras. Based on the industry requirements, the platform is programmed to observe the monitor, producing actionable insights to improve the business operations and their scale. After showcasing their find at international hackathons, the young entrepreneurs received $35,000 from the Sanjay Mehta-led 100X.VC. The company now has 23 team members, including the three founders. Currently in use by 11 different companies, OurEye has generated a revenue of Rs. 1.7 million in the recent financial year. The trio plans to open an office in Bengaluru soon and recruit engineers and other staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/srm-ap-students-start-up-on-a-roll/article33173562.ece

The G+5 MLCP project is being taken up by a Pune-based private company at a cost of Rs. 9.7 crore near Jagadamba Junction. The facility, which is completely computerised and mechanical, can accommodate up to 100 cars. Areas such as Jagadamba, Dabagardens, Dwarakanagar, Asilmetta, Rama Talkies and Gajuwaka have been facing severe parking woes and traffic snarls have been the regular feature, as people park their vehicles on the roads. The residents have been demanding parking space for quite some time and this MLCP, which is a pilot project in the city, is expected to provide some kind of solution.

25 November 2020||VISAKHPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Maoist leader counters police claim by releasing a video||The area committee member (ACM) of Korukonda of the banned CPI (Maoist), Kora Nageswara Rao, released a video on Tuesday condemning the allegations levelled against him by the police that he had taken Rs. 27 lakh from a contractor for building a house in his village Jillelabanda in Balapam panchayat of Chintapalli mandal in Visakha agency. He alleged the police were indulging in false propaganda to defame him and gain ground in the interior parts of AOB. The charges were baseless. He didn’t own a house in his village and this was earlier clarified by him and his wife to the media, he said. He also issued a press note stating that the police were forcing people to take part in volleyball tournaments under the pretext of community policing and development. According to him, the police were spreading false news that the Maoists were against development in the tribal areas and were against building of schools and health infrastructure. “We never opposed such moves,” he said. Police outreach Nageswara Rao’s media interaction was a fallout of the recent Police Community Reach programme at Cheruvuru, a village in Balapam panchayat close to Jillelabanda. This was for the first time that the police made deep inroads into the Maoist stronghold to hold a volleyball tournament, and this seemed to have upset the Maoists, especially Nageswara Rao as he considered it to be his stronghold, said Chintapalli ASP Vidya Sagar Naidu. The police laid a road overnight to Cheruvuru and this facilitated movement of an ambulance to the remote village for the first time. Over 1,500 people, including 40 teams from various interior villages, had participated in the day-long event. Allegation It was at this event that OSD Satish Kumar and ASP Naidu had mentioned of Nageswara and his key man Bonda Prasad taking money from the contractor. In the last couple of months, over 15 Maoists and milita members, both from Galikonda Area Committee and Korukonda Area Committee had either surrendered or were arrested. Among them were Gemmeli Kamesh alias Hari, ACM of Galikonda, and key militia members such as Bonangi Nageswara Rao and Keshav, son of Gemmeli Narayan Rao alias Jambri. Nageswara Rao, in his statement, also said that Bonangi Nageswara Rao had no links with the party but the police were harassing him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/maoist-leader-counters-police-claim-by-releasing-a-video/article33174207.ece

The public hearing was held in strict conformity to the COVID-19 protocols under the aegis of the regional office of the Pollution Control Board in Rudrampur. The more-than-six-decade-old VK-7 underground coal mine of the State-owned Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) falls under the “violation category” owing to excess coal production devoid of the mandatory EC. The SCCL had earlier approached the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) for obtaining the EC to the existing VK7 underground mine as stipulated by the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) regulations. CPI State Assistant Secretary K Sambasiva Rao wanted the SCCL management to refrain from any move to convert some underground mines into opencast projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/public-hearing-on-vk-7-incline-held/article33174239.ece
25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Surgical strikes’ against illegal immigrants: BJP chief||Telangana BJP president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay raised the ongoing GHMC polls election campaign temperature to a feverish pitch by vowing to take up a “surgical strike not to kill but to weed out” illegally staying Rohingya nationals as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan citizens in Old City on Tuesday. “A small time leader questioned about my visit to Bhagyalakshmi Temple in Charminar as if it is in Pakistan. Is it in India’s Hyderabad or Pakistan’s Hyderabad? Who is going to stop me if it’s in India? There are parties like Majlis actually depending on these votes of illegal foreign citizens,” he charged, addressing a series of roadside meetings at Uppal, Ramanthapur and other areas in support of party candidates. Flanked by vice-president and former MLA N.V.S.S. Prabhakar and others, Mr. Sanjay said while his party was not against any religion or group, it would certainly fight against anyone trying to mock the majority religion. “Majlis party, which is an alliance partner of TRS, is known for its links with anti-national and anti-social elements and even holding condolence meetings for them,” he claimed. Responding to Majlis leader Asaduddin Owaisi’s challenge to take action against anti-national elements, he said, “We will certainly take up a drive against illegal immigrants as soon as we are elected to power. We will hold the victory celebrations at Bhagyalakshmi Temple”. His barbs, however, were mostly directed against Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, whom he called “quarantine Chief Minister, isolation Chief Minister”, who does not bother to step out of the farm house or Pragathi Bhavan to console people in distress during COVID-19 or in the recent floods. “He did not meet the victims of the Kondagutta bus mishap or consoled the families of the Intermediate students who had committed suicides last year. Is this why he has been elected? Do we need a CM who is anti-poor, who did not provide two-bedroom housing, did not give government jobs,” he asked, amid cheers. The BJP president said the CM decided on Rs. 10,000 to flood-hit families only with GHMC polls in mind and that too was stopped based on producing a fake letter and his forged signature. Referring to the TRS manifesto, Mr. Sanjay wanted to know why the same promises like free water and free power, made in the last GHMC polls, were not given in the last six years. “People should question why Layout Regularisation Scheme (LRS) was not mentioned in the manifesto, the government is planning to bring BRS - Building Regularisation Scheme and invoke more taxes,” he claimed and appealed for a chance to the BJP. Later on Tuesday, the MP stayed for the night halt at a Nagole slum. In separate road show at Malkajgiri, Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy accused KCR and KTR of making all kinds of allegations against BJP only because they realised people’s support increasing by the day. “Why are they promising so many sops if they had developed the city spending Rs. 67,000 crore?he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/surgical-strikes-against-illegal-immigrants-bjp-chief/article33174117.ece
25 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Many women contestants faceless in GHMC poll campaign||The election vehicle is plastered in orange and green with photographs of a number of men. The only clue that the candidate in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) poll fray for Venkateshwara Colony ward is a woman is the photograph of her with her husband in ‘namaskar’ pose. At least this woman candidate has made it to the poster. In other parts of the city, some women are not even visible though they are officially in fray. This invisibilisation of women is not limited to one party but across the political spectrum in the city. “I went to file my nomination in Asifnagar and a couple with their supporters were there. The candidate was standing while the two chairs were occupied by her husband and a political leader,” says a woman candidate who filed her nomination from the seat. No independent identity In Tolichowki, the candidate’s name is given as ‘Dr Ayesha Humera w/o Dr Haroon Farhan’ and carries the photograph of only the man with the woman nowhere to be seen. The small handbill has been posted with a message: “Mohd Haroon Farhaan Sahab to be once again Tolichowki numainda corporator (sic)”. “Mahatma bharya vochchindi (Mahatma’s wife has come),” Vithal Reddy tells his wife, minutes after the door-to-door campaign by Srilatha Korani passes by his house in Reddy Basthi, Upperpally, in the Rajendranagar ward on Monday morning. “Someone picks up the call and helps us whenever we need something. Sometimes, she picks up the call and at other times, it her husband or other relatives. But they help us,” informs Mr. Reddy. But this sidelining of women is not going uncontested in social media. Clamour on social media “The candidate is Samena Yasmeen. The photograph is supposed to be of her filing her nomination papers for contesting Municipal Elections. Yet, she is nowhere in any of the photographs. Is this how women are empowered in our country? (sic),” posted Twitter user R. Natasha tagging a photograph posted by AIMIM’s Aziz Khan that showed a bunch of men with garlands filing nomination on behalf of Sameena Yasmeen who is identified as the wife of Mohammed Badruddin. Another social media user commented about the practice by writing: “That is largely the case in municipal elections, because most seats are reserved for women so, men who are politically active ensure their wives contest. The only time you will see the woman is at the nomination office; outside that, for the next five years, it will be the man.” Hyderabad’s mayoral post is now reserved for women for two terms and 50% wards are also reserved for women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/many-women-contestants-faceless-in-ghmc-poll-campaign/article33174086.ece
25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC declines orders on flood aid||The Telangana High Court on Tuesday declined to pass any orders in a PIL petition challenging State Election Commission’s directive to State government to stall disbursal of Rs. 10,000 relief to flood-affected families in GHMC area. A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said the government can continue disbursal of money after December 4. It directed the Chief Secretary to file a counter affidavit explaining why the government did not request the SEC to permit continuation of disbursal of financial assistance to flood-affected families. The bench also sought to know from the CS if financial assistance was being given to people all over the State or only in GHMC area. It asked the CS why the government consented to conducting GHMC elections even as the disbursal of Rs. 10,000 was on. Hearing the PIL plea filed by lawyer S. Sharath Kumar, the bench made it clear that the SEC was not an institution subordinate to the government. It was an independent entity and had the responsibility of conducting free and fair elections. The petitioner contended that election code was not against extending financial assistance to victims of natural calamity. It was not fair to pass instruction to stop disbursal of money to flood affected families in the city in the name of elections, he said. The SEC’s decision was unilateral, he said. The SEC’s counsel G. Vidya Sagar argued that there were allegations that flood relief assistance was being given only to supporters of ruling party. Payment of cash at the time of elections was likely to influence voters. Stopping this for 10 days would not cause inconvenience to anyone, he said. The bench observed that distribution of money, whatever be the purpose, was not correct. The SEC had stopped disbursal of money temporarily, not permanently, the bench said. The plea was posted to December 4 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-declines-orders-on-flood-aid/article33174105.ece
25 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||BJP for ‘Becho India’, TRS for ‘Socho India’: KTR||BJP’s new slogan is “Becho India” as it is on a selling spree of India’s best organisations, TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao said, adding, “failures in governance is just an ‘Act of God’ for them”. ‘Spreading lies’ “Going by their selling spree, the BJP will not hesitate to sell Golconda, Charminar and even GHMC. The only achievements of the BJP is spreading lies and dividing people on religious lines,” Mr. Rao said, as he tore into the BJP’s chargesheet against the TRS government. “BJP stood for ‘Becho India’ and TRS is for ‘Socho India’”, Mr. Rao said. “The BJP will see thousands of chargesheets against it from various sections of people for cheating them with false promises,” he said. Listing out various promises made by the BJP over the last six years, he sought an apology from Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, who released the chargesheet against the TRS government. Mr. Rao asked whether the TRS was targeted for “constructing Kaleshwaram, bringing top technology companies to Hyderabad and helping farmers with Rythu Bandhu scheme.” He said the chargesheet resembled ‘Goebbels diary’, calling BJP “cousins of Hitler’s propaganda minister Goebbels”. “There is TRS government in Telangana and not TRS-MIM government as claimed. The claim reflects BJP’s allergy towards Muslims of the country. But when it comes to political opportunities, it is the same party that formed government with the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir,” he said. Mr. Rao sought answers from the BJP on lack of financial help to Hyderabad from the Central government. “The ITIR project sanctioned for Hyderabad was cancelled by the BJP, denying employment opportunities to lakhs of youngsters. Not a single rupee was given for Hyderabad’s development in the last six years.” The Municipal Minister accused the BJP of privatising profitable government-controlled institutions like India Railways and LIC to “help its friends”. Defence institutions like Midhani and BHEL in Hyderabad were also put on the list, he said. Mr. Rao reiterated that their fight was with the MIM, “who will come second in the number of seats and the TRS candidate will be the Mayor.” “Let other parties fight for third and fourth places,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-for-becho-india-trs-for-socho-india-ktr/article33174110.ece
25 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Where were TRS leaders during flood: Revanth||Questioning the campaign of entire Telangana cabinet and 90 odd MLAs and MLCs and Parliament members in the GHMC elections, TPCC working president A. Revanth Reddy said where were these people when the city was flooded and people were suffering. The Congress MP said the ruling party was afraid of defeat and that is why the entire TRS machinery was put in for campaigning in the city “If the TRS is so confident, why is it forcing all the MLAs from across Telangana to campaign here?” he asked during his road shows in support of the Congress candidates. “People’s voice will not reflect in the GHMC council if candidates of the ruling party are elected as they will remain silent with no guts to question the government,” Mr. Reddy said as he asked votes for Congress candidates in various divisions in Malkajgiri Parliamentary constituency. The Malkajgiri MP, who conducted road shows in support of Congress candidates in Hayath Nagar, Mansoorabad, Ramanthapur and Habsiguda, said that only Congress candidates could raise issues on behalf of the people while ruling party corporators would remain silent like their MLAs. “Give strength to the opposition,” he said. In Hayath Nagar and Mansoorabad in support of Gurram Srinivas Reddy and Jakkidi Prabhakar Reddy respectively, the Congress MP targeted local MLA D. Sudheer Reddy, saying that he defected to the ruling party after being elected from the Congress but so far did nothing. “Neither the registration issues that he promised were solved nor could he get any funds for the colonies,” he alleged. During the campaign in Ramanthpur, Habsiguda and Chilukanagar in support of Soumya, Uma Sudhakar Reddy and Beena Bhaskar Reddy, he said that the local Uppal MLA has done nothing for the area and now he was seeking votes for his wife. “What will they do except keeping silent in front of KCR and KTR,” he said. “Give me 30 corporators and I will show people’s strength to the government.” Mr. Reddy said that the TRS government was fleecing people in the name of LRS scheme and people should question when the TRS candidates come for the campaign. “They ate the money meant to be distributed to flood victims and people should not forget and forgive them,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/where-were-trs-leaders-during-flood-revanth/article33174107.ece
25 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Cong. offers host of sops in manifesto||The State unit of Congress has promised 30,000 litres of free water, Rs. 50,000 for every flood-affected family, Rs. 5 lakh for fully damaged houses and Rs. 2.5 lakh for partially destroyed houses apart from Rs. 25 lakh ex-gratia to the people who died due to recent Hyderabad deluge. Releasing the party manifesto here, the Congress assured that COVID-19 would be brought under Aarogyasri treatment and a plan to implement a Comprehensive Drainage System to prevent flooding across the limits of HMDA, taking future urbanisation into account. The ‘People’s Manifesto’ comes with the slogan ‘We did it…We can do it again’ also promises free transportation to women, students, senior citizens and the physically handicapped, Rs. 25 lakh insurance coverage for sanitation workers, complete waiver of property tax and free electricity for the shops being run by barbers, washermen, carpenters and goldsmiths. AICC in-charge for Telangana Manickam Tagore, TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy, CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy, manifesto committee chairman Marri Shashidhar Reddy, AICC secretaries N.S Bose Raju, Madhu Yashki Goud, Sampath Kumar; ex-deputy Chief Minister Damodar Rajanarasimha, former Minister J. Geetha Reddy and vice-president Zafar Javeed were among those present. Mr. Shashidhar Reddy, in his introductory remarks, explained how the TRS has spoiled the city’s infrastructure, and criticised its negligent approach towards the development of the world-class city. AICC spokesperson Sravan Dasoju said manifesto promised citizens to bring back the glory of Hyderabad by implementing world-class flood management, rain water management and underground drainage systems. ‘TRS stealing credit’ TPCC president Mr. Uttam Reddy said the TRS manifesto, released by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday, should be tossed into the dustbin as the ruling party has merely repeated promises made in the last elections. He reiterated that TRS was trying to take credit for the achievements of Congress party which included Hyderabad Metro Rail, international airport at Shamshabad, Outer Ring Road, PVNR Expressway, flyovers and other projects. He said that it was also during the Congress regime that Godavari and Krishna rivers were brought to Hyderabad for drinking purposes. He said it was due to the inefficiency of TRS government and step-motherly attitude of BJP government at the Centre that Hyderabad lost Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR) which was sanctioned by the previous Congress-led UPA regime. The ITIR would have given indirect employment to nearly 50 lakh people. Commenting on the promises made by KCR for free drinking water up to 20,000 litres and free power to laundries and salons, he asked why the schemes were not already implemented as they were promised earlier as well. “KCR repeats his old promises before every election and conveniently forgets them,” he said and added flood relief of Rs. 10,000 to each affected family was swindled by the ruling party leaders and a majority of victims did not get it. “The CM did not even visit any affected area,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-offers-several-sops-to-lure-voters/article33174094.ece
25 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Old City not on enemy land: Shabbir||Former Minister Shabbir Ali criticised Mr. Sanjay’s comments and said that as an MP, he should know that Old City is not in an enemy’s land but in our own country. “He should be ashamed of himself for stooping to such a low level just to win a few seats in GHMC elections. He is clearly trying to create a divide in the society on the basis of religion and it is highly regrettable that neither the Election Commission nor the Hyderabad police are taking any action against him for such provocative statements,” he said in a statement here. He said Mr. Sanjay should explain why the BJP government failed to identify Rohingyas in the city if they were present. “By describing Old City as a hub of terrorism, Sanjay is directly questioning the capabilities of Union Home Minister Amit Shah in handling terrorism.” Mr. Shabbir also accused MIM president Asaduddin Owaisi of promoting communalism and said both BJP and MIM were two sides of the same coin, who want to win elections on the basis of religious hatred. He alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was the mastermind behind the entire rivalry drama being enacted by TRS, MIM and BJP. Since TRS government has failed on all fronts, Mr. KCR is using BJP leaders to divert people’s attention, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/old-city-not-on-enemy-land-shabbir/article33174115.ece
25 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Irresponsible comments: KTR||The ‘surgical strike’ comment by BJP chief Bandi Sanjay infused heat into the poll campaign of TRS as working president K.T. Rama Rao vehemently attacked the BJP for such ‘irresponsible’ comments to divide people. “Is Hyderabad in Pakistan or the BJP doesn’t see the city in Indian map,” he questioned at several meetings during his road show in Musheerabad, Ramnagar, Amberpet and Kacheguda divisions on Tuesday. “Some freshers in politics are making irresponsible statements to divide people on communal lines and incite violence. It is high time people reject such divisive ideology,” he said. The Minister cautioned youngsters not to fall into the trap of such ‘emotive issues’ or else Hyderabad as a hub of investments will suffer and deny employment. If law and order is disturbed, no industry will like to invest its money or resources for which TRS had worked relentlessly for the last six years. “My appeal to people is reject such divisive politics as people of all faiths in Hyderabad have been living in peace.” Mr. Rama Rao also took a dig at the BJP national leadership. He said that national BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP president J.P. Nadda and UP CM Yogi Adityanath are all visiting Hyderabad, and asked them to explain the reason for campaigning in a local election. He challenged the BJP to reveal its assistance to the TS government before their campaigning. He also claimed that it was Telangana that contributed to the national kitty and developmental works in Gujarat, UP and Bihar were being done with taxes contributed by the Telangana people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/irresponsible-comments-ktr/article33174121.ece
25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SEC wants 100% voter slip supply for higher polling||As the day of polling for GHMC elections inches closer, State Election Commission (SEC) authorities have advised civic body officials to take all possible measures to increase the poll percentage this time, including improved awareness programmes and distribution of voter slips to as many voters as possible. The SEC has asked GHMC authorities to supply 100% voter slips to the electorate since lack of their supply was found to be the main reason for the low poll percentage in 2009 (42.04%) and 2016 (45.29%) elections to the civic body. In the instructions sent to the GHMC Commissioner, SEC secretary M. Ashok Kumar wished the former to complete supply of 100% voter slips by November 25 by visiting door to door. Further, the SEC has suggested that the field level functionaries submit a report to the Deputy Commissioners concerned of GHMC on the extent of voter slips distributed till November 25 evening and the reasons for non-distribution of slips, in case of balance. The Deputy Commissioners have been asked to visit at least 30% of households to ascertain proper distribution of voter slips. Order to ZCs The SEC has also suggested Zonal Commissioners to visit at least 10% of the households randomly to confirm about the distribution of voter slips. They have also been told to make one employee responsible for each ward to contact self-help group members, residents’ welfare associations, gated community associations, colony/basti leaders and house owners (property tax payers) over phone regularly to find whether they have received voter slips. After finding the extent of households that have not been distributed with the voter slips, the slips have to be distributed to the remaining households without fail by November 27, the SEC secretary told GHMC officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sec-wants-100-voter-slip-supply-for-higher-polling/article33174097.ece
25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Suburbs high on growth, low on amenities’||The TRS government claims to have spent Rs. 67,000 crore on the city’s infrastructure but that is not visible in the suburbs or erstwhile municipalities which were joined to form Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) although it has seen high growth in the past two decades, said senior BJP leader S. Malla Reddy, who was Rangareddy district chief for several years. In this exclusive interview, he insists that his party will correct the deficiency if voted to power. Excerpts:  Why do you think suburbs are important in this election? We are sure of doing well both in the core city and suburbs because of the changed political scenario. The Dubbak byelection win showed we are the alternative to TRS. Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s policies and corruption-free governance favour us. Rangareddy district in original shape is where the city has expanded tremendously yet basic amenities like roads, drinking water, sewage and other big projects have eluded this area. But, TRS government claims to have taken up many works. Not a single flyover has come up in areas of Kapra, Alwal, Qutbullapur, Rajendernagar and other areas except at Kukatpally and L.B. Nagar. Suburbs generate a lot of revenue because they host business establishments and industries but have seen little civic infrastructure improvement. Kompally, Aramghar and Amberpet flyovers are being taken up through Centre’s funds. TRS projects veer around Durgam Cheruvu or Gachibowli where their favoured realtors have projects. What needs to be done to develop the suburbs on par with core city? Traffic has increased tremendously to and fro but public transport is negligible. TRS government did not bother to give Rs. 300 crore as its share for completing MMTS Phase-II which connects Medchal, Ghatkesar and Shamshabad, providing affordable and eco-friendly transport. It can carry 5 lakh passengers a day. Metro rail needs to be expanded till Patancheru, Qutbullapur, Hayatnagar and Rajendranagar if the city is to be decongested. Most areas face acute drinking water supply because the next two phases of Godavari water scheme are yet to be grounded. The two proposed balancing reservoirs outside Outer Ring Road are delayed. Connecting Singur with Konda Pochamma reservoir will solve a lot of issues. Underground sewage network is limited to a few areas and need to be expanded. So do stormwater drains. River Musi clean-up too is imperative. How about housing for the poor? Two-bedroom housing projects have been taken up in a few places but not yet handed over to any beneficiary. Even more shocking is the utter neglect of the nearly-complete Rajiv Swagruha housing with at least 4,000 flats which can sold to the middle class section if the government shows initiative. How do you plan to develop infrastructure if elected to power? We are promising drinking water connection to every household, total sewerage network, internal and radial roads, traffic signalling system etc. Funds can be given directly to the local bodies under 15th Finance Commission. Centre’s funds are also available for many schemes.  Two-bedroom housing projects have been taken up in a few places but not yet handed over to any beneficiary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/suburbs-high-on-growth-low-on-amenities/article33174092.ece

IRISET re-dedicates itself to its mission objective of continuously improving to bridge the skill gap to make Indian Railways Atma-Nirbhar in S&T systems when IR is at door-step of a major technological leap,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/iriset-trains-4895-employees/article33174126.ece
25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||MIM fields medicos, 3 women with PG degree||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) candidates for the upcoming GHMC polls have filed nomination from 51 divisions, nine divisions lesser as compared to the 2016 civic polls. While the GHMC released a list on Sunday night, updated data on nomination filing by candidates across party lines and independents, was shared with the media on Monday. However, AIMIM functionaries remained tight-lipped on reasons behind the party contesting from 51 divisions as against 60 the last time  While major parties contesting the polls have released list of their candidates, albeit with some delay, the MIM is yet to officially release their list of contesting candidates. When asked for a response, party functionaries remained evasive. According to data, the party has fielded as many as five post-graduates, 18 undergraduates and 12 graduates. The list also includes doctors, a pharmacist and a woman candidate with alima certification in Arabic. Data showed that of the five candidates who are post-graduates, three are women — Mahpara contesting from Kurmaguda division, Sameena Yasmeen from Golconda division and Shireen Khatoon from Nawabsahebkunta division. Batha Jabeen, who is the party’s candidate from Vijaynagar Colony, is a qualified pharmacist, and Dr Ayesha Humera, contesting from Tolichowki division, is a Unani doctor.  The Telangana Rashtra Samithi has fielded candidates in the Old City, and as per a recent statement by Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister K.T. Rama Rao, his party is hopeful of winning a larger share of seats from here. He also clarified that there is no alliance between the TRS and the AIMIM. In response to this, AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi said that his party would fight TRS candidates in the civic polls, even as he confirmed that there is no truck between both parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mim-fields-medicos-five-with-pg-degree/article33174095.ece
25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS is not one family’s jagir: BJYM chief||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao boasted of golden Telangana but only his family and party got gold, said BJYM national president and MP Tejasvi Surya on Tuesday. In a scathing attack on the TRS supremo, Mr. Surya said that Telangana was not the ‘jagir’ of a single family. He was addressing a gathering of students and BJP activists from Arts College building on Osmania University campus. Mr. Surya, who came to Hyderabad to campaign for BJP in the GHMC elections, said that the separate State of Telangana was built on the sacrifices of youngsters. But the youth was being neglected by the government, he charged. While the youth wanted to stand on their own feet by getting jobs, Mr. KCR was offering them ‘unemployment allowance’. “They want jobs, not your pittance. OU and Telangana are not the properties of a single family,” Mr. Surya said amidst slogans of ‘Jai Telangana’ and ‘Jai Sriram’ Ridiculing TRS party rule, the MP said that the definition of democracy got reversed in Telangana. “In Telangana, democracy is by the family, of the family and for the family,” he said. “There is a new wave of transformation arising in Telangana. Youth of the State are heading this revolution,” he said. Mr. Surya exhorted students and BJP workers to fight for change and a new future. The meeting on Tuesday was wrapped in less than an hour and passed off peacefully. However, mild tension prevailed when policemen deployed at the closed NCC gate stopped the BJP leader and supporters from going inside the campus. The BJP activists raised slogans against the police, registering their protest. After some jostling between the police and the BJP workers, the latter pushed open the side gate and started walking towards Arts College. Later, while delivering his speech from Arts College, Mr. Surya charged that Mr. KCR instructed the police to prevent him from entering the campus. However, the fact remained that the NCC gate was closed for everybody since lockdown was imposed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telangana-is-not-one-familys-jagir-bjym-chief/article33174113.ece

A letter of acceptance was exchanged between the SCR’s principal chief operations manager Shiva Prasad and ISB deputy dean Milind Sohoni in the presence of General Manager Gajanan Mallya on Tuesday. Coal occupies predominant share in the freight basket of Indian Railways, but the transportation of the commodity also happens through some of the most saturated sections so the proposed ‘Freight Operations Information System (FOIS)’ can be effectively utilised both for the demand estimation as well as to develop a model to supply the rakes to meet the needs of the industry, said Mr. Mallya. ISB’s scientific analyses will explore new avenues for railways in improving the freight traffic and it looks forward to delivering good optimisation model which results in meeting demand supply variation effectively, said Prof. Sohoni.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/isb-to-help-railways-on-freight-operations-info/article33174127.ece

25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP dumps TRS manifesto in dustbin!||In a symbolic gesture, senior BJP leader P. Muralidhar Rao on Tuesday along with other senior leaders dumped the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) manifesto into the dustbin at the party office. “TRS has been in power for the last five years but has repeated the same promises made in the previous manifesto so it deserves nothing less. Why does the government remember freebies only before the GHMC polls? Is it because of the loss in Dubbak bypoll,” he questioned. TRS led by K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his son K.T. Rama Rao has lost all its moorings and diluted the party ideology, the former national general secretary alleged, adding, “People of the twin cities deserve a new beginning and new ideas for the development of the city, certainly not the same old promises.” He accused the TRS of actively supporting the Majlis Party to become stronger in the city and elsewhere to ensure the latter wins more seats just like the Congress Party had done earlier. “KCR and top TRS leadership are responsible for the deliberate change in demographics of many areas of Old City and willing to play second fiddle to the MIM,” he claimed. Mr. Rao accused the Majlis MLAs in Bihar refusing to take oath on behalf of the country and warned it was an indication of things to come. TRS-MIM combine have been involved in illegal land dealings, extortions, links with former naxalites and so on, he alleged. “KCR and KTR have been trying to scare people that voting for BJP will lead to communal riots when nowhere in the country where our party is in power have there been any riots.” Mr Muralidhar Rao added that the party could, in fact, put a stop to such religious strife. “Whatever the father-son duo claim, people of Telangana have decided to support us and a tsunami political change is imminent. TRS has failed totally in COVID-19 management and providing succour to the flood-affected people,” he said even as he strongly condemned KTR’s “Naxal kind of talk” on collection and devolution of revenues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-dumps-trs-manifesto-in-dustbin-says-change-is-imminent/article33174090.ece

He (BJP leader) said they will flush out Pakistanis and Rohingyas. I want to ask the BJP on whom you would conduct surgical strikes? They (those living in Old City) are Indians only,” he said, while reacting to Mr. Sanjay’s comments at a road show on Tuesday. ‘Our land encroached’ Reacting sharply to the criticism, the Hyderabad MP said, “I want to tell the BJP, whoever gave that statement, I want to tell the Prime Minister, China’s PLA has encroached our land in Ladakh. Mr. Modi, will you not conduct surgical strikes on Chinese who occupied our land,” Owaisi said during his poll campaign. The MIM chief sought to know how many Pakistanis are there in Old City and asked if Home Minister Amit Shah was weak. He also said he would not allow any Pakistani to live in Hyderabad. Mr. Owaisi further alleged that BJP’s intention was to create enmity among people (through such statements).

25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Banking operations likely to be hit||Banking operations in the State are likely to be impacted on November 26 as three major unions of bank employees and officers, working in many public sector banks, will be part of a nationwide strike called by central trade unions. With 20,000 bank employees and officers in Telangana set to participate in the strike, it is unlikely that any customer facing work will be possible in many banks, said P. Venkataramaiah, General Secretary of the Telangana unit of Bank Employees’ Federation of India (BEFI). State Bank of India, however, will function as usual since its workforce is not participating in the strike, sources in the country’s largest lender said. So will be the private sector banks. Mr.Venkataramaiah said other unions directly participating in the strike are the All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) and the All India Bank Officers Association. Some other unions, he said, will be lending support to the strike called by the central trade unions against certain changes in the Labour laws. The BEFI leader said others officers unions who are not directly participating in the strike have declared that their members will not perform clerical duties on that day. For the protesting workforce, the strike will provide a forum to voice their opposition to the recent recommendation of a RBI working group that large corporates may be allowed to promote banks, as also the decision of the central bank to hand over the reins of LVB to a private bank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/banking-operations-may-be-hit/article33174125.ece

25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Young faces in electoral fray||Youth are considered the agents of change in political processes and during every election, their role is always in focus. For the December 1 GHMC elections, 42 out of the 1,122 contestants are aged under 25 years. Of those youngsters, 26 are female candidates and 18 are independents. A few of them said that they were contesting the elections as their family members were not issued a ticket from the party they were hoping to represent. But most stated that the motivating factor was to serve people. Shaik Mohammed Rasool (24), who is contesting from Fatehnagar (ward number 118), said he has been actively involved in helping people with government work such as applying for Aadhaar card or pension for the past five years. “When I go to government offices, they mock me by saying that I am a kid and I should bring a basthi leader along. When we try to take help of political leaders, they do not give us basic respect regardless of their stature. I am a B.Tech graduate. I want to be a public representative so that I can get the works cleared without going through the humiliation,” said Mr Rasool, who is gathering money for election campaigning. One of the youngest contestants, Perumalla Vyshnavi (21) is a first-timer. “I want to bridge the gap between youth and politics,” she said, adding that since she is contesting as an independent candidate, only her history will be considered, which is clean. M. Karthik Yadav, who is just 21, said that though he has been working for the Congress since 2014, he was not issued a ticket to contest the local body elections. At least three women among the 42 are in the fray as a male family members did not get a ticket to contest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/young-faces-in-electoral-fray/article33174088.ece

Scores of cadre of the party and its frontal organisations marched through the main streets of the town holding banners and placards as part of a campaign to drum up support for the ensuing countrywide general strike. Addressing the participants of the rally, the CPI (M) State secretariat member P Sudarshan Rao called upon all sections of the society to demonstrate their dissent against the "anti-labour", "anti-farmer" and "anti-people" policies of the BJP dispensation at the Centre by making the November 26 general strike a grand success. He criticised the labour codes terming them as most detrimental to the interests of the working class. The party State committee members P Venkateshwara Rao and Y Srikanth, the district committee secretary N Nageswara Rao and others took part in the march.

Harish Rao has called upon the youth to teach a lesson to the BJP, saying the party has been responsible for the collapse of Indian economy. Participating in an election campaign at Bharathi Nagar in GHMC limits on Tuesday, Mr. Harish Rao said BJP leaders are making self-contradictory statements and couldn’t be trusted. “Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy says there is no chance of bringing funds from the Centre to develop local bodies and Hyderabad while party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar says he would bring funds from the Centre. Who should we trust,” he asked. Referring to the cancellation of Information Technology Investment Region sanctioned for Hyderabad by the previous UPA government, he said the Centre is responsible for loss of jobs in the State. The so-called development being claimed by the BJP is visible only on social media platforms but not at field level, he alleged. The Minister also questioned why funds were not released to Telangana when rain-induced floods hit Hyderabad while Rs. 600 crore was sanctioned to Gujarat and Rs. 500 crore to Karnataka for the same natural calamity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/teach-a-lesson-to-bjp-harish-tells-youth/article33174096.ece

25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Umar veteran of sedition, say police in riots chargesheet||Delhi Police, in a supplementary chargesheet in a north-east Delhi riots case, described former JNU student Umar Khalid as “a veteran of sedition” who “was the ‘silent whisper’ behind the first phase of the riots that took place in December 2019”. The supplementary chargesheet was filed against Umar, former JNU student Sharjeel Imam and one Faizan Khan under offences related to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. This brought the total number of persons charged under the anti-terror law in connection with the north-east Delhi riots to 18. The Delhi police said the “role of Umar Khalid in the present conspiracy finds first tangible manifestation on December 5, 2019, when on his direction, his disciple Sharjeel Imam had constituted MSJ (Muslim Students of JNU)”. “The constitution of MSJ, its association with SOJ (Students of Jamia) and whatever happened thereafter in Jamia Milia and in select locations of North-East District in December 2019 bears the unmistakable hallmark of a maturing Umar Khalid, learning from his experiences of 2016 and aiming towards engineering large scale communal riots, which was, however, to wait for another two months [sic],” the Delhi police said. “The connectivity of Umar Khalid with the wider kaleidoscope of activists, accused and co-conspirators... points to his centrality in the entire saga of events,” the police stated. The Delhi police also said Umar “was the convergence point of twin lines of Pan-Islamica and Ultra-Left anarchism which had incubated, nurtured and propagated the common conspiracy, all squarely aimed at violent subjugation of the government established by law”. “Umar Khalid had understood that the acceptance of Radical Islamist Groups and their political fronts could not exceed beyond the limits they had already achieved since their presence on the Indian landscape,” the police added. A conspiracy It said that on the night of February 22, 2020, “in pursuance and furtherance of common conspiracy, on the direction of Umar Khalid and other key executors of the conspiracy, under the garb of women, led protest at 27/7 sit-in protest site near Madina Masjid, Seelampur, moved and occupied 66 Foota Road at Jafrabad metro station, completely blocking traffic, i.e. Chakka Jaam”. The Delhi police further said that “Sharjeel Imam also conspired with other conspirators to threaten the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India through ideas and speeches which he delivered from December 13 last year and continued till January 23 this year”. “Accused Sharjeel Imam, in collusion with other conspirators, disrupted essential supplies and services for general public in Shaheen Bagh and instigated others to adopt his model of disruptive Chakka Jaam,” the Delhi police said. “On January 2, 2020, Sharjeel Imam formally withdrew from Shaheen Bagh protest under the pretext of a classical Maoist strategy i.e. keep the movement mass-based and desire individualism [sic],” the police said. “After having exited Shaheen Bagh and up to this date, Sharjeel Imam was not only spewing communal and seditious venom in cities and towns in the Hindi heartland of north India but was also visiting protest sites, arranging manpower and supervising the spread of this anti-national rot across Delhi,” the Delhi police said..||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/umar-veteran-of-sedition-say-police-in-riots-chargesheet/article33174078.ece
25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Can proceed against Umar, Sharjeel in riots case: court||A local court on Tuesday said there was sufficient material to proceed against former Jawaharlal Nehru University students Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, and one Faizan Khan for offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the north-east Delhi riots. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat made the remark after taking cognizance of a supplementary chargesheet filed by Delhi Police. “After perusal of the chargesheet and accompanying documents, there is sufficient material to proceed against accused persons Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid, and Faizan Khan for offences mentioned therein,” the court said. The court also noted that sanction for prosecution under Section 45 of the UAPA for offences under Sections 13 (Punishment for unlawful activities), 16 (Punishment for terrorist act), 17 (Punishment for raising funds for terrorist act), and 18 (Punishment for conspiracy) of the UAPA has been filed by the prosecution.  Soft copy of chargesheet The court also ordered the prosecution to supply a soft copy of the supplementary chargesheet to the accused. It also issued summons to accused Faizan Khan, who is currently on bail, for next date of hearing on December 12. In an earlier chargesheet, the Delhi police had charged 15 persons, including Pinjra Tod activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, under the UAPA in connection with the riots. Others who have been chargesheeted include former Congress councillor from Jagatpuri Ishrat Jahan, Jamia Coordination Committee media coordinator Safoora Zargar, student activist Gulfisha Khatoon, and social activist Khalid Saifi.

25 November 2020||New Delhi,||‘Tree transplantation for new Parliament violates govt. terms’||Trees being transplanted from a plot next to the current Parliament, for construction of a new Parliament building, are being transplanted in an Eco Park about 22 km away, in violation of approval given by the Delhi government. The approval was given for transplantation of a total 404 trees. The trees were supposed to be transplanted near the existing Parliament, close to the India Gate area, as per permission given on September 16. “Transplantation of 404 trees which are standing on the site shall be done by user agency at eight pockets in Central Vista, New Delhi,” the permission for transplantation of the trees given by Delhi government on September 16, read. These eight pockets are close to the artificial ponds near India Gate, according to officials. When contacted about the issue, the official concerned of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, under which the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) falls, did not offer a comment. The Delhi government had given permission for the transplantation of the trees to the CPWD. ‘Under pressure’ When asked about the violation, a Delhi government official told The Hindu, “A CPWD official now said that they were under pressure and transplanted trees in the NTPC Eco Park and were planning to inform us afterwards. But it’s in violation of the permission given and action will be taken.” Workers at the NTPC Eco Park, in Kalindi Kunj, also confirmed the development and said that at least “15-20 big trees” from the Parliament work have been transplanted at the park. This reporter also saw photos of these trees at the park and also videos of them in the process of being transplanted at the park. Multiple drivers of trucks transporting the trees and another CPWD official also confirmed that “large trees” were being taken to the park at night. “The smaller trees are being taken to a plot in Kirti Nagar,” a worker at the new Parliament site said on Tuesday, which was confirmed by two more workers. When asked about the violation, Ashwani Mittal, executive engineer of CPWD, to whom different permissions regarding the work have been sent by the Delhi and Union governments, said that he was “not competent to communicate to the media”. Officials did not comment on how many of the total 404 trees have been transplanted at the park. Some of the trees, which were given permission to be transplanted, were as tall as 16 metres — taller than a three-storey building. The trees include Peepal, Banyan, Neem, and Ashoka, among others and were 5 to over 50 years old, as per officials. When asked why the government is not doing transplantation close to India Gate, as said in the permission, Kanchi Kohli, senior researcher at Centre for Policy Research, said, “The Delhi government, CPWD and Urban Development Ministry are aware that the massive Central Vista redevelopment is proposed for the Prime Minister’s residence, common central secretariat buildings and other buildings, apart from the new Parliament. An application seeking environment clearance for these has already been floated. This makes the transplantation of trees on these same plots, where massive redevelopment may be underway soon, highly improbable and misleading.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/tree-transplantation-violates-govt-terms/article33173841.ece

25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘No coercive action against slum clusters’||The Centre assured on Tuesday in the Supreme Court that no coercive steps will be taken immediately to demolish 48,000 slum clusters situated within safety zones along rail tracks in Delhi. This is the second assurance given by the government to a Bench led by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde in as many months. On September 14, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had made a similar statement in court. The dispute stems from an August 31 order from a Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra, now retired, to remove the clusters within three months along with garbage piled up near the rail tracks. The court had banned any interference in the implementation of the order. It was in this background that Congress leader Ajay Maken and several residents from these clusters had urgently approached the court against the blanket order. Mr. Maken had called the August 31 order a “devastating” one. When the case came up in September, Mr. Mehta merely informed the court that discussions were still on. He had said that any immediate move to demolish the clusters would render over two lakh families homeless amid the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/no-coercive-action-to-be-taken-against-slum-clusters/article33173845.ece

25 November 2020||GURUGRAM,||Farmer leaders arrested in Haryana ahead of Delhi march||Around two dozen farmer leaders were taken into preventive custody by the Haryana Police on Tuesday early morning in raids across the State, ahead of the farmers groups’ two-day call for “Dilli Chalo” on November 26 and 27 to protest against the farm laws. The arrests sparked off protests in many parts of the State with various farmers’ and workers’ unions condemning the action as “undemocratic”. Midnight clampdown In a post-midnight clampdown in several districts, including Jhajjar, Hisar, Sirsa, Karnal and Bhiwani, police teams mounted raids at the houses of farmer leaders and took them in preventive custody. Jhajjar Superintendent of Police Rajesh Duggal told The Hindu that nine farmer leaders were arrested and sent to judicial custody. Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav, in a press conference during the day, claimed that at least 31 farmer leaders were detained in raids across the State in the early hours. He said the farmers were committed to peaceful and disciplined demonstration against the farm laws, but the Haryana government seemed bent on creating anarchy by arresting the movement’s leadership. He said the government was nervous and resorting to crackdown to suppress the “historic movement”. Mr. Yadav said farmers groups were committed to their call for “Dilli Chalo” and made an appeal to all citizens, citizen groups and political and democratic outfits to raise their voice against the crackdown. More than 500 farmers groups across the country have given the call to march to Delhi on November 26 and 27 to hold a protest against the farm laws at Jantar Mantar. Mr. Yadav said that farmers from five States – Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand – were scheduled to gather at five points on November 26 morning and march towards Delhi. “Four of these assembly points are in Haryana at Sampla, Panchgaon, Sector 12 Faridabad and Kundli border,” said Mr. Yadav. He added that delegations from 15 more States were expected to join the protest. Later, angry protesters assembled at Rohtak’s Mansarovar park and took out a protest march to mini secretariat in protest against the arrests of the farmer leaders. Kisan Sabha vice president Inderjit Singh criticised the BJP-JJP alliance government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farmer-leaders-arrested-in-haryana-ahead-of-delhi-march/article33173855.ece

25 November 2020||Mumbai,||Uddhav to PM: Oppn. parties shouldn’t play politics over COVID-19||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to convene a meeting of political parties to appeal for their cooperation instead of playing politics amid the COVID-19 pandemic. At a virtual meeting of the Chief Ministers of eight States, chaired by the Prime Minister, Mr. Thackeray said, “New cases in Maharashtra have dipped from 24,000 to 5,000. We have urged the people to stay alert. The Prime Minister or the Home Minister should convene a meeting of all political parties and inform them about the seriousness of the situation and seek their cooperation.” The Chief Minister did not name any party, but his remarks came in the backdrop of the State BJP staging protests for the reopening of temples and on the issue of inflated electricity bills. Mr. Thackeray said on the one hand the government is asking citizens to follow safety norms, while on the other, political parties are hitting the streets in protest. “This will seriously damage all our attempts to control the pandemic and may invite the next wave of the coronavirus,” he said. The NITI Aayog made a presentation on vaccine production and its distribution during the meeting. Mr. Thackeray said that the State government is constantly in touch with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with pharma major AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford for manufacturing a vaccine. “The State government has set up a task force. It will discuss issues such as availability, production, side-effects, and funds required for distribution,” he said. The task force, which will be led by the Chief Secretary, comprises the Additional Chief Secretaries from the Finance and Planning departments, Principal Secretary of Public Health Department, Secretary of Medical Education Department, Health Services Commissioner, Director of Medical Education, and heads of the pharmacy departments of Sir JJ group of hospitals and KEM Hospital. ‘Successful campaign’ Mr. Thackeray also informed Mr. Modi about the State government’s ambitious ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign. He said the campaign has received a good response and succeeded in containing the spread of the disease. “The State government conducted a health survey of 11.92 crore people and has collected their data. This will help the State to develop its health map,” he added. Mr. Thackeray said 70,000 to 80,000 tests are being conducted in the State daily and instructions have been issued to increase the number of RT-PCR tests.

25 November 2020||Mumbai,||ED raids acts of political vendetta, say MVA allies||The alliance partners of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Tuesday termed raids by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) acts of political vendetta. Earlier in the day, the ED raided the home of Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik and arrested his son, Vihang Sarnaik, in an alleged money laundering case. Standing with Mr. Sarnaik, the Sena said, “Such acts of misusing Central agencies against political opponents will make the Opposition stronger.” Mr. Sarnaik visited the office of Sena mouthpiece Saamana and met Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut. In a brief statement, he said, “We will take the judicial route.” Mr. Sarnaik had moved the breach of privilege motion against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami. He was also vocal in demanding action against Mr. Goswami in the alleged abetment to suicide case of architect Anvay Naik. “This [ED raids] is no different from the ongoing practice of using power against political opponents,” NCP president Sharad Pawar said. State Congress president and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said the ED’s action was unfortunate and objectionable. “At a time when the Central government is not paying GST dues and ensuring financial blockade of State governments ruled by Opposition parties, it is also using Central probe agencies to threaten the Opposition,” said Mr. Thorat. The BJP said the ED conducts raids only when it is in possession of evidence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ed-raids-acts-of-political-vendetta-say-mva-allies/article33173757.ece
25 November 2020||Navi Mumbai,||NMMC targets 4,000 tests per day||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has started setting up COVID-19 testing centres at railway stations to meet its target of conducting 4,000 tests every day. Amid fears of a second wave, NMMC chief Abhijit Bangar has instructed officials to ensure that all its agencies implement ‘Mission Break the Chain-2’. The team of healthcare workers deployed at the exit points of railway stations will conduct reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. “Testing centres with a six-member health team started functioning at Belapur, Nerul and Vashi railway stations on Monday. The emphasis is on getting the maximum tests done. On the first day itself, over 400 tests were conducted. Such testing centres will be set up in the remaining railway stations soon,” Mr. Bangar said. The NMMC chief said teachers also underwent RT-PCR tests as part of the process to reopen schools. Of the 1,195 teachers tested so far, 17 have tested positive. “However, now that schools will open only after December 31, the tests will have to be conducted again,” Mr. Bangar said. The testing centres set up in APMC market and MIDC area are also targeting to test the maximum number of people. Focus on APMC market NMMC had placed special focus on the APMC market at the start of the pandemic and set up a permanent testing centre at the onion market. Now, such permanent testing centres have been set up in the masala, grain, fruit and vegetable markets. On an average, around 2,500 people get tested every day within NMMC limits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/nmmc-targets-4000-tests-per-day/article33173756.ece
25 November 2020||Navi Mumbai,||5 held for pilfering diesel from HPCL pipeline||The Sanpada police have arrested five people, including the manager of a petrol pump, for pilfering diesel from HPCL’s pipeline. HPCL officials noticed a hole drilled into the Mumbai-Pune pipeline at Turbhe overbridge at 3 a.m. on September 27. They then filed a complaint with the Sanpada police against unidentified people. “We kept a watch over the spot and on November 15, we nabbed the first accused, Bholaprasad Yadav,” senior police inspector Suresh Nikam said. Mr. Yadav revealed the names of Baldev Singh, Jitendra alias Jitubhai Yadav, and Keshav Shetty. The police then arrested Suresh Bhaskar Sapkal, the manager of a petrol pump at Chikhli in Buldana, who bought the diesel from the accused for Rs. 40,000. “Around 1,250 litres of diesel is suspected to have been stolen in September. We are investigating if the accused conducted similar thefts elsewhere. The main accused is still absconding. Sapkal is suspected to have sold the diesel at his petrol pump,” Mr. Nikam said. The accused were charged under Sections 379 (theft), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs. 50), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 15 of the Petroleum & Minerals Pipelines (Acquisition of Right of User in Land) Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/5-held-for-pilfering-diesel-from-hpcl-pipeline/article33173755.ece
25 November 2020||Washington,||U.S. agency begins transition process||After weeks of dragging their feet, the U.S.’s General Service Administration (GSA) has made an “ascertainment” that President-elect Joe Biden is the “apparent winner” of the presidential election, allowing the formal transition process to begin. The Biden-Harris transition team will now have access to funds and other resources sanctioned by the Presidential Transition Act. GSA Administrator Emily Murphy said “recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results” were part of her decision to initiate the process. Earlier in the day on Monday, the Michigan State Board of Canvassers voted to certify Mr. Biden as the winner of the State’s vote (16 Electoral College votes), despite President Donald Trump’s attempts to get State legislators to block the certification. Mr. Trump, who has thus far refused to concede the election came close on Monday but stopped short of conceding, tweeting instead that he had “recommended” that the initial protocols begin but said he will continue to challenge the election results in court. ‘We will prevail’ “Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good fight, and I believe we will prevail! Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same,” Mr. Trump wrote. Later, Mr. Trump, who has made unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in the election, wrote: “What does GSA being allowed to preliminarily work with the Dems have to do with continuing to pursue our various cases on what will go down as the most corrupt election in American political history?” In a letter to Mr. Biden, Ms. Murphy, a Trump appointee, said she had come to her decision independently and was not pressured by government and White House officials on her decision. “Contrary to media reports and insinuations, my decision was not made out of fear or favouritism,” she wrote, adding that she had received threats directed at her safety and the safety of her staff, family and pets. Hours before the ascertainment, several Republican Senators, including Lamar Alexander of Tennessee (who is retiring) and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, asked for the transition to begin. “Since it seems apparent that Joe Biden will be the President-elect, my hope is that President Trump will take pride in his considerable accomplishments, put the country first and have a prompt and orderly transition…,” Mr. Alexander said. “When you are in public life, people remember the last thing you do.” The formal nod to the transition will allow the Biden-Harris team to work with government officials on a number of issues, including a response to COVID-19, vaccine distribution, national security and economic revival. Mr. Biden has cited risks to the pandemic response caused by delays in the transition beginning. Delays have also been known to cause national security vulnerabilities. A shortened Clinton-Bush transition (due to a lawsuit on the outcome of the election) period had caused security vulnerabilities in the prelude to the September 11 attacks, a bipartisan commission to look into those attacks found. “This final decision is a definitive administrative action to formally begin the transition process with federal agencies,” Biden-Harris transition executive director Yohannes Abraham said in a statement on Monday. The transition team will meet federal officials to discuss the pandemic response, national security and “the Trump administration’s efforts to hollow out government agencies,” Mr. Abraham said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-agency-begins-transition-process/article33173465.ece
25 November 2020||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka, China to focus on ‘poverty alleviation’||Sri Lanka and China will expedite ongoing development cooperation projects, and increase trade and investment, with “a special focus” on poverty alleviation and livelihoods generation, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Ministry said. Issuing a statement following a virtual diplomatic consultation between Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Jayanath Colombage and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Luo Zhaohui, the Ministry said both sides held “extensive discussions” on strengthening high level exchanges, the fight against COVID-19, economic recovery efforts, people-to-people exchanges and cooperation on “international and regional issues”. Amid a persistent second wave of COVID-19, Sri Lanka faces a major economic crunch, as the country’s export and tourism sectors have been badly hit. Colombo has sought a $700 million loan from Beijing — in addition to the $500 million obtained in March — and is also negotiating a $1.5-billion currency swap facility with the People’s Bank of China. More loans Sri Lanka has sought loans amounting to more than a billion dollars from China this year, while President Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Colombo that Sri Lanka “seeks investments, not loans” from China. The discussion of possible Chinese assistance for poverty eradication and livelihood support in Sri Lanka is in line with President Rajapaksa’s earlier pledge to pursue “China-style development” in the island nation, and to disprove the popular “debt trap” analysis about Chinese loans. “Achieving the kind of rural development that China has reached over the past two or three decades and to improve the living standards of the rural population in Sri Lanka is one of my prime objectives,” President Rajapaksa told the Chinese Ambassador, according to a statement issued by his office last week. Colombo has witnessed heightened engagement from Beijing, New Delhi and Washington over the past few months. In September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a virtual bilateral summit with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, months after the RBI sanctioned currency swap facility of $400 million.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-china-to-focus-on-poverty-alleviation/article33173463.ece
25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||With U.S. drawing down troops, what’s next for Afghanistan?||With the U.S. prepared to reduce its troop presence in Afghanistan to about 2,500 by January 20 — the inauguration day for the new President — Afghanistan is bracing for an uncertain future. The Taliban, who were ousted from power in 2001 after the U.S. invasion and have since been fighting both foreign troops and the Afghan government in Kabul, now control more than half of the country and contest the whole of it. In February this year, the U.S. reached an agreement with the Taliban after prolonged negotiations in Doha, Qatar’s capital, where the insurgents have a political office. According to the agreement, the U.S. would withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan in 14 months in return for assurances from the Taliban that they would not allow Afghan soil to be used by transnational jihadist organisations such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The Taliban also committed that it would start direct talks with the Afghan government. The talks began in September after the Afghan government released some 5,000 Taliban prisoners, which the U.S. had promised as part of its deal. On Tuesday, Afghanistan’s Tolo News TV channel reported that the negotiating sides agreed to include the U.S.-Taliban deal and UN endorsements for Afghan peace process in the upcoming talks in Doha. Experts see this as a breakthrough as the Taliban was resisting including the deal with the U.S. in the talks with the Afghan government. But the Taliban, while holding talks, continued their offensive. Since February, the Taliban have conducted more than 13,000 attacks nationwide, according to a Wall Street Journal report, which cited internal Afghan assessments. Time of uncertainty “It is a time of uncertainty for the Afghan peace process. Months of delay, the Taliban's resumption of violence, and [U.S. President Donald] Trump's continued drawdown of troops in spite of slow progress have all given Afghans and observers cause for concern,” said Andrew Watkins, senior analyst, Afghanistan, at the Brussels-based International Crisis Group (ICG). Echoing the assessment, Ruchi Kumar, a Kabul-based journalist, said: “The Taliban have given plenty of indications that they don’t intend to remain committed to the U.S. deal forever. There’s evidence that they’re still hosting al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.” A UN report in June said ties between the two groups remained “close”. “They are also targeting larger provinces and provincial capitals. Essentially, I get the sense that they’re doing more than just seeking a stronger negotiating position; they are exerting themselves militarily,” Ms. Kumar told The Hindu from Kabul. According to a UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UMAMA) report in October, nearly 6,000 Afghan civilians were killed in the first nine months of the year — 45% of the deaths were at the hands of the Taliban. The UNAMA said violence refused to die down even after talks began in Doha. In early September, right before the peace talks opened, there was an attack on the convoy of Vice-President Amrullah Saleh, who’s known for his hardline anti-Taliban views. Mr. Saleh escaped with minor injuries. Sense of ascendancy “The bad news is that Trump's order [to reduce troops] likely reinforces the Taliban’s sense of ascendancy, and may encourage the group to maintain its aggressive posture across the country,” Mr. Watkins of ICG told The Hindu . The U.S. has already pulled back some 7,500 troops from Afghanistan since February. It would also dismantle the massive base in Kandahar. At present, the U.S. and coalition troops are not directly involved in frontline combat. They provide training to Afghan troops, and American air power is a critical ally of Afghan forces that resist Taliban’s repeated attempts to take over big population centres. In recent times, the Taliban made several bids to take control of Kunduz in the north and Helmand in the south, but were fought off by Afghan special forces with help from U.S. jets. “With the U.S. leaving at such a crucial point, it not only deprives Afghan forces of the support they need, particularly the air power, but also affects their morale. Soldiers I’ve talked to are under extreme pressure and dread the prospects of fighting without the support of their American allies,” Ms. Kumar said. But all is not lost for the Afghan government, which has hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting for it and has backing in urban centres. Much would depend on the policy Joe Biden, the President-Elect of the U.S., would take towards Afghanistan and the outcome of the peace talks. Mr. Biden has said his administration would withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan in his first term, which ends in early 2025. NATO has also committed to funding Afghan troops for four more years. “The good news is that in spite of the challenges, both sides (the government representatives and the Taliban) remain at the negotiating table, and appear to have reached an early breakthrough,” said Mr. Watkins, referring to the initial agreement to include the U.S.-Taliban deal in the talks. “The incoming U.S. administration has pledged to undertake any further military withdrawal “responsibly”, and in spite of the uncertainty, this may be a key moment for the peace process to reset and regain momentum.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/with-us-drawing-down-troops-whats-next-for-afghanistan/article33173473.ece
25 November 2020||Islamabad,||ISI chief-led panel to oversee 2 dozen spy agencies in Pakistan||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has approved the setting up of the National Intelligence Coordination Committee (NICC), a mechanism to coordinate over two dozen intelligence organisations in the country, to be headed by the ISI chief, according to a media report on Tuesday. Although there have been discussions about the establishment of the coordination forum, its terms of reference and modus operandi would be decided once it formally takes shape, Dawn newspaper quoted a senior security source as saying. The new body would be led by the director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), who would function as its chairman, it said. The intelligence agencies have had at least two rounds of discussions on the issue after which the proposal was submitted to the Prime Minister for approval. It is expected that the first meeting of the coordination body could be held as early as next week. The NICC would serve as a mechanism to coordinate over the two dozen intelligence organisations in the country. National Counter Terrorism Authority would also be part of the new structure. The move is part of the long-awaited reform of the intelligence apparatus, which aims at clarifying the role of respective agencies, improving their coordination and optimising their capabilities, the report said. Collective strategy One of the lessons learnt by the country during the fight against terrorism was that effective intelligence coordination was the weakest link in the entire effort. It importantly resulted in the loss of critical time and in some cases, the agencies even could not piece together the information available to them. It was, moreover, a major hurdle to collective strategising, the report said. A leaked version of the Abbottabad Commission’s report had revealed that the commission, while noting the absence of civil-military intelligence coordination mechanism, too had proposed establishment of an agency on the lines of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to synergise the working of main spy agencies in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/isi-chief-led-panel-to-oversee-2-dozen-spy-agencies-in-pakistan/article33173470.ece

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Say ‘no’ to corporate houses in Indian banking||An Internal Working Group of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that corporate houses be given bank licences (https://bit.ly/3fqoLlo). In today’s pro-business climate, you would have thought the proposal would evoke jubilation. It should have been hailed as another ‘big bang’ reform that would help undo the dominance of the public sector in banking. Instead, the reaction has ranged from cautious welcome to scathing criticism. Many analysts doubt the proposal will fly. It is worth examining why. First, the idea The idea of allowing corporate houses into banking is by no means novel. In February 2013, the RBI had issued guidelines that permitted corporate and industrial houses to apply for a banking licence. Some houses applied, although a few withdrew their applications subsequently. No corporate was ultimately given a bank licence. Only two entities qualified for a licence, IDFC and Bandhan Financial Services. The RBI maintained that it was open to letting in corporates. However, none of the applicants had met ‘fit and proper’ criteria. The IWG report quotes the official RBI position on the subject at the time. “At a time when there is public concern about governance, and when it comes to licences for entities that are intimately trusted by the Indian public, this (not giving a license to any corporate house) may well be the most appropriate stance.” In 2014, the RBI restored the long-standing prohibition on the entry of corporate houses into banking. The RBI Governor then was Raghuram G. Rajan. Mr. Rajan had headed the Committee on Financial Sector Reforms (2008). The Committee had set its face against the entry of corporate houses into banking. It had observed, “The Committee also believes it is premature to allow industrial houses to own banks. This prohibition on the ‘banking and commerce’ combine still exists in the United States today, and is certainly necessary in India till private governance and regulatory capacity improve. (https://bit.ly/3ftp7Yf)” The RBI’s position on the subject has remained unchanged since 2014. The worry is the risks What would be the rationale for any reversal in the position now? The Internal Working Group report weighs the pros and cons of letting in corporate houses. Corporate houses will bring capital and expertise to banking. Moreover, not many jurisdictions worldwide bar corporate houses from banking. It is the downside risks that are worrying in the extreme. As the report notes, the main concerns are interconnected lending, concentration of economic power and exposure of the safety net provided to banks (through guarantee of deposits) to commercial sectors of the economy. It is worth elaborating on these risks. Corporate houses can easily turn banks into a source of funds for their own businesses. In addition, they can ensure that funds are directed to their cronies. They can use banks to provide finance to customers and suppliers of their businesses. Adding a bank to a corporate house thus means an increase in concentration of economic power. Just as politicians have used banks to further their political interests, so also will corporate houses be tempted to use banks set up by them to enhance their clout. Not least, banks owned by corporate houses will be exposed to the risks of the non-bank entities of the group. If the non-bank entities get into trouble, sentiment about the bank owned by the corporate house is bound to be impacted. Depositors may have to be rescued through the use of the public safety net. The Internal Working Group believes that before corporate houses are allowed to enter banking, the RBI must be equipped with a legal framework to deal with interconnected lending and a mechanism to effectively supervise conglomerates that venture into banking. It is naive to suppose that any legal framework and supervisory mechanism will be adequate to deal with the risks of interconnected lending in the Indian context. Corporate houses are adept at routing funds through a maze of entities in India and abroad. Tracing interconnected lending will be a challenge. Monitoring of transactions of corporate houses will require the cooperation of various law enforcement agencies. Corporate houses can use their political clout to thwart such cooperation. Second, the RBI can only react to interconnected lending ex-post, that is, after substantial exposure to the entities of the corporate house has happened. It is unlikely to be able to prevent such exposure. Third, suppose the RBI does latch on to interconnected lending. How is the RBI to react? Any action that the RBI may take in response could cause a flight of deposits from the bank concerned and precipitate its failure. The challenges posed by interconnected lending are truly formidable. Regulator credibility at stake Fourth, pitting the regulator against powerful corporate houses could end up damaging the regulator. The regulator would be under enormous pressure to compromise on regulation. Its credibility would be dented in the process. This would indeed be a tragedy given the stature the RBI enjoys today. What we have discussed so far is the entry of corporate houses that do not have interests in the financial sector. There are corporate houses that are already present in banking-related activities through ownership of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). Under the present policy, NBFCs with a successful track record of 10 years are allowed to convert themselves into banks. The Internal Working Group believes that NBFCs owned by corporate houses should be eligible for such conversion. This promises to be an easier route for the entry of corporate houses into banking. The Internal Working Group argues that corporate-owned NBFCs have been regulated for a while. The RBI understands them well. Hence, some of the concerns regarding the entry of these corporates into banking may get mitigated. This is being disingenuous. There is a world of difference between a corporate house owning an NBFC and one owning a bank. Bank ownership provides access to a public safety net whereas NBFC ownership does not. The reach and clout that bank ownership provides are vastly superior to that of an NBFC. The objections that apply to a corporate house with no presence in bank-like activities are equally applicable to corporate houses that own NBFCs. It points to privatisation There is another aspect to the proposal that cannot be ignored. Corporate houses are unlikely to be enthused merely by the idea of growing a bank on their own. The real attraction will be the possibility of acquiring public sector banks, whose valuations have been battered in recent years. Public sector banks need capital that the government is unable to provide. The entry of corporate houses, if it happens at all, is thus likely to be a prelude to privatisation. Given what we know of governance in the Indian corporate world, any sale of public sector banks to corporate houses would raise serious concerns about financial stability. India’s banking sector needs reform but corporate houses owning banks hardly qualifies as one.

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The migrant worker as a ghost among citizens||When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the world’s most stringent lockdown on March 24, 2020 with barely four hours notice, lakhs of migrant workers across the country found themselves trapped in a novel situation: their livelihood in the city was gone, but they could not return to their native villages. The lockdown offered them only two options: starvation or charity. It was merely a matter of time before they pursued the third option: an arduous walk to their homes hundreds of kilometres away, risking starvation and death. Many did die in transit. India is not the only country to have witnessed lockdown-related governance failures. But it stands alone for the sheer magnitude of the humanitarian tragedy unleashed by a poorly conceived lockdown. It was as if the nation’s top decision makers had no idea that migrant workers existed. Perhaps this is not as far-fetched as it may seem. If we assume that a government makes policies keeping in mind the interests of its citizens, then the question to ask would be: are migrant workers in India full citizens? Or are they half-citizens at best, tolerated only because cities and industries need cheap labour? A new publication, Citizens and the Sovereign: Stories from the Largest Human Exodus in Contemporary Indian History , brought out by Migrant Workers Solidarity Network (MWSN), a collective of workers’ groups and non-governmental organisations (https://bit.ly/3nRqnHF and https://bit.ly/2J5Mrzg), explores these questions through the personal experiences of migrant workers. It contends that the avoidable misery they endured during the lockdown was not an anomaly but an effect of their implicit exclusion from full citizenship.  Quarantine without ‘home’ Take, for instance, the story of Gulab and Sukhlal, two migrant workers from Delhi. The couple was forced to travel 500 kilometres to Lamgara tehsil in Rajasthan with three children and all their belongings to do ‘home quarantine’ — in a home that did not exist. Lada, another worker from Delhi, went home to her parents in Rajiyawas, Rajasthan, only to find that their basti alone did not — and will not — get any form of relief because, as per government records, it does not exist. Lada is a Sansi, while Gulab and Sukhlal are Babarias — all three belong to nomadic tribes. Gulab and Sukhlal have mostly practised the tradition of shifting settlements and do not have a permanent home. “It seems the lockdown had not planned for ‘nomads’. All ten crore of them,” observes the report. “ Their settlements and belongings do not exist enough to exist on paper. They live lives which are too invisible to have rights or its poor substitute, relief. They are ghosts among citizens.” Mere existence, sans cognition by the gaze of the state apparatus, is no longer a sufficient condition of being. Nomadic tribes are the quintessential migrant community. The Indian state’s governance structure for nomadic tribes is determined by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, which upholds the colonial legacy of treating them either as threat or nuisance, while erasing their rights as citizens. This state of ‘non-being’ that marks the political existence of nomadic tribes extends to India’s 5.6 crore migrant workers (2011 Census), who may as well not have existed for the policymakers behind India’s lockdown. The report suggests that the most fitting comparison for India’s lockdown is not with those implemented by other countries but one from its own past: the Bubonic Plague of 1896 and the draconian measures implemented under the then newly minted Epidemic Diseases, Act, 1897. Section 4 of this Act grants “Protection to persons acting under Act. No suit or other legal proceeding shall lie against any person for anything done or in good faith intended to be done under this Act.” More than 120 years later, policemen protected by this legislation would brutally assault desperate migrants for trying to walk home. Even for the ‘independent’ Indian state — a democracy where the citizen is supposed to be the sovereign — migrant workers seem to trigger the same repressive impulses that the ‘uncouth’ natives did for the colonial state. The despotic interventions of the colonial British administration sparked some of the processes that led to the transformation of the natives into “the people,” leading eventually to the formation of a new national sovereign in 1947. The National Democratic Alliance government’s lockdown too sparked several protests, which this report documents with a ‘Migrant Resistance Map’ (https://bit.ly/2UXI4Ja), but systemic changes in the way migrant workers live and work seem remote for now. Bridging social distance A cartoon that went viral during the lockdown captured the anomalous position of the migrant worker in the metropolis. It depicts a street on which families of migrant workers, with their belongings tied up in cloth bundles, are seen trudging past. On either side of the street, at a safe height from this tired procession, people in balconies are seen cheering, clapping and chanting, “Go, corona, go.” The cartoon is titled ‘social distancing’. The challenge, then, is to bridge the social distance between migrant workers and the rest of urban society, including the ruling elites. As the report observes, “A large portion of lowly paid labouring population of our country have historically come from Adivasi, Dalit and socially oppressed castes as well as religious minorities.” This is an important aspect of the reproduction of both caste and capital in India. So, if our cities are organised on a foundation of unorganised labour, and if the very process of claiming entitlements as citizens — such as decent pay, housing, and social protection — requires migrant workers to get organised, then it would seem that structural forces militate against it. That the new labour codes make it nearly impossible to unionise is a case in point. The active production of migrant labour (from worsening terms of trade for agriculture, displacement from land and forests) and their invisibilised exploitation (in low paid wage work in cities and industrial clusters) are two parallel processes that feed into each other. Urban life in India, as in many developing economies hungry for growth, is premised on a toxic equilibrium generated by these two processes. This has been the case for some decades now. The lockdown caused a violent disturbance of this equilibrium. The migrant worker bore the brunt. sampath.g@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-migrant-worker-as-a-ghost-among-citizens/article33173452.ece
25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Daring to love beyond societal limits||‘Love jihad’ has slipped effortlessly into our public vocabulary, as if it were a social truism. The term is taken to refer to a deliberate campaign that uses love, seduction and trickery to convert Hindu (and Christian) women to Islam. It is claimed that money and planning are invested in such a venture, with Muslim youth being groomed — provided with mobile phones, dark glasses, and a pair of jeans — to be attractive to Hindu women. Once ‘caught’, it is alleged, Hindu women end up converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men. Investigations into Hindu-Muslim marriages that appeared to have taken place under ‘suspicious’ circumstances have shown many of these to be consensual. Both the police and the courts have admitted to as much, in Karnataka and Kerala. But such admissions and findings have not deterred those who insist that ‘jihadists’ are on the prowl, and are looking to deceive foolish and trusting Hindu women. There are repeated assertions to this effect, ‘discoveries’ of Hindu-Muslim sexual liaisons, subsequent filing of complaints, and investigations. An imagined threat is thus actualised, in law and through governance. And, thus, ‘love jihad’ assumes a life of its own. ‘Retrieving’ lost Hindu manhood Invoking a ‘love jihad’ where none exists has to do with a history of Hindu beleaguerment. As historian Charu Gupta has demonstrated, since the 1920s, upper caste Hindu thinkers, men of god and political leaders, especially those associated with the Arya Samaj, Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, have expressed indignation and resentment against centuries of Muslim rule, and blamed the loss of Hindu ‘manliness’ for allowing such rule in the first place. In order to ‘retrieve’ lost Hindu manhood, they advocated a robust physical culture for Hindu youth, and also warned Hindu men to not let their women go astray. Thus, Hindu men from all castes, including subaltern ones, were enjoined to be watchful and guard their women against Muslim predators, even as women were told to keep themselves ‘pure’ in order that they might be fit mothers of the nation. The idea was to build a grand, national brotherhood of Hindu men from all castes: shared trepidation over Muslim sexual prowess and mistrust of Hindu women’s ability to know what was good for them formed the basis for this putative national community. Today we are witness to a similar phenomenon. Once again, Hindus are asked to step up and do their duty by their faith. The fundamental difference though is that such an entreaty comes from a position of brute power, but its core content remains the same. While all of this is appalling, the invocation of ‘love jihad’ secures social traction because it repeats and builds on tried and tiresome sexual rhetoric which is commonplace in caste society. Lawlessness sanctified as custom Women are often warned of unsuitable men (read: from castes below their own, or from other religions) who shall try and woo them, and are urged to marry within designated limits of caste and community; whereas men are told who they could sexually possess (all women, but in particular those over whom they exercise caste and class authority), and who they ought to legitimately marry. These warnings come with threats of punitive action, often directed against ‘erring’ women who choose to be with men from castes ‘below’ their own, and against Dalit men who ‘dare’ love and marry women from castes placed ‘above’ them. No law of the land endorses these arrangements, but as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar pointed out, the law notwithstanding, lawlessness, sanctified as custom and tradition, stalks the land, and influences not only civic behaviour, but also the administration, including the judicial system. Unsurprisingly, when young persons across caste lines choose to leave home and marry, they are ‘advised’ by officialdom to be mindful of family and community honour and sentiments. Women, especially, are berated, lectured, and separated from those they have chosen to be with, and ‘restored’ to their natal homes. Warnings In a culture that routinely infantilises women or views them as foolish and incapable of rational choice, this is to be expected. From family to kin to khap to caste, women are constantly told what to do, and how to comport themselves, and to ensure that they are not like ‘other’, ‘promiscuous’ women from castes and communities that are socially and culturally ‘low’. Meanwhile, these ‘lower’ caste women are warned that they ought not to step beyond limits ordained for them: not educate themselves, protest the social and economic conditions of their existence, and that if they do, they stand to be punished. Studies of violence against Dalit and Adivasi women indicate that protesting women and those who dare to be different are earmarked for acts of abuse and violence. Bad enough that caste society is sustained by puerile fears to do with transgressive love, which sadly enough are also internalised by women, who then strive hard to be ‘good’ and proclaim their caste honour. But to have parts of a nation get phobic over women’s alleged lack of emotional judgment and the alleged chicanery of Muslims is worse and civilisationally pathetic. While we stake our rights to lives and loves of our choice, equally, we might want to assert our right to re-imagine this nation, not in terms of faith and caste, but in ways we have learned from anti-caste and feminist traditions — where the nation is essentially an equal, just and fraternal society.

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Love in the time of Hindutva||The season of ‘love jihad’ is back. It never really goes away but resurfaces — every time with more frequency and vitriol — after periods of hibernation. ‘Love jihad’ emerged from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) laboratories in Kerala but only found its voice and a scope for destruction in the north under the gaze of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. But following him closely in this latest season are ministers from Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, and Assam. The U.P. Chief Minister had, in the past, toyed with anti-Romeo squads employing a similar rhetoric of ‘saving’ women from the unwelcome gaze of men but ‘love jihad’ additionally offers endless possibilities where anti-Muslim rhetoric is concerned. Mr. Adityanath is by no means alone. Bharatiya Janata Party leaders across the country are agonising about daughters and sisters who are apparently defenceless against ‘sensuous’ Muslim men, although these women may not care for such filial connections. Rhetoric of shame and pity The campaign builds on the ground prepared by the formerly potent khap panchayats, which had popularised that idea that women who seek consensual relationships must have been lured, tricked or duped. The only other alternative, in the eyes of influential khap leaders like Mahendra Tikait, was lack of shame since “only whores choose their partners.” ‘Love jihad’ weaponises this toxic rhetoric of shame and pity for women who seek to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed rights but also brings RSS’s years of experience and dedicated cadre into the picture. Unlike khap panchayats which were seen by the mainstream as localised power centres representing a distant, barbaric and medieval India, the anti-‘love jihad’ campaign is actually mainstream. However, those eager to punish men who enter perfectly legal and consensual relationships might be getting short-changed by forthcoming laws. According to Justice (Retired) Aditya Nath Mittal, Chairperson of the U.P. State Law Commission, his 2019 report that proposes a regulation on religious conversions does not mention ‘love jihad’ nor restricts the scope of conversions to just Hindu-Muslim relationships. In an interview with The Hindu , Justice Mittal admitted that the scope is purposefully broad since a limited scope legislation will not stand in law. Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, meanwhile, are taking cues from Himachal Pradesh, the only State with an existing law that ostensibly curbs ‘love jihad’. This Freedom of Religion Act also does not refer to any religion in particular. It mandates, however, that those who wish to convert notify the district authorities at least one month in advance. As recent Allahabad High Court judgments show, the curtailment of marriages that follow conversions may not be restricted to the conversion of Hindu women. What is clear, however, is that courts also appear very concerned about the faith of women who choose to convert in order to marry a loved one. The High Court posed the following question as part of a 2014 judgment, Noor Jahan Begum v. State of U.P. , that considered the affidavits of five couples who sought protection after consensual marriages: “Whether conversion of religion of a Hindu girl at the instance of a Muslim boy, without any knowledge of Islam or faith and belief in Islam and merely for the purpose of Marriage (Nikah) is valid?” Although Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani admitted that it is difficult if not impossible to define or delimit the expression of religion, he held that it is a matter of personal faith, one that must stem from “the depth of the heart and mind”. Justice Kesarwani was ostensibly privy to the ‘depths of the hearts and minds’ of not one but five women whose fates he ruled on that day. What is significant is that Justice Kesarwani had, as part of this order, dismissed petitions for protection and non-interference in married life and not pleas that sought a court statement on the validity of marriages. Whether the existing laws and the ones State governments claim they will legislate hold such marriages null and void does not automatically strip women of their right to co-habit with men they love. A question judges and State governments may well ask at this point is not ‘what is religion’ but rather, ‘what is marriage’? In Salamat Ansari v. State of U.P. , the High Court addressed this aspect while also critiquing its own past judgments as “not laying good law” since the task before the court was simply to ascertain “the wish and desire of the girls”. Justices Pankaj Naqvi and Vivek Agarwal remarked that they do not see the petitioners as Hindu and Muslim, “rather as two grown-up individuals who out of their own free will and choice are living together peacefully and happily over a year.” Facilitating marriages If conversion is used as a convenient means to marry a partner who belongs to a different faith, the primary offender here may well be State governments and bureaucracies. While bureaucracies make the procedures for solemnising marriages under the Special Marriage Act difficult for both inter-faith and intra-faith couples, governments at times step in to further complicate the process. In 2018, when Justice Rajiv Narain Raina struck down the Haryana government’s ‘court marriage checklist’, he urged the state to facilitate rather than obstruct marriages. He said: “The State is not concerned with the marriage itself but with the procedure it adopts, which must reflect the mind-set of the changed times in a secular nation promoting inter-religion marriages instead of the officialdom raising eyebrows and laying snares and land mines beneath the sacrosanct feet of the Special Marriage Act …” Justice Raina said that India is a secular nation as if in a direct, defiant response to campaigns such as ‘love jihad’ and ruled that the state’s role in marriage does not pertain to its validity. Ultimately, whether the laws are broad in scope or not may be relevant in individual courts and for individual judges but, constitutionally, it is still not the state’s mandate to decide which relationships are acceptable and permissible. Transforming this reality may well be the endgame.

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||With land rights, but no land||Tribal politics in the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir was focused on the twin issues of political reservation and enactment/extension of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006. Mainstream political parties, which are now arguing for these rights for the Adivasis in J&K, failed to provide them these rights when they were in power for years. This failure continues to aggravate the problems of the Adivasis in J&K who were provided reservations in jobs, but no political reservation though this was constitutionally mandated. It is this lack of political reservation that has been a major reason for their marginalisation. The Adivasis have had to largely depend on non-tribal leadership to represent their issues and demands. Lack of political reservation meant that their issues were never adequately represented in the Legislative Assembly. The vote share of Adivasis is a major deciding factor in almost 21 Assembly constituencies, yet they remain politically marginalised. After the abrogation of J&K’s special status, there was no delay in providing political reservation for the Adivasis. Its actual impact will be seen only after elections are conducted for the Legislative Assembly of the Union Territory of J&K. However, similar urgency wasn’t shown in the extension of the FRA to J&K after the abrogation of special status though many other Central laws were extended to the Union Territory. More evictions In fact, the FRA should have been in place in J&K long time ago — nothing in Article 370 prevented the Legislative Assembly from enacting a similar law. Adivasi lands have not been protected, nor have these communities been given ownership rights. Instead, evictions of Adivasis have intensified in the last few years. The FRA would have provided Adivasis in J&K access and ownership rights, forest-based livelihood rights, and minor forest produce rights. Adivasis, especially nomads, have neither land rights nor rehabilitation rights. The J&K government has now decided to implement the FRA. On November 18, the J&K Chief Secretary reviewed the implementation of the FRA. It has been decided that the survey of claimants by the forest rights committees for assessing the nature and extent of rights being claimed at the village-level would be completed by January 15, 2021. Subsequently, the claims would be scrutinised by the sub-divisional committees, which will then prepare a record of forest rights by or before January 31, 2021. District-Level Committees will give the final approval and grant forest rights by March 1, 2021. Proving ownership Implementing the FRA is a welcome step. However, instead of alleviating fears of displacement and disempowerment, the law has only increased those fears. This is primarily because this is happening against the backdrop of the J&K government’s decision on October 31 to declare the State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001, also known as the Roshni Act, null and void. This Act has been controversial due to the questionable transfer of ownership of state land to many influential people, including Ministers, legislators, bureaucrats, and police officers. Some say that it provided ownership rights to many poor, landless Adivasis as well; now the land will be retrieved from them. In such a scenario, the Adivasis will fail to prove their claims of ownership under the FRA. Further, in the last few weeks, the eviction and demolition drives against nomads have intensified without any rehabilitation plans in place. The FRA, then, is unlikely to benefit such poor, landless Adivasis. In the rest of India, the FRA provided and recognised the forest rights of forest dwellers who had occupied forest land before December 13, 2005. No such cut-off date has been mentioned in the case of J&K. Without a cut-off date, with land being retrieved after declaring the Roshni Act null and void, and with forceful evictions taking place, many tribal families are unlikely to benefit from the implementation of the FRA.

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Diplomatic offensive||With more details coming in of a planned terror strike in Jammu and Kashmir by four men, believed to be members of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed, who were gunned down by security forces last week, and the discovery of a tunnel in the Samba sector from where the men are supposed to have infiltrated into India, the government has decided to step up its diplomatic campaign to hold Pakistan accountable. On Monday, Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla briefed a select group of Ambassadors on the plot, which the government believes was planned on the same scale as last year’s Pulwama bombing that killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel, and timed for the anniversary of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The envoys were part of the first batch of diplomats being briefed. Indian missions have also been instructed to pass on details of the “information docket” handed over, which includes details of the encounter in Nagrota between the suspected terrorists hiding in a truck and security forces, as well as the AK-47 rifles, 29 grenades and 7.5 kg of RDX explosive material the men allegedly had. That this was no ordinary encounter was evidenced from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement, calling it a “nefarious attempt to target grassroots level democratic exercises in Jammu and Kashmir”, a reference to the District Development Council elections due to start on November 28. By apprising the international community, it would seem the government has a multi-pronged strategy. The first imperative is to ensure that the full implications of the aborted attack and what could have occurred are understood worldwide, and the threat India continues to face from cross-border terror is acknowledged. In addition, any actions India takes against terror threats the Army perceives along the LoC this point on will be considered retaliatory. The second is to put Pakistan, which has itself been making allegations about a terror threat from India, squarely on notice. Pakistan still faces the final FATF decision in February 2021 on whether it will be blacklisted for its inability to curb terror financing and to shut down groups such as the JeM and the LeT, and the Imran Khan government would be better positioned in fulfilling the action plan it has been tasked with rather than flashing unsubstantiated dossiers with counter-claims against India. However, the Modi government must also remember that invoking the international community can be a double-edged sword in its bilateral conflict with Pakistan, that could invite discomforting interventionary interest. Eventually, India’s success lies in protecting its borders, as done in Nagrota, and by providing a peaceful and stable environment in J&K so as to restart the much-delayed democratic process there, despite all attempts to derail it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/diplomatic-offensive/article33173444.ece

But the strong reactions to an internal panel’s report on November 20, almost a full month since the group of central bank officials had submitted their recommendations on October 26, come as no surprise. The panel, which was tasked with reviewing ownership norms and corporate structure for private sector banks, has made worthwhile suggestions including ways to harmonise licensing norms for all banks including older legacy lenders and newer entrants. While the panel’s appointment in June — at a time when the country was in the throes of coping with the severe economic fallout of the COVID-19 lockdown — got little attention, its suggestion that corporate or industrial houses be allowed to promote banks has triggered widespread concern. And among those with reservations are at least three former senior central bankers and a global credit rating agency. Most intriguing is that the panel, which consulted with experts ranging from former RBI officials to legal and finance professionals, clearly acknowledges that all but one of these outside experts were unequivocal in their opinion that given the prevailing far-from-ideal corporate governance culture, corporates ought to be barred from promoting banks. The difficulty in ring-fencing “the non-financial activities of the promoters with that of the bank”, was flagged by these experts as the central concern, a fear that was echoed by S&P Global Ratings too. Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and former Deputy Governor Viral Acharya — who was appointed by the Modi government after Mr. Rajan had left the central bank — in a joint article on LinkedIn have termed the proposal a ‘bad idea’ and questioned its rationale. Acknowledging the RBI group’s caveats including its assertion that corporates only be allowed as promoters after “necessary amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949” are enacted to safeguard against connected lending, the two economists have, however, pointed to the bailouts of Yes Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank as examples of the heightened risk posed by any move to loosen bank licensing norms. For all its regulatory powers and supervisory capabilities, the RBI failed to spot the build-up of troubled exposures at Yes Bank in time. The dangers posed to overall financial stability by letting industrial houses have access to relatively inexpensive capital in the form of household savings through banks, howsoever legally regulated, are far too great to risk at the altar of liberalisation of ownership norms. The RBI’s decision makers need to reject this suggestion outright and place it where it belongs — the shelf.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/dangerous-suggestion/article33173445.ece

25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Govt. orders ‘priority’ for local tenders||The government has tightened its procurement norms to make it tougher for Ministries to pursue global tenders for contracts worth up to Rs. 200 crore. Under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan announced in May, the government had barred departments from issuing global tenders for contracts worth Rs. 200 crore or less. The General Financial Rules were amended to disallow global tender enquiries in such procurement of goods and services, with an eye on boosting the prospects of domestic micro, small and medium enterprises. Any Ministry seeking an exemption to the norm, in order to call for a global tender enquiry, is required to seek the Cabinet Secretariat’s prior nod. So far, Ministries’ requests could be considered if they gave valid justification for the need to issue a global tender and the lack of alternatives within the country. Now, Ministries can no longer seek a nod for issuing a global tender unless they have first floated a domestic tender for their requirements, and tried to locate domestic producers in co-ordination with industry bodies, as per new rules issued by the Cabinet Secretariat and the Finance Ministry over the past week. Moreover, departments also cannot submit exemption proposals unless they have first published their procurement plan for the next three and five years on their websites. Publishing such a procurement plan was mandated by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) in September through a Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) order. Exemption offered In an office memorandum, the Department of Expenditure has conveyed the Cabinet Secretariat’s instructions to Ministries and departments, stressing that domestic tenders need to be floated for all goods and services before a global tender could be considered. However, local tenders floated before May 15 this year, when the new procurement norms came into place, shall not count. ‘Discuss, send proposal’ “Ministries, departments are requested to discuss with DPIIT, relevant industrial bodies for identification of domestic manufacturers and service providers and send the details of such deliberations along with the proposal,” the memo stated. A blanket exemption to allow global tenders was recently granted for procurement of spare parts from foreign original equipment manufacturers after multiple departments and public sector firms raised concerns about the lack of domestic options.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-orders-priority-for-local-tenders/article33173434.ece

Multiple fast-paced indicators, including GST collections, had been showing a sharp recovery since October, which has also led many analysts to revise their overall GDP forecasts for the fiscal. “We caution that the spikes in production seen in the various sectors in October 2020, are an exaggeration of the true recovery on the ground, as they have been driven by a large component of pent-up demand that may not sustain after the festive period is over,” the agency’s principal economist Aditi Nayar said. The factors that need to be watched are the pace of government spending in the second half of the fiscal, after the unexpected contraction recorded in the September quarter, she added. The potential re-imposition of restrictions in one or more States on account of a fresh surge in COVID-19 infections may temper the momentum of recovery in the coming months, she warned. The agency said that available trends for early November suggested some moderation in these spikes. In October, 10 of the 17 high-frequency indicators tracked by the agency showed a pick-up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pent-up-demand-spurring-activity-may-not-sustain-icra/article33173440.ece
25 November 2020||HYDERABAD,||GAIL proposes Kondapalli-Tirupati natural gas pipeline||State-owned GAIL is planning a 450-km pipeline from Kondapalli, near Vijayawada, to Tirupati for supplying natural gas to industries and city gas distribution projects. Though the proposed infrastructure is for catering to consumers in Andhra Pradesh, the bi-directional pipeline, is expected to emerge as a crucial component of a larger natural gas pipeline network in the region, over time. Submitting an expression of interest for developing the pipeline to regulator PNGRB, the firm said the pipeline will originate from Kondapalli in KG Basin network in Andhra Pradesh and connect Amravathi, Narasaraopet, Podili and Tirupati. On natural gas sources for the pipeline, GAIL said ONGC had indicated additional HPHT gas availability at Odalrevu and Mallavaram in KG Basin. It counted the R Series gas from RIL field as well as other natural gas pipelines such as East West Pipeline, IOC’s Ennore-Bengaluru pipeline and RLNG terminal in Ennore, besides gas from other interconnected pipelines as sources. Pegging the potential gas demand en route at 4-5 MMSCMD, GAIL said the pipeline would have capacity of 4 MMSCMD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gail-proposes-kondapalli-tirupati-natural-gas-pipeline/article33173423.ece

The firm’s platform connects more than 70,000 highly-skilled freelancers with more than 3,000 companies worldwide. The research is based on 3,84,000 fee quotations and benchmarks collected from independent consultants. As per the study, the median fee earned by freelance consultants dropped by almost 25% between the first and second quarters, but started picking up Q3 onwards, slowly reaching pre-COVID-19 levels. In the FMCG industry, consultants were least impacted by the pandemic in terms of fees while in other industries, including professional services, pharma and education, there was a decrease of over 20% in the median compensation between the first and second quarters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/freelance-earnings-back-to-pre-covid-19-levels/article33173428.ece

The report tracks the movement of prime prices across 45 cities globally. The prime residential market of Mumbai, though expected to see a zero annual price change in 2021 (Dec.’20 — Dec. ’21), is likely to witness a buoyancy in demand for prime properties, the report said. Shanghai and Cape Town lead the forecast for 2021, with an annual price growth of 5% forecast in 2021, whereas Buenos Aires is expected to be the weakest-performing global city, with prime residential prices falling 8% in the same year, the report said. Knight Frank’s research analysis expects 20 of the 22 cities to see prices remain flat or increase in 2021, a slight reversal of the trend seen in 2020, where analysts expect nine cities to end the year with lower prices. ‘Luxury market moves’ “With the modest price correction in the Indian real estate sector, post-lockdown, the luxury market has seen significant traction,” Shishir Baijal, CMD, Knight Frank India, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/prime-global-residential-prices-may-rise-2-in-2021/article33173432.ece

25 November 2020||CHENNAI,||Vasudevan to head senior selection panel||S. Vasudevan will be the chairman of the fresh senior selection panel, constituted by the newly formed CAC of the TNCA. After a meeting here on Tuesday, the CAC settled on Vasudevan, the last captain from Tamil Nadu to triumph in the Ranji Trophy, as the selection committee chief. The left-arm spinning all-rounder led Tamil Nadu to Ranji triumph in 1987-88. Subsequently the team has come close without winning. A case of so near yet so far. Hopeful TNCA secretary R.S. Ramasaamy told The Hindu , “Vasudevan was the last captain to win us the Ranji Trophy. And S. Suresh [chairman of the CAC] took us twice to the Ranji Trophy final. Between them, we hope they will bring home the Ranji Trophy.” The CAC had requested the TNCA for additional documents so that any ‘conflict of interest’ could be avoided. More so since from this season, the job of a State selector will be a paid one. In the two changes in the panel, M. Senthilnathan makes way for Vasudevan as the chairman. Former Tamil Nadu wicket-keeper batsman T.R. Arasu, known for his quicksilver glovework and a counter-punching batsman down the order, comes in for left-arm spinner S. Ramkumar. Three selectors unchanged Former Tamil Nadu paceman K. Bharath Kumar, former State and Railways off-spinning all-rounder R. Venkatesh and former State batsman Tanveer Jabbar continue to keep their job. The panel will have its hands full in a domestic season, whose shape and form is still a matter of suspense.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vasudevan-to-head-senior-selection-panel/article33173571.ece
25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Chennaiyin picks up full points in a thriller against Jamshedpur||Chennaiyin FC prevailed 2-1 over Jamshedpur FC, in a thrilling, end-to-end contest, to get off the mark in the Indian Super League with three points in Vasco on Tuesday. Chennaiyin proved too strong and too quick on the night for its former boss Owen Coyle in the Jamshedpur dugout. New signing Esmael Goncalves scored a penalty and also played his part in the opening goal, which came in the first minute of the game. It was his low cross from the right which Anirudh Thapa, operating as a right-side midfielder in a diamond 4-4-2, fired into the net from inside the box. The 22-year-old became the first Indian goal-scorer of the season. After taking the lead, Chennaiyin looked comfortable playing on the break with skipper Rafael Crivellaro pulling the strings in the middle. In the 26th minute, Goncalves doubled the lead from a spot-kick after Issac Vanmalsawma’s foul on Lallianzuala Chhangte. Chennaiyin had four shots on target within the first 30 minutes, and it needed T.P. Rehenesh to stop Jamshedpur from falling further behind. Jamshedpur’s threat came down the flanks thanks to Chennaiyin’s narrow formation. Nerijus Valskis met Jackichand Singh’s cross with a leaping header to pull one back nine minutes before the break. That remained the only big chance that came his way as he struggled for service.  Chennaiyin could have added to its lead in the second half but a penalty shout went against striker Jakub Sylvestr. Chennaiyin goalkeeper Vishal Kaith offered a way back for Jamshedpur when he spilled the ball into the feet of Issac but luckily for him, Enes Sipovic cleared the effort off the goalline. Chennaiyin stood firm in the final stretch of the game to get Csaba Laszlo’s reign off to a winning start.  The result: Jamshedpur FC 1 (Nerijus Valskis 37) lost to Chennaiyin FC 2 (Anirudh Thapa 1, Esmael Goncalves 26) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chennaiyin-picks-up-full-points-in-a-thriller-against-jamshedpur/article33173542.ece
25 November 2020||LONDON,||Burnley posts first win of the season||Burnley won for the first time in the Premier League this season as Chris Wood sealed a 1-0 victory against Crystal Palace, while Southampton missed a chance to go third in its 1-1 draw at Wolverhampton on Monday. Burnley, which had failed to win any of its first seven games in the joint worst start to a season in the club’s history, was the only Premier League team yet to score a home goal this term until New Zealand striker Wood put it ahead in the eighth minute. That was enough to clinch a much-needed three points for Burnley, which climbed out of the relegation zone at the expense of Fulham. At Molineux, Southampton took the lead in the 58th minute, with a touch of controversy about the goal. Barge unpunished Wolves were frustrated that Stuart Armstrong’s barge into Rayan Ait-Nouri went unpunished in the build-up before Che Adams sent a low cross to the unmarked Walcott, who slotted home from close-range. It was the 31-year-old’s first goal for Southampton since rejoining it on loan from Everton in October. But Pedro Neto came off the bench to equalise as fifth-placed Southampton had to settle for extending its unbeaten run to seven matches. Athletic Bilbao comfortably defeated Real Betis 4-0 to move further away from the relegation zone in the Spanish league. The result moved Athletic to eighth place. It was just two points above the relegation zone entering the match. Manuel Pellegrini’s Betis also is in mid-table, though it has played one game more than Athletic. Real Sociedad leads the league with 23 points, three more than second-placed Atletico Madrid, which has two games in hand.  The results:   Premier League: Burnley 1 (Wood 8) bt Crystal Palace 0; Wolves 1 (Neto 75) drew with Southampton 1 (Walcott 58).   LaLiga: Athletic Bilbao 4 (Victor Ruiz 9-og, Capa 33, Muniain 59, Berenguer 68) bt Real Betis 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/first-win-for-burnley/article33173572.ece
25 November 2020||Sydney,||Last year’s Test series loss still hurts Paine||Test captain Tim Paine has admitted the “annoying” Test series defeat to India still “grinds” him, adding that Australia now has a better all-round side which is pumped up to take on the holder of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. India stunned Australia 2-1 to win its maiden Test series Down Under in 2018-19, which was Paine’s first assignment as skipper on home soil. The wicketkeeper-batsman was given charge of the Baggy Greens after the 2018 ball-tampering incident that saw then skipper Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner being slapped with year-long bans. Paine told 2GB’s Wide World of Sports radio: “Whether we had Steve and David or not you don’t want to be losing any Test matches or Test series you’re involved in, so that still grinds me a little bit,” Paine said. Clarke’s take Meanwhile, former Australia captain Michael Clarke has warned that India could be “smoked 4-0” in the Test series if skipper Virat Kohli does not set the tone in the white-ball games before his departure. “These one-dayers and Twenty20s is where Virat Kohli can really stand up and lead from the front,” Clarke said on Sky Sports Radio on Tuesday. “If India don’t have success in the ODIs and T20s, they are in deep trouble in the Test matches and they’ll get smoked 4-0, in my opinion,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/last-years-test-series-loss-still-hurts-paine/article33173536.ece
25 November 2020||Milan,||Like a final, says Antonio Conte||Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan takes on Real Madrid in Wednesday’s Champions League clash in a game the coach describes as “like a final” with both sides needing a win. “For us it represents a final, after the defeat in Madrid and the two previous draws there are not many solutions,” Conte told a pre-match press conference at the San Siro. “We have no escape, we have to win. And we know, after the first leg, that if we want we can win.” Bottom of group The Italians are bottom of Group B after losing 3-2 in Spain, despite coming from two goals down to equalise before Real snatched victory. Real Madrid, the record 13-time European champion, is third with four points after three games. “It will be a very difficult match, we know what Real Madrid are, their history, even recent in this competition,” continued Conte. Not decisive The clash between Conte and his former Juventus teammate Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid will not be decisive. But after drawing against Borussia Monchengladbach and Shakhtar Donetsk, another defeat would push Inter towards a third consecutive elimination at the group stage. “To qualify we need seven points, maybe nine,” added Conte. Real lost at home to Shakhtar, and drew against Monchengladbach. The Spanish giants have never failed to advance past the group phase in 24 consecutive editions since 1997. Zidane will be without two of the three scorers from the home leg, Sergio Ramos and Karim Benzema, both injured, with Luka Jovic and Eder Militao out with COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/like-a-final-says-antonio-conte/article33173763.ece

25 November 2020||MUMBAI,||Rohit and Ishant unlikely to join Indian contingent||Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma are extremely unlikely to join India’s team for the four-Test series in Australia, starting December 17. The duo, after breaking down during the Indian Premier League in the United Arab Emirates, has been undergoing rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. While Ishant returned to India midway through the IPL after tearing an abdominal muscle, Rohit stayed back after a hamstring tear and even returned to lead Mumbai Indians for its fifth title despite being ruled out of the limited overs’ leg Down Under. According to a BCCI insider, the duo is “all but ruled out” considering Ishant’s “lack of match practice” and Rohit’s “recovery [being] slower than expected”. According to a member of India’s contingent in Australia, it will be “a miracle if both of them join the squad”. Time constraints  The Hindu understands that Ishant, despite having resumed bowling at NCA under the watchful eyes of NCA head Rahul Dravid, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey along with the medical staff, would be ready to bowl at full tilt only by mid-December. Similarly, Rohit’s injury “may heal” by then. Even if they leave for Australia around mid-December, it would leave them little or no time to reach Australia, serve the mandatory hard quarantine for 14 days, and then train and be match-ready in the middle of the series. India head coach Ravi Shastri also hinted the same during a radio interview with Australian Broadcasting Corporation. While Ishant has taken all due precautions, the manner in which Rohit’s injury rehab has been handled has posed serious questions on the BCCI’s injury management mechanism and a senior cricketer’s preference to IPL over international cricket.  It is understood that the medical report that was presented to the national selectors on October 26 had stated Rohit won’t be available for India selection “at least for three weeks”. Soon after the selectors didn’t consider him for the limited overs’ leg, which begins on Friday, Rohit returned to the field for Mumbai Indians on November 3, and played a match-winning knock in the final on November 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohit-and-ishant-unlikely-to-join-indian-contingent/article33173545.ece
25 November 2020||Chennai,||Regaining the Ranji Trophy is top priority: Vasudevan||The first act by the CAC — to name S. Vasudevan as the senior selection panel chief — was perhaps a master-stroke. Someone not belonging to any camp and without any agenda, Vasudevan is a highly respected former State and South Zone cricketer, both for the quality of his cricket and equanimity on the field of play. A natural in every sense of the term, Vasudevan was a potent left-arm spinner with an easy action and a vicious arm ball. His 214 wickets came in 61 first class games at 24.38. He was a lower order batsman with the gift of timing and could pluck the most difficult of catches in the slip cordon. It was fitting he captained Tamil Nadu to Ranji triumph in 1987-88; his style of leading the team was inclusive and he could be firm without being harsh. Vasudevan, now 64, was pleased with the faith shown in him by the CAC. He told The Hindu , “Regaining the Ranji Trophy is top priority. We have been doing well in the other formats but Ranji Trophy has been elusive. Collective effort needed “We have the talent. We have cricketers who have either played for India or are on the fringes. What we require is a collective effort.” Winning the big moments was critical, Vasudevan felt. “We need cricketers with mental strength. We have to identify players who will perform when the side is 50 for five. We need cricketers with discipline, dedication and total commitment to Tamil Nadu cricket.” Vasudevan planned to visit the ongoing camp for the Tamil Nadu probables. “They would be playing against each other in practice matches and that could provide us with clues.” Interestingly, State coach D. Vasu was in the squad when the Vasudevan-led Tamil Nadu side won the Ranji Trophy. “I know Vasu well. He was in my team although he did not play in the final. He was promising then.” Vasudevan signed off saying: “There is no reason we cannot regain the Ranji Trophy. It has to be a total team effort.”  We have cricketers who have either played for India or are on the fringes.

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||A fan’s travelogue & a historian’s clarifications||We who write on cricket do so without envy. That’s a lovely line from Ramachandra Guha, who characterised himself as an off-spinner who seldom turned the ball and batted at number ten or eleven. It meant that, to quote from his Spin and Other Turns , “I have gloried unashamedly in the achievement (of others).” To fail at art or politics is “to embitter one for life; to fail on the cricket field is to marvel at those who don’t.” We owe the cricketing gods a debt for ensuring that Guha was but a modest player. It made him an outstanding writer.  The Commonwealth of Cricket, Guha’s latest, is remarkable on at least two counts: the historian and private man talks about his family, and secondly, the book moves between Pollyanna and Diogenes. About four-fifths is full of joy and cheer and optimism, a fan’s travelogue. A fifth deals with murkiness in the administration. When Guha became a Supreme Court-appointed administrator, I told my wife that we might lose a romantic, but Indian cricket might have found a saviour. In the event, neither came to pass.  The Commonwealth shows the romantic is alive, and that’s a blessing; you can read it as a return to a briefly interrupted love affair. Sadly, Indian cricket is back to being run by the old compromisers or their relatives.  Some of the saddest portions of the book detail how the hopes were dashed, as much by politicians in power as by Guha’s colleagues in the administration who chose to remain silent. Guha writes about this with engaging honesty, conscious of serving a higher cause, the historian setting the record straight. Too nervous Speaking of the reaction of the CoA to yet another BCCI shenanigan, Guha says, “I urged our chairman, Vinod Rai to issue a public statement saying this was illegal, but he was too nervous to do so. His silence emboldened the Old Guard further.” Guha explains how the BCCI plied Rai and others with photo-ops with Indian cricket’s superstars, “further defanging our committee.” Publicity, writes Guha, “had got to my colleagues.” Guha’s uprightness and the realisation he could not continue in a committee that was increasingly beginning to function like the BCCI itself, led to his stepping down. His resignation letter was a model of restraint and distress. Guha details how pointing out their violations of the conflict of interest code turned Sunil Gavaskar and Rahul Dravid against him. And also the interesting ways in which the bridges were later rebuilt. Lifelong love affair I don’t know if The Commonwealth is a way of saying farewell to writing about the game. One hopes not. It is the story of a lifelong love affair with cricket. But an elegiac air hangs over it despite the delightful anecdotes, both personal and picked from the vast folklore of the game. As a schoolboy, Guha revelled in the fact that he was a “mere three handshakes away from a cricketing immortal.” As he grew older, “I began climbing up this hierarchy of hero worship myself,” he says. Guha’s cricketing heroes are not just international players but former teammates at college and players at his club, the Friends Union Cricket Club, in Bengaluru. His uncle Durai, the face of that club, played a crucial role in his development as a player and a cricket person (many of the former don’t get to become the latter, but that’s another story). Guha’s loyalties — FUCC, Karnataka, India — are in the order prescribed by internationals of an earlier generation who wrote club-State-country beneath their names on their kit bags. Few Indians have written with such passion about their clubs; fewer have written about club cricketers with such charm. It is the Englishman’s boast that true cricket is played only on the village green. For the Indian it was once the local league, played on matting, turf, hastily swept maidan ‘pitches’ or anywhere fervour trumped hindrances.  The young Guha was a fan of his times. He is slightly older, but we did the same things in different cities. That is, scrounged for match tickets, looked around desperately for books on the game while reading serialisations in Sport and Pastime ( Ten Great Bowlers by Ralph Barker a favourite), attended school, college and club nets, somehow got our hands on C.L.R. James’ Beyond A Boundary , attended league matches and rubbed shoulders with local heroes. It’s a lost time, and Guha’s book, like Proust’s madeleine, will open the floodgates of memory for one generation while giving a peep into that era for another. No cricketing luddite But Guha is no cricketing luddite, going on about the past. That he is willing to replace his favourite Viswanath with Virat Kohli in his all-time XI is testimony enough. And speaks of his fair-mindedness in this, the most personal of his books.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-fans-travelogue-and-a-historians-clarifications/article33173568.ece
25 November 2020||London,||Guardiola, Klopp welcome fan-return plan||Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, on Tuesday, welcomed the government’s decision to allow fans back into stadiums, a move described by the English Football League chief as a “lifeline” for smaller clubs. Lower-league clubs, who do not enjoy the TV riches of the Premier League, have been struggling to make ends meet, with supporters shut out during the coronavirus pandemic. But under plans unveiled on Monday, up to 4,000 people will be able to return to outdoor sports stadiums, depending on levels of COVID-19 in the area, from December 2. Manchester City boss Guardiola welcomed the potential limited return of fans. “If they believe it is the best, we will do it and hopefully it will work,” he said. “If the government has decided, they must have listened to the scientists and doctors.” Liverpool manager Klopp also welcomed the development, but said he had questions about the logic being applied to the numbers involved. “The problem is, I just struggle to put faith in any kind of announcements,” he said. “I don’t understand why it is only 2,000 people in a 60,000 stadium. But I am not surprised. It’s good news, good sign. I’ll take it, 100 percent.” English Football League chairman Rick Parry told the BBC he was looking forward to getting fans back in more substantial numbers but it was a “welcome start”. “At League One and League Two level (third and fourth tiers) it could be very significant,” he said. “It’s not just the money, it’s a very welcome return to an atmosphere, and if we get 4,000 at League Two level it would be very welcome. It can be a very welcome lifeline.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/guardiola-klopp-welcome-fan-return-plan/article33174173.ece

25 November 2020||KOLKATA,||Manoj Tiwary stars in Mohun Bagan’s win||Mohun Bagan banked on the seasoned Manoj Tiwary’s brilliant 39-ball 61 to beat Calcutta Customs by 17 runs in the opening match of the inaugural Bengal T20 Challenge at the Eden Gardens here on Tuesday. After being inserted, Bagan aggregated 156 for five before thwarting Customs’ progress in the death overs. Even as Bagan lost opener Saurabh Singh and captain Anustup Majumdar cheaply, Vivek Singh scored a stroke-filled 29-ball 35 (4x4, 2x6) before being claimed by off-spinner Karan Lal. Bagan was 50 for three in 7.5 overs. Entertaining knock Tiwary steadied the boat to add 60 runs with Shivam Sharma (16). The former Bengal captain placed the ball nicely in the gaps to rotate the strike. He also hit some entertaining shots, including five fours and three sixes. Tiwary was caught at long-off in Bapi Manna’s final and his team’s 18th over. Debabrata Das and Prince Yadav added 20 valuable runs for the sixth wicket. In reply, openers Abhishek Das (55 off 60, 5x4) and Chirag Pathak (23 off 22, 3x4) gave Customs a solid start by forging 57 runs. Prince provided the breakthrough by removing Pathak in the eighth over. Customs suffered as Abhishek took too long to accelerate the run rate. The Bagan pacers — including Akash Deep (one for 20), Sayan Das and Sandipan Das Jr. – bowled miserly towards the end to ensure victory.  The scores: Mohun Bagan 156/5 in 20 overs (Manoj Tiwary 61, Vivek Singh 35, Bapi Manna 2/33) bt Calcutta Customs 139/6 in 20 overs (Abhishek Das 55, Sandipan Das Jr. 2/ 21, Sayan Ghosh 2/32) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/manoj-tiwary-stars-in-mohun-bagans-win/article33173829.ece
25 November 2020||MUMBAI,||BCCI aims to bring IPL back to India||Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sourav Ganguly has said the BCCI is trying its best to hold the Indian Premier League’s (IPL) 2021 edition in India. The BCCI chief also said England would play four, instead of the earlier agreed five, Tests in India early in 2021. “We are trying, we are very much trying, because it’s a tournament for India. People spoke about the success of IPL (2020 in UAE), I told all of them ‘you have to be in India to see what IPL is to India,’” Ganguly said on Tuesday while endorsing Livinguard. “Our domestic season will start very shortly. England is touring India for four Test matches, three ODIs and five T20s. “It is a lot easier having bilaterals because the number of people (to be managed in a biosecure bubble) are less. “When it gets to eight teams, nine teams, 10 teams, then it becomes a bit more difficult. “But as you asked me, we are trying to hold it (next IPL) in India, but we have to keep assessing the situation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bcci-aims-to-bring-ipl-back-to-india/article33173535.ece
25 November 2020||Auckland,||‘Windies will keep playing aggressively’||Ahead of the upcoming three-match T20I series against New Zealand, batsman Andre Fletcher on Tuesday said that West Indies will continue playing an aggressive brand of cricket. West Indies has lost five of its last six T20I series and the Kieron Pollard-side is ranked ninth in the rankings for the shortest format. Off balance “I don’t think anything will change. We’ll continue being positive and playing our brand of cricket. It’s sometimes tough — winning two T20 World Cups and ranking No. 9 in the world is kind of off — balance, but I believe we’ll get back up there in the rankings,” ESPNCricinfo quoted Fletcher as saying. West Indies has won the T20 World Cup twice (2012 and 2016). In both editions, Daren Sammy was the skipper of Windies. First appearance Fletcher may make his first appearance for Windies since 2018 after having a good Caribbean Premier League (CPL) 2020 campaign for St. Lucia Zouks. For the series against New Zealand, West Indies is missing the likes of Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Chris Gayle, and Dwayne Bravo. “It’s a part of our preparation for the World Cup. For all teams playing now, that’s what they’re getting their minds up for. “Hopefully we can start well and see where it takes us. We’ve practised a lot, we’ve trained very hard, we’ve put in the work, and we strongly believe that we are capable and ready,” said Fletcher. New Zealand has also rested Kane Williamson and Trent Boult for the T20I series, and the side would be led by Tim Southee for the first two T20Is. Windies and New Zealand will lock horns in the first T20I on Friday, Nov. 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/windies-will-keep-playing-aggressively/article33173831.ece
25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Mysterious and inexplicable||In the Devi Bhagavata Purana, Narada is seen asking his father Brahma whether he had created this Brahmanda or whether it was Vishnu or Siva. Narada confesses to Brahma that his mind is restless owing to lack of clarity about the identity of the Supreme Lord. Who is to be meditated upon? Who is to be worshipped? Narada’s questions on these matters and Brahma’s reply exemplify the proclamation of the Vedas that the never ending glories of the Supreme Brahman will always continue to be ineffable and beyond all thought and word, pointed out Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. Brahma tells Narada that even Vishnu is unable to answer these doubts that are difficult. Nobody who is attached to the world knows anything about this. It is only those realised souls who are unattached to this world, who are free from any envy and desires, and remain calm, who can know the secret of all this. Brahma first gives a brief account of his birth in the navel of Vishnu and how he was unable to understand his own self and his duties. He was then prompted by a celestial voice to practise tapas and he did so for a thousand years. Then the voice commanded him to create. Brahma was confused about what to create. Then the two daityas, Madhu and Kaitabha, challenged him to fight with them. Then he saw Vishnu in deep slumber and realised that He was under the influence of Yoga Nidra and then he praised the Goddess. By the grace of the Goddess, Vishnu was able to kill them after a prolonged battle that lasted for 5,000 years. Then Rudra also joined them and all three praised the Devi. The Goddess then commanded them to forsake laziness and engage in their respective acts of creation, preservation etc, and showed them how to go about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mysterious-and-inexplicable/article33173533.ece

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Meals that heal||Coimbatore-based Keeraikadai.com has now introduced ready-to-eat meals. The challenge of supplying perishable greens to distant places within 24 hours had compelled them to make soups out of five different greens in 2019. The pandemic led them to come up with five packaged food options that are now available online and at their flagship store in Saibaba Colony, Coimbatore and at KK Nagar and SS Colony in Madurai. “We decided to package five curries made with banana flower and stem, spinach, moringa, and ponnangani greens during the pandemic since people were reluctant to step outside for purchases,” says Sriram Prasad G., CEO and founder. The meal packages, launched in Madurai recently, are NABL tested and said to be rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins. There are 10 more in the pipeline to be released by the year-end. The ready-to-eat curries have a shelf-life of six months at room temperature. “The texture, taste and nutritive value are maintained without any artificial agents because we have adopted the retort packaging method,” says Sriram. He chose his hometown for the launch because the processing unit is located inside the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) in Madurai and the venture is supported by TNAU, NABARD and Madurai Association of Business Incubation Forum. On the inaugural day, 500 kg of curry was prepared in each variant and packaged into 250 gram packs priced between Rs. 85 and Rs. 95. “You have to dip the meal package in boiling water for five minutes prior to use, and enjoy it with rice or chapati ,” says Sriram who researched for months to come up with the dishes. He spoke to old-timers and villagers and says these interactions also helped him learn that till about four decades ago, there were 350 to 400 varieties of greens grown across Tamil Nadu. “Today, we barely get to see 10 to 15 types,” he rues. Earlier this year, their dip soups in five variants     won them the first prize among 400 entries at the Tamil Nadu Innovation Grand Challenge, by Entrepreneurship Development and Innovation Institute. According to Sriram, the calcium, protein and iron-rich soups were sought after during the COVID-19 crisis as they are believed to be immunity boosters. Sriram and his brother Sriram Subramaniam G. are trained at TNAU and are inspired by organic farming pioneer, the late G. Nammalvar: “We believe food prevents and cures diseases and that is why we work with natural and organic farming methods,” he says.

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||‘I’m in the joy business’||Child star, teen phenomenon, rom-com superstar, author, entrepreneur… and now, talk show host. Drew Barrymore’s been there, done that, and will do it all over again. Right from when she catapulted to global fame as a seven-year-old with Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and her many successes later in films like Charlie’s Angels , 50 First Dates , Music and Lyrics to headlining Netflix’s Santa Clara Diet , Barrymore’s career is a hallmark of twee humour that has endeared audiences for nearly four decades. This year saw Barrymore debut her pandemic talk show —The Drew Barrymore Show— that has encapsulated the 45-year-old star’s journey in a nutshell. A mixture of celebrity guest appearances — with her Charlie’s Angels co-stars Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu, and actors such as Adam Sandler ( The Wedding Singer ) and Jessica Alba ( Never Been Kissed ) — and emotional surprises, like inviting her ex-husband Tom Green after having not spoken to him in 15 years, the show has lived up to its enjoyable, eccentric nature. She fought hard to have the show produced live — “Otherwise, there would be no spontaneity!”. Ahead of the show’s India premiere, the actor is at her charming best, as she once again explains her recent catchphrase: “I’m in the joy business.”  Excerpts from an interview:  When you first conceived the show, before the pandemic, you must have had a different vision in mind. How has that changed over the last year?    A little bit into 2020 we got our official announcement, and then the world changed as we know it. In some ways, the old show we were doing applies to the joy and the subjects. Right now in 2020, we have to face the facts; we can’t pretend things are not happening and have a blind gratuitous optimism, although I am an optimist. I just want to take my life experience and talk about it with other people and figure it out together. Also, laugh, heal, cry and cook and do everything our opening credit sequence says, because variety is also the spice of life. It’s funny; in late night shows, they are like, ‘You made it through the day, we’re going to put you to bed with some laughs, Congratulations.’ I’m like, I want to start the day that way! I want people to carry that with them throughout the day like a tool in their arsenal, and give them a place that is elevated and transported. Tell us about the Charlie's Angels reunion after all these years. How is your relationship with Cameron and Lucy today?  When we planned our premiere episode, we really took a moment and we didn’t want to rush because every booking is meaningful to us and has purpose. We wanted to make sure that we were stepping into this world with more than a booking; a feeling. We came to the understanding that we wanted to project friendship, support and love. And that is what was important to us. That was what made it such an easy decision to bring in Cameron and Lucy. I couldn’t have begun this journey without them. They have been a part of my life for over 20 years. We are friends...we are fellow angels and partners in crime. The show also delves deep into personal and emotional aspects of your life. Was it challenging to expose yourself like that to an audience?    I definitely am really convinced that all of this work I do for myself is the same thing that everybody else is going through. We are trying to reach enlightenment, we are trying to grow and figure out things...we are going through uncomfortable changes in our lives. I want to talk about that stuff. Being a mother to two young kids, are you looking to do a segment for moms/children at some point?     I want to keep moms connected, supported and heard. That is why we created the recurring segment, Mom’s Time Out, where we celebrate moms and surprise them with some much-deserved time out.  Can a show like this be rehearsed before you go on camera?  Being spontaneous; being myself and not pretending to be anyone else is something I always want in this show. I try and give people a refreshing approach: I would prefer taking more about your life experience or your upbringing, rather than the thing you are working right now or promoting. I know that is an essential aspect — and we will certainly hit that button professionally — but I want to have a different approach to conversations, something more casual and disarming.

25 November 2020||November 25 2020 00:00 IST,||‘India vs Australia on par with the Ashes’||Conversations about the India-Australia rivalry in cricket don’t end without a recollection of Australia’s tour of 2001, in particular about that Test at Eden Gardens. Even a casual fan knows its place in the sport’s pantheon — after all, it captured the zeitgeist of Indian cricket. A 26-year-old Jason Gillespie was a part of that historic moment. Almost two decades later, Gillespie reminisces that game with awe. It is, however, not his favourite India-Australia memory. Understandable, as his side lost the Test and the series. But three years later, when they toured India again, the Aussies found redemption. They won a Test series in India for the first time in over 30 years. Gillespie was the leading wicket-taker for Australia. “We tried so hard to win Test matches in India for so long. And so to win the 2004 series, after losing in 2001 is probably the favourite for me,” he says from Adelaide, a few days ahead of the India’s tour of Australia, starting with an ODI in Sydney. These hard-won battles on the field are not the only reason he cherishes India. Nowhere else, he says, has he witnessed the adulation he did here. “Everywhere we went, there was a small crowd just following us around, just, you know, watching us eat and do our shopping, and whatnot. Nothing like that ever happened to me.” Gillespie also recalls his visit to the Taj Mahal. “The 1996 World Cup was my first visit to India. We had a team photo taken in front of the Taj Mahal. As a child, I have seen the Taj on TV. But to actually stand there in front of it was incredibly special.” Unintentionally cutting short his happy reminiscence, the conversation steers towards bowling to Sachin Tendulkar in the 2004 Sydney Test. He made 241 in the first innings, besting all the Aussie bowlers. Gillespie had bowled the most that innings (45 overs). “Not much fun,” he replies with a straight face. A second later, his smile returns. “He was an incredible player, wasn’t he? I remember that innings so well. We tried everything but just couldn’t get the little master out.” A great rivalry The tables have turned in the India-Australia rivalry in Test compared to 2004. The Australian teams of Gillespie’s times were often the favourites. Ever since his retirement, India has had more series wins, including the first on Australian soil last year. “In terms of the quality of cricket, India vs Australia is definitely on par with The Ashes,” he says. Australia, like India, has a passionate following for cricket. Games involving India especially have large turnouts at venues. Gillespie is looking forward to the return of the crowds. “It was unusual to watch the IPL being played without the crowd. Even if it’s going to be just 50% of the stadium being filled due to the restrictions, it will be exciting to watch cricket played in front of the people.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/india-vs-australia-on-par-with-the-ashes/article33173721.ece
25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Need more ICU beds, positivity rate declining, Kejriwal tells PM||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday requested more ICU beds at Central government hospitals and stated that the COVID positivity rate in the city was declining, while briefing Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the outbreak in the Capital. Speaking to Mr. Modi via videoconferencing, Mr. Kejriwal stated that the third wave of the novel coronavirus in Delhi reached its peak on November 10 with 8,600 cases, and that pollution from stubble burning in neighbouring States had been a significant contributor in making the third wave more dangerous. Mr. Modi interacted with Chief Ministers of eight worst-affected States during the day where Mr. Kejriwal said that out of the total beds reserved for COVID in city hospitals, 9,400 beds were occupied and 8,500 beds were vacant. Kejriwal thanks Centre “We are not concerned about the non-ICU (common) corona beds, since we have an adequate number of them. Out of the total ICU beds available across Delhi, around 3,500 ICU beds are occupied and 724 ICU beds are vacant,” Mr. Kejriwal said. Crediting Home Minister Amit Shah with helping increasing the number of ICU beds in the city, Mr. Kejriwal said the Centre’s decision to reserve 1,000 beds for residents in Safdarjung and AIIMS would provide great support. “We are thankful for all the help that we and the people of Delhi have received from the Centre during the entire epidemic,” he added. Mr. Kejriwal also told the PM that the first wave of the virus in Delhi came in June during which 20,000 samples were collected every day. The Delhi government increased sample collection in September to 60,000 per day, he stated. The CM said that the positivity rate in Delhi is constantly declining but the rising mortality rate is a matter of concern. “We hope that the mortality rate will also reduce along with declining positivity ratio in the coming days,” he added. Commenting on stubble burning, Mr. Kejriwal said that the Delhi government is trying out a bio-decomposer developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, PUSA, to curb farm fires: “We want that under your leadership, the Chief Ministers of Delhi, Punjab, and Haryana should work together as a team to eliminate stubble burning.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/need-more-icu-beds-positivity-rate-declining-kejriwal-tells-pm/article33173751.ece
25 November 2020||Patna,||NDA, Mahagathbandhan field candidates for Speaker’s post||The Bihar ruling National Democratic Alliance and the Opposition Mahagathbandhan candidates on Tuesday filed nominations for Speaker’s post, election for which will be held on November 25. In a surprise move, five-time RJD MLA from the Siwan Assembly seat Awadh Bihari Chaudhury filed nomination as the Mahagathbandhan candidate while senior State BJP leader and party MLA from Lakhisarai in Munger district Vijay Kumar Sinha too filed papers. After filing his nomination papers, Mr. Sinha thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for reposing faith in him. “Yet again this reflects that even an ordinary worker in the BJP can achieve great heights,” he said. Earlier, the name of BJP MLA from Patna Sahib seat Nand Kishore Yadav was doing the rounds in the political circles for the post. Sparring over post “The post should go to an experienced legislator and our candidate has been a five-term MLA. He knows the proceedings of the House well and has a reputation of taking everyone along,” said RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav. Asked about the numbers, he said, “We’re in touch with other MLAs and seeking their support. I’m hopeful that our nominee will win.” Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Tarkishore Prasad said the “convention of unanimous election of Speaker should be maintained.” Mr. Yadav retorted, “Convention also has it that the Deputy Speaker’s post should go to the Opposition. In the previous Assembly, we kept requesting for it but the post was kept vacant.” This is going to be the first time since 2005 when the NDA government came to power in the State that the BJP has fielded its candidate for the post as it was earlier bagged by ally JD(U).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nda-mahagathbandhan-field-candidates-for-speakers-post/article33173743.ece
25 November 2020||BHUBANESWAR,||Cuttack IIFL gold robbery case cracked||The police of twin cities Bhubaneswar and Cuttack have cracked the sensational IIFL gold robbery case. IIFL, a gold loan leasing company, has claimed that 39.5 kg of gold was looted from its Cuttack branch. Four persons barged into the Nayasadak branch of the company and looted gold at gunpoint on November 19. The company had lodged a police complaint stating that 39.5 kg gold was looted. Police have recovered 2 kg of gold and taken into custody four persons. The involvement of six persons in the crime was found. “We found the involvement of an insider in the case. Lala Amrit Ray, who has been working in the company for the past five years, masterminded the robbery, fearing that his role in embezzlement of gold would get exposed,” said Sudhansu Sarangi, Commissioner of Police for Bhubaneswar-Cuttack, on Tuesday. Lala Amrit Ray and his brother Lala Ranjan Ray have past criminal records. “The company was perhaps unaware of Amrit Ray’s criminal antecedents. As per our information, he was involved in many irregularities. He had managed to sweep those under carpet by winning over the past auditors. When a new auditor joined and raised the issue of irregularities, he became worried,” said the police chief. From the beginning, probe teams were apprehending the role of someone who had knowledge of the functioning of the branch. Amrit took help of his childhood friend, Bapu alias Ranjan Behera. Four persons who were roped in for robbery were identified as Rajakishore Sahu, Biju alias Prakash Sahu and Padia alias Pradipta Behera and Bapi alias Santosh Bhoi. Two bikes used by them were seized.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cuttack-iifl-gold-robbery-case-cracked/article33173740.ece
25 November 2020||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan ahead in COVID fight: Gehlot||Rajasthan is ahead on all parameters in the fight against COVID-19 and has strengthened the medical infrastructure to tackle the pandemic, while working hard to reduce the positivity rate, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said here on Tuesday. The death rate due to the infection has been restricted in the State to just 0.89%. Mr. Gehlot said during a videoconference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the State was conducting 100% testing by RT-PCR that was credible and had developed the testing capacity of 60,000 per day. In the 42 lakh tests done so far, the positivity rate was detected at 5.8%, which was far better than the national average of 6.89%, he said. Awareness campaign The Chief Minister said his government had taken steps such as a complete ban on firecrackers during Deepavali, enactment of a law on compulsory wearing of masks, imposition of night curfew in eight cities and limiting the number of persons at wedding and other events to 100. Besides, a campaign for awareness on containing the pandemic has been operative since October 2. “The steps taken with a strong willpower have been praised all over the country,” Mr. Gehlot said. He suggested that all the States should adopt 100% testing by RT-PCR, and pointed out that only Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu were doing it. The Chief Minister said the State had improved the availability of intensive care units, oxygen and ventilators, which had enabled health officials to operate successfully during the second wave of the infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-ahead-in-covid-fight-gehlot/article33173742.ece
25 November 2020||Ghaziabad,||Noida, Ghaziabad start random testing of Delhi travellers||After Gautam Buddha Nagar, the Ghaziabad administration started random screening of people travelling from Delhi for COVID-19 from Tuesday evening. This has come after the two districts saw a surge in cases after Deepavali. Officials from the health department stopped travellers from Delhi at the Ghazipur border and tested them through rapid antigen test kits. Later, they were joined by police officials for effective management. “We have done random sampling earlier, but this time we are doing it in the evening to check whether Ghaziabad residents who are working in Delhi are bringing the virus from the Capital, which has seen a spike in cases after Deepavali. We will do it for a few days and calculate the positivity rate,” said N.K. Gupta, Chief Medical Officer (Ghaziabad) adding the test were voluntary. Ghaziabad saw 1,115 new cases in the week after Deepavali. This number was 784 in the week before the festival. In Gautam Buddha Nagar, these numbers were 1,083 and 1,256, respectively. Dr. Gupta, who was present on the ground, said Ghaziabad has 200 ICU beds and 50 more would be added soon. “Almost 50% of them are occupied by patients from Delhi,” he said. Tanya Singh, who works in real estate and travels daily from Mohan Nagar to Mayur Vihar was stopped at the border. “It is a healthy initiative,” she said. Elated at being found negative, she said everybody should cooperate. Ramendra Singh, coming from Okhla Mandi, was not as pleased. “It is really random. They are not asking for the identity card of those tested. They are not giving any physical report either. If I am stopped tomorrow or at the other border, I have nothing to show,” he said. Officials said the report would be sent on the phone number of those tested. “Those found positive will be isolated,” Dr. Gupta said. In Noida, random tests were done at two places on the Delhi-Noida border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/noida-ghaziabad-start-random-testing-of-delhi-travellers/article33173747.ece
25 November 2020||New Delhi,||CM orders procurement of 1,200 BiPAP machines for new ICU beds||Amid a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the city, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has ordered for an immediate procurement of 1,200 BiPAP machines for the new ICU beds being added here this this week, an official said on Tuesday. He said the move will allow immediate operationalisation of the new ICU beds. The city recorded 6,224 fresh COVID-19 cases and 109 deaths in the past 24 hours, said the government. A total of 1,200 BiPAP machines will be procured immediately from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the official said. On Monday, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain attributed the high death rate due to the virus in the city to the pollution caused by stubble-burning and said he expects a downtrend in the next two-three weeks. Graveyard out of space The biggest Muslim graveyard in the city near ITO is running out of burial space amid rising COVID-19 deaths, an official said, adding that COVID-19 victims from other NCR areas also being buried here. “There should be some arrangement so that COVID-19 victims are buried at graveyards in their neighbourhoods and their relatives do not have to come here because space is limited,” said Haji Mian Faiyazuddin, secretary of Qabristan Ahle Islam in the vicinity of the walled city. He said the management committee will write to the government for help.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cm-orders-procurement-of-1200-bipap-machines-for-new-icu-beds/article33173749.ece
25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Why only spas not allowed to resume services, High Court asks Delhi govt.||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the AAP government on why spas were not being allowed to open even though everything else like markets, gyms, restaurants, metro and buses was operational in the Capital. Justice Navin Chawla’s query came after the Central government said it has issued an office memorandum on November 18 allowing reopening of spas. The Delhi government’s counsel said that he was given oral instructions that spas would not be reopened in view of the COVID-19 third wave. The counsel also sought time to file an affidavit giving reasons for the same. “Why only spas? What is so special about spas? You have opened everything else. Look at markets, restaurants, metros, buses, all are open and running full time,” the Bench remarked. During the hearing, the Central government told the court that while it “has cleared the decks” for reopening spas, the final decision with regard to the same has been left to the Delhi government. The case was posted for hearing on December 4. It was hearing a plea moved by several persons who run spas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/why-only-spas-not-allowed-to-resume-services-high-court-asks-delhi-govt/article33173745.ece
25 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Cong. demands Health Minister’s resignation||Delhi Congress on Tuesday called for the resignation of Health Minister Satyendar Jain for “failing to address the COVID-19 spread, and spike in deaths” in the city. The party alleged that the Delhi government had put up “zero fight” against the deadly virus. “The Arvind Kejriwal-led government is hiding exact number of COVID cases and deaths, as the number of bodies reaching the crematoriums and burial grounds are much more than what the government data says,” Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said, adding he had suggested at an all-party meeting with the Chief Minister that there is a need to increase testing to two lakh per day, “but the government has not taken any steps to do so”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-demands-health-ministers-resignation/article33173752.ece
25 November 2020||GURUGRAM,||Haryana puts fresh limits on guest lists||The Haryana government on Tuesday decided to put a cap on the maximum number of guests allowed in social, political and religious functions held indoors at 50 in six districts in and around the National Capital Region. However, the maximum limit for the events held outdoors in these districts will be 100. Chief Minister Manohar Lal informed about the decision during a video conference — attended by Chief Ministers of eight States and presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi — on the COVID-19 situation. Health and Home Minister Anil Vij was also present. Mr. Lal said the limit was fixed in view of the recent upsurge in the COVID-19 cases and the orders would come into effect from November 26. The six districts are Gurugram, Rewari, Faridabad, Rohtak, Sonipat and Hisar. In the rest of the districts, the gatherings have been limited to 100 people for indoor functions and 200 for the outdoor ones. Mr. Lal said the situation of COVID-19 in Haryana remained satisfactory in the first and second phase. However, in the third wave of COVID-19, a spurt in the number of cases has been registered during the past few days especially in the NCR districts. He added that the State government has ramped up testing in these areas so that those infected could be isolated. He said 57,000 beds were made available in different hospitals of the State, keeping in view the number of cases and an adequate number of oxygen cylinders, ventilators and ICU beds can be arranged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-puts-fresh-limits-on-guest-lists/article33173753.ece

25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi’s air quality in ‘very poor’ category||The air quality of Delhi and Noida deteriorated to the upper end of the “very poor” category on Tuesday and that of Gurugram was in the “poor” category, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The air quality of the Capital is likely to slightly improve to the lower end of the “very poor” category on Wednesday, said government-run monitoring agency SAFAR. In a related development, Environment Minister Gopal Rai urged the Commission on Air Quality Management to direct other States to use a bio-decomposer, which had been used in Delhi to treat stubble, and thus, reduce air pollution. He also said that due to massive stubble burning, which affected the air quality of Delhi in the past few days, the COVID-19 situation in the Capital has also “significantly worsened”. The AQI deteriorated on Tuesday as the surface winds were calm, which do not aid in dispersion of pollutants. Also, the boundary layer winds were moderate, which helps in bringing pollution from stubble burning in neighbouring States to the city. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to PM2.5, a chief pollutant, in Delhi was estimated to be only 5% on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhis-air-quality-in-very-poor-category/article33173838.ece
25 November 2020||New Delhi,||Ramani, Akbar refuse to reach any settlement||Former Union Minister M.J. Akbar and journalist Priya Ramani on Tuesday declined any settlement between them in a criminal defamation complaint filed by him against the her for her tweets accusing him of sexual harassment. Senior advocate Geeta Luthra, appearing for Mr. Akbar, said her client would consider closing the defamation suit if Ms. Ramani was apologetic for her allegations. Ms. Ramani’s counsel, Bhavook Chauhan, said she stood by her statement and if Mr. Akbar wanted to withdraw the complaint, he may do so. ‘All doors shut?’ The statements came after Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Ravindra Kumar Pandey, who started hearing afresh the final arguments in the case, asked if all doors are shut for any settlement between the parties in the suit. Judge Pandey started hearing afresh the final arguments in the case as the previous judge, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja, was transferred to another court last week. At the height of the MeToo movement in 2018, Ms. Ramani accused Mr. Akbar of sexual harassment during his previous role as newspaper editor. Following Ms. Ramani’s accusation, about dozen former colleagues of Mr. Akbar also came out with different allegations against him. Days before he resigned from his post of Minister of State for External Affairs in October 2018, Mr. Akbar filed a criminal defamation case against Ms. Ramani citing her open letter published in a magazine and her tweets naming him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ramani-akbar-refuse-to-reach-any-settlement/article33173744.ece
